But a different story is playing out in conservative media: And that different story is the thrust of what Republicans on and off the Intelligence Committee are pursuing as a coping mechanism for the drip-drip-drip of information and rumors about possibly treasonous activities among intimates of a Republican president: focus on the leaks, not what they reveal. This approach was clearly signaled by Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes the day before the hearings started, when he told Fox News that the leak to the news media that led to Michael Flynns downfall would be central to his line of questioning: Senator Rand Paul went further Sunday on This Week: Nunes did not quite go there this morning, but he made clear his belief that the leaks are as important as what was leaked: And now in the course of the hearing, not only are committee Republicans focusing on the intelligence communities responsibilities for the leaks, but at least one  Representative Trey Gowdy  is wondering aloud if the recipients of leaks might be prosecuted. So is this just a matter of a different partisan spin on an issue that is inherently damaging to the GOP? Perhaps, but something bigger is going on here: the claim that the deep state that is producing the damaging information is a greater threat to civil liberties than the quasi-authoritarian who is being damaged. This claim is psychologically important to Republicans  especially libertarian-ish Republicans like Rand Paul  who cannot bring themselves to defend Trumps behavior but can happily give him covering fire by attacking his tormentors as being worse. And in turn this approach is a fine example of the decision of Republicans who are not fully in the Trump camp to make anti-anti-Trumpism a regular M.O. The whole deep state line of reasoning is a way to keep Barack Obama in the crosshairs as the alleged ringleader of a cabal that is trying to overturn the 2016 election and assert permanent control over the federal government. Its absurd, and theres not much evidence for it, but it is a satisfying way to avoid taking a clear stand for or against the administration of the 45th president. And it establishes its purveyors as, at a minimum, fellow travelers of Team Trump."}, {"date": "2017/03/20", "title": "The Republican Health-Care Plan Has Disappeared Again", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/the-republican-health-care-plan-has-disappeared-again.html", "text": " The greatest advantage the Republican Party held, through eight years of political war over the provision of health care, was not having a plan to defend. After Novembers elections handed them full control of government, Republicans designed a strategy to retain that advantage: repeal-and-delay, which would have allowed them to eliminate Obamacare without specifying the replacement. Repeal-and-delay failed, forcing them instead to pass a replacement plan. That plan has proven wildly unpopular. Indeed, it is so deeply unpopular that Republicans have given up defending the plan at all. Instead, they are back to promising an unspecified, future plan that will be revealed only after Obamacare has been gutted first. The most significant development to come out of the last week is that Republicans no longer defend the American Health Care Act. When confronted with the fact that his plan would make counties that supported him far worse off, Trump acknowledged, Oh, I know. Paul Ryan, appearing on Fox News Sunday, echoed Trump. We do believe we need to add some additional assistance to people in those older cohorts, he told Chris Wallace. We believe we should have more assistance, and thats what we are looking at. Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price told CNN, This is not the plan. By this, Price meant the plan that the White House and Republican leadership had claimed as its plan. The real plan has three prongs, of which the bill is only the first. The other two involve a combination of regulatory moves that may or may not be legal and a package of legislative changes that stands a zero-percent chance of being passed into law. (Theyre omitted from this bill because they cannot be included in a reconciliation bill, and thus are subject to a filibuster and require Democratic support, which will not be forthcoming.) Fixing the Republican plan is not a technical problem akin to rejiggering some wires in the shop. It means allocating real-world resources. The GOP plan makes coverage unaffordable for the old and poor because theyre expensive to cover, and Republicans dont want to pay for it. They insist their plan repeal Obamacares taxes on the rich, reducing the amount of resources available for coverage. They also insist their plan expand choice and freedom, which in practice means having the choice and the freedom not to pay for other peoples medical care. But if you dont make somebody pay for it  either forcing insurers to give them artificially low premiums, or by taxes, then it wont be paid for. The regulations Republicans tout, which would allow insurers to sell skimpy plans to healthy people, would exacerbate the problem. Healthy people would get cheaper plans that dont cross-subsidize medical care needed by the old and sick. That would force the old and sick to bear even more of their costs. If there was a real Republican plan in writing, its effects would be even more gruesome. And so it must remain an abstraction. One Republican member of Congress hilariously stated that he would vote for the plan on the basis of unspecified assurances from Trump to eliminate features that would punish older, poorer Americans. The President listened to the fact that a 64-year-old person living near the poverty line was going to see their insurance premiums go up from $1700 to $14,600 per year, said Alabama representative Robert Aderholt. The President looked me in the eye and said, These are my people and I will not let them down. We will fix this for them. So, like every Republican alternative to Obamacare, this one has vaporized upon contact with the real world. The real Republican plan, once again, exists on an ethereal plane. Its features cannot be quantified but they can be described in generalities. Everybody who has seen it says it is, or will be, wonderful."}, {"date": "2017/03/20", "title": "Comey Confirms FBI Investigation Into Russias Election Meddling and Trump Ties", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/comey-confirms-investigation-into-russias-election-meddling.html", "text": " FBI director James Comey told the House Intelligence Committee Monday that the bureau is investigating potential Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether members of Donald Trumps campaign coordinated with the Russian government. Comey began by saying he would not typically confirm the existence of ongoing investigations, but called this an unusual circumstance. Ive been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI as part of our counterintelligence mission is investigating the Russian governments efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, he added. That includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russias efforts. Watch his full statement below. Comey would say little else on the subject, which at least one pundit thinks is trouble for the President. Mondays hearing also addressed President Trumps claims that President Obama had the phones wiretapped at Trump Tower. Both Comey and NSA director Mike Rogers said they know of no evidence to support Trumps claims.  Further on the subjects of wiretaps, Congressman Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the committee, asked Rogers about the White House claim that Obama enlisted the help of British intelligence arm GCHQ to spy on Trump. Earlier this month, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer referred to a report from Fox News claiming that Obama went around U.S. intelligence agencies to get dirt on Trump. Rogers denied asking the GCHQ to spy on Trump and denied being asked to do so. When Schiff asked Rogers if he agreed with the GCHQ, which called Spicers claim nonsense and utterly ridiculous, he said, Yes sir.  Committee chair Devin Nunes advocated for equal opportunity investigating at one point, asking Comey if he would investigate ties between Russia and the Clinton campaign if evidence surfaced linking the two. It was a question that, if nothing else, proves Nunes follows Trump on Twitter.  While members of the minority party focused on Russia and alleged wiretapping in their questions to Comey and Rogers, several Republicans wanted to talk about leaks. Representative Trey Gowdy pressed Comey on how the media learned about phone conversations between former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, which eventually led to Flynns firing. After ticking off a list of officials he appears to believe may have had something to do with the leak, Gowdy asked Comey if the FBI was investigating the leak. I cant say because I dont want to confirm that that was classified information, Comey said. Later, Gowdy suggested that hes after punishment not just for leakers of classified information, but for the reporters who publish that information.  In a sign that Comey has learned a lesson from the FBIs investigation of Hillary Clintons personal email server, he refused a request to provide Congress with regular updates into the investigation of Russias ties to the Trump campaign. I dont know how long the work will take, he said. I cant predict or commit to updates.  Think the 2016 election marked the beginning and end of Russias attempts to meddle in the U.S. electoral process? Think again, Comey said. Theyll be back, he warned in response to questions from Florida Republican representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. Theyll be back in 2020, they may be back in 2018, and one of the lessons they may draw from this is that they were successful because they introduced chaos and division and discord and sowed doubt about the nature of this amazing country of ours and our democratic process.  As the hearing pressed on, President Trump weighed in on Twitter. The official @POTUS account shot off several tweets that not-so-subtly suggest it was the Obama administration that leaked classified information about former NSA Mike Flynn."}, {"date": "2017/03/20", "title": "Billionaire Philanthropist and Businessman David Rockefeller Dies at 101", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/billionaire-david-rockefeller-dies-at-101.html", "text": " David Rockefeller, the last surviving grandson of Standard Oil founder John D.

He set aside 1,000 acres of land next to Acadia National Park for a nonprofit, in honor of his 100th birthday in 2015. According to Reuters, Rockefeller gave away nearly $2 billion in his lifetime. Rockefeller also made his mark on international affairs, most controversially when he helped lobby President Jimmy Carter to admit the Shah of Iran into the United States for medical treatment, which helped spark the Iran hostage crisis in 1979.

Previously, the Attorney Generals office sued Trump on behalf of students who say they were bilked out of millions by Trump University, though the parties reached a settlement after the presidential election, in November.

On and beyond the Judiciary Committee, Republicans will try to depict Gorsuch as a slam-dunk selection that only a radicalized Democratic Party terrified by its lefty-lefty base could possibly oppose. We will hear many citations of the unanimous votes with which potential justices, including Gorsuchs role model Antonin Scalia, was confirmed back in those golden days before liberals ruined that great tradition in 1987 by keeping Robert Bork off the Court. Gorsuchs originalist views about constitutional interpretation, a controversial approach, will be described by his defenders as the legal equivalent of common sense, which again, only a lefty radical who despises constitutional limitations on Big Government could possibly oppose. Meanwhile, Democrats will make a lot of noise about the GOPs refusal to give Barack Obamas nominee for the same seat, Merrick Garland, even a single hearing. Some in the Senate will say thats enough to compel a vote against Gorsuch as a matter of principle, regardless of any case that can be made for Trumps choice. And others will use the hearings to raise concerns about the direction of the Roberts Court in the Trump Era, given the large array of critical issues that could soon come before SCOTUS, including some that were stalled last year due to a deadlocked Court awaiting Scalias replacement. In general Democrats will hold Gorsuch to a much higher standard than Republicans are likely to proffer, and even Democrats who intend to vote for his confirmation in the end may make a bit of a show of giving him a hard time. Perhaps the most inflammatory aspect of the hearings will involve efforts to gauge Gorsuchs attitude toward Executive branch excesses, which will give liberals and conservatives alike who have been alarmed by the presidents thinly veiled threats to the independence of the judiciary a chance to toss a few brushback pitches toward the White House. By most accounts, Gorsuchs originalism and natural-rights beliefs are strong enough to make his protestations of independence from the political branches credible, and hes probably deft enough to avoid saying anything that could set off the volatile man who appointed him. The big wild card in this or any other SCOTUS confirmation hearing is the possible emergence of new information about the nominees record or private life. The letter to the Judiciary Committee from a woman who recently took a law school class taught by Gorsuch alleging he made comments about maternity leave that exhibited both sexism and excessive deference to corporate needs is the first such hand grenade rolled onto the floor in this particular confirmation. More could be on the way, and Gorsuch is at particular risk for comments showing insensitivity to womens rights, given his prominence in cases carving out religious liberty rights for conservative Christians refusing to comply with anti-discrimination laws, and his presumed hostility to constitutionally protected reproductive rights. Democrats and possibly even a Republican or two who want to find an excuse for opposing Gorsuch could in theory seize on evidence of personal unsuitability in order to avoid the tougher questions surrounding his constitutional views. If on the other hand Gorsuchs generally positive reputation as a decent and fair-minded judge survives the hearings, some key strategic issues will remain for both parties. If Democrats can muster the 41 opposed votes necessary to filibuster Gorsuch, Republicans will almost surely exercise the so-called nuclear option to eliminate SCOTUS filibusters once and for all, extending the action taken by Senate Democrats in 2013 to allow for confirmation of Executive branch and non-SCOTUS judicial nominations by simple majority. Some Democrats would prefer to delay this sort of fraught confrontation to a future nomination (it is, after all, a second Trump appointment to SCOTUS that would really shift the Court to a position to the right of where it was when before Scalias death), since the odds of actually stopping this confirmation appear limited. Other observers, like my colleague Jonathan Chait, advise Democrats to enthusiastically help get rid of the SCOTUS filibuster because it is more of a threat to future Democratic presidents than it will be to Trump. Either way, Gorsuch is very likely to be confirmed barring new revelations of extremism or pigginess, because of the hellish pressure on Senate Republicans to approve him. Donald Trumps acceptance of the process that produced the Gorsuch nomination, which basically turned the choice over to the hyperconservative legal group the Federalist Society along with the hyperconservative policy group the Heritage Foundation, has been the glue that has kept the Republican Party more or less together through the trauma of the Trump party takeover. Now that Trump has kept his promise on a subject very near and dear to conservative ideologues who believe they have been repeatedly burned by past Republican presidents and their SCOTUS nominees, any Republican senator who threatens to gum up the works is going to face a campaign of demonization leading to a primary challenge. And any senator of either party with public or private concerns about Neil Gorsuch must deal with the high probability the next Trump choice would be, by any standard, worse."}, {"date": "2017/03/20", "title": "Its Official: The United Kingdom Will Trigger Brexit Next Week", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/its-official-u-k-will-trigger-brexit-next-week.html", "text": " The United Kingdom has put the European Union on notice: A letter is arriving March 29, which will trigger Article 50, the first step toward negotiating the U.K.s formal exit from the European bloc.

(He has never commented on the issue specifically, but he did rule that Hobby Lobby shouldnt have to cover its employees birth control, and he wanted to rehear a decision blocking Utahs attempt to defund Planned Parenthood.) Now some of his former students have raised concerns about Gorsuchs views on discrimination against female workers. Jennifer Sisk, who graduated from the University of Colorado Law School last year, says that during a Legal Ethics and Professionalism class last spring, Gorsuch told his students that companies should ask women about their pregnancy plans during job interviews, and claimed that many women plan to manipulate their employers by taking maternity leave, then quitting to stay home with their children. Sisk, who once worked for Democratic Senator Mark Udall and the Interior Department during the Obama administration, sent a two-page letter describing the incident to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. It was posted on Sunday night by the National Employment Lawyers Association and the National Womens Law Center. In the letter, Sisk says that, on April 19, the class discussed a reading that described a hypothetical law student trying to find a job at a law firm to pay off her student loans, who also wanted to start a family with her husband. This sparked a discussion of work-life balance and student debt, but Gorsuch stepped in to redirect the conversation: Sisk says that when only a few people raised their hands, Gorsuch said, Cmon, guys. He told them that all our hands should be raised because many women use their companies for maternity benefits and then leave the company after the baby is born. She says he implied that women intentionally manipulate companies and plan to disadvantage their companies, starting from the first interview. When one student said employers cant ask prospective hires about their pregnancy plans, Gorsuch said that was incorrect. Sisk continues: Guidelines published by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission do not ban asking questions about family plans, but an applicants answers are not supposed to figure into hiring decisions, according to NPR. Sisk says officials at the school told her they thought Gorsuchs interpretation was incorrect. She took her concerns to the deans and they told her they would speak to Gorsuch at the end of the term. She does not know if they followed through. The National Womens Law Center posted several documents supporting Sisks claim, including her post to a Facebook group for female lawyers and part of an email exchange with the dean. Theres also an anonymous statement from another student who took the class. They wrote: Both students said it seemed Gorsuch was expressing his personal views rather than playing devils advocate to spark classroom discussion, though they were happy with him as a professor overall. Sisk told NPR that she sent the letter so that the proper questions could be asked during his confirmation hearings. In a Facebook post just after President Trump announced that hed selected Gorsuch from his list of 21 candidates to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, Sisk said Gorsuch has a sharp judicial mind but she still finds his views troubling. He does not support FMLA, women as equal citizens, and values corporations above people, she wrote. Hes still better than the rest of the choices. This post was updated to note that Sisk worked for a Democratic senator and the Obama administration."}, {"date": "2017/03/20", "title": "Trump Said to Have Political Aides Monitoring the Loyalty of Cabinet Secretaries", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/trump-aides-monitor-loyalty-of-cabinet-secretaries-report.html", "text": " As President Trump recently reminded us, when someone has been disloyal to him, he never forgets it. But now that hes president, its become more difficult to keep track of those who have defied him  or who may potentially defy him. Thats why, according to the Washington Post, Trump has embedded political appointees in every cabinet agency and tasked them with keeping tabs on the secretaries fealty to the president. Unsurprisingly, this is not going over well with some cabinet members. The Post is not the first to note the existence of these monitors. Last month, Politico reported that the Trump administration had created the new position of senior White House adviser within each agency, placing many former campaign aides in those jobs. Records obtained by ProPublica show that there are at least 16 of these advisers, with Trump loyalists stationed in all the major departments, as well as in some smaller agencies, such as NASA. Theres some disagreement over who the advisers answer to. The Post says they report to the Office of Cabinet Affairs, which is overseen by White House deputy chief of staff Rick Dearborn. An anonymous White House official said the advisers technically report to the head of each agency, but the White House would not discuss the matter on the record. The advisers ostensible mission is to act as a go-between on policy issues for the White House and the agencies, but eight officials tell the Post their primary task is to make sure agency staffers are carrying out the presidents agenda. Concerns about the presidents authority over the executive branch are not unusual, but no recent president has had such an arrangement. As New Yorks Ed Kilgore noted last month, People like that can be described as political commissars, to use the term made famous in the Soviet Union for the agents sent to impose ideological discipline, particularly in military units. Sure enough, the former Marine and fighter pilot assigned to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is privately referred to as the commissar within the Pentagon. But the attitude toward the senior White House advisers varies by agency. Aides at the Departments of Transportation and the Interior described the advisers as part of their teams, and some advisers are picking up the slack in understaffed departments. However, Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt has reportedly banned former Washington state senator Don Benton, who ran Trumps Washington state campaign, from meetings.

The ubiquitous question of 15 years earlier  Why do they hate us?  was repurposed for Donald Trumps demolition of the political order. Why did white working-class voters reject Hillary Clinton and the Democrats? Why did they fall for a billionaire con man? Why do they hate us? There were, of course, many other culprits in the elections outcome. Comey, the Kremlin, the cable-news networks that beamed Trump 24/7, Jill Stein, a Clinton campaign that (among other blunders) ignored frantic on-the-ground pleas for help in Wisconsin and Michigan, and the candidate herself have all come in for deserved public flogging. But the attitude among some liberals toward the actual voters who pulled the trigger on Election Day has been more indulgent, equivocal, and forgiving. Perhaps those white voters without a college degree who preferred Trump by 39 percentage points  the most lopsided margin in the sector pollsters define as white working class since the 1980 Ronald Reagan landslide  are not deplorables who cling to guns and religion after all. Perhaps, as Joe Biden enthused, these are good people, man! who arent racist and arent sexist. Perhaps, as Mark Lilla argued in an influential essay in the New York Times, they were turned off mostly by the Democrats identity politics and rightfully felt excluded from Clintons stump strategy of name-checking every ethnicity, race, and gender in the partys coalition except garden-variety whites. Perhaps they should hate us. While many, if not most, of those in #TheResistance of the Democratic base remain furious at these voters, the partys political class and the liberal media Establishment are making a concerted effort to convert that rage into empathy. Democrats Hold Lessons on How to Talk to Real People was the headline of a Politico account of the postelection retreat of the partys senators, who had convened in the pointedly un-Brooklyn redoubt of Shepherdstown, West Virginia. Democrats must heed the rural white enclaves, repeatedly instructs the former Pennsylvania governor and MSNBC regular Ed Rendell. Nicholas Kristof has pleaded with his readers to understand that Trump voters are not the enemy, a theme shared by the anti-Trump conservative David Brooks. Were Driving to the Inauguration With a Trump Supporter was the Kumbaya-tinged teaser on the Times mobile app for a roundup of on-the-ground chronicles of these exotic folk invading Washington. Even before Trumps victory, commentators were poring through fortuitously timed books like Nancy Isenbergs sociocultural history White Trash and J.D. Vances memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, seeking to comprehend and perhaps find common ground with the Trumpentariat. As measured by book sales and his appeal to much the same NPR-ish audience, Vance has become his peoples explainer-in-chief, the Ta-Nehisi Coates, if you will, of White Lives Matter. The outbreak of Hillbilly Chic among liberals is an inverted bookend to Radical Chic, the indelible rubric attached by Tom Wolfe in 1970 (in this magazine) to white elites in Manhattan then fawning over black militants. In both cases, the spectacle of liberals doting on a hostile Other can come off like self-righteous slumming. But for those of us who want to bring down the curtain on the Trump era as quickly as possible, this pandering to his voters raises a more immediate and practical concern: Is it a worthwhile political tactic that will actually help reverse Republican rule? Or is it another counterproductive detour into liberal guilt, self-flagellation, and political correctness of the sort that helped blind Democrats to the gravity of the Trump threat in the first place? While the right is expert at channeling darker emotions like anger into ruthless political action, the Democrats default inclination is still to feel everyones pain, hang their hats on hope, and enter the fray in a softened state of unilateral disarmament. Stronger Together, the Clinton-campaign slogan, sounded more like an invitation to join a food co-op than a call to arms. After the debacle of 2016, might the time have at last come for Democrats to weaponize their anger instead of swallowing it? Instead of studying how to talk to real people, might they start talking like real people? No more reading from wimpy scripts concocted by consultants and focus groups. (Clinton couldnt even bring herself to name a favorite ice-cream flavor at one campaign stop.) Say in public what you say in private, even at the risk of pissing people off, including those in your own party. Better late than never to learn the lessons of Trumps triumphant primary campaign that the Clinton campaign foolishly ignored. This is a separate matter from the substantive question of whether the party is overdue in addressing the needs of the 21st-century middle class, or what remains of it. The answer to that is yes, as a matter of morality, policy, and politics. Americans below the top of the heap, with or without college degrees and regardless of race, have been ill served by the axis of Robert Rubin, Lawrence Summers, and the Davos-class donor base that during Bill Clintons presidency helped grease the skids for the 2008 economic collapse and allowed the culprits to escape from the wreckage unscathed during Barack Obamas. That Hillary Clinton pocketed $21.6 million by speaking to banks and other corporate groups after leaving the State Department is just one hideous illustration of how the Democrats opened the door for Trump to posture as an anti-Establishment champion of the forgotten men and women. In the bargain, she gave unenthused Democrats a reason to turn to a third-party candidate or stay home. But its one thing for the Democratic Party to drain its own swamp of special interests and another for it to waste time and energy chasing unreachable voters in the base of Trumps electorate. For all her failings, Clinton received 3 million more votes than Trump and lost the Electoral College by the mere 77,744 votes that cost her the previously blue states of Michigan (which she lost by .2 of a percentage point), Wisconsin (.8 point), and Pennsylvania (.7 point). Of the 208 counties in America that voted for Obama twice and tipped to Trump in 2016, more than three-quarters were in states Clinton won anyway (some by a landslide, like New York) or states that have long been solidly red. The centrist think tank Third Way is focusing on the Rust Belt in a $20 million campaign that its president, a former Clinton White House aide, says will address the question of how you restore Democrats as a national party that can win everywhere. Here is one answer that costs nothing: You cant, and you dont. The party is a wreck. Post-Obama-Clinton, its most admired national leaders (Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren) are of Social Security age. It rules no branch of federal government, holds only 16 governorships, and controls only 14 state legislatures. The Democrats must set priorities. In a presidential election, a revamped economic program and a new generation of un-Clinton leaders may well win back the genuine swing voters who voted for Trump, whether Democratic defectors in the Rust Belt or upscale suburbanites who just couldnt abide Hillary. But thats a small minority of Trumps electorate. Otherwise, the Trump vote is overwhelmingly synonymous with the Republican Party as a whole. That makes it all the more a fools errand for Democrats to fudge or abandon their own values to cater to the white-identity politics of the hard-core, often self-sabotaging Trump voters who helped drive the country into a ditch on Election Day. They will stick with him even though the numbers say that they will take a bigger financial hit than Clinton voters under the Republican health-care plan. As Trump himself has said, in a rare instance of accuracy, they wont waver even if he stands in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoots somebody. While you cant blame our new president for loving the poorly educated who gave him that blank check, the rest of us are entitled to abstain. If we are free to loathe Trump, we are free to loathe his most loyal voters, who have put the rest of us at risk. Liberals now looking to commune with the Trump base should check out the conscientious effort to do exactly that by the Berkeley sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild. As we learn in her election-year best seller, Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right, she poured her compassion, her anthropological sensibility, and five years of her life into a journey to the heart of the American right. Determined to burst out of her own political bubble, Hochschild uprooted herself to the red enclave of Lake Charles, Louisiana, where, as she reports, there are no color-coded recycling bins or gluten-free restaurant entres. There she befriended and chronicled tea-party members who would all end up voting for Trump. Hochschild liked the people she met, who in turn reciprocated with a teasing, good-hearted acceptance of a stranger from Berkeley. And lest liberal readers fear that she was making nice with bigots in the thrall of their notorious neighbor David Duke, she offers reassurances that her tea-partyers were generally silent about blacks. (Around her, anyway.) Hochschilds mission was inspired by Thomas Franks Whats the Matter With Kansas? She wanted to scale the empathy wall and unlock the door to the Great Paradox of why working-class voters cast ballots for politicians actively opposed to their interests. Louisiana is Americas ground zero for industrial pollution and toxic waste; the stretch of oil and petrochemical plants along the Mississippi between New Orleans and Baton Rouge is not known as cancer alley for nothing. Nonetheless, the kindly natives befriended by Hochschild not only turned out for Trump but have consistently voted for local politicians like Steve Scalise (No. 3 in Paul Ryans current House leadership), former senator David Vitter, and former governor Bobby Jindal, who rewarded poison-spewing corporations with tax breaks and deregulation even as Louisianas starved public institutions struggled to elevate the health and education of a populace that ranks near the bottom in both among the 50 states. Hochschilds newfound friends, some of them in dire health, have no explanation for this paradox, only lame, dontwannarockBig Oilstanker excuses. Similarly unpersuasive is their rationale for hating the federal government, given that it foots the bill for 44 percent of their states budget. Everyone who takes these handouts is a freeloader except them, it seems; the government should stop favoring those other moochers (none dare call them black) who, in their view, cut the line. Never mind that these white voters who complain about line cutters are themselves guilty of cutting the most important line of all  the polling-place line  since they are not subjected to the voter-suppression efforts being inflicted on minorities by GOP state legislatures, the Roberts Supreme Court, and now the Jeff Sessionsled Department of Justice. In What So Many People Dont Get About the U.S. Working Class, a postelection postmortem published to much op-ed attention by the Harvard Business Review (and soon to be published in expanded form as what will undoubtedly be another best-selling book), the University of California law professor Joan C. Williams proposes that other liberals do in essence what Hochschild did. The best advice Ive seen so far for Democrats is the recommendation that hipsters move to Iowa, Williams writes  or to any other location in the American plains where shockingly high numbers of working-class men are unemployed or on disability, fueling a wave of despair deaths in the form of the opioid epidemic. She further urges liberals to discard the dorky arrogance and smugness of the professional elite (epitomized in her view by Hillary Clinton) that leads them to condescend to disaffected working-class whites and write off blue-collar resentment as racism. Hochschild anticipated that Williams directive, too. Shes never smug. But for all her fond acceptance of her new Louisiana pals, and for all her generosity in portraying them as virtually untainted by racism, its not clear what such noble efforts yielded beyond a book, many happy memories of cultural tourism, and confirmation that nothing will change anytime soon. Her Louisianans will keep voting for candidates who will sabotage their health and their childrens education; they will not be deterred by an empathic Berkeley visitor, let alone Democratic politicians. What is it about the white working class that has such a strong hold on American politics? We have a racialized definition of workers, which is much older than this past election. For instance, when historians or normal people talk about America before the Civil War, they dont tend to talk about enslaved workers as workers. They are units of race  theyre not unpaid workers with no rights. If you include those people in your concept of the American working class, it changes the generalizations and it changes the history. A similar example is the migration of Southerners out of the South during the First World War and after. This occurred for southern people generally, both white and black. But most people dont pay attention to the Great Migration of white Southerners. Thats something thats come up now with some new literature around the election  here are people in the Midwest whose roots are in Kentucky or Arkansas. But the Great Migration has been thought of as a racial movement, not as part of the American working classs movement. I mean, even Bernie Sanders has talked like this. On the one side, there are the people who the Democrats have been paying attention to, and its women and people of color and non-Christians and so forth. And on the other side, the white working class, as if there were no nonwhite working class. Yet youve commented that the 2016 election marked a turning point in white identity. Why this election? Its made it so visible, partly after the backlash against Obama. The assumption of whiteness had been that white people didnt have race  that was somebody elses problem. But some of the attacks against Obama, the birtherism, the really ugly commentary that didnt necessarily use the word white and sometimes didnt even use the word black but were so clearly racialized attacks. The southern congressman who stood up during the presidents State of the Union address and shouted You lie. I mean, that kind of insult just off the top comes out of southern history, which is a racialized history. The election put whiteness under the microscope, so to speak. But part of the assumption that real Americans are white people or rural people is deeply structured in our politics. Where do presidential campaigns start? They start in Iowa; they start in New Hampshire. They dont start in Newark. For me, the conversation around rural drug addiction cries out to be placed in the context of the older conversations about addiction, from the 1960s and 70s, the 80s, about crack. Urban issues have, for so long, been exactly the same. Addicted mothers, grandmothers having to raise children, children being left adrift because their parents are not functioning, very brittle unions with low levels of marriage and high levels of divorce  all of the social ills that go with poverty, deindustrialization, and unemployment. The sociological and even the literary discussions of the wages of addiction in urban America are vast. I have yet to see it put together with addiction in rural America. And I think it would be so helpful if attempts to address addiction and its problems would not stop at the color line. The movie Moonlight, for instance  one of the central figures is the mother, whos an addict. In that movie, theres not a grandmother. There are sort of surrogate parents, in the older drug dealer and his girlfriend. But the question of the nonfunctioning parent is central to the narrative. So theres art, theres literature, theres policy  theres prisons. We have dealt with issues of addiction before. You would never know it by reading much of the current discussion, which is about white people, its as if this never happened. What I would like to see is, lets talk about economic issues that have to do with working-class people in a capacious way, that isnt racialized, that realizes that American workers are in the country and in the city and theyre black, white, and brown, and yellow, and red. What would that look like? Well, for one thing, it would abolish the term white working class. Had Hochschild conducted her Louisiana experiment, as Williams suggests, in Iowa or the Rust Belt towns hollowed out by factory closings and the opioid epidemic, the results would have been no more fruitful. You need not take a liberals word for this. The toughest critics of white blue-collar Trump voters are conservatives. Witness Kevin D. Williamson, who skewered the white working classs descent into dysfunction in National Review as Trump was piling up his victories in the GOP primaries last March. Raised in working-class West Texas, Williamson had no interest in emulating the efforts of coastal liberals to scale empathy walls. Instead, he condemns Trump voters for being in thrall to a vicious, selfish culture whose main products are misery and used heroin needles. He chastises them for embracing victimhood by blaming their plight on outside forces like globalization, the Establishment, China, Washington, immigrants  and the Man who closed the factories down. He concludes: Donald Trumps speeches make them feel good. So does OxyContin. Though some in Williamsons ideological camp recoiled from his blunt language, hes no outlier among conservatives. The popular blogger Erick Erickson tweeted last year that a lot of Trump voters have failed at life and blame others for their own poor decisions. His and Williamsons line of attack echoes the conservative sociologist Charles Murray, most recently famous for being shouted down at Middlebury College in Vermont, where some remembered his co-authorship of The Bell Curve, a Clinton-era slab of spurious science positing that racial genetics play a role in limiting blacks performance on I.Q. tests. In a 2012 Obama-era sequel titled Coming Apart: The State of White America 19602010, Murray switched his focus to whites and reprimanded those in the lower strata for abandoning family values and civic virtues. (This time, the culprit was not the genetic code but the anything-goes social mores wrought by leftist 1960s counterculture.) The much-beloved Hillbilly Elegy is a kinder, gentler version of the same condemnatory conservative take on the white working class, stitched into the candid and touching life story of the author, now 32, successful, and a Republican who, like Williamson and Murray, is no Trump fan. Against all odds, Vance triumphed over a sometimes brutal and always hand-to-mouth working-class upbringing in Middletown, Ohio, where his hillbilly family had migrated from coal country in eastern Kentucky. His mother was a junkie who married five times, and during one two-year interval the young Vance lived in four different homes. The powerful scenes between the addled mother and her bruised child are reminiscent of the mother-son interactions in the Oscar-winning movie Moonlight, albeit with a white heterosexual protagonist. Vance has limited sympathy for his mother or the other drug addicts and welfare queens, all white, of his hometown. He describes in detail how they game entitlements like food stamps to support their addictions, whether to opioids or flashy consumer goods. Echoing Williamson, he accuses them of responding to the collapse of the old industrial economy in the worst way possible, by acting like a persecuted minority and blaming everyone but themselves for their plight: We talk about the value of hard work but tell ourselves the reason were not working is some perceived unfairness: Obama shut down the coal mines, or all the jobs went to the Chinese. Like Hochschild and Joan Williams, Vance nonetheless goes out of his way to clear working-class whites from the charge of racism. What infuriates them about Obama, he writes, is not the color of his skin but that he is brilliant, wealthy, and speaks like a constitutional law professor. (That Obama, like Vance, was rescued from his problematic parental dynamic in part by his white Middle American grandparents goes unmentioned.) But thats one of the few spirited defenses he mounts of those whom forgiving liberals like Hochschild, Kristof, and the rest want to usher into the Democratic fold. In nearly every other way, he, like Williamson, finds them to be a basket of deplorables even without leveling the charge of bigotry. At least Hillary Clinton and her party aspired to do something, however inchoate, for the white working class. Vance, Williamson, and Murray  every bit as anti-government as the dysfunctional whites they deplore  have little use for a federal safety net. They instead offer Trump voters lectures about the virtues of self-help. In Hillbilly Elegy, Vance concludes by demanding that we hillbillies  wake the hell up. Its a retread of the magical thinking Murray offered four years earlier (to no avail) in Coming Apart, in which he suggested that a Great Civic Awakening among the out-of-touch upper classes would somehow lift up the dysfunctional whites below. For his part, Williamson suggests that Trump-and-OxyContin- addicted working-class whites rent U-Hauls and flee their dying towns for an unspecified future, with no prospect of any government program to rescue them as FDRs Resettlement Administration once aided Okies who packed up all they had in beat-up jalopies to flee the Dust Bowl. Vance, youd think, would be more generous than this. As an alumnus of Yale Law School who ended up working as a Silicon Valley investor under the aegis of Peter Thiel, he is too successful and sophisticated to leave unacknowledged the government help he received along the way. By his own account, his grandmothers old-age benefits kept him from going hungry as a child. He cites Pell grants, low-interest government loans, bargain in-state tuition at Ohio State, and the GI Bill (he enlisted in the Marine Corps after college) for their role in making his elite education and worldly achievements possible. Vance recently announced that he is moving back to Ohio to start a nonprofit organization to help combat the opioid epidemic. But in Hillbilly Elegy, he minimizes the usefulness of government programs and social services, which often make a bad problem worse. He approvingly quotes a friend who worked in the White House (presumably a Republican White House) as saying You probably cant fix these things and that the best you can do is put your thumb on the scale a little for the people at the margins. In White Trash, Nancy Isenberg might as well be talking about Vance when she writes (of Nixon-era conservatives) that the same self-made man who looked down on white trash conveniently chose to forget that his own parents escaped the tar-paper shack only with the help of the federal government as he now pulled up the social ladder behind him. The conservative contempt for Trump voters  omnipresent among the partys Establishment until the Election Day results persuaded all but the most adamant NeverTrumpers to fall into line  would seem to give the Democrats a big opening to win them over. Bemoaning how his blue native state of West Virginia turned red well before Trump beat Clinton by 42 percentage points, the veteran liberal editor and author Charles Peters was hopeful the tide could be reversed with time and, yes, empathy: If we dont listen, how can we persuade? he implored readers of the Times. Those who want to start that listening now can download an Escape Your Bubble browser extension to sweep opposing views into their Facebook feeds; both MSNBC and CNN have stepped up their efforts to expose their audiences to Trumpist voices. But getting out of ones bubble cant be a one-way proposition. It wont make any difference if MSNBC viewers hear from the right while Fox News viewers remain locked in their echo chamber. Nor will it matter if hipsters  or Democratic politicians  migrate from the Bay Area and Brooklyn to Louisiana and Iowa to listen to white working-class voters if those voters dont listen back. Theres zero evidence that they will. The dug-in Trump base shows no signs of varying its exclusive diet of right-wing media telling it that anyone who contradicts Trump, Rush, or Breitbart is peddling fake news. When Bernie Sanders visits West Virginia to tell his faithful that they are being raped and pillaged by Trump-administration policies that will make the Trump University scam look like amateur hour, he is being covered by MSNBC, not Fox News, whose passing interest in Sanders during primary season was attributable to his attacks on Clinton. The most insistent message of right-wing media hasnt changed since the Barry Goldwater era: Government is inherently worthless, if not evil, and those who preach government activism, i.e., liberals and Democrats, are subverting America. Facts on the ground, as Hochschild saw in Louisiana, do nothing to counter this bias. In his definitive recent book on the Rust Belt drug plague, Dreamland, the journalist Sam Quinones observes that other than addicts and traffickers, most of the people he encountered in his reporting were government workers. They were the only ones I saw fighting this scourge, he writes. Weve seen a demonization of government and the exaltation of the free market in America over the previous 30 years. But here was a story where the battle against the free markets worst effects was taken on mostly by anonymous public employees. In that category he includes local police, prosecutors, federal agents, coroners, nurses, Centers for Disease Control scientists, judges, state pharmacists, and epidemiologists. Yet even now, Reagans old dictum remains gospel on the right (Vance included): The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: Im from the government and Im here to help. In Portsmouth, Ohio, the epicenter of opiate-pill mills and of Quinoness book, Trump won by a landslide. As he did in Ohios Butler County, where Vance grew up and which now ranks eighth among all American counties in the increase in the rate of drug-related deaths between 2004 (when opioid fatalities first spiked) and 2014. As polls uniformly indicate, nothing that has happened since November 8 has shaken that support. And what are Trumps voters getting in exchange for their loyalty? For starters, theres Ryan-Trumpcare, which, on top of its other indignities, eliminates the requirement that Medicaid offer addiction treatment, which over the past two years has increased exponentially in opioid-decimated communities where it is desperately needed. Meanwhile, Trumps White House circle of billionaires is busily catering to its own constituency, prioritizing tax cuts for the fabulously wealthy while pushing to eliminate rural-development agencies that aid Trump voters. The go-to explanation for the steadfastness of Trumps base was formulated by the conservative pundit Salena Zito during the campaign: The press takes Trump literally but not seriously while his supporters take him seriously but not literally. If this is true, then presumably his base will remain onboard when he fails to deliver literally on his most alluring promises: insurance for everybody providing great health care for a fraction of the price; the revival of coal mining; a trillion-dollar infrastructure mobilization producing millions of new jobs and accompanied by massive tax relief for all; and the wall that will shield America from both illegal immigration and the lethal Mexican heroin that has joined OxyContin as the working-class drugs of choice. Theres no way liberals can counter these voters blind faith in a huckster whos sold them this snake oil. The notion that they can be won over by some sort of new New Deal  domestic programs that would benefit everyone (like national health insurance), as Mark Lilla puts it  is wishful thinking. These voters are so adamantly opposed to government programs that in some cases they refuse to accept the fact that aid they already receive comes from Washington  witness the Keep Government Out of My Medicare! placards at the early tea-party protests. Perhaps its a smarter idea to just let the GOP own these intractable voters. Liberals looking for a way to empathize with conservatives should endorse the core conservative belief in the importance of personal responsibility. Let Trumps white working-class base take responsibility for its own votes  or in some cases failure to vote  and live with the elections consequences. If, as polls tell us, many voters who vilify Obamacare havent yet figured out that its another name for the Affordable Care Act thats benefiting them  or if they do know and still want the Trump alternative  then let them reap the consequences for voting against their own interests. That they will sabotage other needy Americans along with them is unavoidable in any case now  at least until voters stage an intervention in an election to come. Trump voters should also be reminded that the elite of the party theyve put in power is as dismissive of them as Democratic elites can be condescending. Forget your cheap theatrical Bruce Springsteen crap, Kevin Williamson wrote of the white working class in National Review. The truth about these dysfunctional, downscale communities is that they deserve to die. Economically, they are negative assets. Morally, they are indefensible. He was only saying in public what other Republicans like Mitt Romney say about the 47 percent in private when they think only well-heeled donors are listening. Besides, if National Review says that their towns deserve to die, who are Democrats to stand in the way of Trump voters who used their ballots to commit assisted suicide? So hold the empathy and hold on to the anger. If Trump delivers on his promises to the poorly educated despite all indications to the contrary, then good for them. Once again, all the Trump naysayers will be proved wrong. But if his administration crashes into an iceberg, leaving his base trapped in Americas steerage with no lifeboats, those who survive may at last be ready to burst out of their own bubble and listen to an alternative. Or not: Maybe, like Hochschilds new friends in Louisianas oil country, theyll keep voting against their own interests until the industrial poisons left unregulated by their favored politicians finish them off altogether. Either way, the best course for Democrats may be to respect their right to choose. *This article appears in the March 20, 2017, issue of New York Magazine."}, {"date": "2017/03/20", "title": "Man Shot and Killed at Paris Airport Was Under Influence of Drugs and Alcohol", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/man-shot-and-killed-at-paris-airport-after-attacking-soldier.html", "text": " French security forces shot and killed a man who seized a soldiers gun at a Paris airport on Saturday morning. Thirty-nine-year-old Ziyed Ben Belgacem, who had been investigated for links to radical Islam, reportedly told the soldiers he attacked that, Im here to die for Allah. In any case people are going to die, before being killed, but its not clear that terrorism was his real motivation. Ben Belgacem, a French native of Tunisian descent who was not considered a high terrorism risk by French authorities, had spent time in prison for armed robbery and dealing drugs, and an autopsy has confirmed that he had alcohol, cocaine, and cannabis in his blood when he died. The alcohol level was twice the legal limit in France. His father is now insisting that his son was not a terrorist, or even a practicing Muslim, and was just out of control under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Cocaine was also found at Ben Balgacems apartment by police. Earlier Saturday morning, the suspect, who had been out drinking the night before, shot and wounded a police officer with an air pistol after being stopped for speeding in a northern Paris suburb. Fleeing the scene, he contacted relatives to tell them that he done something stupid. He then returned to the bar he had been drinking at the night before, where he fired more shots and stole someones car. Ben Belgacem then traveled to Pariss Orly Airport, where he walked into the departures area of the south terminal and accosted a female soldier, holding his gun to her head and telling her fellow soldiers that he wanted to die for Allah. He then grabbed the soldiers assault rifle after a scuffle, and was shot and killed. Those soldiers were part of a military patrol stationed at the airport as part of the countrys Sentinelle security program, which has deployed special-forces troops at various sensitive locations throughout France following the series of deadly terrorist attacks that have struck the country since 2015. No one other than the suspect was injured in the attack at Orly, though some 3,000 passengers were subsequently evacuated from the airport while security personnel confirmed that there were no explosives in the terminal. Flights in and out of Orly were temporarily suspended as well. French president Franois Hollande announced on Saturday that the investigation into the incident was being handled by antiterrorism prosecutors. Ben Belgacems father, brother, and cousin all approached police by themselves on Saturday following the attack, and they were held, questioned, and ultimately all released. Ben Belcagem had been investigated in 2015 over suspicions that he had become radicalized in prison, but he was not listed as posing a high risk by French authorities. A Paris prosecutor suggested to the AFP that Ben Belcagem may have just fallen into some kind of self-destructive downward spiral on Saturday. Terrorism has not been ruled out, however, and the investigation is ongoing. The attack, which follows a similar incident in early February outside the Louvre Museum in Paris, comes in the middle of a fiercely contested presidential race between a centrist candidate, Emmanuel Macron, and a far-right-wing candidate, Marine Le Pen, who has made antiterrorism and anti-immigration the centerpieces of her campaign.

Cohn is allegedly more liberal than most of President Trumps inner circle, and along with former Goldman exec Dina Powell, has apparently gained the trust of  and an alliance with  Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump. But the Cohn-led cadre is also being derisively referred to as the Democrats by their more ideological peers in the White House, and the Post adds that the populist Steve Bannon has now found a new ally in former rival Reince Priebus, partially in response to the rise of the New York/Goldman wing. Fox Business reported last week that Bannon and Cohn are in the middle of a bitter policy fight, which started over trade policy and now also extends to other economic and tax policies, and that the tension has eclipsed the previously dominant tension between Bannon and Priebus. Sources told Fox that the loser of the Cohn/Bannon fight could be the first major casualty of Trumps senior staff (apparently forgetting all about former national security adviser Michael Flynn). One insider told Fox that Bannon and Cohn may like each other but the situation is getting toxic and nobody wants to get in between that feud. Whos winning? According to the Posts sources, its Bannons Team Ideologue. The paper cites a telling choice Trump had to make last Wednesday between a visit south to the grave of ber-populist former President Andrew Jackson (definitely Bannons idea), or heading north to a Broadway musical at the invitation of Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau (the New York Wings preference). Ultimately, Trump dismissed the musical idea and went to Nashville, where he laid a wreath at and saluted Jacksons grave, then went to another campaign-style rally with his supporters. Also, keep in mind that these are not the first insider accounts from unnamed White House sources to connect Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner to the idea of moderate influence on the president and to allude to a feud (one thats been leaked to the nations two biggest newspapers) that infighters are trying to draw attention to  or advantage from. As Axios pointed out on Sunday, there will likely be another round of leaked accounts responding to these reports. But while the conflict-addled Trump administration continues to stall and stutter when it comes to running, or even just staffing, the government, it also seems as though the president is more than content with the status quo. The Times reports that Trump, a former reality-television star, likes the infighting and perpetual struggle for his attention, as he believes it both makes his staff more competitive and ensures no one person obtains too much power.

He did it all on foot and by token. Its news reporting, he once said, and that consists of using your two feet. The only lesson, then, that you could give people is how to climb stairs, because there are no stories on the first floor. Anything youre looking for is four and five flights up. Breslin, who died this morning at 88, found as many of those stories as anyone in six decades as a reporter and columnist. And although reporter and columnist begins to get to his essence, it elides a huge distinction. In the 1950s, the only columnists who went out and climbed the stairs were gossip hounds like Walter Winchell. Political columnists tended to sit in their offices and then write about what theyd read in the Times. Often (as a colleague from the early days of New York Magazine, Tom Wolfe, has noted), a great reporter got a column as a reward for long service and promptly went to sleep on the job. Breslin had indeed been a great reporter in his early days on the New York Journal-American, which he described as a paper where, believe me, ya couldnt even believe the weather report. Hed written a hugely entertaining little book about the awfulness of the 62 Mets, called Cant Anybody Here Play This Game?, that caught the eye of the folks at the New York Herald Tribune. He got hired there in May 1963, and did indeed become a five-day-a-week columnist. And then, instead of rocking back in his chair to crank out the punditry, he hit the streets. After his daily rounds, hed come into the office around 4 p.m., facing a 5:30 deadline, barely getting started as his colleagues were starting to pack up and head for the bar car en route to Westport. As Wolfe wrote in 1972: His ability to push right up to press time scared the hell out of his editors  the late Sheldon Zalaznick, who first worked with him at the Trib, described the daily process as absolutely heart-stopping  but he always made it, delivering a few pages that were covered with scribbled revisions. What emerged from the blue miasma over his desk sounded like nothing anybody else ever wrote. He was often compared with Damon Runyon, and they shared a certain clipped tough-guy patois, but Breslin was funnier and more politically engaged, the hilarious writing just barely concealing a splenetic rage. He was a crusader with a sense of humor, a warrior who won by taking the piss out of everyone at any turn. But he could also be understated and amazingly delicate. The most famous column he ever wrote ran the day after President Kennedys death in 1963. When everyone else was writing about Jackie and the kids, or Lyndon Johnson, or the relations with the Soviets, or Lee Harvey Oswald, Breslin went out to Arlington National Cemetery and interviewed Clifton Pollard, the man whod come into work on a Sunday to dig the presidents grave. (A clich approach now, perhaps, but it was revolutionary then.) That column is taught in journalism schools, the first best example of zagging when everyone else zigs, looking for a singular human moment when the rest of the pack is picking at the same worked-over narrative. Around the time Breslin was hired at the Tribune, two editors named James Bellows and Clay Felker were revamping the papers Sunday magazine, aiming to make it into a showplace for the best newspaper writing in town. They renamed it New York, and Wolfe and Breslin were among the first writers they brought on. Five years later, after the Trib had tipped over dead, Felker relaunched the magazine as a standalone weekly. Breslin wrote and wrote for him, a torrent of good stuff about blue-collar New York and Irish-American New York and crooked public officials. The tribal climate of New York, where races and classes were constantly clashing, continually fed him material. And within a year, Breslin was not only writing long and extraordinarily well about politics, but found himself inadvertently campaigning for public office. It was the spring of 1969, and Mayor John Lindsay was preparing to run for reelection despite relatively weak support and a general public sense that his idealistic administration, despite good intentions, wasnt getting things done. Somehow  well, let Breslin write it. From New York, May 5, 1969: I Run to Win, the story was titled, and it is possibly the funniest piece of political writing youll ever read, proceeding from the gimlet-eyed why-am-I-doing-this moment above to, by the end, flat-out glad-handed campaigning. He spent the summer doing just that in New Yorks pages, filing antic columns like the one in which he posits that John Lindsay, Waspy and suave and six feet five, was physically incompatible with the office, which had been held for a century almost exclusively by stumpy little ethnic guys in the Fiorello La Guardia vein. It was called Is Lindsay Too Tall to Be Mayor?, and if you want to improve your afternoon, click through and read those two ageless stories right now. The Mailer-Breslin campaign  they operated as a conjoint slate  ran on a secession platform, saying that New York City ought to become the 51st state and retain the name New York. (The rest of the state, Breslin said, could be called Buffalo.) They wanted all city services decentralized down to the neighborhood level. Sundays would be completely car- and even elevator-free, to encourage walking and mingling. Kiss Off the Boredom of the Democratic Machine! read the handbills they gave out. Their campaign buttons said, The other guys are the joke. Breslin came in fifth in a field of six in the Democratic primary, taking 10 percent of the vote. (Charlie Rangel came in sixth.) I am mortified, he said, to have taken part in a process that required bars to be closed, as they were on Election Day back then. He quit New York after just a few years, after conflict with Felker and a growing distaste for the magazines white-collar view of the world, and went back to newspapers. At the Daily News, he once again found himself not only covering events but also a part of them. As the Son of Sam serial-killing case played out in the summer of 1977, who did the killer write his madman letter to? Breslin himself. (Hello from the gutters of N.Y.C. which are filled with dog manure, vomit, stale wine, urine and blood  ) From there, he went from fame to legend. Seventeen books, including a Damon Runyon biography in 1991 and a memoir of his own recovery after risky surgery to repair a brain aneurysm in 1994. A long-running column in Newsday that ended in 2004 (ignominiously, with a blown call of the election for John Kerry). He married twice, successfully: His first wife, Rosemary, died in 1981, and his second, the activist and former city councilwoman Ronnie Eldridge, survives him. The 18th book  its subject unnamed (he wouldnt say more than lets see how it comes out)  was in the typewriter at his death."}, {"date": "2017/03/19", "title": "Whitey Tape Blogger Was One of the Sources for U.K. Wiretap Claim", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/whitey-tape-blogger-was-one-source-of-uk-wiretap-claim.html", "text": " Last week, the Trump White House ignited a diplomatic row with Americas closest ally when Press Secretary Sean Spicer, looking to bolster President Trumps baseless wiretap allegations against President Obama, promoted Fox News commentator Andrew Napolitanos report that Obama used a British intelligence agency to spy on Trump during last years presidential campaign. The British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), which is the agency responsible for the U.K.s intelligence gathering, then made a rare public statement in order to officially rebuke the claim, calling Napolitanos report nonsense and utterly ridiculous. President Trump, asked about the claim by a reporter on Friday, tried to shift blame to Fox News and Napolitano, who he also nonetheless praised: But Napolitanos claim, which he repeatedly said came from Fox News sources, was then seemingly dismissed by Fox News itself. Anchor Shep Smith said on Friday that the network could not confirm Napolitanos commentary and that Fox News knows of no evidence of any kind that the now-President of the United States was surveilled at any time in any way. Full stop. The network also said that Napolitano still stands by his report, but anchor Bret Baier later reiterated that the Fox News division was never able to back up those claims. Napolitanos report has also now drawn a rebuke from the deputy head of the NSA, Richard Ledgett. In a BBC interview on Saturday, Ledgett called Napolitanos crazy report arrant nonsense, adding that the allegation belies a complete lack of understanding of how the relationship works between the intel community agencies and completely ignores the political reality of would the UK government agree to do that? Answering his own question, Ledgett went on, Of course [British government] wouldnt do it. It would be epically stupid. So where did Fox News very talented legal mind come up with this White Houseboosted allegation? The New York Times and Politico report that one of the sources was former CIA analyst, blogger, and occasional Russia Today guest Larry C. Johnson, who infamously promoted the false rumor in 2008 that the GOP possessed a bombshell video in which former First Lady Michelle Obama had been recorded making disparaging remarks about white people  also known as the infamous Whitey tape hoax. Napolitano apparently asked Johnson to speak with the Times on Friday, and Johnson explained to them that Napolitano had heard about the U.K. wiretap claim through an intermediary who had learned of it through sources in the U.S. intelligence community. Johnson, who maintains that the Whitey tape fiasco was the result of him getting played by Clinton operatives during the contentious 2008 primaries, has since denied some of the Times report, but admits that he was one of Napolitanos sources. Appearing on CNNs Reliable Sources on Sunday, Johnson further elaborated that he had posted the theory on an online discussion board and someone passed that post along to Napolitano. Speaking with Politico, Johnson explained that his own initial source for the U.K. wiretap theory was a Democrat who is not actually in the U.S. intelligence community but has ties there, and was someone with a history of having access to national security information. That source, according to Johnson, was alarmed at what he saw as this meddling in the election. He says he confirmed the tip with two people in the intelligence community and were not talking janitors or cleaning ladies. Johnson also appeared on the state-controlled Russia Today (RT) television network earlier this year to contest the U.S. intelligence communitys conclusion that Russia interfered in last years election. He then repeated that opinion earlier this month when he reappeared on the network one day after Trump tweeted his now notorious allegation that President Obama had illegally ordered a wiretap on him and Trump Tower. In that interview, Johnson  who says he was not paid by RT for his appearances  seems to have made the first-ever public mention of the U.K. wiretap theory, alleging that senior members of the Obama administration had colluded with the U.K. to spy on Trump and then illegally disseminated that information throughout the U.S. government. He has also passed along the theory that U.S. government insiders like the CIA may have hacked the Democratic National Committee during the campaign instead of Russia. Im not a nut, Johnson told Politico. The British government says it told its U.S. counterparts that they should have ignored the ridiculous wiretap claim, and also stated that the U.S. has promised not to repeat the accusation. The White House, however, has denied a report that they apologized to the British government for highlighting the allegations. I dont think we regret anything, White House Press Secretary Spicer said to reporters on Friday, We were just passing on news reports.

Bush; and First Lady Hillary Clinton. By cramped White House standards, its an expansive space, complete with a desk, a conference table, a couch, a bookshelf stocked with a single copy of The Art of the Deal, a duffel bag full of family photos and a couple of pairs of Spanx  and, through the blinds, a view of the Washington Monument. And on this February day, its current tenant, Kellyanne Conway, was explaining how her life had changed in the nine months since she joined the campaign of the man who would ultimately become the 45th president of the United States  for one thing, she now answers to Blueberry. Thats because shes one of the only officials in the White House, other than President Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence, to have Secret Service protection  which staffers receive at the special request of the president, who has famously referred to her as my Kellyanne. She got the protection, Conway said, after she was sent a suspicious white substance. And then there were the threats. Most of them are online, she remarked, and most of them are very explicit and graphic, and theyre sometimes people who have a history of following through but for whatever reason werent prosecuted. As a child, Conway picked berries in southern New Jersey, where the acidic soil once served as a lab for botanists attempting to tame the wild bushes. In 1984, when she was 16, she was crowned Miss New Jersey Blueberry Princess (the girl who was crowned Miss New Jersey Honey Queen told a local paper she planned to grow a bee beard by sitting a queen bee on her chin and waiting patiently while the rest of the hive, who gravitate to the queen, crowded around on her face). Later on, Conway would earn the distinction of World Champion Blueberry Packer, for the alacrity with which she packed the berries into crates. So when the Secret Service told her to pick a code name that began with B, I was like, Well, thats easy! she said. Conway laughed with her assistant, a 26-year-old College Republicans alum named Catharine Cypher, as she tried to explain the absurdity of hearing the stoic armed men who follow her around refer in all earnestness to the whereabouts of one Miss Blueberry: Its kind of embarrassing! In the supermarket, they trail her and speak into their wrists: Theyre like, Blueberry, horsepower, aisle four! Im like, Seriously? Once in a while, somebody will come up to me in the aisle and they just sort of hasten their gait and say, You oughtta be ashamed of yourself! You oughtta look in the mirror! And Im like, Ill get right on it! Mirrors, aisle eight! She laughed. More often, she said, she finds herself encountering fans. All the women coming up to me: My moms gonna die if she hears youre in the grocery store! Well, how else would I eat? Im on the Blueberry email, Cypher chimed in, referring to the Secret Service alerts that document Blueberrys every move. Conways eyes bulged cartoonishly. Ive never seen it! she said. Show us! Ive never seen the Blueberry email! Reading the emails, the women began cracking up. Blueberry: arrived LGA. More laughter. Blueberry: arrived Crown, Crown being Secret Servicespeak for the White House. Cypher noted that, over the weekend, she knew her bosss every move. Theres too much information! Conway said, laughing. At the airport, she said, all I wanted to do was get coffee and pee. I definitely cant get coffee if I dont pee  trust me, I gave vaginal birth four times. But who wants to bring a guard into a public restroom? Oh my God, theres no privacy! Its crazy, it really is crazy. And it can get complicated. I have two friends, who both  well, one is Ann Coulter. She started dating her security guard probably ten years ago because she couldnt see anybody else, Conway said. And you know Rebekah Mercer? she asked, referring to the Republican megadonor who, with her father, Robert, bankrolled Trumps campaign and pushed to install Conway as its campaign manager. Her younger sister, Heather Sue, married her security guard. She was like, Well, I didnt see anybody else, so one night, I, you know, I invited him in! Conways got a running joke about one of her own agents. If Blueberry has an affair, its with Secret Service! Its with Joe. She deepened her voice to mimic his: Maam? Blueberry, horsepower!  (Coulter and the Mercer family did not respond to multiple requests for comment.) Blueberry knows that she has had a breakout year. As Trumps highly visible and quotable campaign manager during the elections final sprint, she became a constant presence on cable news and thus a subject of widespread fascination, armchair psychoanalysis, outrage, and exuberant ridicule. But rather than buckling, she absorbed all of it, coming out the other side so aware of how the world perceives her that she could probably write this article herself. Heres the proof no one can dodge an interview question like Kellyanne Conway, in case there was any doubt: Caricatures from that time, when hardly anyone believed Trump could defy the polls and win, depicted her wielding everything from a whip to a shock collar to tame her unruly candidate. But these days, serving as the senior counselor to the president, Conway is becoming less a supporting character than a bona fide celebrity in her own right. She is simply more famous  more beloved by Trump fans and more hated by Trump detractors  than anyone in any comparable role in any previous White House. And so she has become a complicated symbol for both sides; recently, when a photo of her wearing a mini-dress and sitting on her knees on a couch in the Oval Office went viral  leading a Democratic congressman to say she looked familiar in the position  it set off debate among feminists over whether a woman like Conway, who many believe is harmful to their cause, deserves sticking up for in the face of sexism. Personally, Conway claims to be sick of herself. But shes also clearly having a lot of fun being the center of attention in whats surely the strangest era in modern political history. On January 20, the day of Trumps inauguration, Conway turned 50. Up close, she looks like a glamorous mosquito, five feet and six inches of wiry limbs and buzzing energy wrapped tightly in colorful shift dresses by Alexander McQueen or Sandro  today a short-sleeve royal-blue number with leather accents, a rhinestone necklace, and black-and-beige stilettos. (President Trump doesnt like frump, a similarly done-up Omarosa Manigault, the Apprentice contestant turned White House staffer, explained recently in the East Room.) Conway had settled down to chat with me one day in mid-February as she skimmed some notes and readied herself for a TV appearance, which she claimed would not be treated as an opportunity to get her opinions through to the president, despite the audience of one theory that many have used to explain the cable hits she and other members of the administration so often make. When I want to talk to him, I go talk to him, she said, emphasizing that she has walk-in privileges, meaning she can waltz into the Oval Office unannounced. Eighty-five percent of what I discuss with him will never be revealed. Its like any other bossC-suite-employee relationship. I dont need to talk to him through the TV. I just go in and talk to him. This idea is very important to Conway, and she returns to it often  that she is as close an adviser to the president as there exists in the White House and can bend his ear at any time. (The following day, I asked her via text message if something Id seen on Twitter was true  that the president had recently unfollowed her. She told me no, that she thought hed never followed her in the first place  then she asked the president himself. Hold on, she texted, complaining all the while that the topic was small ball. In real time, I watched the presidents following list jump up by one. I asked if he had unfollowed, convinced he had never followed. He has 30m followers and follows like 42 people! she wrote. Now 43.) After hair and makeup, she made her way down the narrow staircases of the West Wing and into the briefing room, which was mostly empty. A cameraman approached and asked Conway to stand on a rectangular wooden box decorated with the NBC peacock, about five inches off the ground, so she could meet the cameras gaze. She gave a quick ten count, confirmed that she could hear audio from New York, and started talking. Yes, General Flynn does enjoy the full confidence of the president, she said. This is a big week for General Flynn. Hes the point of contact for many of these foreign visits. If you look at the official schedule, today you had the prime minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, here. Pressed further, she repeated her answer. Does he have the full confidence of the president? Yes, he does, she said. When the segment was over, her stern smile gave way to a look of serene confidence. Thanks for having me, she said into the microphone. Hows the baby? Send me a new picture! She stepped off the platform and turned around to discover that a small scrum of reporters had formed at her back. Hey, Kellyanne! Did you say full confidence? one asked. About 18 times, she said. The reporter raised his eyebrows. About 18 times, he said. Okay. Conway smiled. Should I do it in French since the prime minister was here? Everybody laughed, vying for her attention: Kellyanne! Kellyanne! She began making her way toward the doorway. I dont do the press briefings, she explained. Sean does! Walking into a small office space behind the briefing lectern, she could see that her words had already made their way to various cable-news chyrons, which thrilled her. And there it is! she said, looking at the TV. Conway: Flynn has the confidence of the president! She let out a giddy laugh. Quoted in real time! A few minutes later, leaning on her desk, she looked at her iPhone, with its giant font and banner alerts, and noticed that news had broken that Flynn had extended an apology to Pence. She mumbled the headline aloud. Hmm, she said. Did we really need to put that out there? She ate a few pieces of cinnamon-flavored Orbit, the gum of choice of Sean Spicer, whos technically the public face of the new administration, though Conway was first floated as an obvious pick for press secretary. Asked if she would ever want his job, she rolled her eyes. Slit my wrists, bleed out, put cement shoes on, jump off the bridge, and then Ill take the job  are you kidding me? Delivering absolute assurances about the gainful employment of the national-security adviser just before he was forced to resign might have torpedoed anyone elses communications career. After all, what she said wasnt skillful obfuscation; it was just wrong. On that one, she was definitely not in the loop. She was never envisioned to be in the loop, Steve Bannon, the presidents chief strategist, told me. Quite frankly, I was a little surprised when I saw that. Conways interview had taken place in the afternoon, around 4 p.m., and it only took an hour for Spicer to come out and cast doubt on what shed said. Just after 10 p.m., Flynn resigned. In her capacity as Trumps spokeswoman, Conway has said many incorrect things. During the campaign, she repeatedly insisted that her candidate had brought an end to birtherism, the conspiracy claiming that Barack Obama was not born in America, rather than launched his political career with it. There was her claim that the White Houses grossly inflated estimates about the size of the crowd at the Mall were alternative facts; the fictional Bowling Green Massacre, which she cited at least three times; and her suggestion, which she later said was taken out of context, that the Obama administration may have conducted unlawful government surveillance on Trump Tower via microwaves. It has been a nine-month run breathtaking in its audacity, with Conway demonstrating an almost freakish facility with falsehoods. But the Flynn episode was particularly dramatic, since her comments were not just at odds with public perception but with the high-stakes decision-making inside the White House  meaning it made Trump Kremlinogists wonder just how close to the center of power she really was. And yet Conway did more than just survive that brief humiliation. In the time I spent observing her and talking to her over the past several weeks, her mood rarely seemed anything other than elated  perhaps because of how many people she encountered, wherever she went in Washington, who greeted her like a hometown hero. Her notoriety seemed only to help her standing with the president, who has kept her as a trusted adviser and the White Houses most recognizable avatar on the outside. By March, she was less a pollster, campaign manager, or communications guru and more what the press expected Ivanka Trump would become in the absence of Melania Trump, who remains in New York with her young son, Barron  a pervasive female double of the president, an extension of his will and much more fiendishly committed to her boss than anyone else working on his behalf. Fewer than 50 days into the new administration, Conway had become almost inseparable from the publics idea of the Trump White House. That is, the functional First Lady of the United States. The simplest explanation for that is Conways eerie similarity to the president: her opportunism, jumping from Ted Cruz to Trump mid-campaign; her mercenary sense of loyalty, somehow both total and totally for hire; her ease at projecting, in even the most staged encounters, a blue-collar authenticity; her fighters instinct, which dictates that she never give an inch or even try to persuade; and, above all, her very loose relationship to the truth and her very evident love of the game. Other Trump surrogates, like Reince Priebus or Sarah Huckabee Sanders, get weaselly under pressure, as did their predecessors in previous administrations. But in intense interviews with Jake Tapper or Chuck Todd, you can usually see Conway winking and smiling, in much the same way her boss seems amused by the theater of a press conference even as hes staging one. Other presidents would have been ashamed to have their representatives spin such bullshit, to have them so dismissively refuse to engage with interlocutors about contrary facts or commonsensical presumptions. But Trump doesnt appear to feel shame, not in his communications strategy nor in any other part of his life. And Conway has become his most convincing doppelgnger by not feeling shame either. Even so, the Trump staffs first Youre fired was rocky for her. On that day, he made a decision at the hour, whatever it was, five oclock, and said, This is how I want to handle this, Spicer, leaning back on a chair in his White House office, told me. This is a guy who makes big decisions when hes ready and then he tells his team. Had Conways interview been 30 or 40 minutes later  he said, trailing off. What people sometimes dont appreciate is youre answering on behalf of somebody whom youre speaking for, so youre representing their point of view, the issues that they care about, and thats a very different thing than answering for yourself. I think sometimes people might look at a television interview and theres an obvious answer to something, but because of what you know, or because of the direction somethings going in, or because of the discussions that may be coming up, you cant answer it in the easiest way because you know things about how the issue is gonna evolve or a meeting that might be coming up or a piece of information that you cant share that makes it more difficult to answer in a way than someone whos just sitting at home watching understands. The way we roll is, things are thought through in a smaller group and people are brought in as they need to be brought in for input, Bannon explained. I think its a pretty good way to manage things. Theres a tendency, if you get too broad too quickly, either things can leak out or its just not as tight as you can roll, and I think the General Flynn thing was that. It was obviously embarrassing to her, and the media immediately jumps on it because, look, no offense, the media, lets be honest about it, its a lot like junior-high school. (Bannon himself attended an all-boys military school.) Its a whos in, whos out. Its all of this snarky stuff. But the degree to which a senior White House official is in, when the job, in part, is to communicate the presidents thinking to the general public via the media, is rather important  as members of the media, already warring with Conway, were quick to point out. Anybody who pretends Im not smart or not credible, its like, Excuse me, Ive spoken 1.2 million words on TV, okay?, Conway told me before the Flynn mishap. You wanna focus on two here and two there, its on you, youre a fucking miserable person, P.S., just whoever you are. Besides, as everyone in this chaotic White House will tell you, when it comes to this president, having all the facts all the time is virtually impossible. Its very hard to be in the Trump loop, one former Trump adviser said, both owing to his unpredictable personality as well as the insular nature of his senior staff. (About the presidents perspective on the staff scrambling and turf wars, another adviser, who has known Trump since the 1990s, added, I dont think the president cares. I think he likes the infighting. I think his attitude is, lets see if youre tough. Lets see whos tough.) Being informed, then, is a matter of proximity  which explains why, unlike on most campaigns, Trumps managers and strategists traveled the country with him on his private Boeing 757, for fear that staying behind in the Trump Tower war room could mean losing their influence. There is kind of a circle-the-wagons mentality, and if your wagons out of the circle for a while because youve gotta go do something, youre out of the loop, the former adviser said. In the Trump White House, that can happen to anyone the moment youre outside of the inner circle physically. As Bannon said, I do think it was a little overplayed when she was quote-unquote the Trump whisperer. Theres no Trump whisperer. Theres just not. It doesnt function like that. He doesnt absorb information like that. Everybody thats looked at as a Trump whisperer? Its always meant to demean him. For her part, Conway calls Bannon the White Houses man of mystery  joking that you cant constantly jockey to be next to the president and remain invisible at the same time. I tease him a lot. I told him in December or November, You realize I go on TV to defend you more now than Donald Trump? So while youre sound asleep and my husband is trying to master how to flip a pancake, Im actually defending you. Not that it matters to Bannon. I tell her, I tell everybody: I could care less if you defend me, he told me. I dont want to be defended, because I dont care. When the White House learned Bannon would appear on the cover of Time, Conway told me, people were running around the West Wing frantically trying to figure out what to do. Like, whos ever out there for me? Or even Sean? Its like, you cant be in every photo and then wonder why youre an object of media fascination. And then because youre in every photo, people are like, Oh, those who arent in the photo must be   She trailed off. How about if were the ones working? How about the five computers on my desk? (There was only one computer on her desk.) Everybody draws the wrong conclusions, I think. Maybe not everybody. From the #MAGA side of the political spectrum, where Trump still has enormous support, Conway has become a kind of loyalist hero, more visible than Jared and Ivanka and more deeply committed to the singular cause of Trump than Bannon, who sees himself as part of a global nationalist movement, and Priebus, who is self-preserving in the grand tradition of Establishment operatives. To judge by her reception at the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual assembly of Republicans that takes place at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland, she might as well be a second president, mobbed by reporters and conservatives young and old, who turned around and walked backward to take selfies as she made her way toward the escalators. Were on Snapchat! a woman told her excitedly as she moved sideways, angling her camera at her face. Thank you for saving the world, a man said. Oh, Conway said, were just getting started. Backstage, she found her way to a television monitor that projected an image of the empty, gleaming stage where Sean Hannity would soon walk out to hype up the crowd that had assembled for a pre-tape of his Fox News show, telling them to text Mom and Dad and Grandma and Grandpa, because they might soon be visible on TV. Youre gonna have a rock-and-roll time and a lot of fun, he said. Kellyanne Conway is out there with us! At the mention of her name, screams and applause erupted so loudly that the stage seemed to vibrate, prompting her to throw her head back and curl her mouth into a broad grin, the glow of the monitor reflecting off her teeth. To her right stood Sebastian Gorka, a radical anti-Muslim activist and deputy assistant to the president who would also appear with Hannity (and who more recently has gotten into trouble for a reported affiliation with a Nazi group). Conway was wearing the same red-and-black cocktail dress shed modeled on Election Night, when she appeared onstage at the Midtown Hilton and beamed at the crowd, Bannon and Chris Christie beside her. When Trump was done delivering his victory speech, he had walked slowly away from the lectern, shaking hands and stiffly hugging members of his staff and family. When he arrived at Conway, she wrapped both her arms around his neck in an almost maternal embrace. The counselor to the president, Hannity said, winding up his introduction, and, might I add, the first woman in American history to ever be a campaign manager of a winning campaign! The crowd cheered, cutting him off, then broke into the sort of chant usually reserved for politicians, athletes, and musicians, not pollsters turned presidential advisers: KEL-LEE-ANN! KEL-LEE-ANN! KEL-LEE-ANN! Hannity took a seat across from her and joked, Whats new? Anything happening lately? After the interview (highlight: I have a lot of faith in the wisdom of the American people; they can go and pull information themselves), she snaked backstage and into the hallway by the greenroom, past a door labeled STARS ONLY. She was, she complained, cold and hungry  two things she says she frequently is. That news sent Cypher off, against Conways protests, looking for a cup of hot tea to solve at least one of the problems. Meanwhile, Ian B. Walters, a musician and the American Conservative Unions communications director, approached with his infant daughter, Violet, who was born the weekend of the Republican National Convention in July. Conway, whom Walters referred to as Aunt Kellyanne, squealed at the sight of the child, scooping her into her arms and cooing. With every flash of a camera in Conways direction, Violet squinted her little eyes helplessly. Remember what I said at the convention? she asked Violets father. She could be the first female president. The jobs still open! A young woman then interrupted, shaking and on the verge of tears. Its been my dream to meet you, honestly, she said. Aim higher, Conway said, laughing. Arriving at the CPAC cocktail party in the hotel penthouse, she was immediately surrounded again. Were so proud of you, a woman told her. I love your dress, another said. Thats so cute! Reds my favorite color. Conway told the woman shed worn it until early in the morning the day after the election  a night shes happy to revisit again. My phone rang at 2:30, she said. Huma Abedin! My husband took a picture of it. Im like, Hey, Huma! And she said, Hey, Kellyanne, hows it going? Im like, Its  going! Whats up? She laughed. She goes, Um, Secretary Clinton would like to speak to Mr. Trump. I said, Would that be now? She said, If hes available. Hes available! And I said to Mike Pence, I hope she concedes, because John Podesta had been on TV saying, Well see you tomorrow. Im like, Tomorrow? She turned to me. Screw the tea, she said with a smile. Im getting wine. Horrified critics of the president are often surprised to find that, in person, its very difficult to dislike Conway. With her airy voice and cheeky sense of humor, shes charming and magnetic almost in the manner of a particularly gifted retail politician, and without the alien creepiness that actually being a politician sometimes requires. Shes a chronic oversharer (one with top-secret security clearance) who will let you in on the most intimate details of her existence in casual conversation. Shes also pathologically social, her life a hamster wheel of meetings, briefings, appearances, interviews, events, and cocktail parties  something that separates her from someone like, say, Bannon. I have enough friends, Bannon told me. Im not doing this to have friends. I dont socialize a lot, I dont bring people into my life. This is like being in the Navy, this is like a duty. I dont enjoy this every day. This is not living; this is a kind of existence. Conway was definitely enjoying herself at Lupo Verde, an Italian restaurant on 14th and T, where she and Cypher found their way to a table I was sharing with a friend and sat down across from us. Id invited Conway on a whim and didnt expect her to show, so by the time she arrived with her entourage, the entre we had ordered to share, a steak, was sitting on the table. Conway gestured to the plate and asked if she could have some. Sure, we said, of course. She then reached her hand across the table and, rather than the steak, picked up the roughly seven-inch-long decorative scallion resting on top. Then she tilted her head back and put it in her mouth, like a sword swallower on Coney Island or a snake eating a mouse. About ten minutes later she remarked that she thought it was a piece of asparagus. Conways unusual unaffectedness may be explained by her childhood, which she spent in the small town of Atco, New Jersey, raised by her Italian mother, Diane; her grandmother, Antoinette; and two aunts, after her father, a truck driver, walked out. I didnt know, unless you had to clean the bowl, why you would ever lift the toilet seat up, she recalled. But even surrounded by strong women, identifying as a feminist didnt occur to her back then. She described her home as apolitical, defined more by patriotism and religion than talk of elections or the issues of the day. In the 1970s, it was very active on the college campuses, she said of feminism, and nobody in my family went on them. She did, however, idolize Mary Tyler Moore, whose show she watched every week. I just remember thinking Mary Tyler Moore was really cool, but not because anybody sat there and said, Shes a feminist! I just thought she was composed and stylish and had a big smile. She laughed. Now she would have to be, like, a brain surgeon at NASA whos vice-president of the United States on the side, adopting babies from faraway lands. When I suggested that Conway conflates feminism with misandry, the hatred of men, she said she didnt know the term. Shes careful to define her own brand of conservative feminism as softer and less anti-male and less pro-abortion than the feminism practiced by the women wearing pussy hats to protest the president. I dont object to other people marching at all  you know, my friends were there, she explained. But Id rather do than march; Id rather act than talk. Still, Conway, a pro-life advocate who spoke at the March for Life in Washington the week after the inauguration, says she would never judge a woman for getting an abortion and does not dispute, in an interview, my suggestion that she wouldnt want to see Roe v. Wade overturned. She is, she explained, sympathetic to any woman who makes the decision to terminate a pregnancy. Do I know anybody who ever got an abortion? Well, of course I do. Ive driven them there. Ive helped pay. (She later said she couldnt recall the exact details. She had been a teenager, she said.) You know, when youre young, youre thinking about the person, not the issue, she said. We were younger, and I was focused on her, not on the larger public policy. What she disagrees with is what she characterizes as the liberal position of wanting abortion to be accessible to anyone, anytime, anywhere. She added that one goal she has is to make us culturally  not politically  culturally more sensitive to the value of life. Watch: Kellyanne Conway Has Had a Lot to Say About Abortion Over the Years By the time she was in college, at Trinity-Washington University in D.C., Conway was interning for the late New York congressman and free-enterprise evangelist Jack Kemp, also a mentor to Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. Michael Caputo, who advised Trumps campaign for a time, told me he met the young woman then known as Kellyanne Fitzpatrick in Kemps congressional office. She was, he said, moving the molecules of the Republican Party, even in that minor job. Some people minded making the copies and getting the coffee, she told me. I always felt like, when I delivered the coffee, I had a question to ask to the person who was receiving it. Or a statement to make about something Id read in the Washington Post that day. And when I would fax something  I mean, thats what wed do back then  when wed fax something or copy something in 1987, I would read it and I would learn. She momentarily practiced law after graduating from George Washington, but soon gravitated toward polling. She worked for Frank Luntz, the public-opinion guru known for using dial tests to determine which specific words appeal more to voters, and, in 1995, recognizing that there was money to be made in advising corporations and politicians from a female perspective, she founded her own business, the Polling Company. But even though her focus was women, her client list skewed decidedly fringe, including hard-line anti-immigration groups long disdained by the Republican Establishment and the anti-Muslim extremist Frank Gaffney Jr. By the advent of the pundit-industrial complex in the late 1990s, she was already famous-for-Washington: quoted as an expert on the desires of the female electorate, profiled by JFK Jr.s George magazine, rumored to be romantically involved with the now-deceased senator from Tennessee Fred Thompson (something she told me was not true), and crassly dinged by Bill Kristols The Weekly Standard for being part of a new class of Washington-bred cigar-and-martini bimbos. Those were primarily Conway, Ann Coulter, Laura Ingraham, and Arianna Huffington (who was then a conservative). Being a liberal is no longer fashionable, Conway told the Atlantic Monthly in 1996, just before the impeachment mania that made partisan punditry so entertaining. It went out with bell-bottoms. Were never going to be Stepford Democrats. Most of us make Ayn Rand look like a leftist. Asked about that statement now, she looked embarrassed by her younger self. That comment is a bit nave and certainly inaccurate, she said, emphasizing that shes not a libertarian but a social conservative as well as a national-security conservative and an economic conservative  thats really what motivates me. Along with her contemporaries, she regularly appeared on cable and Bill Mahers Politically Incorrect. She was sort of everybodys favorite conservative at the time because she was wicked smart, very funny, and eminently reasonable, Bill Press, who co-hosted CNNs Crossfire, told me. She was the kind of pundit, he said, who would call a dumb idea a dumb idea regardless of which political party produced it. When I see her today, I just think, What happened? he said. Shes morphed into the dragon lady and says stuff which is just unbelievable. Shes certainly a different person today than I knew back then. Conway was surrounded by photogenic strivers, but unlike her peers, she didnt attain mainstream celebrity in the 90s. At one point, she told me, she arrived at a baby shower she was supposed to host with Huffington only to find that Huffington had fled town at the last minute to appear on television in Los Angeles. (A spokesperson for Huffington said this was untrue.) And as Coulter and Ingraham became niche starlets, too, Conway focused on her company and personal life. In 2001, Kellyanne Fitzpatrick became Kellyanne Conway when she married George T. Conway III, a lawyer whod represented Paula Jones in her case against then-President Bill Clinton (and who is now reportedly being considered to run the civil division of the Department of Justice); theyd been introduced by Coulter, who did a reading at their wedding. For most of the past decade, theyve lived in Alpine, New Jersey, a tony suburb on the edge of the Hudson River (where a string of hip-hop stars, including Sean Combs, Mary J. Blige, and Lil Kim, have also lived), with their four kids, including a set of fraternal twins, who now range in age from 7 to 12. When people come over, she joked, they either get really excited and want to have kids or its, like, the best birth control of your life, like, I am breaking up with my boyfriend right now! Hes not allowed to look at me! Since Election Day, Conways role as a give-no-ground professional woman and mother of four has made her a contested symbol of the state of sexism in American public life. The New York Times used criticism of her appearance  lobbed mostly from Twitter trolls  to declare misogyny a bipartisan exercise, while Jezebel wondered, What Do Feminists Owe Kellyanne Conway? In conversation  with women especially  shes happy to complain about her treatment, going down a list of what she perceives as sexist slights. Nobody would ever ask a father of four, How the hell are you gonna do this job? They would never. No one would ever ask my husband, Oh my God, you missed a birthday party? You missed honor-roll breakfast? They would never. But in other contexts, she uses motherhood to insulate herself from criticism. On Hannity, discussing the drop-off in the frequency of her TV appearances, she said, I dont think I have to explain myself if Im not gonna go on TV for a week if Im out with four kids for three days looking at houses and schools. A lot of my colleagues arent trying to figure out how to be a mother of four kids, I assure you. The crowd cheered in fervent understanding. What outrages many feminists on the left, of course, is her relationship with the president. Trump called her baby onstage at an inauguration ball, an incident that barely ranks in the collection of plainly sexist sins hes committed and that are now so well known that I dont need to repeat them here. But, according to Conway, her boss is the most surprising rejoinder to what I have found to be sexism in the Republican Party, adding that he is very pro-woman and protective of the women he knows. She herself has known him for years, since a 2006 condo-board fight at the Trump World Tower, where Conway and her husband lived. The board wanted to remove Trumps name from the building; George took the other side and was shortly thereafter offered a spot on the board, which Kellyanne assumed instead. But in the 2016 primaries, she found herself working for the super-PAC of Texas senator Ted Cruz, mostly thanks to the Mercers, who had been patrons to Cruz before getting behind Trump. She was a brutal surrogate for Cruz, calling Trump vulgar and unpresidential and repeatedly insisting that he release his tax returns. About that: We litigated this through the election, she says now. People dont care. Joining the Trump campaign, then, was a dramatic about-face  or it wouldve been, had Conway and Trump not shared so many qualities. Having cycled through his first campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, Trump was in the process of cycling through a second, the campaign chairman Paul Manafort, when Conway agreed to join Bannon to run the campaign in mid-August. At the time, there was talk of impending electoral disaster, particularly since Trump was struggling with the female electorate. The fact that she was a woman coming into that position was an added boost, Jason Miller, the campaigns communications director, told me. Bannon and Conway were not just kindred anti-Establishment spirits, they also had a kind of shared cause; since the 2012 election, Conway had grown increasingly focused on immigration, arguing that the divide between leadership Republicans and grassroots conservatives on the issue was crippling the party. Shes still the principal linkage for the grassroots, conservative base thats been around for a long time thats very different from this kind of populist, nationalist movement thats sprung up over the last couple of years, Bannon told me. And on the trail, with both of them in Trumps ear, things changed immediately. It really brought a whole new level of aggressiveness and focus on the media side, Miller remembered. Its a combination of being fearless and being smart, and connecting with the president at a personal level  they really like each other, thats obvious. Which created opportunities, like when she jumped in during debate prep to tell Trump that an answer a male adviser was suggesting he give on abortion was offensive. Soon after the release of the Access Hollywood tape in October, wherein Trump says he can grab women by the pussy and get away with it, because when youre a star, they let you do it, Trump was scheduled to be interviewed by ABC News David Muir. What he really wanted to do was to cancel the interview and head out to Fifth Avenue outside Trump Tower, where his supporters had accumulated in solidarity. The campaign was split about how to proceed, but Conway sided with Trump and, once hed decided, accompanied him downstairs. It was a pivotal moment in the campaign, one source said, and, whats more, a big inflection point for Trump, who realized he could get away with acting on his own instincts, even when that meant shivving the mainstream media and ignoring the advice of veteran politicos. And his campaign manager came out of the episode with her bond to Trump strengthened. Conway, Bannon told me, is Broadway Danny Rose  you know, that Woody Allen movie where he was the agent for every kind of vaudeville lounge act, and hed stick with these people forever? So what is Kellyanne Conways job, exactly? Shes the counselor to an uncounselable man, a spokeswoman for an administration whose message changes day to day, hour to hour. Almost exactly a month after our first interview, I found myself back in the West Wing, sitting across from Conway as she ate her lunch of eggplant Parmesan and steamed broccoli from the White House cafeteria. Asked to explain her unique role, she at first took offense at the question  suggesting that Kushner or Bannon would never be asked such a thing. Later, after our conversation had concluded, she asked me to return to her office so she could answer me more completely. After Election Day, she told me, she sat down with the president-elect to figure out what she wanted to do. If she joined him in the White House, she told him, shed support whatever it is you want me to support in the portfolio in addition to acting as a surrogate. If she remained on the outside, she said, shed work on behalf of his agenda through a political nonprofit group, television, and speeches. He knows I was offered life-changing amounts of money, she told me. What Trump asked her was Well, which one is more prestigious? And I said, Well, thats easy. Being in the White House is more prestigious. Besides, however Trump had phrased the proposition, she felt that she owed it to him. With the president holed up in the White House, separated from his wife and sons, and nostalgic for the energy and camaraderie of the campaign trail, Conways familiarity is a comfort. Shes often the only senior staffer wholl indulge his preference for fast food and even accompanied him after his joint-session address to Congress for burgers. And by all accounts, including Conways, he encourages and enjoys her television presence; hell make suggestions for shows she should do, topics she should broach. She is, after all, a compelling character  something Trump, who confoundingly remains an executive producer on Celebrity Apprentice, values. And its the acts of rhetorical contortionism she performs on his behalf that really demonstrate her value to the White House and mark its break from previous administrations: not just a tendency to spin, but a much more radical Overton-window exercise, by which the White House tries to move the terms of any particular debate by refusing to accept any of the medias premises at all. When Conway refuses to give in about crowd size, what shes doing is establishing the terms of future debate in the administration and casting some epistemological doubt on anything she is being asked about. There is an element of true-believer-ness in many of these confrontations, probably, but it also makes for exceptionally shrewd strategy, especially given how little the White House believes its real supporters trust Conways interlocutors rather than the voice of the Trump administration itself. Of course, to hear Conway tell it, nothing that nefarious is going on at all. She shrugs when asked about the inaccurate things shes said. The Bowling Green Massacre? She meant to say Bowling Green masterminds, she told me, referring to the would-be terrorists who were apprehended before they staged an attack. And alternative facts? Two plus two is four. Three plus one is four. Partly cloudy, partly sunny. Glass half full, glass half empty. Those are alternative facts, she said, further defining the infamous phrase as additional facts and alternative information. But Conway bristles when she feels public perception of her influence is confined to the idea that shes a mere mouthpiece. In conversation, she is eager to explain that shes in important meetings, important events, and privy to important information. In recent weeks, shes hired her own staff, including Cypher and a chief of staff, Rene Hudson, the wife of Richard Hudson, a Republican congressman from North Carolina, and focused her energies on broadening her portfolio  the list of projects and issues shell be most involved with, primarily as a messaging authority rather than a policy director (though in this administration, as in previous ones, those roles can get mixed up). Among her causes are the opioid epidemic, which has her collaborating with Christie; the GOP health-care plan, which shes been talking up on right-wing talk radio; and veterans issues. She told me shes even taken the lead on arranging opening-day pitches (at the Polling Company, she advised Major League Baseball) and the production of the Trump mannequin in Disney Worlds Hall of Presidents, which she said was her favorite as a child. Her office, now two months into the administration, is beginning to look more like a place of permanence, decorated by those photos of her kids that had once been in a duffel bag on the floor as well as photos of her with the president. There are even a few more computers on her desk. But her main job remains playing media foil, which can mean punching bag, and often results in Conway herself being the story. So be it. During the daily briefing on Tuesday, she sat off to the side of the press secretarys podium, writing in a notepad and looking up periodically  even winking at me once. Does the president believe that he was surveilled through microwaves and televisions? a reporter asked. I think theres pretty sound evidence that the microwave is not a sound way of surveilling someone, and I think that has been cleaned up. It was made in jest, so I think we can put that to rest, Spicer said. A smirk spread across Conways face. *This article appears in the March 20, 2017, issue of New York Magazine."}, {"date": "2017/03/17", "title": "Zut Alors: Bannons Taste for Franco-Fascists", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/zut-alors-bannons-taste-for-franco-fascists.html", "text": " In the background of the daily political grind, there has been a back-and-forth battle of narratives over Trumps senior strategist Stephen Bannon. The reason is pretty obvious: He (and his protgs in the White House) is the living link between Donald Trump and a netherworld of previously marginal people known as nationalists or populists or the alt-right. Trump supporters naturally want to mainstream Bannon, and his former bailiwick at Breitbart, as much as possible, while excluding entirely from the charmed circle of real influence the white-identity-politics types and open racists who are so present on social media and other gathering points for the moguls most avid fans. So its of more than passing interest when Bannon himself tells the story (via The Wall Street Journals Michael Bender) of his own radicalization. When financial markets collapsed in 2008, Bannon, then just your average investment banker with a taste for conspiracy theory filmmaking, watched helplessly as his elderly father authorized a panic sale of stock in the company he served for many years, AT&T. None of Bannon juniors Wall Street buddies went to jail for the betrayal of people like Bannon senior, and thus was born Stephen Bannon as a divisive political firebrand. Its a sad and heartwarming story. But a counter-narrative stubbornly keeps emerging of Bannons intellectual interests having as big an impact on his political thinking as that single incident in 2008. And two examples involve French writers from that countrys royalist and often racist authoritarian Right. First HuffPost unearthed multiple recent examples of Bannon favorably citing Jean Raspails 1973 novel, Le Camp Des Saints (The Camp of the Saints), as a prophecy for the crisis facing Western countries in the form of immigrants and refugees pouring in from non-developed, nonwhite, non-Christian countries. While it may or may not be fair to call Raspail a racist or a fascist (he rejects the label, but does confess to being a royalist), the whole thrust of his novel was to scorn the suicidal liberalism of modern Europe as compared to the healthier murderous impulses of self-respecting white Christians ranging from the crusaders to the Ku Klux Klan. And the books central presentation of Asian refugees as an existential threat to Western Civilization makes it a rather alarming source of inspiration for anyone close to actual power. It does, on the other hand, help explain the over-the-top obsession of Breitbart with refugee and immigration policy to this day. But it seems Bannons French quasi-fascist influences significantly predate Raspail. In a recent profile of the mans attitude toward Europe, Michael Crowley discovers a more exotic role model: As Pema Levy points out at Mother Jones, Crowleys description of Maurras omits a rather crucial issue: He and his Action Francaise organization were inveterate anti-Semites who proposed a classically fascist political and economic order. Those who, like me, have read Ernst Noltes classic study Three Faces of Fascism, think of Maurras as having pioneered many of the dogmas and practices later made catastrophically important by Mussolini and Hitler. And while Maurras was too much of a German-hating French nationalist to support Adolph Hitler, he did become an enthusiastic supporter of the Vichy regime after Frances defeat in World War II, and was subsequently imprisoned for collaboration with the Nazis. So at what point do Bannons rather disreputable influences become relevant to the advice he is offering Donald Trump? Thats hard to say. But as long as hes citing thinkers like Maurras, its going to be hard for him to disavow the white-nationalist label, or worse."}, {"date": "2017/03/17", "title": "Report: Fired U.S. Attorney Bharara Was Investigating Health Secretary Tom Price", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/report-bharara-was-investigating-tom-price-when-fired.html", "text": " Shortly after winning the presidency, Donald Trump met with U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara at Trump Tower. When Bharara left the meeting, he informed reporters that the president-elect had asked if he were willing to remain in his post, and that he had answered in the affirmative. Just under two months into Trumps presidency, the White House asked Bharara and 45 other U.S. Attorneys to resign. Bharara refused to tender his resignation. He was then fired. Bharara announced his unemployment on Twitter, and then posted this enigmatic remark: In 2013, New York governor Andrew Cuomo launched the Moreland Commission, to investigate corruption in the Empire States government. But the commissions investigation brought it too close to the governors office for Cuomos comfort, and he ordered it disbanded. Bhararas implication, then, was that his office was investigating something that the White House preferred to keep quiet. Its far from clear that there is a basis for Bhararas insinuation. It is standard for new presidents to replace U.S. Attorneys with their own appointees. However, Bhararas office was reportedly investigating Fox News for an array of potential crimes, including whether the networks executives committed wire fraud by allegedly hiding financial settlements paid to women who had accused Roger Ailes of sexual harassment. But Rupert Murdoch & Co. may not be the only Trump allies who stand to benefit from Bhararas dismissal: The former U.S. Attorney was overseeing an investigation of Health Secretary Tom Prices stock trades prior to his firing, according to a source who spoke with ProPublica. In December, the The Wall Street Journal reported that the former congressman had traded more than $300,000 worth of stock in health companies over a four-year period  during which he pushed legislation that could have benefited those companies. Since then, three of Prices trades have drawn heightened scrutiny: (1) In March 2016, Price bought $15,000 worth of stock in Zimmer Biomet, a medical-device company. Two days later, the congressman introduced a bill that would have protected that company from a cut in its Medicare reimbursement rate. Zimmer Biomet then put money in his campaign coffers. (2) That same month, Price purchased thousands of dollars worth of stock in six pharmaceutical companies  and then led a legislative and public-relations effort to defeat regulations that would have (almost certainly) hurt those companiess profits. (3) Last summer, Price made a bulk purchase of discounted shares in Innate Immuno, an Australian biotechnology company. Shortly thereafter, he helped push through legislation that expedites the FDAs approval process  a reform that directly benefits Innate Immuno, which is working to get its wares onto the U.S. market. Price has already enjoyed a 400 percent paper gain on his investment in the company. At his confirmation hearings, Price was asked about how he managed to get that discount on Innate Immunos shares. The congressman replied that the discounted shares were available to every single individual that was an investor at the time. Weeks later, The Wall Street Journal found that the cabinet nominee was one of fewer than 20 U.S. investors who were invited last year to buy discounted shares of the company  an opportunity that, for Mr. Price, arose from an invitation from a company director and fellow congressman. In January, Democratic Representative Louise Slaughter asked the SEC to investigate Prices trades, arguing that there was reason to suspect that he had violated the STOCK Act  a 2012 law that bars members of Congress from using nonpublic information for personal profit. The source who spoke with ProPublica did not specify precisely what trades  and potential legal violations  Bhararas office was investigating. Bhararas former deputy, Joon Kim, currently presides over the office.

It also weirdly contained some important files on Pope Francis, and, ironically, some details about the Hillary Clinton email investigation. Some sensitive documents were also stolen, reports CBS, along with the agents lapel pins that gave her access to details for the United Nations, Donald Trump, Clinton, and the pope, says CNN.

The Secret Service confirmed the laptop theft in a statement, saying the agent was a victim of a criminal act.

And so, when he burst onto the national scene, he positioned himself as an earnest, thoughtful policy wonk whose primary interest was in saving the country from a fiscal crisis. Subsequently, when the facts began to catch up to him, Ryan made a huge deal about his allegedly deep commitment to poverty, a messaging ploy that worked quite well.

Medicaid is a lifeline that gives ultra-cheap health insurance to the desperately poor and sick. Ryans plan to repeal and replace Obamacare would combine a huge tax cut for the rich with $370 billion in cuts to Medicaid. The latter figure might grow in order to placate ultra-right-wing members of the House who object to his plan because it does not eliminate all subsidies for people unable to afford their own insurance. And it was in the context of placating these far-right dissidents that Ryan abandoned his usual public-relations strategy and admitted that slashing the safety net is his lifelong dream. Meanwhile, Robert Woodson, a poverty activist who, like so many reporters, has been favorably impressed by Ryans doe-eyed apparent sincerity, tells McKay Coppins that he believes Ryans commitment to helping the poor despite his fervent efforts to pass a law hurting them: Give Woodson this much: Admitting I dont know much about this issue, but I believe Paul Ryan as a matter of religious faith is a pretty honest way to justify it."}, {"date": "2017/03/17", "title": "Trump: Being Wiretapped by Obama Is the One Thing Merkel and I Have in Common", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/trump-merkel-and-i-were-both-wiretapped-by-obama.html", "text": " During Angela Merkels visit to the White House Friday, President Trump refused to shake the German chancellors hand in front of a crowd of cameras. And then things got awkward. At a joint news conference following the leaders sit-down meeting (and handshake snafu), a German reporter asked Trump about his administrations recent spat with another major U.S. ally. On Thursday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer had suggested that Barack Obama ordered British spies to wiretap Donald Trumps phone, during the final month of the 2016 campaign. British spies were not pleased by this speculation. And on Friday morning, U.K. prime minister Theresa Mays official spokesman said that the Trump administration had promised never to make that allegation again. Are there other suspects, or do you think it was a mistake to blame British intelligence for this? the German reporter asked Trump Friday. As far as wiretapping, I guess, by this past administration, at least we have something in common, perhaps, Trump replied, gesturing to Merkel. Documents released by WikiLeaks in 2015 suggested that Americas National Security Agency (NSA) had tapped phone calls by the German chancellor and her closest advisers for years. There was a moment of silence, a confused look from Merkel, and then raucous laughter. Trump had accused Barack Obama of wiretapping his phones in a Saturday-morning tweet earlier this month. The president has since said that this allegation was based solely on media reports (which do not actually support his allegation) and that his tweets should not be taken literally. But he has also sworn by the truth of his claim  and is, reportedly, furious that the House and Senate Intelligence Committees have both said that there is no evidence to back up his (baseless) assertion. Trump did not defend the substance of his accusation on Friday afternoon. But he did defend Spicers slander of GCHQ. We said nothing. All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television, Trump said. That was a statement made by a very talented lawyer on Fox, so you shouldnt be talking to me, you should be talking to Fox. The very talented lawyer whom Sean Spicer quoted was Judge Andrew Napolitano  a conservative pundit who has said that 9/11 couldnt possibly have been done the way the government told us.

At the end of the day, Big Birds goose will not be cooked; Meals on Wheels will still roll; and the Pentagon may well have to get by with the mere half-trillion-dollars plus it was already slated to receive for the upcoming fiscal year. There are four reasons the Trump Budget is far less than meets the eye: 1. The Trump Budget isnt really a budget. Stan Collender explains: Why is this document so sparse?

And perhaps Collender is right that the whole thing is just a Trump campaign press release masquerading as a government document. But the likeliest reason for the massive omissions is that the administration is dealing with entitlements (at least those related to Obamacare) in the budget-reconciliation bill thats already well down the pike, and with taxes in a later reconciliation bill this spring or summer. This budget document deals with the leftovers, and was apparently motivated by the need to show which domestic discretionary programs would provide the savings for the big $54 billion defense increase Trump promised. As Mulvaney put it: So its about sending messages, not providing a real budget. 2. When it comes to discretionary spending, presidents propose but appropriators dispose. And appropriators dont like to cut. In the best of circumstances presidential budgets are recommended wish lists, particularly at the level of detail that involves individual programs and specific funding for them. The actual budget, to the extent there is any such thing, is the congressional budget resolution that sets out spending limits by category of programs. The real decisions for non-entitlement items, a.k.a. discretionary spending, are made via annual appropriations bills (lately big omnibus bills and temporary continuing resolutions, given the difficulty Congress has in passing the 13 individual bills they are supposed to enact). The Appropriations Committees that supervise spending at the programmatic level tend to attract, even among Republicans, lawmakers who like government spending or at least parceling out government spending. And they famously dont like zeroing out or eliminating funding. Like mama birds, they may have more or fewer worms available for any given meal, but they want to feed all the baby birds. That is why the Trump Budget has so many targets on its kill list that have been on Republican kill lists quite literally since the famous Reagan Budget of 1981. The chairmen of the various Appropriations subcommittees are often called the College of Cardinals. Like their Vatican counterparts, they dont like radical change. 3. Trumps proposed defense-budget hikes break the caps on spending imposed by Congress and Obama in 2011. Thats a no-no. If theres anything real in the Trump Budget, its the $54 billion shift in funding from nondefense to defense accounts. Unfortunately, thats $54 billion over the caps that the famous 2011 budget agreement between Congress and the Obama administration set up to limit spending for the foreseeable future. And that agreement is a matter of law, not custom or regulation, so the administration cannot just push it aside to shower more money on the Pentagon. It is enforced, moreover, by a process of automatic spending cuts for excess dollars called a sequester (or sequesture, as Donald Trump pronounces it). The only way around the sequester is to ask for money in emergency war appropriations, but thats a clumsy and politically perilous way to do it. And more importantly, all these appropriations measures are subject to Senate filibusters. Which leads us to the fourth reason the Trump Budget is an illusion: 4. You cant boost defense spending as much as Trump wants without Democratic votes. And Democrats will insist on more, not less, domestic discretionary spending. The only practical way to get a defense-spending increase that busts the caps set in 2011 yet avoids triggering a sequester is with Democratic votes. You can do anything with 60 Senate votes. But as happened in 2015 when Republicans (with support from the Obama administration) wanted to bust the defense cap, Democrats not surprisingly asked for a waiver of the caps limiting nondefense discretionary spending, too. And so they cut a deal. Nothing in that basic dynamic has changed: If Trump and congressional Republicans are serious about getting a waiver of the defense-spending cap, they wont be able to get it without the votes of Democrats who will insist on more, not less, of the spending that got hammered so notably in Mulvaneys toxic little document. And if Team Trump decides the Pentagon can do without all that extra money after all, then theres no reason to make all those domestic cuts to pay for it, right? Any way you look at it, OMBs drastic cuts aint happening, and in that respect as in others, the Trump Budget isnt remotely as terrifying as it purports to be. There is a whole separate line of questions that can be asked about why the new administration chose to rattle hobgoblins at all the supporters and beneficiaries of the programs it pretends it is going to kill. Maybe, as Mulvaneys own statement suggests, its all about conveying extreme hard-power masculine disdain for the squishy liberal priorities reflected in things like taking care of children and old folks. But the nursing homes and neonatal centers wont be emptied just yet."}, {"date": "2017/03/17", "title": "Trump Refuses to Shake Hands With Angela Merkel, and Its Very Awkward", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/trump-refuses-to-shake-hands-with-angela-merkel.html", "text": " President Donald Trump finally met with German chancellor Angela Merkel at the White House on Friday.

On Friday, Republican sources told Politico that the American Health Care Act (AHCA) will go the floor of the House next Thursday. That move came after President Trump huddled with a group of wary House conservatives, and (reportedly) endorsed three amendments to the bill  including a provision that would strip Medicaid from unemployed, able-bodied adults. Another amendment would give states the option to convert Medicaid from an entitlement program (which covers anyone who meets certain eligibility requirements) into a block grant (a fixed annual sum that does not rise or fall with the poverty rate). This would allow states to escape federal rules regarding eligibility and the benefits that Medicaid must provide to its enrollees (at the likely cost of lower funding). Finally, the new bill would prevent non-expansion states from expanding Medicaid during the expansion phaseout, according to Axios. These changes would almost certainly increase the number of Americans who lose access to health insurance due to the GOPs bill. In its current form, the Congressional Budget Office expects the AHCA to grow the ranks of the uninsured by 24 million. So, Trumpcare is now sufficiently cruel to garner 216 Republican votes in the House  or, at least, Paul Ryan thinks that it is. Still, unless the endgame here is to shift blame for Obamacare repeals failure away from Paul Ryan and onto Susan Collins, its hard to see how a more right-wing version of the AHCA passes the Senate. The aforementioned Maine senator is already a no vote on the bill, and other moderate Republican senators have demanded that the bill adopt more generous subsidies for low-income people. Meanwhile, the Republican governors of Ohio, Nevada, Michigan, and Arkansas jointly declared their opposition to the bill, in a letter to Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan Thursday. Like the Senate moderates, John Kasich and company want to preserve the increased level of federal funding that Obamacare provides Medicaid recipients  and, if cutbacks are needed, to limit eligibility rather than reducing reimbursements. In other words: The governors dont want Paul Ryan to take away the free money thats keeping their low-income residents insured and their hospitals paid. While governors, obviously, wont get a vote on the AHCA, Republican senators from expansion states are subject to similar pressures. And on Friday afternoon, Nevadas Dean Heller said he stands with his governor. Ohios Rob Portman and Arkansass Tom Cotton are among the many other Republican senators who have expressed reservations about the House bill."}, {"date": "2017/03/17", "title": "White Nationalist Richard Spencer Gets Federal Subsidies for Cotton Farm", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/white-nationalist-spencer-gets-federal-subsidies-for-farm.html", "text": " Richard Spencer runs the National Policy Institute, an anodyne name for a white-supremacist think tank.

But Kentucky GOP senator Rand Paul busted in and objected to McCains stance, stymying the vote. McCain was displeased. He has no justification for his objection to having a small nation be part of NATO that is under assault from the Russians. So I repeat again, McCain said, the senator from Kentucky is now working for Vladimir Putin. McCain punched first, accusing his colleague of being a foreign agent for an adversary at a time when that actually doesnt seem insane, but Rand Paul came right back at him with a personal attack. Well, I think he makes a really, really strong case for term limits, he responded Thursday on Morning Joe. I think hes past his prime, maybe hes gotten a little bit unhinged. Fight! This is not the first time the two senators, who are at completely opposite ends of the foreign-policy spectrum, have sparred. Here are some highlights: March 2013: Wacko birds.This animosity probably all began with the infamous wacko birds comment, which is how McCain described right-wing colleagues including Paul who were trying to block the confirmation of CIA director John Brennan over U.S. drone policy. You know, I think hes just on the wrong side of history, and on the wrong side of this argument, really, Paul said later, adding: I treat Sen. McCain with respect. I dont think I always get the same in return. September 2014: Dissembler or crackpot.The McCain-Paul war has involved proxies. Mark Salter, McCains former chief of staff, penned an op-ed in response to Pauls false claim that McCain had met with members of ISIS: A spokesman for Paul fired back: Mark Salter advised the Republican Party down a losing electoral path that paved the way for two terms of President Obama, so people should read his angry screed in that context and disregard it. April 2015: Obamas lapdog.While criticizing President Obamas foreign policy, Paul called McCain and his hawkish pal Lindsey Graham lapdogs who have been wrong about every policy issue over the last two decades. McCain later responded by barking to a reporter. I mean, cmon. And by calling Paul, on Fox News, the worst possible candidate of the 20 or so that are running on the most important issue which is national security. May 2015: Theres a new breed in the Senate.Paul successfully blocked an extension of the Patriot Act. McCain said: Theres a new breed in the Senate. Some time ago senators would try to sit down and work things out and obviously these individuals dont believe in that, and Im sure its a great revenue raiser. The [fundraising] emails are out now and they were out during the 11-hour performance a couple days ago, McCain added. Paul only said the veteran senator shouldnt question his sincerity. May 2015: The senator from Kentucky needs to learn the rules of the Senate.Paul opposed an extension of the Patriot Act that would have continued NSA surveillance, putting him in conflict with fellow Republicans. During a Senate debate, Paul tried to cut in as fellow Republican, Indiana senator Dan Coats spoke. Enter McCain. February 2017: I would say John McCains been wrong on just about everything over the past four decades.After McCain slammed President Trumps tweet calling the media the enemy of the American people, Paul criticized McCains criticism on ABCs This Week. Everything that he says about the president is colored by his own personal dispute hes got running with President Trump, and it should be taken with a grain of salt, because John McCains the guy whos advocated for war everywhere, he said. He would bankrupt the nation. Were very lucky John McCains not in charge, because I think wed be in perpetual war. Paul continued: I would say John McCains been wrong on just about everything over the last four decades. He advocated for the Iraq War, which I think destabilized the Middle East."}, {"date": "2017/03/17", "title": "NYPD Commissioner Says Trumps Budget Would Hobble Counterterrorism Efforts", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/nypd-says-trumps-budget-would-hobble-counterterror-effort.html", "text": " Mayor Bill de Blasio blasted President Trumps budget for undermining the lives of New Yorkers. Governor Andrew Cuomo described it as a wrecking ball. Based on initial estimates, the city stands to lose hundreds of millions in funding for public schools and public housing and even for phase two of the Second Avenue subway (which was supposed to be part of Trumps infrastructure plan). The proposal would also slash approximately $190 million in Homeland Security funding from the NYPDs budget, much of it coming from a chunk of nearly $667 million cut from FEMA and local Homeland Security grant programs nationwide. This funding is absolutely critical, NYPD Commissioner James ONeill said Thursday. It is the backbone of our entire counterterrorism apparatus. It is the cornerstone of preparedness and prevention against terrorist threats, and enables us to do what we can do to keep the city secure. The NYPD uses those grants for counterterrorism investments such as the departments bomb squad, dog training, intelligence analysis, active training, and equipment for radiological and chemical attacks, says the New York Daily News. The Department of Homeland Security, overall, gets an almost 7 percent boost under Trumps budget  most of which goes to building the big, beautiful border wall ($2.6 billion) and immigration enforcement. But cutting money from counterterror efforts in the nations cities doesnt exactly make sense for a president that says his responsibility is to keep America safe. Though New York City is also at risk of losing funding because of its sanctuary city status, its unlikely that these particular Homeland Security cuts will play with Congress, particularly New Yorks delegation. Long Island Republican Peter King already said any reduction to New York Citys funding is dead on arrival. Everyone who lives in, works in, and visits New York City, this moneys critical to keeping everybody safe, ONeill also said, about the funding. And speaking of, that includes Donald Trumps family. The NYPD spends a little more than $100,000 per day guarding Trump Tower when the First Lady and Barron are there, and about $300,000 when Trump is in town. This is as much for Trump as it is for everyone else in New York  by dint of the building being the commander-in-chiefs residence, it remains a terror target. And the federal government has only picked up $7 million of the nearly $25 million tab that the then-president-elect racked up before Inauguration Day.

Shes the professional referee who (among other duties) advises the Senate leadership about what can and cannot be included in the budget reconciliation bill that is being used by Republicans this year to repeal and replace Obamacare. The key issue is enforcement of the so-called Byrd Rule (named after the late Democratic senator and procedural stickler Robert Byrd), which creates a point of order against non-germane items in reconciliation bills  i.e., matters that do not directly produce fiscal consequences. Waiving that point of order requires 60 votes, which is the equivalent of allowing a filibuster. Since the whole point of using reconciliation is to avoid filibusters and pass legislation by a simple majority, senators will go to a lot of trouble to avoid Byrd Rule conflicts. Indeed, there is a procedure informally known as a Byrd bath where lawyers for both parties debate hypothetical provisions in the presence of the parliamentarian, and design their bills accordingly. All this arcane stuff matters a great deal right now because Paul Ryan and other GOP congressional leaders are citing Byrd Rule problems as the reason more of the Republican vision for health care isnt included in the American Health Care Act. More specifically, the repeal of Obamacare regulations involving minimum benefits and preexisting conditions exclusions are left alone, and such conservative policy fetishes as Health Savings Accounts, interstate insurance sales, and high-risk pools are left out, on grounds they might trigger a Byrd Rule point of order and screw everything up when the bill goes to the Senate. And that has a bad effect on the provisions that are left, as conservative health-policy wonk Philip Klein explains: So Republicans, and especially conservatives who hate anything that looks like a continuation of Obamacare, are stuck defending a bill they dont much like, and muttering vague promises about additional prongs of their repeal-and-replace initiative that fall outside reconciliation and sound a lot like well do it maana. Indeed, even AHCA could yet have Byrd Rule problems, despite Byrd bath simulations that guided its drafting. Ted Cruz, among other rebellious conservatives, has an answer, which he has been voicing repeatedly like Cato the Elder intoning Carthage must be destroyed. He expressed it most recently in a Wall Street Journal op-ed he signed along with House Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows: In other words, if AHCA fails to fully repeal and replace Obamacare to conservatives satisfaction, Cruz and Meadows will blame not just Paul Ryan or Elizabeth MacDonough, but the vice-president of the United States, and through him Donald Trump. The message is not subtle: Trump should tell his junior partner to let Senate Republicans do whatever the hell they want. The response, as Klein describes it, is the ever-popular floodgates argument: You have to figure Mitch McConnell, who reveres Senate traditions he has not chosen to disregard for partisan purposes, is the real leadership source for that argument. The real question is whether McConnell, Pence, and Ryan will wind up deciding the risk of gutting the filibuster is acceptable if the only alternative is the complete collapse of the Obamacare repeal-and-replace process, leading to angry red-state mobs inspiring a new tea party movement, and perhaps a fatal intra-party split. They could always spin the squashing of poor MacDonough as the Peoples Representatives stopping a power grab by an unelected bureaucrat who may well secretly watch Samantha Bee late at night. If nothing else, this approach could be a break glass in case of an emergency fallback if all else fails, as it certainly looks like it may."}, {"date": "2017/03/17", "title": "White House Angers Britain by Claiming Obama Used U.K. Spies to Wiretap Trump", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/white-house-angers-u-k-saying-obama-had-gchq-spy-on-trump.html", "text": " Two weeks ago, President Trump announced that Barack Obama had tapped his phones, during the final month of the 2016 presidential campaign. This claim was not based on conclusive intelligence, but, rather, on Trumps wild extrapolations from news reports he misread. That may sound like the snarky presumption of a liberal blogger. But it isnt. Its the presidents official story. Asked by Tucker Carlson how he came to discover that his predecessor had spied on him, Trump replied: The Times article that Trump cites  as his primary source  did have the words wiretapped data in its headline. But the story was about intelligence agencies monitoring Russian officials  and how, through that regular surveillance, they may have discovered contacts between those officials and Trump associates. The article says nothing about Trump Tower being surveilled, let alone about Obama wiretapping Donald Trump, himself. Notably, the president has previously described precisely this kind of article  a report by the failing New York Times, based on anonymous sources, insinuating a connection between Trump and Russia  as fake news that should not be believed. In that same interview with Carlson, Trump said that the word wiretap covers a lot of different things  a claim that makes little sense, given that the president repeatedly said his phones had been tapped. So, to review, the president says that his claim: (1) Was based solely on news reports (which do not support his claim). (2) Should not be interpreted literally. (3) Probably wasnt a mistake, although, if he makes one mistake in a month on Twitter, thats actually pretty good. On Thursday, the Senate Intelligence Committee joined the House Intelligence Committee in saying it had found no evidence to support Trumps claim. Considering that the president has (essentially) admitted that he doesnt have any evidence to support it either, youd think the White House would throw in the towel. After all, if were not supposed to take Trump literally, then, ostensibly, the president is merely accusing the Obama administration of investigating ties between his associates and Russia. This is probably true  but it is, also, a claim that the Trump administration has previously denied. In other words: The Trump administration doesnt want to admit that the president made a bad tweet. But it also doesnt want to admit that American intelligence agencies found cause to investigate ties between the president and Russia. And its hard to see how it can do both. But on Thursday, Sean Spicer found a way  and soured diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom, in the process. Three intelligence sources have informed Fox News that President Obama went outside the chain of command, the White House press secretary said Thursday, quoting Fox News commentator Judge Andrew Napolitano. He didnt use the NSA, he didnt use the CIA, he didnt use the FBI and he didnt use the Department of Justice. He used GCHQ. What is that? Its the initials for the British intelligence-finding agency. So, simply by having two people saying to them president needs transcripts of conversations involving candidate Trumps conversations, involving President-elect Trump, hes able to get it and theres no American fingerprints on this. Putting the published accounts and common sense together, this leads to a lot. Obama deputized the redcoats! Apparently, Spicer was so taken by how elegantly this reconciles the presidents contradictory claims, it didnt occur to him that accusing a core allys intelligence service of participating in the illegal surveillance of an American presidential candidate might not sit well with said ally. Recent allegations made by media commentator Judge Andrew Napolitano about GCHQ being asked to conduct wiretapping against the then president-elect are nonsense, GCHQ said in a rare public statement. They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored. The White House has promised the British government that it will not accuse its spies of wiretapping Donald Trump ever again, U.K. prime minister Theresa Mays official spokesman said Friday.

Liberals see him as a murderous autocrat and kleptocrat who hacked the election and might somehow be manipulating the president. Meanwhile, hes enjoyed a surge of popularity among GOP voters, thanks largely to Trumps consistent praise. But how does Putin look in his own country, where his approval ratings are sky high? What does he give Russians? What really motivates him? Whats his long game? Unfortunately, much American journalism has been content to give lazy answers or brush these questions aside altogether. Alexander Vershbow was the U.S. ambassador to Russia under George W. Bush from 2001 to 2005, and later an ambassador to South Korea and the deputy secretary general of NATO. Hes also been a student of Russian language, history, and culture since his teens. Vershbow believes that Putin still thinks in Cold War terms of spheres of influence and sees NATO enlargement in Eastern Europe as encroachment on a sphere that rightfully belongs to Russia. Below, Vershbow discusses possible Trump campaign ties to Putin, how Russia could influence elections in Western Europe, and how his vision for Russia is different from that of earlier Soviet leaders. How unusual is it for an ambassador to meet with members of different campaigns or of incoming administrations?Its not that unusual. One of the duties of any embassy in a foreign country is to report back to their capital on whats going on in politics, and the likely positions of different candidates, so in that sense Ambassador Kislyak was doing his job. There are more questions about what the Trump campaign representatives were trying to achieve in these contacts. Were they sending signals about future policies of the administration? That wouldnt be totally inappropriate either. Or was there something related to the hacking, to WikiLeaks, et cetera? That would raise serious questions. Clearly the Russians have many different agendas, but I dont think the ambassador is likely to be engaging in subversive activities. He has plenty of people on his staff who do that. I keep chuckling because Ive known Kislyak in many stages of my career, probably going back 25 years, and hes the last person I would label a superspy as hes being labeled in some of the media coverage. Hes a relatively low-key, self-effacing figure whos really an expert on security and arms control. Thats his passion: being a professional arms-controller and problem-solver. Its the administrations secretiveness thats leading to questions about possible collusion with the Russian hacking effort. Do we know there was any such collusion? No. But Im convinced that having either a 9/11-style commission or a bipartisan select committee would be appropriate, given that undermining our democratic system is a pretty big deal  a bigger deal than things that have been the subject of select committees in the past, like Benghazi. Assuming all the intelligence agencies are right that Russia meddled in the election, why do you think they would do so?It reflects a broader kind of hostility on the Russians part towards the West. It was brewing for some time, and I think it burst into full flower after Putin came back into the presidency in 2012. He became convinced that the Western strategy was a regime change vis--vis Russia. Thats his distorted version of history. He believes that even Gorbachev may have been an unwitting dupe of the West, but he certainly sees Yeltsin, and the whole experience of Russia in the 90s, as a period in which the West took advantage of Russia and tried to marginalize it as a global power. He and his fellow KGB veterans never viewed Gorbachev and Yeltsin as legitimate, and in a sense are restoring the status quo ante  but without the Marxist-Leninist ideology. Its the same kind of fervent Russian nationalism and the same defensive view of the relationship with the West  defensive and zero-sum. Why did Putin feel that way so much more strongly after he returned to power in 2012?I think the revolutions in Ukraine and Georgia in the mid-2000s convinced him that by supporting democracy and civil society, the West was in fact aimed at bringing about regime change and reorienting traditional Russian and Soviet neighbors towards the West. Fast-forward to 2008, when he saw Georgia trying to use force to recover territory that Russia had been occupying since the breakup of the Soviet Union. Again, he saw the West having instigated an effort to tear a country under Russias influence away from Russia. Then I think the big tipping point was the Arab Spring and the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi as the leader of Libya. He came back into office convinced that the West was once again on the march against Russian interests, and then when the demonstrations took place after his election, he claimed the protests were instigated, financed, orchestrated by the West, and the U.S. in particular. Thats why theres such animus against Hillary Clinton. He said at the time that she was the godmother of these protests, and I think he really believed it. What do you think the proper response to the hacking should be?The most important thing is to fully appreciate our vulnerabilities, and if not eliminate them, at least reduce them. Russia has proven that it can undermine confidence in our own institutions and traditions. Youve said that the prospect of Russia interfering in other European elections is one of the biggest and most immediate threats that we face this year. Could you elaborate on that?There are already patterns emerging in the behavior of RT, which has German service, and the Sputnik news agency, which is pumping out stories clearly aimed at boosting Kremlin-friendly candidates like Marine Le Pen in France and the Alternative fr Deutschland party in Germany, and trying to run down the more mainstream candidates. They seem to be gunning for Angela Merkel, because she has been the linchpin of the European unified response to the aggression against Ukraine. Shes kept the EU in line when it comes to renewing the sanctions every six months, and so I think theyre trying to undermine her. Theyre portraying her as out of touch with the people on migration issues, and theyre promoting messages similar to what we saw in Trumps campaign: about the dangers of migrants, crime, murder, violence being perpetrated by these thousands of Syrians and others who Merkel has imposed on us, that kind of stuff. Its not necessarily without some factual basis, but its playing to the disgruntled and to the dissatisfied, in identifying Merkel with their biggest grievances. Whether it will be decisive or just an irritating influence remains to be seen. The German election is not until September. Of course, the Russians also do this in smaller countries that are less noticed by the U.S.: countries where theyve historically had influence, like Bulgaria and Serbia and Moldova. Moldova recently elected a president who is very pro-Russia. Of course, they have very corrupt mainstream parties, so theres also popular rejection of the status quo in these kinds of countries. Russia is just one of many factors, but they dont seem at all inhibited from trying to do what they did in the U.S. in other places. Youre always saying, on Twitter and in interviews, that Western countries shouldnt forget Russia still has troops stationed in eastern Ukraine. Why do you think its so important to keep this in mind?Because it represents the biggest challenge to the whole European security order since the end of World War II. Allowing the Russians to get away with it only creates the likelihood that Putin will strike again somewhere else, perhaps against other vulnerable neighbors like Belarus or Kazakhstan, where there are also potential inter-ethnic disputes that could be exploited. The economic sanctions on Russia were imposed for a very specific reason: the things theyve done, including the aggression and the changing of Ukraines borders by force, have been ruled out by international law. The Russians have torn up the rule book, and its important that we not let them get away with it. It would be unfortunate if the new administration decided to basically trade Ukraine for the illusion of cooperation on fighting ISIS or something else, or even for the reality. If Russia wants to fight ISIS with us, good for them, lets do it, but we dont have to sell out Ukraine in order to get that kind of cooperation. Its often difficult, when youre going from American media, to get any sense of how Putins actions look to him or his supporters. What does he think hes doing in Ukraine? What does he want to achieve there?Hes trying to prevent Ukraine, in a broad sense, from joining the West but in particular, from joining NATO and the EU. Just as he was trying to prevent Georgia from joining the West in 2008. He was quite angry when, at NATOs 2008 summit in Bucharest, NATO said, We agree that Ukraine and Georgia will one day be members of NATO. Some people say it pushed him over the edge in attacking Georgia. The Russians have maintained a naval base in Crimea since the breakup of the Soviet Union. Putin was clearly worried that his lease on the Port of Sevastopol would be swept away by the popular revolt. He even said in his celebratory speech after the annexation, basically, If we hadnt done this, NATOs fleet would be in Sevastopol before you know it. It comes back to European integration, but NATO is sort of the bogeyman. That explains the motive for seizing Crimea, but what about other parts of eastern Ukraine where hes dispatched troops?He may have succumbed to delusions of grandeur. He really believed some of his own propaganda: that those people in Ukraine, who used Russian as their first language, wanted to be part of Russia, and that instigating an insurrection in some of these Russian-speaking areas would lead to a chain reaction, and all of Ukraine would fall apart and fall in his lap. Even though this whole project to stir up pro-Russian rebellions across the southern and eastern part of Ukraine failed, it was still a success for Putin by creating this smaller renegade state-within-a-state in eastern Ukraine. It keeps the country unstable for as long as Russia really wants to keep the pot boiling. That too prevents Ukraine from being an attractive candidate for NATO. Keeping at least eastern Ukraine in a state of semi-chaos is in and of itself an objective. Why is he so afraid of NATO enlargement?For Russians, its psychological. They lost their empire, the Warsaw Pact dissolved, and NATOs still there. Of course, now theyve reawakened NATO by what they did against Ukraine. NATOs now spending more. Were building up collective defense, and not just doing expeditionary operations in Afghanistan. Putin has created a self-fulfilling prophecy. NATO has more reason to be concerned about Russian military capability, which has substantially expanded and improved qualitatively after the Georgia war, when they discovered that their forces were really third-rate and had been under-maintained. Theyve been spending a fortune with new generations of everything from strategic nuclear missiles to new tanks, flamethrowers, air-to-air missiles, surface- and ship-to-shore missiles. Theyve got new everything, and now Trump is going to see them and raise them with the defense budget that hes about to announce. What do you see as the outlook for U.S.-Russian relations under Trump?As somebody whos worked on U.S.-Soviet and U.S.-Russian relations over the last 40 years, I can understand why Trump would want to try to improve the relationship and reduce tensions. At the same time, I worry that important principles could be sacrificed for the sake of a so-called reset in the relationship. Russia might be able to help in fighting ISIS, but their objectives in Syria have not been the same as U.S. objectives. Theyve been doing everything to preserve Assad and destroy all opposition to him, including the more moderate strands of opposition in Syria. On Ukraine, I hope that Trump will try to succeed where Obama failed, which would be to try to negotiate a durable political solution that gets the Russians to disengage from eastern Ukraine and reintegrates the occupied territories into the rest of the country. Putin claims he wants to do that, but the challenge is to come up with incentives. Obama wasnt able to do it. The Germans and the French have been unable to do it. Can Trump get a good deal for Ukraine? That would be great. I hope he tries, but the odds are not necessarily all that favorable. Have the sanctions produced any visible effect?I think theyve deterred Putin from going further. There were concerns in 2014 and early 2015 that he might try to recapture additional cities. Russias economy has clearly been affected. It had negative growth two years ago, and last year they were pretty close to zero growth. Part of that is because of lower oil prices, and part of it is because of failure to reform their economy. But the sanctions have been a factor. Theyve made Russia a reputational risk for Western investors, so theres an intangible effect as well. Putin clearly wants to get them lifted. Russian leaders have talked bravely about how Were becoming more self-sufficient, and we dont need the West, but sooner or later the Russian man on the street will get tired of nationalism and will want better food and a better standard of living. The Russians are actually eating less in the last three years. Theyre consuming 18 or 20 percent less food, because the sanctions are really cutting into peoples incomes. Putins still popular, but the famous, Its the economy, stupid, eventually will become applicable to Russia. What about Russias involvement in Syria? Do you see any upside? For instance, weakening the overall power strength of ISIS?I think the outcome remains to be seen. They clearly prevented Assad from falling, which was their main objective. That may make it much more difficult to ever get to a political solution thats consistent with the many U.N. resolutions that have been passed, all of which talk about a transition of power to a new leadership that would be representative of all the different elements in Syrian society. Now the Russians are basically saying, Assad isnt going anywhere. He isnt even going to be eased out over a transition period. If the U.S. and Turkey and other key players grudgingly agree, the question is whether the rebels will compromise and accept bit parts in a postwar Syria. Its hard to see that country ever being put back together again under stable governance. What do you think Putin wants for Russia 20 years from now? Whats his long-term vision?I think he does want Russia to permanently have at least a soft empire, involving long-term dominance over Ukraine and the other former Soviet republics, maybe even over the eastern flank of NATO. In this vision, the West pays deference to Russian interests to a far greater degree. I dont think he thinks of the future Russia as a powerhouse in science and medicine and aerospace exploration, all the things that the Soviet Union, with all its weaknesses, still aspired to do. He doesnt mind being a giant gas station in terms of the economy. Its more about just naked power than about achieving greatness through the achievements of Russian people. If I were writing a tweet on that, I would put sad at the end. Thats why theres huge brain drain. Most of the really innovative Russian inventors and scientists have emigrated to Europe or the U.S. Since these people tend to be renegades, the Russians say Good riddance, and that too is sad."}, {"date": "2017/03/17", "title": "EMT Killed in the Bronx After Man Steals Her Ambulance, Runs Her Over", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/fdny-emt-killed-after-man-steals-ambulance-runs-her-over.html", "text": " An FDNY emergency medical technician was killed in front of her partner on Thursday evening when a man stole her ambulance and ran her over. Yadira Arroyo, 44, was a mother of five and a 14-year FDNY veteran. Arroyo and her partner Monique Williams were responding to a call in the Bronx around 7:10 p.m. when passersby told them a man was riding on the rear bumper of their ambulance. When the EMTs exited the vehicle to confront him, he ran around them and got behind the wheel. They were acting very bravely. They certainly wanted to continue on their way to the call. This person had no business being in this ambulance, Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said. The EMTs tried to stop him, grabbing at the sides of the ambulance, but he threw the vehicle into reverse, fatally striking Arroyo and injuring Williams. He reversed so hard and she was dragged, said one witness. He ran over her and she went under the wheels. The man then drove up onto the sidewalk and crashed into parked cars on Watson Avenue. A K-9 officer and several bystanders prevented the man from fleeing. Video of the incident shows Williams wailing over her partner, then trying to kick the man before being pulled away. She was screaming, My partner, my partner! She was screaming hysterically. I cant forget her screaming, witness Nancy Montavo told the Daily News. All the police came running and they put her in an ambulance. The 25-year-old suspect is in custody but police havent identified him. A source told the Daily News he has a lengthy criminal record and was incoherent and talking to himself. Officials said Arroyo is the eighth member of the New York emergency medical services to be killed in the line of duty. An EMT was lost in the line of duty, bravely doing her job and encountering the kind of danger that our EMTs should not have to confront, said Mayor Bill de Blasio. They should not ever have to be subjected to violence, and yet that danger always exists for them."}, {"date": "2017/03/17", "title": "Hannity Said to Pull Gun on Co-worker; Claims It Was for Educational Purposes", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/hannity-gun-juan-williams.html", "text": " Weve been learning a lot about what happens behind the scenes at Fox News, and now we have a new fact to ponder during commercial breaks: Sometimes when the cameras stop rolling, co-workers whip out firearms. This is not in dispute, but a new feud has broken out between CNN and Fox News over how Sean Hannity showed off his gun to Fox News analyst Juan Williams. CNNs Dylan Byers reported on Thursday that the host aimed the gun at his guest back in October: Byers said Hannitys colleagues were so disturbed that they reported the incident to network executives. They said it went to Fox News co-president Bill Shine, a longtime friend of Hannitys, and nothing came of it. Fox News had a very different version of events. A spokesperson said the legal and human-resources departments looked into the incident but determined it was no big deal. Sean Hannity has been trained in firearm safety since he was 11 years old and has a license to carry a gun in five states, including New York, the network said in a statement. The situation was thoroughly investigated and it was found that no one was put in any danger. The network also released statements from Hannity and Williams. While discussing the issue of firearms, I showed my good friend Juan Williams my unloaded firearm in a professional and safe manner for educational purposes only, Hannitys statement read. Every precautionary procedure that I have been trained in since the age of 11 was followed. Ive had a concealed carry permit in five states for all of my adult life. Any other interpretation of this is outright false reporting. This incident is being sensationalized  everything was under total control throughout and I never felt like I was put in harms way, Williamss statement read. It was clear that Sean put my safety and security above all else and we continue to be great friends. Byerss larger argument was that Hannity loves a good fight, but so far Hannity has refrained from proving his point. He did call Byers a fake news hack, but considering that he frequently calls critics jackass on Twitter, he was fairly subdued: Hopefully the fight between Trumps favorite anchor and his most hated network wont distract the president from whatever Twitter feud he was planning to start this weekend."}, {"date": "2017/03/17", "title": "GOP Health Bill Is One Vote From Death After Senator Susan Collins Opposes It", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/susan-collins-no-gop-health-bill.html", "text": " The Republican health-care plan can only afford to lose two votes in the Senate, and with as many as 18 Republican senators expressing reservations about the bill, several GOP lawmakers have warned that it cant pass without serious modifications. They got some concrete evidence to back up their argument on Thursday night, when Senator Susan Collins of Maine said shes a firm no on the American Health Care Act. This is not a bill I could support in its current form, Collins told the Portland Press Herald. It really misses the mark. Senator Rand Paul has already said he wont vote for AHCA, and Senators Ted Cruz, Tom Cotton, and Mike Lee have been railing against the bill, though they havent said definitively that they wont support it. They say they oppose the bill because it isnt conservative enough, arguing that the governments role in the health-insurance market should be drastically reduced. House Speaker Paul Ryan and the Trump administration have even argued that getting more people covered was never the goal. Collinss announcement is particularly significant because she opposes the AHCA from the opposite end of the GOP spectrum. She told the Press Herald that shed like to see a system that improves Obamacare and gives more people health insurance. This bill doesnt come close to achieving the goal of allowing low-income seniors to purchase health insurance, Collins said. We dont want to in any way sacrifice coverage for people who need it the most. Older people living in rural America would be really left behind, Collins added. Her remarks come one day after President Trump acknowledged during a Fox News interview that the AHCA hits Republican voters the hardest  which, as Jonathan Chait noted, is an attack ad waiting to happen. While Collins is one of the most moderate Republican senators, many to her right balked at the Congressional Budget Offices forecast that 24 million people would lose their insurance under the AHCA. Conservatives who oppose the bill on ideological grounds have been most vocal, but the Republicans worried about its effects  who Vox has nicknamed the Coverage Caucus  may be an even greater threat: Speaker Ryan shifted his tune this week, acknowledging that the bill wont pass without significant changes. But its hard to imagine any AHCA modification that would bring these two sides together, since their views on the goal of health-care reform are diametrically imposed. Earlier on Thursday, The Hill reported that many GOP senators now hope the AHCA will die an early death in the House. Collinss hard no may make that more likely. While some House conservatives are eager to get their opposition to Obamacare on record, many centrist Republican representatives resent that theyre being forced into a controversial vote that stands no chance of passage in the Senate. If I hear the Senate say one more time that this bills dead on arrival, you know, my head will explode, moderate representative Charlie Dent told CNN."}, {"date": "2017/03/16", "title": "Steve King a Cautionary Tale in Iowa Debate Over Adopting Runoffs", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/steve-king-cautionary-tale-in-debate-over-adopting-runoffs.html", "text": " It seems that in Iowa, one argument for getting rid of a strange system for nominating candidates for office is that it once gave the world the career of Steve King. Yes, as the Des Moines Register reports, Democrats raised the specter of the widely controversial congressman from the western part of their state during an Iowa Senate debate over legislation to get rid of an arcane procedure whereby delegates to a party convention resolve nominations if no one received more than 35 percent of the vote. King, you see, first came to Congress in 2002 after winning one of those conventions. There really is not much to be gained by Republicans from saying anything about King at the moment. But while Iowa Senate Democrats may have had King in mind in voting to adopt a runoff system for nominations like 11 other states use, Republicans may have had more personal motives at hand.

On Thursday morning, the White Houses budget director Mick Mulvaney explained that these changes were inspired by one, simple question: Can we ask the taxpayer to pay for this? Heres what he said: When you start looking at places that we reduce spending, one of the questions we asked was, can we really continue to ask a coal miner in West Virginia or a single mom in Detroit to pay for these programs? The answer was no, Mulvaney told MSNBCs Morning Joe. We can ask them to pay for defense, and we will, but we cant ask them to continue to pay for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. This was a bizarre defense of the Trump budget for several reasons. To name just three: (1) The U.S. already spends more more on its military than China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, France, India, and Germany  combined. By contrast, America spends far less than its peers (per capita) on many of the initiatives that the Trumps budget cuts. (2) Trumps proposal cuts many programs that are more intuitively valuable to coal miners in West Virginia  and single mothers in Detroit  than a 10 percent increase in defense spending. The presidents budget cuts funding for early-childhood education, public housing, transit, food assistance, and job training  all programs that disproportionately benefit single mothers in cities with low median incomes. And it also abolishes the Appalachian Regional Commission and Rural Business-Cooperative Service, while shrinking the Labor Department  all moves that disadvantage coal miners. (3) If the White House feels bad about taking money from coal miners and single mothers, then why is one of its top priorities to pass an enormous, regressive tax cut? CNNs Jim Acosta asked Mulvaney to address some of the tensions in his argument at a White House press briefing Thursday afternoon. And heres what happened  Just to follow-up on that, you were talking about the steel worker in Ohio, coal worker in Pennsylvania, but they may have an elderly mother who depends on the Meals on Wheels program or who may have kids in Head Start, Acosta said. Yesterday, or the day before, you described this as a hard-power budget. Is it also a hard-hearted budget? No, I dont think so, Mulvaney replied. I think its probably one of the most compassionate things we can do. To cut programs that help the elderly and kids? Acosta asked, incredulously. Youre only focusing on half of the equation, right? Youre focusing on the recipients of the money. Were trying to focus on both the recipients of the money and the folks who give us the money in the first place, Mulvaney explained. And I think its fairly compassionate to go to them and say, Look, were not gonna ask you for your hard-earned money, anymore, single mother of two in Detroit  unless we can guarantee to you that that money is actually being used in a proper function. This is obscene. In addition to the cuts already mentioned, Trumps budget slashes rental assistance and home-energy aid to low-income families. His plan would almost certainly increase the rate of homelessness and malnutrition experienced by the children of single mothers in Detroit. Mulvaneys argument doesnt even make sense on its own terms. By itself, this budget has no impact on taxes  it just transfers federal spending from programs that directly benefit working families to ones that dont. And the Trump administration has expressed no interest in significantly cutting payroll or sales taxes, which make up the bulk of many a Detroit residents tax burden. On Thursday, the White House explained that the key distinction between the Defense department and the anti-poverty programs it wishes to cut is that the latter have failed to meet their objectives. Here is how Trump described the return on investment that the Pentagon has provided the American people, back when he was running for president. In light of this stellar record, increasing the rate of child homelessness to finance new weapons systems is one of the most compassionate things we can do. Just go to Detroit and ask a single mother."}, {"date": "2017/03/16", "title": "Heres the Proof No One Can Dodge an Interview Question Like Kellyanne Conway", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/kellyanne-conway-skillfully-dodges-interview-questions.html", "text": "  Dont worry.

The Budget Committee cleared the legislation narrowly despite three conservative Republican defections. Now it goes to the Rules Committee, where Speaker Paul Ryan will try to put together a managers amendment to fix the bill in ways that will get him over the threshold of 218 votes. That will be quite the task, since the key objections of Republican AHCA opponents (the Washington Post counted 37 GOP House members publicly expressing grave concerns as of yesterday) are all but mutually exclusive (some want a more generous bill, others think its far too generous already), and Ryan cannot lose more than 21 votes. Worse yet, he cannot perform some sort of con job on his members, since the Congressional Budget Office the very entity that exposed AHCAs problems earlier this week  will again score the amendment. With deadlines almost sure to slip, the prospect of this wretched legislation following GOP members of one or both chambers home for the long Easter recess grow higher each day. It is reasonably clear that Ryans obsessive goal now is to somehow get the bill through the House so that the whole steaming mess can be sent across the Capitol to the Senate, where the factional problems are even worse and the elephants are even less disciplined. That is why Republican senators, according to the Hill, are hoping the bill dies an early death: It is not a good sign when the internal party debate over must-pass legislation shifts from the hows and the wherefores to the apportionment of blame. And make no mistake, Republicans understand the base is going to be furious with them for what will look like the failure to pull off a one-car funeral: In understanding the consequences of this situation, it is important to recall that both the tea-party movement and the Trump uprising were fed heavily by the frustration of Republican voters with a party that could not find a way to impose its will on Barack Obama. Now they control the federal government entirely and still cannot repeal the hated health-care law they voted to kill 52 times when it did not matter. Yet the certain wrath they will thereby incur is not worse than voting for this woofer of a bill, it seems. And the only plan B most of them can imagine is to somehow fix the AHCAs many problems via a second bill that would require eight Democratic votes in the Senate along with every Republican. If there is a way out of this quagmire for Republicans, it is not obvious. Might their president somehow save them? Hardly: Its not like he commands that much personal loyalty in Congress, and the substantive dilemmas wont be resolved by turning them over to someone who probably does not begin to understand them. Its more likely that Donald Trump, with Stephen Bannon and other anti-Establishmentarians whispering in his ear, blames Ryan for the fiasco, or even backs a coup to get rid of him. But these are early days for that kind of speculation. First, Republicans in both the Legislative and Executive branches must play out the string and listen to the death agonies of a health-care plan with fewer friends than Christian Laettner at a Kentucky basketball banquet.

He promised to bring similar relief to the automobile factories of the Rust Belt, and construction firms throughout the nation. There is little evidence that he will make good on any of those pledges. But there is one long-suffering industry that the president has already done wonders for  the office-supplies business. The week before Trumps inauguration (and/or the Womens March) sales of poster boards, markers, pens, and other (protest) sign-making materials jumped more than 30 percent. Per Bloomberg: Trump may not be able to generate that kind of boom every week. But it wont be for lack of trying. Over his first two months in office, the president has done (virtually) everything in his power to sustain the protest-sign industrys boom times  from ordering a grotesquely cruel travel ban to egging protesters on with derogatory tweets.

This time, despite a major revision of the order to fix problems the courts found in the initial action, not one but two federal district judges, in two widely separated judicial circuits, have put it on hold. Worse yet, in both cases (Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii, and Judge Theodore Chuang in Maryland) the problem the judges identified was not something any revision could likely cure: It is the claim that the whole process is just a thinly veiled effort to implement a blatantly unconstitutional Muslim ban, as evidenced by Donald Trumps own proposals during the presidential campaign. So whats an America First president to do? The most prudent course of action might well be to forget about the temporary travel ban and move on as quickly as possible to the new system for vetting applicants for visas and for refugee status the ban was supposed to give the administration time to develop. Max Zapotsky explains: This approach, of course, would involve surrender to the so-called judges who have stood in Trumps way, so that is very unlikely, particularly after Trump devoted ten fiery minutes at a rally in Nashville last night attacking the judicial overreach and threatening to bring back the original, broader order. That idea probably occurred to Trump (or someone in TrumpLand) because in something of a coincidence the full Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decided yesterday not to vacate the earlier order on the first travel ban (issued by a three-judge panel) denying the administration a go-ahead on national-security grounds. In dissent, five judges said the courts should have deferred to the presidents national-security authority the first time around. So there is some conservative judicial support for that proposition, even on the liberal Ninth Circuit. But again: These were dissenters, and the odds are very low the full Ninth Circuit or any particular three-judge panel of same will reach that conclusion if and when the administration appeals Watsons ruling. In agreeing to make the revision, the White House was implicitly conceding it did some pretty sloppy work back in January. Though Trumps ego might want a total vindication, its not likely to succeed unless the Supreme Court intervenes on his behalf after some additional judicial setbacks. The more conventional approach would be to stick with the revision and instead go after the finding that Trumps (and Rudy Giulianis) comments on the campaign trail are relevant to what he is trying to do as president. At Lawfare this morning, Peter Margulies argues the administration will eventually prevail on that point. But it might take a while, and involve a long and winding road to the Supreme Court. Knocking down Watsons order will take the government through the obviously not very sympathetic Ninth Circuit. And even if they succeed, theres Chuangs order, which applies only to the visa application portions of the travel ban (because thats all the plaintiffs in the case were challenging). Overturning that order means going through the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. If the case does get to the Supreme Court, timing would be a big issue. For one thing, the Court is currently shorthanded. If, however, the administration waits to make its pitch for SCOTUS intervention until Trumps nominee Neil Gorsuch is confirmed, that could make for additional delay. Since the official position of the White House is that terrorists are likely pouring over the borders and into the airports every moment the travel ban is not in place, a posture of accepting delays doesnt make a lot of sense. What we are probably facing, then, is a murky and complicated schedule of legal maneuverings punctuated occasionally by judge-bashing explosions from the president of the United States. It may not be the smartest way for him to get his way, but for a man whose main fear in life seems to be the appearance of looking weak (his frequently expressed concern about the travel-ban delays), it may be the only way Donald Trump can handle it."}, {"date": "2017/03/16", "title": "6 Promises That President Trumps Budget Betrays", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/6-promises-that-president-trumps-budget-betrays.html", "text": " Say what you want about Donald Trump  youve gotta admit, hes doing what he said he would. Many people, including some of the presidents most fervent detractors, have expressed this sentiment since January 20. Which is odd, since it isnt really true. Granted, Trump has made a good-faith effort to implement his radical immigration agenda, despite the objections of many congressional Republicans and federal judges. And its true that his early gestures on the issues of foreign aid and policing are right in line with his campaign rhetoric. But Trump didnt just promise to crack down on immigrants and pretend police violence isnt a problem  he also vowed to provide health insurance to all Americans; raise taxes on hedge-fund managers; directly negotiate with drug companies over pharmaceutical prices; and maintain Medicaids current funding levels. And hes doing none of those things. Trumps selective memory about his past promises is on full display in his first official budget. This is the America First budget, Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney said of the document, on Thursday. In fact, we wrote it using the presidents own words. We went through his speeches. We went through articles that have been written about his policies  and we turned those policies into numbers. Some of the budgets numbers faithfully reflect the presidents words. Trumps call for a stronger military is well represented in a $54 billion increase to defense spending. His warnings about all the drugs and rapists that Mexico is sending over the border are affirmed by new appropriations for immigration enforcement and border-wall construction. And Trumps disinterest in climate change and international cooperation are expressed via giant cuts to the State Department and Environmental Protection Agency. But many of the presidents less reactionary  and more popular  promises are directly contradicted by his budget proposal. Here are six of the most conspicuous: (1) We will free the Earth from the miseries of disease. Trump touted this as a long-term ambition in his inauguration address. And he reiterated his commitment to encouraging the development of miracle cures in his speech to Congress. The National Institutes of Health supports most of Americas research into diseases and treatments  and Trumps plan would slash its funding by $5.8 billion, which is 20 percent of its current budget. (2) The government will stop wasting money overseas and rebuild our inner cities. Last October in Charlotte, Donald Trump detailed his vision for bringing urban renewal to Americas inner cities. The conditions in our inner cities today are unacceptable, Trump said, before lamenting that the United States had wasted $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East that have produced only more terrorism, more death, and more suffering  imagine if that money had been spent at home. Trumps budget funds its military buildup by, among other things, cutting $2 billion from public housing and$300 million from rental assistance, while abolishing the Community Development Block Grant program, which funds affordable housing, community recreation centers, and food assistance, among other things. The budget also cuts job-training programs, legal aid, and home energy subsidies to low-income Americans. Granted, its possible that when Trump said the conditions in our inner cities were unacceptable, he meant that Americas public housing is too well-maintained, its urban communities are too well-developed, its poor children are too well-fed, its poor families houses are too well-heated, and the rent (for low-income people) is too damn low. (3) We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation. Trumps budget cuts nearly $500 million from the Department of Transportations budget for road projects. (4) My administration will promote clean air and water. Trumps budget would abolish the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a popular, bipartisan program that preserves the health of the lakes that eight Midwestern states depend on. (5) The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. When Trump used this phrase in his inaugural address, he was referring to the working-class voters who came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before. These voters hailed, predominately from what costal elites (supposedly) disdain as flyover country  landlocked, rural, small towns. So, its remarkable how much of President Trumps agenda is devoted to making life worse for poor people in rural America. First, there was his health-care plan, which funds a massive tax cut for the rich by radically reducing health-insurance subsidies to low-income Americans  particularly those who live in rural areas. Trumps broader budget rains further pain on our nations forgotten men and women. The president proposes slashing $4.7 billion from the Department of Agriculture; cutting more than $500 million from Rural Development; eliminating the Rural Business-Cooperative Service; and abolishing the Appalachian Regional Commission, which promotes economic development and infrastructure in poor rural areas. Finally, the budget reduces much of rural America to literal flyover country: The proposal cuts subsidies to rural airports, which make it possible for commercial airliners to fly to low-population areas. Per the New York Times: To be fair, when Trump said that the forgotten people of this country will be forgotten no longer, he could have meant that his administration would remember to make their health-care more expensive, transportation less accessible, and communities less well-developed.

The epidemic was so concentrated for a while in a gay male subculture  often itself veiled by various closet doors  that straight people without gay family members or friends couldnt see it. There was blanket media coverage, of course. But in your everyday life, if you were straight, you could live quite easily in the 1990s without coming across someone with AIDS. While gay men were living in a medieval landscape of constant disease and death, many others carried on in safe, medical modernity, that elysian period in human history when most diseases can at least be treated, if not cured. It occurred to me reading this reported essay by Christopher Caldwell that the opioid epidemic is the new AIDS in this respect. Its toll in one demographic  mostly white, working-class, and rural  vastly outweighs its impact among urbanites. For many of us in the elite, its quite possible to live our daily lives and have no connection to this devastation. And yet its ever-increasing scope, as you travel a few hours into rural America, is jaw-dropping: 52,000 people died of drug overdoses in 2015. Thats more deaths than the peak year for AIDS, which was 51,000 in 1995, before it fell in the next two years. The bulk of todays human toll is related to opioid, heroin, and fentanyl abuse. And unlike AIDS in 1995, theres no reason to think the worst is now over. Caldwell notes that: These are the contemporary equivalents of the urban gay ghettos of the 1980s and 1990s. Within them, carnage is not an exaggeration: Sure enough, the last time U.S. life expectancy dropped was in 1993, because of AIDS. And this epidemic is dramatically escalating. Among men aged 2544, deaths from synthetic opioids like fentanyl more than doubled between 2014 and 2015. No year in the AIDS epidemic showed such a swift increase in mortality. There are major differences between the two health crises, of course, but none of them are very encouraging. AIDS was eventually overcome by innovation by pharmaceutical companies. The heroin epidemic is, in many ways, the creation of those very same companies, thanks to their cynical marketing of opioid products in the 1990s. Treatment for opioid abuse, much more complex than prescribing anti-HIV meds, can also be as deadly as the addiction itself. Many fatal overdoses occur among people who managed to get sober for a while, because their resistance had gone down  the Philip Seymour Hoffman scenario. But for me, the real parallel is the cultural isolation. This is a plague many of us who are cocooned in urban, prosperous bubbles can ignore if we want to. But, if we do, wed be mimicking the same indifference much of straight America exhibited toward gay men in the 1980s and early 1990s. A tiny minority of heroes  like J.D. Vance, author of Hillbilly Elegy  are moving back to the heartland to tackle the health emergency. But for most of us, the scale of this compounding tragedy is all too easy to ignore. Worse: Funds for AIDS research kept rising and rising through the 1990s. Today, the Trump administrations proposed cuts to Medicaid could drastically reduce treatment options in a spiraling crisis. Silence = Death, once again. But where, one wonders, is the ACT UP of the red states? How much can politics achieve? Your answer to that question, it seems to me, is a pretty good indicator of where you are on the right-left spectrum. One reason I still call myself a conservative (despite much probably deserved mockery) is that Im pretty skeptical of government as a solution to the core problems of being human. This doesnt make politics unnecessary: Au contraire. You have to do what you can  say, in protecting civil rights, or guaranteeing universal health care. But if politics is your path to happiness, it has its limits. In my own adult lifetime, to take an obvious example, politics has helped transform the environment for gay people. One reason I long believed in marriage equality was because I felt that the denial of marital rights both directly hurt gays, by denying them benefits and the like, and also did so indirectly  by culturally signaling that they were somehow less as human beings than straight people. Take those barriers away, and you could mitigate the pain of many, make the lives of gay kids and teens more bearable, help others handle stigma, even enlarge the scope of human happiness. And so Ive watched myself and others in the gay world shift and change as the atmosphere has been revolutionized. And yet: Gay people are still, depending on the study, between two and ten times more likely than straight people to take their own lives. Were twice as likely to have a major depressive episode. And just like the last epidemic we lived through, the trauma appears to be concentrated among men. In a survey of gay men who recently arrived in New York City, three-quarters suffered from anxiety or depression, abused drugs or alcohol or were having risky sex  or some combination of the three. This essay by Michael Hobbes is the best account Ive read that helps explain why this is still so: how the pressures of being out of the closet can be as intense as those being in it; how badly many gay men treat one another; how the disappearance of gay spaces and the proliferation of apps has intensified mutual objectification and a deeper sense of loneliness. The extraordinary suffering gay men once lived with  and still do in the vast majority of the world  is no longer. We can thank politics and culture for that. But the struggle of being a small minority, of being male, and of being human endures. Growing up gay and different, especially in our teens, will always be traumatic to a greater or lesser degree. Homophobia, especially in this demographic, will never disappear, as our sexualities blossom at the same time our need to belong and to conform intensifies. And so our psychological baggage, lightened perhaps, stays with us. Politics, we discover, cannot do the work of life. Only life can do the work of life. Some more thoughts about intersectionality as a religion. The first is that Im not the only person noticing the evolution of elite private colleges into de facto religious institutions. Jonathan Haidt decries a modern auto-da-fe here. Michael Rectenwald argues for re-secularizing the university here. William Deresiewicz in the American Scholar homes in on one key thinker in the entire matrix of social constructionism: The presiding presence is Michel Foucault, with his theories of power, discourse, and the social construction of the self, who plays the same role on the left as Marx once did. The fundamental questions that a college education ought to raise  questions of individual and collective virtue, of what it means to be a good person and a good community  are understood to have been settled. The assumption, on elite college campuses, is that we are already in full possession of the moral truth. This is a religious attitude. It is certainly not a scholarly or intellectual attitude. Ive always found Foucault a really interesting (if unpersuasive) thinker  as long as he is considered alongside countless other ways of understanding the world we live in. But if he is the default foundation of all thinking in a university, the university itself has been deconstructed. Stephen Carter fingers Herbert Marcuses theory of repressive tolerance as well. (How about we substitute the now tired term political correctness with the less euphemistic repressive tolerance?) Analytically, it makes sense to see how various inequalities are related  such as race and wealth. But an individual is so much more than a compounding sum of group identities. We dont just vary in racial or gender demographics. We have different individual genetics, upbringings, religions, levels of attractiveness, interests, ambitions, dumb luck, and on and on. Aspects of our personal identities that liberate us can be just as potent and revealing as those that oppress us. Its also a useful insight, it seems to me, to see intersectionality as responding to a practical problem on the social justice left: how to prevent each oppressed group fighting the others. If everything is connected, and if you cant separate out one oppressed identity from all the rest, then we have a chance for a truce: Everyone against white straight men! Theres something perfectly perverse about an anti-sexist and anti-racist movement agreeing on an enemy that is defined by sex and race. Whats also revealing is where the intolerance is strongest. Brookingss Richard Reeves and Dimitrios Halikias have crunched the numbers. The answer is: the most expensive colleges. Specifically: The average enrollee at a college where students have attempted to restrict free speech comes from a family with an annual income $32,000 higher than that of the average student in America. What you have here is an elite class paying for their kids to avoid ideas that might make them uncomfortable. Worse, as Deresiewicz explains: All of which is presciently foretold in Coming Apart, a book about soaring inequality and elite isolation  by the man, Charles Murray, the students refused to hear. And the beat goes on."}, {"date": "2017/03/16", "title": "Nazi-Affiliated Hungarian Group: Sebastian Gorka Swore a Loyalty Oath to Us", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/far-right-hungarian-group-gorka-swore-a-loyalty-oath-to-us.html", "text": " Sebastian Gorka, the special assistant to President Trump who calls himself a counterterrorism expert despite the consensus view of the national-security community that he isnt one, has had a rough month. His misadventures have ranged from presenting false Guantnamo Bay statistics on Fox & Friends to engaging in a crazy, secretly recorded phone-fight with a real terrorism expert to the revelation that he has long palled around with anti-Semitic groups in Hungary (Gorka was born in London but his parents are from Hungary and he has spent a lot of time there). Now, it turns out Gorka may have an even tighter connection than previously thought to the Hungarian far right. Writing in the Forward, which has been excellent at probing Gorkas Hungarian connections, Lili Bayer and Larry Cohler-Esses report that according to members of Vitzi Rend (Order of Vitz), a far-right Hungarian group with deep historical ties to the Nazis and to anti-Semitism, Gorka took a lifelong oath of loyalty to the group. This could help explain why Gorka was seen at President Trumps inaugural balls sporting a medal associated with Vitzi Rend founder Mikls Horthy, the virulently anti-Semitic World War IIera ruler of Hungary ([F]or all my life, I have been an anti-Semite, he once wrote) who cooperated with the Nazis, and why he reportedly signs his name with initials meant to signify membership in the group. At the time, Gorka told Breitbart the medal was meant to symbolize the Hungarian fights against communism and Nazism. And there was some ambiguity about the medals precise meaning: Hungarian scholars who spoke to TPM did not unanimously agree that the medal he wore on inauguration night could definitively be identified with Horthys Order of Vitz, reported Talking Points Memo in February. But they concurred that Gorkas regalia is popular today among Hungarys nationalist conservatives. If what the Vitzi Rend members told the Forward is true, though, this wasnt just a bit of (creepy) nationalist symbolism  rather, Gorka is a full-blown member of the organization. And that, Bayer and Cohler-Esses explain, would be a problem for the beleaguered self-appointed terrorism expert: The State Departments Foreign Affairs Manual specifies that members of the Vitzi Rend are presumed to be inadmissible to the country under the Immigration and Nationality Act. So if Gorka failed to disclose his membership in the group, a law professor and retired immigration judge told the Forward, it could cause him legal problems and even call his naturalized citizenship into question. Gorka didnt deny his membership in the group to the Forward, failing to respond to multiple emails sent to his work and personal accounts, asking whether he is a member of the Vitzi Rend and, if so, whether he disclosed this on his immigration application and on his application to be naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 2012. Now, its probably unlikely a top Trump adviser is going to be investigated in such a manner, let alone have his citizenship jeopardized. But this incident does add an interesting flavor to a sentence from Trumps first, defeated-in-court immigration executive order: In order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles.

Thats an appropriate take, and not just because the groups parent organization, the Heritage Foundation, has left fingerprints all over the proposal, hastily assembled by a less than complete OMB staff. It is, in many respects, a sort of greatest hits compilation of conservative prescriptions for paying for a big defense-spending increase with targeted and general cuts in nondefense discretionary programs  domestic spending that is not in one of the big entitlement programs. The fact that its all wrapped up in the bristling America First language of nationalist populism  with a few distinctive flourishes like a truly neanderthal attack on the State Department that takes one back to the McCarthy era  should not distract from the fact that this is a very conventionally conservative budget prepared by the very conventionally conservative OMB director Mick Mulvaney. Those who remember the budget wars of the Reagan era will find a lot of blasts from the past in the list of agencies and programs Mulvaney is proposing to shutter entirely: the Appalachian Regional Commission, Community Development Block Grants, the Economic Development Administration, the Legal Services Corporation, Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation  all were surviving targets of Reagans first budget in 1981. Other targets are products of the later culture wars: federal funding of the arts and culture would be basically eliminated, with the closure of the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Institute of Museum and Library Services, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. And still other programs Team Trump seeks to kill involve initiatives associated closely with Democratic presidents, such as the Corporation for National and Community Service (including Bill Clintons signature AmeriCorps program) and Barack Obamas various clean-energy and climate-change initiatives. Along with the individual constituencies affected, its reasonably clear state and local governments will be unhappy with the budget, as they have been unhappy with most Republican presidential budgets over the years. Again and again in Mulvaneys document you see reductions or eliminations of small grant programs justified as being things states and localities should pay for themselves. And thats aside from the big-ticket cuts like EPA grants and CDBG (the last significant source of general-purpose funding for local governments). Another notable and familiar feature of the budget is what you might call cannibalization: Within major agencies Trump priorities are funded by cuts in things his people dont know or care about. Thats how you wind up with an America First budget that hammers a variety of Department of Homeland Defense programs (including the Coast Guard, TSA, and FEMA) in order to shower money on the Wall and border control. It will be abundantly noted today that the Trump budget document is a strictly hortatory effort. When Reagan released his 1981 budget, his brilliant budget director, David Stockman, had already hatched plans to implement it using an obscure legislative vehicle called reconciliation, which enabled Republicans to get much of what they wanted in one huge bill that only required a majority vote. The GOP is again using reconciliation this year, but its being largely deployed to repeal and replace Obamacare (not very successfully at the moment, but thats another story) and then to cut taxes. (Reconciliation can only be used once per fiscal year; the GOP gets to use it twice this time because because Congress never passed a 2017 budget resolution last year.) So the Trump budgets fate will mostly fall to the Appropriations committees, those notoriously picky barons who tend to reject executive-branch dictation over their programs. Its appropriators and their staffs who are already out there declaring Mulvaneys handiwork dead on arrival. And thats probably okay with Team Trump, which seems to be using the whole budget exercise to send messages rather than to get anything done. Mulvaney in effect took off the green eyeshade of the budget wonk and put on his MAGA hat  maybe a military version in khaki  in describing the budget: Yep, its a Big League Conservative Budget Request, and like many others, it should be taken with a shaker of salt."}, {"date": "2017/03/16", "title": "Trump Health Secretary: States Should Only Require Vaccines If They Feel Like It", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/price-says-states-should-decide-on-vaccines.html", "text": " The realities of public health, much like those of climate change, bedevil American conservatism. It does this in a few different ways. One is that the logic of markets is ill-suited to the provision of health care. Medical treatment is not an ordinary good. People dont ever feel no need to buy new furniture one minute  then start coughing blood, and suddenly need $500,000 worth of couches to stave off death, the next. Nor is anyone born with a genetic condition that requires her to buy two iPhones a month to stay alive. But many people do find themselves in similar positions with regard to health care. If our society were willing to let all its least fortunate, non-millionaires die of easily treatable illnesses, then perhaps our health-care system could be reconciled with Ayn Rands ideal of individualism. But it isnt. Most Americans dont want to live in a country where ambulance drivers shake down severely ill people for cash before taking them to the hospital. Nor do they want to live in a place where poor kids with diabetes are left to die from hyperglycemia. And if youre not willing to do that, youre going to have to accept a little socialism. The rich and healthy are going to have to subsidize the poor and sick, whether we do this formally, through public policy, or not: When an uninsured person wracks up emergency-room bills she cant pay, that cost gets socialized through higher prices. The incompatibility of American conservatism and human biology is even more obvious when one considers the existence of infectious diseases. If your neighbor cant afford Netflix and falls behind on House of Cards, that wont threaten your childs life. But if he cant afford  or isnt willing  to vaccinate his kids, that will. American conservatives fondness for federalism runs into a similar problem: If the government of Pennsylvania decides that it isnt going to require its residents to vaccinate their school children against measles, that poses a threat for people living just across the border in Maryland. President Trumps Health secretary does not seem to recognize this problem. In an interview with CNN Wednesday night, Tom Price was asked, should it be required, measles, mumps, those kinds of immunizations? I believe its a perfectly appropriate role for the government, this happens by and large at the state-government level, because theyre the ones who have the public-health responsibility  to determine whether or not immunizations are required for a community population. On one level, Prices remarks can be read as a mere statement of fact. Currently, the power to mandate vaccines lies with state governments. But the federal government has the power to influence state decisions, through the policies of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And, at present, the CDC recommends requiring the vaccines Price was asked about. But when prompted to make that recommendation himself  when asked a normative question about whether such vaccines should be required  Price suggested it wasnt his place to tell state governments how to approach questions of public health. Granted, its possible Price wasnt showing deference to conservatives fondness for federalism. Rather, he may have merely been deferring to his bosss (baseless) suspicion that vaccines cause autism."}, {"date": "2017/03/16", "title": "Mayor de Blasio Will Not Face Charges in Fundraising Investigations", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/de-blasio-wont-face-charges-in-fundraising-investigations.html", "text": " Federal and state prosecutors said Thursday that Mayor Bill de Blasio will not face prosecution in separate nearly yearlong campaign-fundraising probes. The decision comes less than a week after the Trump administration fired U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara from his post. Bharara had overseen an investigation into allegations that de Blasio or his team had doled out preferential treatment to fundraisers in exchange for donations to his 2013 campaign or Campaign for One New York, the mayors now-closed nonprofit. In a brief statement, the acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Joon H. Kim, effectively cleared the mayor and his associates, saying that after careful deliberation given the totality of the circumstances here and absent additional evidence, we do not intend to bring federal criminal charges against the Mayor or those acting on his behalf relating to the fundraising efforts in question. The statement went on to point out that it is rare to discuss the status of a probe, but that prosecutors believe it appropriate in this case at this time, in order not to unduly influence the upcoming campaign and Mayoral election. The Manhattan district attorney also said Thursday that it was ending its investigation into whether the mayor had violated campaign-finance law by improperly channeling money to Democratic candidates in the 2014 New York State Senate race. Manhattan D.A. Cyrus Vance Jr., who had reportedly convened a grand jury on the matter last year, said pointedly that the mayor may have violated the Election Law but that this office has determined that the parties involved cannot be appropriately prosecuted. These coordinated announcements end months of intense scrutiny for de Blasio, who was himself grilled by the feds in a four-hour interview last month. It also removes, at least for now, the one wild card from the 2017 mayoral race, and makes it even less likely that a viable Democratic challenger will risk taking on the popular-enough mayor in a very safe city. De Blasio had firmly denied any wrongdoing in both the state and federal investigations from the outset. He told WNYCs Brian Lehrer that he and his aides acted appropriately, we acted lawfully, we cooperated from the very beginning. Of course we stayed both with the spirit and the letter of the law. A (probably much lighter) de Blasio is expected to formally brief reporters later, says NBC 4.

(Once Republican Senators indicated in early January they wouldnt support repeal-and-delay, forcing the party to draw up its own plan, the best chance to repeal the law was already gone.) If there was a moment when the final demise became assured, it was in Trumps interview last night with Tucker Carlson, when the president declined to mount even a perfunctory defense of the existing bill: Whether or not he realized it at the time, Trump was essentially filming an attack ad that could be used against any member of Congress who votes for the bill. The plan cuts taxes for the rich and lays waste to health-care access for the poor and middle class. Trumps response is, I know. He replies that the bill is very preliminary, and when told its not consistent with the message of his election, says, a lot of things arent consistent. Why would any Republican vote for a bill knowing they can be hit with an ad showing Trump admitting the plan harms their voters? Health care has risen to the top of Trumps vulnerabilities. A new Fox News poll shows that the public disapproves of his handling of health care by a 22-point margin. His allies have mounted an aggressive effort to shift the blame for this debacle from Trump to Paul Ryan. Hilariously, the pro-Trump spin depicts the president as a dupe for the wily House Speaker, and Trumps aides are trashing the bill in private. Of course, the lack of presidential support drives the chance that the bill can pass the House even lower. The Obamacare repeal debacle is already moving out of the how-a-bill-becomes-a-law stage and into the blame-shifting stage. The truth is that Ryan and Trump are both at fault. At one level, blaming Ryan for the legislations demise is absurd. Trump agreed to the process Ryan carried out, as well as to its substance. His administration collaborated on the design of the House bill and the legislative strategy. To be sure, Trump almost certainly lacks even the faintest grasp of the workings of the law he agreed to, but its hardly Paul Ryans fault that the president is a television junkie who cant read anything longer than a single large-type font page with a handful of bullet points. Ryan would not have produced a bill in the first place if Trump didnt authorize him to do it. It also isnt Ryans fault that the Republican Party has spent eight years making impossible promises on health care. Obamacare is unpopular with the public  or at least it was before it became threatened; now people like it  because most want generous care and insurance with transparent costs. Its unpopular with conservative ideologues for the exact opposite reason. Conservatives dont want the government to subsidize health care for people who cant afford it on their own. Republicans have attacked the law from the left (the premiums and deductibles are too high) while avoiding being pinned down on a specific plan that would reveal that their alternatives create higher premiums and higher deductibles. Liberals have been warning for years that the alternative Republican plan that could actually pass Congress was a mirage. There was no plan that could be both acceptable to conservative anti-government ideology and to the broader public. The dilemma Republicans find themselves in now  a plan that subsidizes too little coverage to be acceptable to vulnerable members, and too much coverage for the partys right wing  has always been unavoidable. Whoever had to write the first version of the Republican health-care bill that would have to be scored by the Congressional Budget Office and pass both chambers was given a task with impossible parameters. Ryan is being turned into the fall guy for eight years of lies that the entire Republican party, himself included, told the country and itself. However, Ryan does appear to be the mastermind behind the legislative sequence Trump has agreed to. The plan is rooted in Ryans obsessive quest to pass a huge tax cut for the rich that will be permanent. That strategy requires a series of difficult steps, which  if carried out correctly at every turn  will ultimately culminate in a massive tax cut that can be scored by the Congressional Budget Office as revenue-neutral after ten years, and thus avoid the arcane budgetary requirement that caused the Bush tax cuts to expire automatically after a decade. This intricate calculation, based on complying with the Senates budget rules, is the linchpin of the entire Republican legislative strategy. I explained Ryans plan a few weeks ago. The conclusion I drew is that its impossibly ambitious. Ryans plan has already gone horribly awry. His original scheme was to rush through a repeal of Obamacare with the replacement to come later, so that Congress could move on to tax cuts. When that couldnt pass the Senate, Congress was forced to pass a replacement for Obamacare on the fast-track schedule that was originally conceived for a simple repeal bill. Now they are bogged down in the impossibly complex work of reordering one-fifth of the economy on a schedule that was never designed to accommodate such a task. Ryans assumption that he could rush a simple repeal and delay plan through Congress turns out to be like the Wehrmacht invading Russia without bothering to pack winter clothing. Whats more, even if Obamacare repeal somehow survives and can pass Congress on something remotely like the original time frame, Ryans tax-reform plan is probably doomed anyway. It relies upon, among other things, finding a trillion dollars in revenue from a border-adjustment tax that divides his party and the business lobby against itself and raises taxes on the working class. If Republicans dont try to pass a revenue neutral tax cut, and just cut taxes like Bush did and accept that theyll expire after a decade, their task would grow immeasurably easier. They wouldnt need to repeal Obamacare first, because they wouldnt need to lower the tax-revenue baseline by eliminating Obamacares taxes. And they wouldnt need to pass a complicated and unpopular border adjustment tax. They would only need to hand out big tax cuts to rich people, which is something Republicans can all agree on. Yes, the tax cuts would only have a shelf life of ten years, but ten years of low taxes for rich people would still be a pretty big win for them. Trump has alluded to Ryans strategy multiple times. He always explains it by repeating the word statutorily, and consistently gives the impression that the strategy has been explained to him, and he has agreed to it without quite understanding why. For instance, he told Carlson last night: Trump has been persuaded that he has to repeal Obamacare first in order to have a gigantic tax cut. But that, again, relies on Ryans wildly complex and probably impossible plan to write a huge tax cut for the rich that wont expire. When Trump talks about the tax-cut plan, he describes it in a very different way than Ryan does. Ryan calls his idea tax reform, a nod to his notion that the revenue losses will be offset by higher revenue from other sources, at least on paper. Trump doesnt say that. He just calls it tax cutting. I want to get to taxes, I want to cut the hell out of taxes, Trump told his audience last night, But before I can do that  I would have loved to have put it first, Ill be honest  there is one more very important thing that we have to do: We are going to repeal and replace the horrible, disastrous Obamacare. Does Trump understand that he doesnt actually have to repeal Obamacare first? That he could just cut the hell out of the taxes for the next decade?"}, {"date": "2017/03/16", "title": "McDonalds Gets Political for 18 Minutes With Now-Deleted Anti-Trump Tweet", "url": "http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/03/mcdonalds-deletes-anti-trump-tweet-making-fun-of-his-hands.html", "text": " This morning, McDonalds, or at least whoever controls the companys Twitter account, shared some polarizing opinions about POTUS 44 and POTUS 45.

Just as they were beginning to adjust to the idea they had lost the culture wars and needed to reassess their apparently barren marriage with the Republican Party, along came Donald Trump, a politician who split their ranks decisively. Most old-school culture warriors fished right into the Trump phenomenon, even as more discerning souls like Douthat and Southern Baptist political spokesman Russell Moore strenuously objected. In the end, the man that Douthat calls a sybarite and heathen (using the terms not as an insult but as a precise description) won a higher percentage of conservative evangelical voters than actual conservative Christians like George W. Bush ever won. As a result, those who wondered if it was time for a retreat from a triumphant secular culture of the left are now wondering if a triumphant secular culture of the right is worth fleeing as well. That possibility is the subject of a new Douthat column that exhibits a signal lack of self-confidence. So, wonders Douthat, is the unexpected ascendancy of a Republican president backed by so many other conservative Christians grounds for reassessing the earlier call for withdrawal from secular causes, or the very opposite? It is certainly hard to ignore the change in national leadership and act like the left is still in charge: In the end Douthat argues for an intensification of religious life across the board as an appropriate response to an ambiguous situation, and again reaches out to progressive Christians: Coming from a writer who not long ago wrote an entire book arguing that the abandonment of traditional orthodox tenets on cultural matters like sex had doomed progressive Christians to irrelevancy and decline, this is quite an admission. But its another sign of the terrible self-doubts generated by Jerry Falwell Jr.s man in the White House: A chilling thought indeed for the Lenten season."}, {"date": "2017/03/16", "title": "How Trumpcare Would Affect Medicaid and Why Thats Dividing Republicans", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/trumpcare-offers-states-short-term-money-for-long-term-cuts.html", "text": " Much of the Republican factional infighting over the new American Health Care Act involves the proposals impact on the Medicaid program. And thats appropriate: For all the discussion of Obamacares exchanges for purchasing individual health-insurance policies, a majority of the roughly 20 million uninsured Americans who obtained coverage under the Affordable Care Act did so through the Medicaid program, which ACA expanded to cover working poor people without children or disabilities. Even though the Supreme Court made this Medicaid expansion optional, 31 states ultimately accepted it, some lured by very generous federal financial inducements that let them try out conservative policy experiments on the Medicaid population. So its worth some effort to understand how the new proposal affects the Medicaid expansion and the underlying program, and how that affects the politics of the repeal-and-replace effort. Ever since Obamacare became law, Republican politicians have been struggling with ways to reverse the expansion and pursue a long-standing goal of limiting federal responsibility for the low-income population served by Medicaid. However, they have been doing so over the objections of 13 Republican-governed states that chose to participate in ACAs Medicaid expansion. The GOPs new American Health Care Act appears to incorporate a decision to offer states short-term Medicaid money in exchange for sharp, permanent cuts down the road. Like most of the AHCAs provisions, its treatment of Medicaid may fall between two stools and satisfy no one. Four GOP senators (Shelly Moore Capito of West Virginia, Cory Gardner of Colorado, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Rob Portman of Ohio) representing Medicaid-expanding states were among the loudest voices complaining about the leaked February 10 draft of the House GOPs Obamacare replacement legislation, which would have simply killed the expansion after 2020. That language would have left the expansion states with a choice of abandoning millions of beneficiaries or covering them at the much lower pre-expansion match rate. So the actual bill tweaked the transition to let expansion states continue to get the super-match for new beneficiaries who signed up by the end of 2019  in effect a phase-down of the expansion instead of a phase-out (though in reality the tendency of Medicaid beneficiaries to cycle quickly and repeatedly in and out of coverage could mean a faster phase-down than one might imagine). But the bill retains a Medicaid reform feature that conservatives were promoting long before Obamacare was created: a per capita cap on how much the federal government will pay the states for each beneficiary. Unlike a block grant, which just limits the total amount states receive from Washington to cover all Medicaid beneficiaries, a cap will let states cover more people, but not expand the range of benefits or pay doctors and other providers at a higher rate. Because of vast differences between the states on benefit and reimbursement rates, there are huge variances in per capita expenditures between the states. In 2016, Georgia spent $4,245 per beneficiary, while Massachusetts spent $11,091. These inequities would likely be frozen in amber by a per capita cap. Over time, the AHCA is designed to ratchet down federal Medicaid spending as the generous federal inducements the expansion offered fade away, and states decide to do more for fewer people, or less for more people. Based on applying the AHCA formula to actual recent costs, the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities estimates the per capita cap would shift $370 billion in costs from the federal government to the states over ten years. And the shift could get much, much larger if the arbitrary allotments to the states created by the cap are lowered by future Congresses. Indeed, many conservatives have long viewed Medicaid reforms like a per capita cap as a way station to dumping the whole mess on the states  or better yet, private charities and individuals themselves once and for all. So the AHCA formula essentially exchanges short-term generosity to the states for long-term reforms that will hammer them. That should buy off current Republican governors while making conservatives happy, right? Not necessarily. GOP governors (e.g., Nevadas Brian Sandoval) are already beginning to complain the phase-down of funding for the Medicaid expansion will still throw a lot of people out of coverage, soon if not immediately. And nearly all the governors are alarmed by the absence of language in AHCA giving them the flexibility to use reduced funds as they wish to serve the eligible population. Meanwhile, some conservatives  especially from non-expansion states are angry that the Medicaid expansion is being accommodated at all, and according to some accounts Donald Trump is listening to them. And other commentators are noting that the interaction of the AHCAs Medicaid and private insurance provisions will actually produce immediate pressure on the states to expand Medicaid to avoid a big coverage loss from inadequate purchasing subsidies. As influential conservative health-policy expert Avik Roy argues, the AHCAs tax credits for individuals to buy health insurance are so small that the working poor will have a strong incentive to stay in Medicaid instead of entering the individual market, while the states will have a strong incentive to keep Medicaid as large as they can to avoid a big spike in the ranks of the uninsured. And that will infuriate those many conservatives who view big, permanent, and immediate changes to Medicaid as the shriveled booby prize they receive for having to abandon (or so it seems right now) their more avaricious dreams of entitlement reform in the Trump era. As in other aspects of health-care policy, on Medicaid the AHCA tries unsuccessfully to placate the various Republican factions. And any further tweaks are almost certain to increase one factions fury even if the lower anothers  particularly in the Senate, where losing just three of 52 Republicans will likely prove fatal to the entire enterprise."}, {"date": "2017/03/16", "title": "Trumps Budget Funds Military and Border Wall, Eliminates Dozens of Programs", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/trumps-budget-funds-military-eliminates-dozens-of-programs.html", "text": " The Trump administration has had a rough week, with a federal judge blocking the new travel ban, the GOP bickering over its health bill, and the House Intelligence Committee shooting down President Trumps wiretapping claim. The White House needs to change the subject, and their bold new budget plan is sure to do that  though Republican lawmakers are already saying it will never pass. Trump previously revealed that he would seek a $54 billion increase in defense spending, to be offset by major cuts to the State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency. Indeed, the Washington Post reports that the budget blueprint being unveiled on Thursday strips money from more than 18 agencies. The EPA is hit the hardest, with a funding cut of more than 30 percent; the Agriculture, Labor, and State departments would see reductions of more than 20 percent. Many smaller programs would be eliminated entirely, including the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, National Endowment for the Humanities, National Endowment for the Arts, and Legal Services Corporation. Aside from the Department of Defense, the agencies that benefit are Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security. The latter would see a $2.8 billion increase in funding, with much of it going toward the border wall with Mexico. The White House clearly wants to make a statement with the shockingly drastic budget  specifically, that the administration is powerful. There is no question that this is a hard-power budget  it is not a soft-power budget, said Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney told CNN. This is a hard-power budget and that was done intentionally. The president very clearly wants to send a message to our allies and our potential adversaries that this is a strong-power administration. The administrations budget isnt going to be the budget, said Senator Marco Rubio. We do the budget here. The administration makes recommendations, but Congress does budgets. But the proposal is short on details, and several lawmakers have dismissed it as unrealistic and contradictory. Republican senator Lindsey Graham has called the cuts to the State Department dead on arrival, and Democratic senator Patrick Leahy said the White House is only proposing the massive spending cuts because they know they wont make it through Congress. They know theyd be a disaster for their own party if they did. It makes for a great talking point.

With 95 percent of the vote counted, PVV is expected to finish second, taking 20 of the 150 seats in parliament. The Peoples Party for Freedom and Democracy, or VVD, came in first with 33 seats, which means Prime Minister Mark Rutte is likely to secure a third term.

The Dutch election was seen as a test of right-wing populisms hold over Europe. Far-right candidates appear to be gaining support in France and Germany, which will both hold elections later this year. The German governing coalition led by Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed the result on Twitter: French foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault tweeted, Congratulations to the Netherlands for halting the advance of the far right. But it wasnt all bad news for Wilders: His party is still expected to gain 5 seats, up from its current 15. Ruttes party lost a quarter of its seats, and its current coalition partner, the Labour Party (PvdA), dropped from 38 seats to a new low of 9. Several parties also shifted to the right during the election in an attempt to fend off Wilders. We are not a party that has lost, Wilders said, according to the Guardian. We gained seats. Thats a result to be proud of  and Rutte is certainly not rid of me yet. Dutch politics is now more fractured than ever, with 28 parties participating in the election. It may take Rutte months to form a new coalition, and its likely to be fragile.

The plan would hit older and rural Americans hardest because it wouldnt provide a larger tax credit to people with more expensive plans, the Times Upshot blog explained. The Congressional Budget Office also estimated that the American Health Care Act would reduce Medicaid spending by $880 billion, though Trump repeatedly promised no cuts to the program when battling his primary opponents, as the Washington Post noted. So while the AHCA may fulfill Trumps vow to destroy Obamacare immediately, it violates most of the other health-care promises he made to his voters  and theres no way to spin that as fake news. A recent Breitbart headline blared 7 Reasons Why Obamacare 2.0 Is All But Guaranteed to Impose Crushing Costs on Voters, Hurt Trumps Base, and Hand Power Back to the Democrats. Tucker Carlson raised this point with President Trump during a Fox News interview on Wednesday night. I know that, I know, the president said, as the host cited Bloombergs finding that Trump-supporting counties would be hammered. Its very preliminary. This isnt consistent with the message of the last election, Carlson said. No, a lot of things arent consistent, Trump acknowledged. But these are going to be negotiated. Weve got to go to the Senate. Were going to see what happens in the Senate. Now right now, we have five or six senators that look like maybe theyre not going to  Im talking about Republicans, because were not going to get one Democrat to vote for it. Trump repeatedly circled back to the point that Democrats wouldnt vote for the AHCA, calling them selfish and stupid. If this bill were perfect, if it was the greatest thing for Democrats and Republicans, we wouldnt get one Democrat vote, he claimed. That could be seen as laying the groundwork for the health-care backup plan Trump was reportedly talking about just last week: abandoning efforts to replace Obamacare, and blaming the Democrats once the health-care system collapses. It looks increasingly unlikely that the AHCA will pass in its current form. Were confident tonight that there are not the votes to modify this current bill to make it acceptable to conservatives and moderates alike, Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus, said on Wednesday night. Even Speaker Paul Ryan acknowledged on Wednesday that the bill wouldnt make it out of the House without significant changes. While he previously called AHCA a binary choice, now he says leaders will incorporate feedback from lawmakers. Now that we have our score, we can make some necessary improvements and refinements to the bill, he said. Trump hasnt abandoned the legislation just yet. He told Carlson hes acting as the arbitrator between different Republican factions, but the self-proclaimed expert dealmaker doesnt appear to be relishing that role. I want to get to taxes, I want to cut the hell out of taxes, Trump said during a rally in Nashville on Wednesday. But before I can do that  I would have loved to have put it first, Ill be honest  there is one more very important thing that we have to do: We are going to repeal and replace the horrible, disastrous Obamacare. Still, Trump suggested that he wont accept legislation that hurts Americans as much as the AHCA would, even if it means he could move on to other parts of his agenda.

In his decision granting the temporary restraining order, Federal District Judge Derrick Watson rejected the governments argument that the travel restrictions did not amount to a Muslim ban, and that only probing Trumps veiled psyche and secret motives would turn up evidence of religious discrimination. Watson agreed that its wrong to undertake a judicial psychoanalysis of a drafters heart of hearts, but he said he didnt have to. There is nothing veiled about this press release: Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States, the judge wrote. He continued: Basically, the Trump administration cant publicly declare again and again that they intend to find a way to legally discriminate against Muslims, then turn around and claim that the ban does no such thing. So, how did the president respond to this latest setback? By complaining that the current order is just a watered-down version of the original, more discriminatory order, and bringing up radical Islamic terrorists. Trump discussed the subject for about ten minutes during a rally in Nashville on Wednesday night. The ruling makes us look weak, Trump said, as the crowd booed. He called the Ninth Circuits decision unprecedented judicial overreach, and vowed to take the case all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary. You dont think this was done by a judge for political reasons? he said, sarcastically. No? The president also said he wanted to go back to the original order, and elaborated on who it was meant to target. The best way to keep foreign terrorists or, as some people would say, in certain instances, radical Islamic terrorists, from attacking our country is to stop them from entering our country in the first place, he said.

Federal District Judge Derrick Watson of Honolulu granted a temporary restraining order requested by the State of Hawaii to prevent implementation of the sections of the revised travel ban relating to refugees and new visas, due to go into effect tonight at midnight EDT. And he did so based on the one rationale all the changes in the original travel ban could not fix: that a full review of the ban would likely show it was a thinly veiled effort to impose the kind of Muslim ban that Donald Trump and key advisers advocated during the presidential campaign. A Muslim ban, Hawaii argued (and Watson agreed), would violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and its protection against religious discrimination. Heres the key language in the order: That consideration trumps, if you will, the national-security rationales the government has offered for the ban. It also makes all the revisions  aimed at dealing with other judicial objections to its earlier version  largely irrelevant. Two other federal judges, one in Maryland and the other in Washington State (the very Judge James Robart who put the original order on hold), held hearings on efforts to stop the travel ban today  but no matter how they rule, Watsons order puts a hold on everything. And in its wake, the Trump administration is going to have to come to grips with claims that the presidents anti-Muslim talk during the campaign wasnt mere innocent demagoguery: It has now fatally poisoned his efforts to restrict refugees and immigrants from Muslim countries.

Wilders, a far-right, anti-Islam figure who lives under 24/7 police protection, ran for prime minister as head of the Party for Freedom, or PVV, which he founded in 2006. The PVV has had a major impact during its short lifespan: As the Washington Post explained, It was the third-most-popular party in the Netherlands after the 2010 election, and it agreed to support the minority government. It remained the third-largest party after the 2012 election, although it did not support the government. Polls have suggested that it could win the largest share of votes in this years election. Polls also suggested a tight race for PM between Wilders and current prime minister Mark Rutte, of the Peoples Party for Freedom and Democracy, or VVD. But based on the first round of exit polling, the election was a setback for Wilders and the PVV. The AP reports that Wilders had an unexpectedly poor showing  finishing far behind Prime Minister Mark Rutte. Things werent much better for the PVV at the parliamentary level: The main exit poll showed Rutte controlling 31 seats, and three parties each winning 19  the pro-EU center party D66, the Christian Democrat CDA, and the Party for Freedom of anti-Islam nationalist Geert Wilders. This will be welcome news for anyone in favor of a strong EU, opposed to anti-Muslim policies, or both. Wilders, after all, has built a reputation as one of the most virulent anti-Muslim politicians in Europe. The BBCs 2010 article In quotes: Geert Wilders gives a sense of the sort of politician he is, and the sorts of beliefs he would have brought to his role as PM of the Netherlands. Islam is not a religion, its an ideology, the ideology of a retarded culture, he said at one point. I have a problem with Islamic tradition, culture, ideology. Not with Muslim people. On another occasion, he explained that the Koran is a fascist book which incites violence. That is why this book, just like [Adolf Hitlers] Mein Kampf, must be banned. In fact, Wilders has expressed a desire to ban all Islamic symbols, mosques, and the Koran from the country, as the Independent put it. Not surprisingly, there are links between Wilders and Steve Bannon, the head of the Trump administrations counter-jihad wing  the group of people, including Sebastian Gorka, who believe Islam is a threat to the world and buy into some of the more overheated conspiracy theories about it. When Bannon was executive editor at Breitbart, the site regularly ran opinion pieces by Wilders  Lets Lock the Door to Islam should give you an idea of their flavor. More broadly, theres ideological affinity between Bannon and Wilders stemming from their mutual dislike for the EU; another one of Wilderss Breitbart columns was headlined Britain Is the Brexit Pioneer and Others Will Follow. Bannon has exhibited a desire to help spread far-right, anti-EU nationalism across the European continent, and having Wilders as PM of an important EU state would have helped toward that goal. Now, as the Washington Post pointed out a few days ago, this election is about a lot more than just Wilders: The Netherlands has an increasingly complicated and fragmented political system, and its becoming harder and harder to form governments. The countrys far-right elements, meanwhile, arent going anywhere, and will remain an influential force. But still, Wilderss defeat will bring a sigh of relief from the many people worried about the current trajectory of the EU.

But the place that will most likely be described, accurately or not, as offering a referendum on the Trump presidency will be the Commonwealth of Virginia, which will elect a governor and other state constitutional officers, along with the lower house of its legislature, this November. That is partly because Virginia remains a relatively competitive state where the recent statewide Democratic advantage is small (and offset in Richmond by GOP majorities in both legislative chambers). But it is the proximity of the Washington Beltway political-media complex that guarantees the Old Dominion maximum coverage and quite possibly overemphasis. Virginia also has a rich tradition of offering good news to the party that has most recently lost a presidential election. Until Democrat Terry McAuliffe broke the streak with a narrow win over Republican Ken Cuccinelli in 2013, no candidate of the presidential party had won a Virginia gubernatorial race since the Nixon administration. Another Virginia distinction is that it is the last of what was once a robust list of states prohibiting governors from serving a second consecutive term. Since every governors race cannot be, by definition, a referendum on an incumbent running for reelection, its easier to blame or credit national trends for the results. Adding to the buzz Virginia will earn is the fact that the governors race will feature what look to be highly competitive primaries for both parties. Thats a bit of a surprise. Until recently, the contest to succeed McAuliffe looked to be a preordained showdown between T-Macs lieutenant governor, Ralph Northam, and former national and state GOP chairman Ed Gillespie. Northam was very much the candidate of McAuliffe and the state Democratic establishment (hes a veteran of the state senate), while Gillespie very nearly pulled off the upset of the cycle in 2014, coming within an eyelash of beating Senator Mark Warner. After Donald Trumps victory, Gillespies grip on the GOP nomination got a little slippery. Corey Stewart, chairman of the Board of Supervisors in exurban Prince William County and the new presidents one-time Virginia campaign manager, got into the race, immediately posturing as a hellfire Trump-style populist. (Stewart was actually fired by the Trump campaign during October of 2016 after embarrassing it by conducting a protest at the RNC for writing off Virginia. That hasnt cooled his ardor for the Boss and his message, though.) Sensing an opening for a candidate from the Hampton Roads region, State Senator Frank Wagner of Virginia Beach also got into the race, followed by Charlottesville distillery-owner Denver Riggleman, another Trumpian populist and a political neophyte. Virginia does not have a majority vote requirement for nominations, so Gillespie could well prevail with a plurality over divided opposition. The most recent poll, from Quinnipiac, taken in mid-February, unsurprisingly showed 59 percent undecided. Among the minority with a candidate preference, Gillespie led with 24 percent; Stewart had 7 percent, Wagner 5 percent, and Riggleman 2 percent. On the Democratic side, Northams cakewalk to the gubernatorial nomination was interrupted by former one-term congressman and Obama administration foreign-policy official Tom Perriello of Charlottesville. Perriello, who won a largely rural House district in 2008 in a big upset, was once a classic economic populist/social conservative pol, who voted against coverage of abortions under Obamacare and won an NRA endorsement for his unsuccessful reelection bid. Now hes very much the seamless-web progressive, and looks likely to be a magnet for Bernie Sanders supporters and others disgruntled with McAuliffe and other elements of the centrist state party. Northam has already sought to draw attention to Perriellos past cultural heresies, but hes got some orthodoxy problems, too, now that hes admitted he voted twice for George W. Bush (albeit as an apolitical physician back in the day). So far Perriello seems inclined to make national anti-Trump themes central to his candidacy, while Northam is following the ancient Virginia tradition of focusing on state issues. In the white-hot atmosphere of early 2017, its hard to know which approach will work better in the June 13 primary. Perriello did corner one local issue by coming out against two controversial natural-gas pipeline projects that Northam (and McAuliffe) support. But in the meantime, the reproductive-rights group NARAL endorsed Northam. Neither Northam nor Perriello is from the Democrat-rich regions of Northern Virginia or Richmond, so messaging, organization, and money are going to matter a lot. The mid-February Quinnipiac poll showed them tied at 19 percent, with 61 percent undecided. Barring an upset win on the Republican side by Stewart or Riggleman, which would definitely make the general election a referendum on Trump, the ultimate contest should be a fairly standard-brand center-left Democrat versus conventionally conservative Republican match, with Trumps relative popularity being a wild card no matter what. McAuliffe is reasonably but not overwhelmingly popular. Democrats have definitely built a consistent if occasionally marginal statewide coalition, winning the last four U.S. Senate races and carrying the state in three consecutive presidential elections (impressive since Democrats had lost the Commonwealth in every presidential election from 1968 through 2004). Feeding the Democratic trend has been demographics, with major population growth occurring in Northern Virginia with its many immigrants, federal employees, and contractors, and transplants from outside the South. As of the 2016 elections (according to the exit polls), 30 percent of the electorate were minorities, and 54 percent had college degrees. In terms of the kind of smaller, off-year electorate we can expect in November, it is significant that Clinton nearly matched Trump among white college graduates, those most likely to show up in non-presidential elections, while Trump won the more marginally participating white non-college graduates by a massive 71/24 margin. If this kind of education gap occurs in the Virginia governors race, particularly if white working-class voters stay home in significant numbers, a GOP win will be very difficult to produce. The closely divided (21 Republicans, 19 Democrats) Virginia Senate will not face the voters this year. The much bigger, gerrymander-aided GOP House majority (a 66-34 advantage over Democrats) will be on the ballot. Democratic gains may depend on whether the Donkey Party can stop leaving so many Republican incumbents (44 of 67 in 2015)  unopposed. All in all, Virginia is less of a probable blue paradise in 2017 than its off-year counterpart in New Jersey, where Chris Christies deep unpopularity is even more of a problem than Trumps issues. But the odds are good for a Democratic sweep of the top offices in both states  especially if the president becomes a millstone rather than a hot-air balloon for his party."}, {"date": "2017/03/15", "title": "Fed Raises Interest Rates As Quietly As Possible", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/fed-raises-interest-rates-as-quietly-as-possible.html", "text": " One of the terrible burdens of being the chair of the Federal Reserve Board is the knowledge that even the slightest indication of future interest-rate-setting intentions can have massive effects on markets near and far.

These nefarious implications led FBI Director James Comey to request that the Justice Department publicly reject Trumps claim. But the DOJ declined to do so. After word of Comeys request leaked, White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that the president didnt accept the FBI directors denial, explaining that he wants the truth to come out to the American people and he is asking that it be done through the House Intelligence Committee and that that be the process that we go through.

Now that hes attorney general, the 70-year-olds stance on marijuana has not softened, as he made clear on Wednesday in a speech to a group of law-enforcement officials in Virginia. After citing CDC overdose statistics, Sessions denounced the suggestion that medical marijuana could help fight heroin addiction. That would amount to addicts one life-wrecking dependency for another thats only slightly less awful, he said. Thats quite a statement, especially as heroin continues to ravage the country, with overdose deaths more than quadrupling since 2010. Sessionss comparison is particularly galling when you consider the evidence showing that medical marijuana reduces opiate-related overdoses. One 2014 study showed that states with legal weed have a lower rate of opioid overdoses than those without. In 2016, researchers found that doctors in those same states write fewer prescriptions for opiates, suggesting that the availability of marijuana to treat pain results in fewer opioid overdoses. Despite his clearly boneheaded opinion on marijuana, Sessions is at least conceding that his DOJ will not upend the marijuana enforcement guidelines laid out by the Obama administration in 2013. These guidelines tell prosecutors what to focus on related to marijuana and show states how to legalize it without interference from the feds. On Wednesday, Sessions said he thinks much of the memo is valid."}, {"date": "2017/03/15", "title": "Trumps Top Trade Adviser Tries to Sell Mexico On North America First", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/trumps-top-trade-adviser-pitches-north-america-first.html", "text": " Donald Trumps primary criticism of the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has been that it allows Mexico to kill us. Thus, as a candidate, Trump promised to renegotiate NAFTA to Mexicos detriment  and, ostensibly, to allow America to start killing the Mexicans (economically, speaking). This proposal suffered from the same problem that ailed Trumps plan to bill Mexico for his border wall: Why would the Mexican government consent to a policy that the American president has publicly described as a burden on the Mexican people? Even if you accept that trade negotiations are zero-sum games, it makes little sense to tell your adversary that you intend to screw them over. Especially when that adversary is a democratically elected politician who will need to sell any agreement to his or her electorate. So, it isnt too surprising that Trumps top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, plans to take a different approach to NAFTAs renegotiation. Navarro is one of the White Houses most committed protectionists  one who has vowed to repatriate the global supply chains that power the American economy. But even he doesnt seem anxious for a trade war with our immediate neighbors. Instead, Navarro has made a slight revision to Trumps trade philosophy, one thats bound to play better across a negotiating table from Canada and Mexico  North America first. Per Bloomberg: Under NAFTAs current rules, 62.5 percent of the value of a cars constituent parts must originate in the U.S., Canada, or Mexico, for that car to be sold in North America without an import tariff. The U.S. wants to raise that percentage, along with several similar thresholds that apply to other products. Navarro believes that these rules will allow the U.S. to reduce its $500 billion trade deficit, which he sees as a fundamental obstacle to economic growth. Other economists argue that Americas trade deficit is driven, primarily, by our low savings rate and our nations attractiveness to foreign capital. As Laurence Kotlikoff writes in Forbes: Still, Navarros view is not exclusive to a radical right-wing fringe, by any means. Progressive economists Dean Baker and Jared Bernstein (who served as chief economist and economic adviser to Vice-President Joe Biden) made the case for reducing the trade deficit in The Atlantic last December: Bottom line: It appears that the economic nationalist wing of the White House is pushing for stricter rules of origin, not a trade war with Mexico. And if thats the radical end of the Trump administrations internal debate about protectionism, then markets have little to fear. And, in fact, the Mexican and Canadian currencies both rallied, shortly after Navarros comments were published."}, {"date": "2017/03/15", "title": "The Pentagon Is Likely to Send 1,000 Ground Troops to Syria, Report Says", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/the-pentagon-is-likely-to-send-1-000-troops-to-syria.html", "text": " The U.S. ground presence in Syria is likely to increase by 1,000 troops in the next month, as the Pentagon ramps up U.S. military presence in the country ahead of a planned offensive on the ISIS capital in Raqqa, the Washington Post reports.

Theyd be called on to assist the Syrian Democratic Forces, an alliance of Kurds and Arabs fighting ISIS, with bomb disposal and air-defense coordination, among other things. These thousand or so conventional troops would join nearly 1,000 members of Special Operations forces already on the ground in the country. While none of these soldiers are in Syria to fight, the Posts reporting suggests that that could soon change as military leaders consider plans to embed U.S. forces alongside Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces, potentially pushing U.S. soldiers and Marines into a direct combat role. The plan to send the ground troops to Syria will coincide with the lifting of an Obama-era troop cap for the country.

In a move that will likely cripple part of President Obamas attempt to fight climate change, Trump announced a review of regulations requiring new cars and trucks to have an average fuel economy of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Adopted by the Obama administration in 2012, the fuel-economy targets were set for review in 2018. But seven days before Obama left office, in an apparent bid to lock the standards in place, thenEPA administrator Gina McCarthy finalized the rules, which environmentalists have praised because they would cut carbon emissions, reduce oil consumption, and promote technological innovation. Trump plans to revive the 2018 review and have his EPA and Transportation Department study the rules over the next year. In April 2018, the Trump administration will propose its new fuel economy standards, according to the Times. While the White House hasnt explicitly said that the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) targets are going to be gutted, the writings on the wall. Sean Spicer said Trumps trip to Michigan will involve discussion with auto executives on rolling back federal red tape and as those executives have made it known, the CAFE standards strike fear into their hearts. Last month, two groups representing automakers sent letters to EPA head Scott Pruitt asking for the standards to be reviewed. The standards would, they said, be too difficult to meet, raise vehicle prices, and depress profits for the car companies. So Trumps plan, according an anonymous White House official quoted by NPR, is to replace them with standards that are technologically feasible, economically feasible and allow the auto industry to grow and create jobs."}, {"date": "2017/03/15", "title": "The Reality of Climate Change Is Catching Up to the GOP", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/the-reality-of-climate-change-is-catching-up-to-the-gop.html", "text": " The science-fiction writer Phillip K.

You can even polarize the issue of environmental sustainability until rock-ribbed Republicans start thinking its their patriotic duty to roll coal. But none of that will keep rising tides from flooding the districts that your party represents. On Wednesday, 17 House Republicans testified to this truth, by signing onto a resolution affirming the reality of climate change and the dangers that it presents. The statement emphasizes the legislators commitment to economically viable, conservative solutions to the problem at hand. But, unlike the president, the lawmakers recognize that ignoring the problem is not a solution. In the statement, they pledge to study and address the causes and effects of measured changes to our global and regional climates and develop ways to balance human activities that fuel those changes. This issue was regrettably politicized some 20 or so years ago, and we are in the process of taking some of the politics out, reducing the noise, and focusing on the challenge and on the potential solutions, Florida congressman Carlos Curbelo told Reuters Wednesday. Curbelo represents Miami, where high tides routinely bring water to the streets. Two of other Republican co-sponsors hail from southern Florida. Others come from Western regions that have been adversly impacted by the decline of mountain snowpacks. And then theres arch-conservative Mark Sanford, whose concern for South Carolinas coastline seems to have brought him to accept climate science. The bill isnt going anywhere.

I was a couple of days from starting as incoming Secretary of State John Kerrys chief speechwriter, and was a couple of blocks from the building when I ran into two of the outgoing secretarys writers. In what felt like an informal, serendipitous changing-of-the-guard ceremony, my counterparts passed to their successor some well-earned wisdom: In diplomacy, every word matters. True, writers and pundits always feel this way, sometimes to a fault. But foreign policy amplifies the fussiness. One of Secretary Hillary Clintons speechwriters recalled the time when, in an otherwise innocuous list of countries, an ally took offense when its name came after anothers. The offended country had established diplomatic relations with the United States earlier; it just happened to come later in the alphabet. Legislatures codify their policy in laws and amendments. Courts issue opinions that set judicial precedent. Foreign policy is a more subtle art. Outside of a major treaty, diplomacy is rarely dictated by anything resembling legislation, rulings, or executive orders. Instead, diplomats words are their policies. And when policy isnt clearly defined by those speaking, it is divined, for better or worse, by those listening. Secretary Rex Tillersons unnerving silence as Americas chief diplomat reveals a corollary to the rule I was reminded about on 23rd Street: Every word you dont say speaks just as loudly as those you do. Tillerson has been less vocal and less forthcoming than his predecessors in his first weeks on the job  a defining period in any tenure, but especially in the tumultuous transition to Donald Trumps America. At home and abroad, citizens and stakeholders are straining their ears for clues about what our America First conversion will look like: What tangible changes should we brace for as we regress from the indispensable nation to an insulated one? How will the muscular bluster of the campaign and nationalism of this new era be realized in bilateral and multilateral relationships? Which of our core interests, like standing with our NATO allies, standing up for universal human rights, or even standing firm on a two-state solution, are now obsolete? Yet in an administration that is so loud in so many ways, our top emissary to the world has been so quiet. Tillerson was more deflective than reflective at his confirmation hearing. When he saw softballs as easy as whether America should condemn the terrorizing violence of Filipino strongman Rodrigo Duterte, Tillerson didnt swing at the pitch. When he spoke to State staff on his first day at the department, Tillerson told diplomats, who already lose sleep every night over their colleagues safety, that they should prioritize security, but failed to tell them why he believes its important that we secure strong relationships around the world. Tillerson still has not delivered a foundational maiden speech, as his predecessors did, that outlines for our citizens, allies, partners, and foes alike what the Trump-Tillerson doctrine might look like. This also means that when trying to understand how their new leaders value the role they play and sacrifices they make, the only thing our diplomats and development experts have to rely on is a dangerous and demoralizing budget that flippantly slashes foreign aid, harming Americas ability to alleviate poverty and instability and making it harder for diplomats to do their jobs and do them safely. Tillerson then broke from bipartisan tradition by declining to vocally support the departments annual Human Rights Report, which unnerved even Marco Rubio and signaled to dissidents around the world that America no longer believes in their courageous causes. The report is more than just another bureaucratic text waiting for its layer of dust. Secretaries of State dont often go behind the departments briefing-room podium; but they have stood there in recent years  followed by an on-record question-and-answer session from an assistant secretary  to bring additional attention to a fact-based evaluation of how our principles are practiced around the world. In his first year in Foggy Bottom, Kerry made a point of prioritizing his public support for the report even as the country and the secretary himself were consumed by the shock of the Boston Marathon bombings just days before. But this year, Tillerson couldnt be bothered. A senior official talked to reporters over the phone, but wouldnt be quoted by name. And prime opportunities to hold Dutertes feet to the fire, or answer newly relevant questions about Russian offenses, slipped away. Along with the proud backing of our top officials, the Human Rights Report from which Tillerson excused himself is an expression of our national conscience and a critical signal of the value we place on human dignity and government accountability. When asked about Tillersons silence, the anonymous official said that the report speaks for itself. It doesnt; the very fact that our senior-most voices are not afraid to publicly call out countries upon whose partnerships we depend is part of the power of Americas example  or at least, it used to be. From Stephen Bannons West Wing, America appears actively opposed not just to promoting these principles, but to the principles themselves. Last month, Tillersons team ejected journalists from his first public meeting with the Russian foreign minister in such a startling way that it gave the Russians a chance to lecture Americans on press freedom. And last week, after Tillerson had invited journalists to yet another public appearance, he ignored their questions on Russia and China. Now, as Tillerson leaves for his first major trip to Asia, he is leaving diplomatic correspondents on the tarmac. This is, again, more than a mere departure from precious protocol. As Ilan Goldenberg, a former State and Pentagon official who handled some of the most nuanced negotiations, has explained, allowing journalists to report honestly on these events contradicts propaganda from foreign state-run media  and in a country like China, their mere presence makes its own statement about our commitment to a free press. When Americas secretary of State comes to town with journalists in tow, it makes it harder for foreign leaders who avoid being challenged to escape public questioning. Its undeniable that diplomacy often happens best behind closed doors. But by the time those deliberations take place  to pursue peace in the Middle East, for example, or to stop Irans pursuit of a nuclear weapon  our nations values and corresponding objectives are usually well-established. After this recent American reset, though, we no longer can take that foundation for granted. That leaves our allies, including NATO nations and countries enduring constitutional crises like South Korea, worried about whether well still have their backs. It leaves our adversaries hopeful that we wont challenge them. It leaves an opening for someone like Xi Jinping to present China as the reasonable voice on globalization, global stability, and global climate change, as he tried to do at Davos. When the vice-president and secretary of Defense  but not the secretary of State  represent America at the Munich Security Conference, one of the most important annual gatherings on international security policy, it leaves the world with a striking impression: that we value diplomacy so much less than defense that our generals are the face of our foreign policy, and that Tillerson doesnt believe its worth his time to build relationships with his foreign-minister counterparts. After years of a clear American message, across administrations, our absence in the form of Tillersons silence implies we dont subscribe anymore to what used to be our core beliefs. That encourages people to bet against America and makes us weaker in the world. And it leaves massive opportunities on the table. If the secretary of State isnt engaging in public diplomacy, campaigning for our values and selling our ideals, who is? If Tillerson isnt moderating the more strident voices in Trumps White House, nations have no alternative but to assume the worst. And if our top diplomat isnt cultivating the trust and support of other nations populations, through town halls, public speeches, and open meetings with women, youth, and entrepreneurs, its that much harder to create the political space for Americas agenda to succeed on the world stage. Inside the walls of the State Department, the negative space Tillerson is creating has produced a low-grade sense of crisis among the nonpartisan patriots in the Foreign Service and civil service. Since Inauguration Day, they have too much empty time in their days and insufficient guidance to do their jobs well. Employees in Foggy Bottom report that theyre still getting periodic requests for information from department leadership, though its not always certain who is requesting it or how it will be used. They dont know whether their positions will be eliminated in a widely rumored  and reported  defunding and restructuring plot that seems to be taking shape in the White House. Even if their positions remain, they dont know if their resources will be cut by a budget the administration cant even discuss in a consistent voice. Tillerson isnt wrong to want a more efficient bureaucracy, but leaving tens of thousands of his charges stewing about their futures isnt an effective way to inspire good work. The continuity and perspective from our ambassadors, deputy secretaries, undersecretaries, and assistant secretaries of State, from whom State staffers and the general public might cobble a sense of this administrations priorities, are similarly missing because Trump has summarily dismissed many of them and disdained their institutional knowledge, yet neglected to nominate nearly all of their replacements. At the very least, a Senate confirmation hearing is an opportunity to air signals and reassurances; think of how many havent even happened. All of which makes Tillersons words that much weightier, and his silence that much more disappointing. For career employees who serve honorably under any administration, transitions in personnel, party, and policy are the norm; but as with everything else in the Trump administration, we have to recognize that our top diplomats failure to articulate his beliefs is not normal. Thats all the more important when we need our secretary of State to counterbalance his boss, whose simplistic worldview jibes poorly with the nuance necessary to conduct international relations. The diminished role of the most senior cabinet agency and its leader is not a Washington parlor game. When Tillersons supporters, like Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker, say the secretary doesnt mind people noticing his absence, theyre forgetting that the important thing isnt whether Tillersons feelings are bruised. Its whether our standing in the world is understood or undermined  including by our own citizens. During the campaign, then-candidate Trump spoke less about the power of our example than he did about the power of our unpredictability. What happened to the element of surprise? he asked during the final debate about counter-ISIS strategy. But as one concerned former national-security colleague recently put it, Our values arent a battle plan  theyre a statement of who we are. In other words, the principles for which we stand should be the last thing we keep secret. Because even when were not talking, the world still listens.

Last summer, the British Labour Partys working-class strongholds bucked their leadership and backed a Brexit campaign led by xenophobic nationalists. Months later, the Democratic Partys onetime bastions of union support delivered the presidency to Donald J. Trump. Recent elections in Denmark and Germany produced a similar pattern; in both countries, some working-class areas that once voted with the Social Democrats or the center-left embraced far-right populists who promised to stem the tide of (nonwhite) immigration. As the Dutch head to the polls today, the far-right Freedom Party candidate, Geert Wilders, has an outside shot at becoming prime minister. Some on the left see these developments as an indictment of economic centrism. By moderating on issues of corporate power  and, thus, failing to arrest the growth of inequality and the decline of middle-class stability  the Third Way Democrats and New Labour Party fertilized the soil from which right-wing nationalism grows: With their position on the economic ladder evermore insecure, white workers became more receptive to demagogues promising renewed prosperity  and/or to protect their pride of place on the racial hierarchy. In other words: A Trump vote is the language of the unheard. Thus, as Bernie Sanders argued shortly after Trumps victory, to regain power, the Democratic Party has got to stand with the working people of this country, feel their pain and take on the billionaire class, take on Wall Street, take on the drug companies. Voxs Zack Beauchamp thinks otherwise. In an essay titled, No easy answers: why left-wing economics is not the answer to right-wing populism, Beauchamp amasses a wealth of evidence against Sanderss theory of politics. Heres a quick summary of the case against Sandersism or barbarism: (1) Many nations in Western Europe are home to robust welfare states  and ascendent right-wing nationalist movements. In fact, some studies have found that the more generous a European countrys social safety net is, the more likely it is to have a strong, nativist political party. (2) Jeremy Corbyn applied Sanderss prescription to the British Labour Party, and it failed. Corbyn has spent the past year advocating for a radical left-wing agenda, and his party has only diminished in popularity  while Britains far-right UKIP Party improved its standing in public polls. (3) Far-right parties dont draw the bulk of their support from working-class voters, but, rather, from the petty bourgeoisie. Thus, the kind of voter whos attracted to the far right just doesnt care a whole lot about inequality and redistribution. (4) In last Novembers senate races in the Midwest, populist Democratic candidates Russ Feingold and Ted Strickland both polled behind Clinton  while the economic centrists Evan Bayh and Jason Kander ran ahead of her. (5) In the United States, the right has successfully linked redistributive economic policy with aid to undeserving minorities. Thus, moving left on economics could plausibly hurt the Democrats politically by reminding whites just how little they want their dollars to go to those people. These are points that every left-wing Democrat should take seriously. One can reasonably object to Beauchamps narrow definition of left-wing economics  by focusing exclusively on the welfare state, its possible he misses the political efficacy of left-wing labor market policies. But, regardless, his essay makes a persuasive case that Medicare for All is no silver bullet against the racial resentment that fuels the modern right (as Bernie Sanders sometimes seems to suggest). Still: Its hard to imagine what is. And Beauchamps piece offers little insight into that question. Heres the closest his essay ever comes to offering a (non-easy) answer to right-wing nationalism: Nothing in Beauchamps piece would give the reader any intuition of what, precisely, such a strategy would entail. In his account, the true drivers of right-wing populism are mass nonwhite immigration, white racial resentment, and, possibly, strong social safety nets that allow white voters to prioritize cultural concerns over economic ones. But Beauchamp maintains that the left should not embrace restrictive immigration policies, for reasons both moral and political. It seems doubtful that he believes the left should try to destroy (what remains of) the American social safety net, so as to coerce more white voters into prioritizing their economic concerns. And there is no obvious campaign strategy for blunting white racial resentment. But Beauchamps past writing on this subject suggests that he believes that some kind of direct confrontation with white racism is the proper political strategy for defeating right-wing populism. In an essay published in January, Beauchamp celebrated Canadas relative openness to accepting refugees, and credited this openness to its governments promotion of multicultural values: These measures seem worthy of the lefts attention. And, perhaps, when Democrats regain power, they should develop an analogous set of policies for the American context  and not assume that redistributive measures are sufficient for stifling right-wing populism. But Democrats cant go back in time and change the textbooks that Trump voters read in elementary school. So, its hard to see what implications Canadas example has for the Democratss electoral strategy in 2018 or 2020. Still, in his January essay, Beauchamp suggests that progressives can emulate the spirit of Ottowa  and defeat right-wing populism by confronting its ideology, head on. The forces of reaction, of ethno-racial supremacy, have been defeated in the past, and can be defeated again, Beauchamp wrote. The key to doing it is to refrain from surrendering on core values  to reaffirm Western societies basic commitment to tolerance and to craft policies that promote that commitment rather than back away from it. In his new essay, Beauchamp writes, if social democrats see their future as a competition for votes with right-wing populists, then they have two choices: Lose the election, or lose their progressive identity. Taken together, Beauchamps prescription for the Democratic Party appears to be: Make defending multiculturalism against Trumps bigotry the heart of your message; dont worry about winning over non-college-educated white Trump voters; and build a new majority by turning out nonwhites and appealing to moderate conservatives alienated by Trumpism. Which is to say: Run the same campaign that Hillary Clinton just lost. This isnt an unreasonable prescription. If it werent for James Comey, theres a good chance Clintons formula would have worked. But its hard to see how this strategy is any more empirically proven than the one Beauchamp devotes his essay to rebutting. After all, this gambit did just fail to defeat the most unpopular major-party nominee in modern American history. And in 2020 the Electoral College is still going to inflate the influence of non-college-educated white voters. Whats more, its hard to see how Beauchamps apparent prescription fits with with his own account of the problem. He cautions that calls for redistributive economic policies may backfire  because white voters associate such transfers with undeserving others. But then, he also seems to argue that Democrats should explicitly identify themselves with the interests of those others, by championing policies that promote tolerance and multiculturalism. Surely, if talking about universal health care activates white racial animus, campaigning on the virtues of multiculturalism does the same. One of last years most-celebrated works of political science, Democracy for Realists, speaks to this point. In their book, political scientists Larry Bartels and Christopher Achen argue that social identities drive voter behavior more than any other force: Outside of the intellectual elite, few voters have ideologically coherent political opinions and/or enough interest in politics to study which candidates positions are closest to their own. Thus, most cast their ballots for whomever they most identify with  which is to say, whomever seems to best represent people like them. But voters possess myriad social identities  they may simultaneously identify with a religious group, a line of work, an ethnic heritage, a socioeconomic background, and a gender, to name just a few. Thus, political campaigns often encourage voters to prioritize one of their identities over all others. Hillary Clinton made appeals to moderate Republican women  asking them to put their gender identity ahead of their partisan affiliation, and vote against her misogynist opponent. Trump, for his part, distanced himself from the Republican Party  and invited white, working-class Democrats in the Midwest to put their racial identity ahead of their partisan one. The latter tactic seems to have been effective. And that shouldnt be surprising: A large body of social-science research suggests that when white Americans are primed to contemplate their nations growing diversity, their racial identity comes to the fore  and they become markedly more sympathetic to right-wing politics. Heres how Achen and Bartels summarize the research: Despite Steve Bannons best efforts, America will continue to become less white over the next four years  even as the electorate, particularly in critical Electoral College states, will remain overwhelmingly light-skinned. It is difficult to see how emphasizing a defense of multiculturalism  to the exclusion of left-wing economic appeals  is the safe way for Democrats to compete on this terrain. Perhaps, the party should reject calls for a dramatic left-wing turn on fiscal issues, in deference to its growing reliance on affluent voters. But one core premise of Sanderss political theory  that Democrats should identify themselves with working people, and, thus, encourage lower-income whites to identify on the basis of class rather than race  seems as sound a road map back to the White House as any other. It is, after all, the one that Barack Obama followed in 2012: Obamas pitch to whites in the Midwest wasnt that America must reject Mitt Romneys bigotry  it was that Mitt Romney is the guy who fired all your dads. This week, the Roosevelt Institute produced fresh evidence that this appeal still has promise for Democrats in Trumps America. The liberal think tank conducted a focus group with 35 Democrats and independents who voted for Trump in Macomb County, Michigan. Heres what they found, per Voxs Jeff Stein: A recent survey of Obama-Trump swing voters  and traditional Democrats who stayed home on Election Day  by Priorities USA, turned up similar results: Its true, as Beauchamp notes, that right-wing populists draw more support from the petty bourgeoisie than from the working class. But its also true that Trump performed 16 points better among voters making under $30,000 in 2016 than Mitt Romney had in 2012, according to exit polls. This data point  along with the many Obama-Trump counties in the Midwest  suggest that working-class swing voters provided a significant portion of Trumps thin margins in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The fact that these voters arent the typical constituents for far-right populism only bolsters the notion that they may be persuadable. But even if one writes off Trumps marginal voters, a case for beating back right-wing nationalism with appeals to left-wing economics remains: Turnout among working-class voters, of all races, has been trending down for decades, and fell substantially in 2016. It makes intuitive sense that a stronger appeal to economic uplift might get some of these voters off the sidelines  and Priorities USAs findings offer (limited) empirical support for that view. Maybe Americas racial history makes it uniquely hostile to redistributive fiscal policy. But the Republican Partys brand of economic conservatism is also uniquely extreme, unpopular, and ill-equipped to meet the demands of our second Gilded Age  as the current fight over Obamacare repeal has amply illustrated. Put simply: The constituency for regressive tax cuts, reduced entitlement benefits, and Wall Street deregulation is vanishingly small. Given the GOPs vulnerability on these issues, it seems reasonable to believe that left-wing economic populism  broadly defined  is at least part of the solution to the problem of right-wing nationalism. To be sure, such a populism is no surefire antidote to the growth of white reactionary politics in a rapidly diversifying nation that was founded on white supremacy. But nothing is."}, {"date": "2017/03/15", "title": "Train Delays and Icy Platforms Are Making for a Miserable Commute in NYC", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/train-delays-and-ice-are-making-for-a-miserable-nyc-commute.html", "text": " A day after New York City was blanketed in a slushy mixture of rain, sleet and ice, giving much of the city a snow day, the MTA is making people wish theyd stayed home again.

Moments later, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs appeared, cast as an embodiment of the global elite that has robbed our working class. During his primary campaign, Trump suggested that Ted Cruz was a tool of Goldman, on the sole basis that his wife worked for the firm. And, of course, he savaged Hillary Clinton for delivering paid speeches to the Wall Street bank. On Tuesday, the president nominated a fifth Goldman alum to a top position in his administration. Jim Donovan spent nearly a quarter-century at the great vampire squid, and was working as managing director of the banks private wealth division, when Trump offered him the new gig at Goldmans D.C. branch. The White House has already employed Goldman alums Steve Mnuchin at Treasury Secretary; Steve Bannon as chief White House strategist; Gary Cohn as director of the National Economic Council; and Dina Powell, as senior counselor for economic initiatives. At Treasury, Donovan would work with Mnuchin on implementing Trumps economic agenda, including his proposed reforms (a.k.a. regressive cuts) to the corporate- and income-tax codes. The financial industry is relieved by Donovans nomination, which had initially been resisted by some in the West Wing, according to Politico. Donovan was a fundraiser for Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush, and is seen as an opponent of the trade protection and economic nationalism favored by Bannon and Trumps National Trade Council head Peter Navarro."}, {"date": "2017/03/15", "title": "Health-Care Mess Could Screw Up Everything GOP Is Trying to Do This Year", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/health-care-mess-could-be-fatal-to-gop-legislative-blitz.html", "text": " The current mess in which the GOP finds itself concerning the long-discussed but imperfectly planned repeal and replacement of Obamacare is a big deal by any measure, considering the real-life stakes and the many promises Republicans, from Donald Trump to the lowliest House member, have made to rid a suffering nation of this modern form of slavery as quickly as possible. But there are broader implications as well. Action on health care was supposed to be the first (and easiest!) of an audacious series of actions the trifecta-winning GOP would take in this calendar year to erase the Obama legacy and send the country down a decisively conservative path. As you may recall, the idea was that Republicans would use a budget resolution for the current fiscal year to repeal Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood, the two priorities so high for conservatives that many of them were willing to shut down the federal government over them. With that out of the way, and the budget baseline set with lower deficits (real or imagined), the table would be set for a second budget resolution  this one next fiscal year  that would massively cut taxes and perhaps reduce entitlement spending (though one entitlement, Medicaid, might well be hammered in the first bill). And finally, perhaps between the first two bills and perhaps later, Republicans would use the appropriations process to boost defense spending and slash nondefense discretionary programs, especially those benefiting the poor folks who dont tend to vote Republican. It was obvious all along that timing and momentum would be critical to this kind of legislative blitzkrieg, complemented by an executive-order program that would kill Obama priorities legislation couldnt quite reach quickly enough. And thats why the train wreck over health-care policy endangers everything Republicans are trying to do. They are too far down the road to that first budget bill to turn back. But any scenario to resolve the internal differences among Republicans, which are magnified by House and Senate conflicts, would take time and might lose crucial votes. And the ultimate fallback plan involving Democratic votes and some sort of health-care fix that will be viewed as betrayal by conservatives, would take even longer and create even more political problems down the road. To mention just one bit of collateral damage from a perpetually delayed or bipartisan health-care bill: It would almost certainly involve shifting nonnegotiable conservative demands for the defunding of Planned Parenthood to the appropriations arena, where a Democratic filibuster and ultimately a government shutdown could ensue. And that could represent the death of the impression that a triumphant GOP is bending Washington to its will. Republicans have planned all along to follow up on the Obamacare repeal-and-replace legislation with a second health-care bill that takes care of things that cannot be done in a budget bill, like the revocation of regulations and such new nonfiscal provisions as interstate health insurance sales. The idea is that after Obamacare was dealt with, Democrats might well go along with such provisions in order to improve the system  not an unimportant asset since such legislation would require 60 Senate votes. Without the Obamacare repeal and replacement, Democrats might see no need for helping the GOP with this chore. And since the American Health Care Act includes more than $800 billion in tax cuts and well more than a trillion dollars in budget cuts, a stalled or abandoned bill would add that much more pressure to the amount of tax and budget cuts that would have to be accommodated in the second, FY 2018 budget resolution and reconciliation bill  and would make it one of the largest such measures since at least the first year of the George W. Bush administration. That is inherently dangerous, and could lead to diminished achievements if Republicans dont stick together  as they have not stuck together on health care. And there would be less time to work through potential differences of opinion. Worse yet, if the overall timetable falls apart and key GOP legislative goals slip into 2018, all the complications of a midterm election atmospherewhere Republican are already expected to lose House if not Senate seatswill come into play. And beyond that, Donald Trumps promises to change Washington forever and Make America Great Again will start to look more than a little like the stuff politicians always say and never accomplish. So figuring out how to resolve the health-care challenge in a big hurry should be Job One for Trump, Paul Ryan, and Mitch McConnell  if, that is, they are all still on the same page. If so, they could always do what Democrats did in 2009 and 2010, and use their muscle and party discipline to force through health-care legislation whether it was popular or not. After all, what is partisan power for if not to risk it by actually doing something? If Republican leaders are not, however, really thinking along the same lines, this mess could be the new normal, and the stunning GOP triumph last November might have been an illusion."}, {"date": "2017/03/15", "title": "Republicans Search for Someone to Blame for Trumpcare", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/republicans-search-for-someone-to-blame-for-trumpcare.html", "text": " The Congressional Budget Offices estimate that 24 million people will lose health coverage by 2026 under the Republican health-care plan has kicked off a new phase in the effort to repeal and replace Obamacare: the hunt for a scapegoat. Vice-President Mike Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price spent Tuesday on Capitol Hill trying to rally support for the health-care bill, but more and more Republicans are coming out against the current version of the legislation  and pointing fingers at each other. The most obvious target is the man behind the bill, which fails to achieve the Republicans contradictory goals for the health-care system. Breitbarts escalating attacks on House Speaker Paul Ryan have added fuel to suspicions that chief strategist Steve Bannon hasnt given up on his goal of ending Ryans career. But as the Washington Post notes, Breitbart is far from the only conservative outlet bashing Ryancare. Newsmax chief executive Christopher Ruddy even published a piece urging President Trump to abandon the current bill on Tuesday (though he went with the less catchy moniker Ryan Plan II). Trump figures things out pretty quickly, and I think hes figuring out this situation, how the House Republicans did him a disservice, said Ruddy, a longtime friend of Trumps. President Trump is a big-picture, pragmatic Republican, and unfortunately the Ryan Republican plan doesnt capture his worldview. Even Republicans who dont consider Ryan the enemy have expressed alarm about the American Health Care Act. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that at least a dozen Senate Republicans, including some who had previously kept a low profile in the health debate, have expressed serious doubts about the legislation making its way through the House. The report poured cold water on the theory that passage in the House would build enough momentum to get the AHCA though the Senate. Republicans cant afford to lose more than two Senate votes. Since the senators objections range from concerns about depriving millions of affordable health insurance to claims that the bills tax credits amount to a Republican welfare entitlement, it seems modifying the legislation would only alienate another GOP faction. According to the Huffington Post, Republicans may already be giving up on getting AHCA passed in the Senate. The focus of House leadership has been more about getting a bill out of the House that is unchanged and in keeping with the Better Way plan, instead of truly seeing to potential roadblocks that exist in the House and Senate, said a Republican House member. The Trump administration is said to be considering moving the bill to the right to appease the Freedom Caucus. The thinking is that moderates may be willing to get on board if they think AHCA will fail in the Senate anyway. Their vote would be merely another declaration of their opposition to Obamacare, and the Senate would be accused of dropping the ball. One senior House aide was already calling out senators who claim to oppose the AHCA from the right, saying theyre actually opposed to the bill because Obamacare worked in their states. The question people should be looking at is whether Republican senators like Tom Cotton and Rand Paul are actually interested in repealing Obamacare, or whether theyre sabotaging this to preserve the Medicaid expansion in their states, said the aide. These senators masquerading with conservative objections are too afraid to admit they want to keep Obamacare. Of course, as President Trump has stated several times, the Republicans preferred Plan B is to keep blaming Senate Democrats. As the Huffington Post notes, theres a major flaw in that strategy: Will voters remember that Trump promised an Obamacare replacement thats going to be better health care for more people at a lesser cost, then failed to put much energy into crafting that plan? Maybe, but blaming other people for his mistakes happens to be one of his strong suits."}, {"date": "2017/03/15", "title": "Senator Says Comey Promised to Disclose Any FBI TrumpRussia Probes by Wednesday", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/senator-comey-to-disclose-any-trump-russia-probe-tomorrow.html", "text": " FBI director James Comey, who had plenty to say about Hillary Clintons emails during the election, infuriated the Senate Intelligence Committee in January when he refused to either confirm or deny the existence of any investigation into the Trump campaigns alleged ties to Russia. But thats all going to change on Wednesday, if Comey honors what one senator interpreted as a promise to release more information about the FBIs efforts by March 15. Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse and Republican Lindsey Graham, who lead the Judiciary Committees Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, have launched an investigation into Russias election meddling. During a private meeting with Comey on March 2, the senators asked Comey to confirm the existence of any Russia-related FBI probes. Whitehouse told CNN that Comey assured them he would confirm if an investigation exists and the scope of their Russia/Trump investigation because he had not been able to, at that point, say that there was one. Politico shed some more light on the request. The meeting occurred on the same day that Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from any investigation related to the Trump campaign, so Whitehouse said it was unclear who Comey would go to for clearance to discuss the investigation. So we said, Look, were going to go ahead with our hearing on the 15th, just let us know by then, Whitehouse said. So I think he implicitly confirmed that they are looking at this and he said hed get us a clearer explanation by tomorrow [March 15]. That was satisfactory to both of us. What exactly Comey meant by that is subject to interpretation, and the FBI has not confirmed that the director will be weighing in tomorrow. Whitehouse isnt the only lawmaker publicly pressuring Comey to comment on the Russia matter. Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley, a Republican, said on Tuesday he will hold up the confirmation of deputy attorney general nominee Rod Rosenstein until Comey briefs the committee on Trumps rumored ties to Russia. After Michael Flynn resigned as national security adviser last month, Grassley and the committees ranking Democrat, Dianne Feinstein, formally requested a briefing on any related investigations, as well as transcripts of Flynns calls with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. According to the Washington Post, Grassley complained last week that Comey told them he was still seeking clearance to brief the committee. Comey has been meeting with members of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Gang of Eight, who receive briefings on classified intelligence matters. The House Intelligence Committee has invited current and former intelligence chiefs to its first hearing on Russia, which is scheduled for Monday. The FBI said Comey plans to testify, but its unclear if hell appear during the public hearing or during a closed-door session. The Senate Intelligence Committee is expected to hold its own Russia hearing by the end of the month. Comey may show up, but his testimony will likely be overshadowed by that of former Trump adviser Roger Stone."}, {"date": "2017/03/15", "title": "2005 Trump Tax Return Shows He Paid $38 Million in Taxes on $150 Million Income", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/trumps-2005-tax-return-shows-he-paid-usd38-million-in-taxes-on-usd150-million-income.html", "text": " About an hour before her show started on Tuesday night, Rachel Maddow revealed that she had a huge scoop: Shed obtained Donald Trumps tax returns from 2005. Several minutes into Maddows interminable wind-up, the Daily Beast stepped on her big reveal: Trumps 1040 from 2005 shows that he paid $38 million in federal taxes on around $150 million in income. Thats an effective tax rate of 25.3 percent for that year. On Maddow, Daily Beast contributor David Cay Johnston, a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist, said the two-page document appeared in his mailbox. He said he had no idea who leaked it, and speculated that it could even be the president himself. Its entirely possible Donald sent this to me, he said. With Donald, you never know. In a statement released just before the start of Maddows show, the White House seemed to confirm that the figures in the illegally published return are real. (Maddow countered that the First Amendment gives journalists the right to publish unsolicited tax documents.) Theres nothing earth-shattering in the new document, but it does shed some more light on Trumps finances. Last fall, the New York Times published portions of Trumps 1995 tax return, which revealed that he reported a loss of $916 million that year. That could have allowed him to legally avoid paying federal income taxes for up to 18 years. The new return shows Trump had a $103 million loss, which may have been carried over from the 90s, but that wasnt enough to eliminate his tax obligation completely in 2005. The other key point is that, in 2005, Trump and his wife Melania paid about $5.3 million in regular federal income taxes and $31 million in alternative minimum tax, which is a supplemental tax designed to make sure that wealthy people cant use credits and deductions to completely avoid income tax. Trump is in favor of eliminating the alternative minimum tax, but without it he could have paid a rate of less than 4 percent. (As The Wall Street Journal notes, its hard to calculate an accurate effective tax rate due to the $103 million loss. Plus, the AMT can interact in complicated ways with depreciation deductions and net operating losses.) Nevertheless, Donald Trump Jr. claimed on Twitter that the leaked return proves his father was very successful in business. Trump has broken with 40 years of tradition by refusing to release his tax returns. He claims that he cant make them public because hes been under audit for the past 12 years, though theres no law prohibiting that. As Ronald Klain, a former Obama administration aide, noted, the statement from the White House underscores that theres no legal reason the president cant release his tax returns.

However, as viewers tuned in and slowly realized Maddow wasnt about to go live and immediately scream some devastating dirt about the president the second her image hit the screen, Twitter coped the only way it knows how: goofs.

RinoCare, a.k.a. Obamacare 2.0, one important group that you might miss or misunderstand is Republican governors. According to a report in Politico, the number of GOP governors who have expressed strong support for their partys plan is exactly zero, while 15 have voiced varying concerns. You might think the kvetching governors are all upset about the Medicaid cuts in the bill which will affect beneficiaries in states that accepted the Affordable Care Acts Medicaid expansion beginning in 2020. And thats true of some. Others, however, are conservatives who agree with some of their counterparts in Washington that the plan is too much like Obamacare. But something they probably all agree on involves the long-term trajectory of Medicaid, in which federal allotments to the states will be limited by a per capita cap. In the long history of proposals for these kind of limitations on federal responsibility for Medicaid, the idea has always been to ask states to take on more fiscal responsibility for beneficiaries in exchange for getting maximum flexibility in dealing with the programs requirements and procedures. Unfortunately for governors, AHCA has the spending cuts without the flexibility. As Health Affairs notes, AHCA may actually be more prescriptive than the status quo, micromanaging several types of beneficiaries the authors do not want to receive coverage (e.g., lottery winners, the undocumented, those with home equity over a certain amount), without some general grant of flexibility. Yes, there is some flexible money in the form of $2 billion a year for five years to be distributed to states that did not expand Medicaid; its kind of a consolation prize, amounting to far less than these states would have received by pursuing the expansion. But in general, the sought-after flexibility isnt there: The GOP governors have noticed this disrespect from the authors of AHCA: It is often a problem that Republicans pay lip service to the concept of letting states set their own policies, but only extend that support when states do what they want. Thats what people in states that have legalized recreational marijuana use fear could be the case with War on Drugs throwback Jeff Sessions in charge of the Justice Department.

The National Weather service reportedly knew by Monday afternoon that the models were calling for far less snowfall, but, for some reason, decided not to fill the public in. Either way, the noreaster shifted westward, dumping one to two feet of snow in the regions northwest of the city, and leaving the city with a nasty combination of snow, sleet, and rain. The snow accumulation for New York City had been downgraded to a measly four to six inches, and thats about where five boroughs ended up. Central Park logged 7.2 inches. LaGuardia Airport recorded 5.9 inches; JFK came in just shy of 4 inches. The Bronxs Parkchester neighborhood won, with 8.3 inches. At least take consolation that the storm delivered with some thundersnow.

The MTA suspended aboveground service at 4 a.m. Tuesday, and trains were running on the local track: New York City Transit buses are still operating, though definitely check for service changes before venturing out to catch one.

Officials are still urging people to be careful venturing out on the roads; the brutal cold puts slick roadways at risk of refreezing. Now for the people who actually got the snow downstate New Yorkers were promised. Counties such as Putnam, Rockland, and Orange saw more than a foot of snow, and some spots in northern New Jersey also got within range of a foot. Close to 13 inches has fallen in Albany so far. Roads are closed and a travel ban is in effect in upstate Broome County, which includes Binghamton.

Boston may get just shy of a foot, though the citys public schools will remain closed Wednesday. Parts of Vermont could get up to 22 inches. The Washington, D.C., metro area got a couple of inches, and the federal government opened after a morning delay. Luckily, President Donald Trump was on top of it.

In Achbitas case, the court ruled that companies are allowed to have policies banning religious symbols from the workplace. Although the European Union has laws in place that bar religious discrimination, Achbitas firing was based on equal application of company policy and was not discriminatory. But in Bougnaouis case, the court ruled in her favor, saying that because the demand came from a client and not her employer, it cannot be considered a genuine and determining occupational requirement. Right-wing leaders in Europe reacted enthusiastically to the ruling. Franois Fillon, the French presidential candidate, issued a statement that called it an immense relief, not just for thousands of companies but also for their workers. He added that the ruling would be a factor in cohesion and social peace in Europe. Meanwhile Germanys right-wing populist party, Alternative fr Deutschland, said the ruling sends out the right signal, especially for Germany. The ruling comes at a time when right-wing populist candidates whove taken hard stances against Islam  such as the Netherlands Geert Wilders and Frances Marine Le Pen  are experiencing an unexpected surge in popularity."}, {"date": "2017/03/14", "title": "Trump Is Once Again Allowing CIA Drone Strikes, Reversing Obama Protocol", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/trump-is-once-again-allowing-cia-drone-strikes.html", "text": " President Trump has given the CIA new authority to conduct drone strikes in Syria, reversing an Obama-era decision to restrict the spy agencys capabilities on the battlefield, The Wall Street Journal reports. After relying for years on CIA drone strikes to kill suspected terrorists in Pakistan and Yemen, and killing plenty of civilians in the process, President Obama tightened the rules on the agency in 2013. Instead of conducting surveillance and launching missiles, CIA drones would do only the former. The latter would be carried out by the militarys Joint Special Operations Command. The change was made, in part, because Obama thought the CIA should focus on intelligence gathering. But it was also a move toward transparency. Drone strikes made by the CIA are kept secret while those carried out by the Pentagon are typically acknowledged publicly. While that change resulted in a decrease in CIA drone strikes, it didnt eliminate them. Last June, the CIA was reportedly on pace to conduct 12 strikes in the entire year. With Trump restoring the CIAs powers, it seems that number will go up in 2017. The CIA has already gotten to work using its new power, given by Trump shortly after his inauguration. In late February an Al Qaeda higher-up was targeted in Syria. The WSJ says the CIAs restored striking authority only applies in Syria, but others have speculated that a strike that killed two men in Pakistan early this month, which the Defense Department has not acknowledged, was carried out by the CIA. Trumps decisions to give more power to a agency he compared to Nazis may seem odd, but its all a part of an attempt to loosen restrictions on the military. As the Times reported Sunday, Trump is signing off on Pentagon requests to declare parts of Yemen and Somalia areas of active hostilities, where battlefield rules are less strict, and generally seeking to relax rules aimed at preventing civilian casualties."}, {"date": "2017/03/14", "title": "How to Watch Every NCAA Tournament Game (Not That You Care, Since You Have Work)", "url": "http://www.vulture.com/2017/03/how-to-stream-watch-ncaa-tournament-march-madness.html", "text": " Stretch out those pretending-to-work muscles: March Madness begins this week, bringing with it an array of daytime games.

While Bannon admits there is racism and anti-Semitism at the fringes of the alt-right, with which his old journalistic perch at Breibart has associated, he insists on treating such influences as marginal. It is worth remembering that this is a persistent claim among right-bent political activists who may or may not themselves be bigoted, but who are clearly trafficking in appeals to bigots. When George Wallace shifted his focus from defending segregation to attacking unpopular desegregation methods like school busing, he argued he was just favoring the color-blind posture of his old enemies in the civil-rights movement. But he  and we  knew better when it came to the visceral politics of race he espoused. The effort to marginalize the role of racial or religious bigots in cultural conservatism works best when everybodys got the memo and is refusing to say things that cross the line. But right there in Washington, within close proximity of the cameras, is at least one member of Congress who, to use a phrase sometimes said of Wallace in his heyday, just comes right out and says it: Iowas Steve King. No, King doesnt admit to racially or religiously discriminatory sentiments, as much as he flirts with them. But for years he has been closely associated (along with his very close friend, former Congressman Tom Tancredo of Colorado) with a brand of nativism that views both illegal and legal immigration as threats to what can only be described as European-American civilization, and who is willing to trade in crude stereotypes of people of color. A case in point was probably Kings most infamous comment, suggesting that most Dreamers actually weigh a hundred and thirty pounds  and theyve got calves the size of cantaloupes because theyre hauling seventy-five pounds of marijuana across the desert. He was careful to claim that such interlopers were a threat not to white racial hegemony, but to our culture and civilization. But its hard to see much of a difference in Kings usage. King is back in the news this week for going out of his way on Twitter to associate with Dutch extremist politician Geert Wilders, who favors closing all mosques and banning the Koran. Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny, King wrote. We cant restore our civilization with somebody elses babies. Given a chance to walk the tweet back, King characteristically refused. You can guess which culture contributed the most. After repeated requests for a comment, House Speaker Paul Ryan mildly indicated he disagreed with Kings perspective. So, too, did Iowa Republican Party chairman Jeff Kauffman and Governor Terry Branstad, who has himself been nominated to represent the United States to the 1.4 billion nonwhite, non-Western people of China. Kauffman and Branstad also mentioned their general appreciation of Steve Kings great service to the people of Iowa, perpetuating the silly game of pretending the man doesnt say this sort of thing all the time. But you can appreciate why Iowa Republicans wont go too far in rebuking the wiggy congressman: He is likely the most popular Republican pol in the state. He was generally conceded a Senate nomination in 2014 had he wanted it; the prize instead went to Joni Ernst. Even though he is often a poor fundraiser who takes to the campaign trail late, he is unassailable in his district, as was best demonstrated in 2012 when he defeated a well-financed and popular Democrat, former Iowa First Lady Christie Vilsack, by a landslide despite inheriting a lot of new turf through redistricting. And so he hangs around like a juvenile delinquent in the schoolyard, embarrassing his colleagues and giving Democrats box after box of ammunition. Hes not going to clean up his act: As a Constitutional conservative, King believes his view of the world is derived from the infallible will of the divinely inspired Founders. And as long as other conservatives and other Republicans continue to praise him with faint damn, hell be a continuing threat to the self-presentation of Trumpian nationalists as smiling equally on all kinds of people, notwithstanding their race, religion, or culture."}, {"date": "2017/03/14", "title": "The GOP Just Made Its Bait and Switch on Health-Care Reform Explicit", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/the-gop-message-on-health-care-reform-just-changed-radically.html", "text": " In early January, a group affiliated with the House GOP launched a $1 million ad campaign for a health-care bill that didnt exist. The 30-second spot featured a montage of ethnically diverse (but uniformly telegenic) American families spending quality time together, as a friendly female voice outlined the Republican Partys core goals for health-care reform. That voice described a plan that would deliver better care at lower costs, while giving peace of mind to people with preexisting conditions and putting patients and doctors in charge  all without disrupting existing coverage. The commercial never explained how the plan would accomplish these goals. Instead, it invited interested viewers to go to ABetterHealthCarePlan.com for more details. But that website merely offered visitors the chance to watch the commercial again  and to type their names and email addresses into a form. There was no bill, nor even a summary of one, because A Better Health Care Plan had yet to be written. And it never would be. You can watch Paul Ryan try to defend the GOP healthcare replacement here: On Monday, the Congressional Budget Office released its analysis of the House GOPs Obamacare replacement  and confirmed that it bears little resemblance to the bill that the party has been promising for nearly eight years. Per the CBOs estimates, the American Health Care Act (AHCA) will cause 24 million people to lose coverage by 2026, a decline fueled by cuts to Medicaid and a radical increase in the cost of insurance for low-income, elderly people  especially those in rural areas (who tend to vote Republican). Republican defenders of AHCA have taken three different lines on the CBO report: (1) The CBO cannot be trusted to fairly score conservative proposals. (2) The CBOs numbers are worthless because they dont factor in the effects of parts two and three of the GOPs health-care-reform plan. (3) The CBO report is actually good. The first argument is a bit odd, considering that the current CBO head is a conservative economist handpicked by Trumps Health Secretary Tom Price. The second argument is even more disingenuous. The GOPs second and third health-care bills havent been scored because they havent been written. And they havent been written because theyre comprised of regulatory reforms that would require eight Democratic votes to clear the Senate  and the GOP knows it cant get those votes. Whats more, even if Republicans could push their desired regulations, there is no reason to think the insurance rate would be significantly affected. The AHCA cuts subsidies to the poor and the old. Allowing insurers to sell across state lines is not going to make health care affordable for low-income people who lose their access to Medicaid. The third argument is the most honest, but, in a sense, the most shocking. Heres Paul Ryan making the case in his official response to the CBOs findings. Okay, so the first sentence here is a lie  unless you tack for young, affluent people to the end of it. (One of the more bizarre aspects of AHCA is that even as it drastically reduces the amount the government spends subsidizing health care, it increases subsidies for middle-income people who can afford to fund their own insurance. It also allows insurers to shift the costs of premiums from the young onto the elderly.) But the second sentence is entirely true. The bill gives the wealthiest people in America a $599 billion tax break. But it also slashes $935 billion in health-care subsidies. So, Paul Ryans bill provides genuine relief to multimillionaires struggling to finance their second boats, while still cutting the deficit (on the backs of the working poor). The Republican leadership is eager to tout these results. Per Axios: This argument is remarkable for at least two reasons: First, the premium reductions that the CBO projects are the direct result of fewer old people being able to afford insurance. (The fewer expensive old people your insurer covers, the better deal it can cut you  until you become an expensive old person, anyway). Touting these premium reductions is akin to championing a plan to cut Social Security costs by reducing the number of Americans who survive long enough to retire (which, as it happens, is another thing the AHCA appears to do). Second, and more fundamentally: The words tax relief, deficit reduction, and entitlement reform were never spoken in the partys early-January advertisement. And for good reason: The GOPs primary critique of Obamacare has never been that it cost the rich too much money. What you need to understand is that there are 25 million Americans who arent covered now, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell explained on Face the Nation, back in January. And many Americans who actually did get insurance when they did not have it before have really bad insurance that they have to pay for, and the deductibles are so high that its really not worth much to them. The following week, the president echoed the argument that the big problem with Obamacare is that it isnt generous enough. Were going to have insurance for everybody, Trump told the Washington Post. There was a philosophy in some circles that if you cant pay for it, you dont get it. Thats not going to happen with us.Now, the Trump administration is claiming that expanding insurance coverage was never one of its goals, as the National Reviews Rich Lowry notes: In celebrating the fact that its bill cuts taxes on the rich and reduces the deficit  while minimizing the significance of millions losing their insurance coverage  the Republican Party is all but admitting that it has been lying about its priorities on health-care policy for nearly a decade. Imagine if the Republican Party had been honest about its vision for an Obamacare replacement. Imagine if the GOP had explained that its new path forward would provide lower taxes for the rich and more affordable health insurance for 21-year-olds who make $68,000 a year  while pricing 24 million (disproportionately elderly, rural) Americans out of the health-care market, and, thus, saving those who can still afford insurance 10 percent on their premiums, one decade from now. What would Obamacares approval rating have looked like, if Americans always knew that this was the alternative? How many electoral votes would working-class, rural voters have delivered to the GOP in 2016?"}, {"date": "2017/03/14", "title": "North Korea Threatens U.S. and South Korea With Merciless Strikes", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/north-korea-threatens-u-s-with-merciless-strikes.html", "text": " As F-18 fighter jets took off from the U.S.S.

North Korea has been particularly sensitive this year to the military exercises, which have been going on for 40 years and have been described by the Defense Department as defensive in nature. Thats not how theyre viewed in Pyongyang, where the exercises are seen as a preparation for war, and last Monday North Korea fired four ballistic missiles into the East Sea to make its displeasure known. In response to that launch, the U.S., Japan, and South Korea are testing missile defense ships in the East Sea this week in what the U.S. Navy has called a trilateral missile warning informational link exercise.

But the White Houses diehard supporters at Breitbart News are touting the bad numbers as fresh grounds for its on-again-off-again crusade against House Speaker Paul Ryan, and are all but begging Trump and his congressional allies to dump not only Ryans plan, but Ryan himself. In the days before the CBO score came out, Breitbart was featuring conservative attacks on AHCA, most notably in an interview with Sarah Palin wherein the author of the death panel smear of Obamacare called the new bill RINO-Care and socialized medicine. It greeted the score itself with a brief news story leading with this: The Congressional Budget Office report states that 14 million people will lose insurance in 2018 under the Ryan plan, while 24 million would lose insurance by 2026  where GOP loyalists tended to play up cost savings. But the site formerly overseen by presidential strategist Stephen Bannon quickly followed with a Neil Munro piece extensively quoting Republican heretic David Frum predicting that [t]he failed rollout of House Speaker Paul Ryans unpopular healthcare bill has weakened his hold on the Speakership. Incidentally, Frum, identified not inaccurately by Munro as a champion for pro-American immigration and labor policies, has used about every term of abuse in the dictionary for Donald Trump. If there was any remaining doubt that Breitbart wanted to tie AHCA around Ryans neck and send him to the bottom of the Potomac River, it was removed by the choice of this particular day to release an audiotape made last October of the Speaker distancing himself from his partys presidential nominee after the Access Hollywood video came out: The remark was reported at the time, but the audio is new, and the timing of its release speaks to the nakedness of Breitbarts animus. The $64,000 question, of course, is whether Breitbarts continued campaign against Ryan and AHCA in any way reflects the views of its White House alumni (including not only Bannon but Julia Hahn, sometimes called Bannons Bannon, who together wrote one piece on Ryan that all but called him a traitor), or their chief patron in the Oval Office. As Axios speculated this morning, one path forward for Trump is to throw Paul Ryan under the bus and come up with a new bill that conservatives like and that somehow avoids Ryancares bad press.

He called his company for help and someone there gave him two options, Gorsuch continued. He could drag the trailer carrying the companys goods to its destination (an illegal and maybe sarcastically offered option). Or, he could sit and wait for help to arrive (a legal if unpleasant option). The trucker chose None of the Above, deciding instead to unhook the trailer and drive his truck to a gas station. About a week later, in January 2009, the employer, TransAm Trucking, fired the driver for insubordination. In January 2013, an administrative law judge ruled that the truckers termination had been illegal, under a federal law that protects employees who refuse to operate vehicles under unsafe conditions. In November 2014 that ruling was unanimously upheld by a three-member administrative review board of the U.S. Department of Labor and then, last August, by Gorsuchs two colleagues on a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Gorsuch parted ways with them because, as he explained, the trucker could have simply waited in his tractor-trailer. The problem, then, wasnt that the driver had refused to operate the truck in an unsafe way, Gorsuch explained, but rather that he had operated the truck, and had done so in a way his employer had forbidden. It might be fair to ask whether TransAms decision was a wise or kind one, Gorsuch continued. But its not our job to answer questions like that  It is our job and work enough for the day to apply the law Congress did pass, not to imagine and enforce one it might have but didnt. Laconic, sharp-edged, concise, and arch, the writing style has grown familiar. It is that of many conservative judges who call themselves textualists or, when interpreting constitutional provisions, originalists  jurists who believe they have found a more objective basis for decision making than their liberal colleagues, whom they deride for trying to interpret the law to achieve just results, a goal these conservative judges deem hopelessly subjective. Yet there are other adjectives for Gorsuchs dissent. Obtuse, callous, elitist, and cruel are contenders. He displays a manner of thinking that might disappoint  if not shock  many of the white, working-class voters who turned out for Trump in November. For what follows are the facts of this case as found by the administrative law judge, which all the appeals judges, including Gorsuch, were legally bound to accept. On January 14, 2009, trucker Alphonse Maddin picked up a load of frozen meat in Nebraska that was to be delivered to several locations, in Wisconsin and Michigan. At about 11 p.m., while traveling through Illinois in subzero temperatures, his engine began sputtering. The fuel gauge had dipped below empty and he couldnt find a gas station. (It was later determined that TransAm had misidentified the gas stations location on the map it had provided Maddin.) Maddin pulled off the road, contacted TransAm, and was informed that the driver who had been scheduled to switch out with him couldnt do so, so hed have to continue the trek himself. Maddin restarted the truck but discovered that the trailers brakes had frozen, due to the frigid temperatures. He called TransAms Road Assist unit at 11:16 p.m., and was told to wait there for a repairman. When the truck was being driven, it used one heating system, but when the motor was off, the driver had to rely on a bunk heater run by an auxiliary power unit. Maddins auxiliary power unit, however, had stopped working earlier in the trip. So Maddin waited in the unheated truck. After about an hour, he fell asleep. At 1:18 am  nearly two hours after first calling Road Assist  Maddin was awakened by a cell-phone call from his cousin. The cousin became alarmed by how Maddin sounded; he seemed to be shivering, and his speech was slurred. Maddin straightened up in the cab and noticed that his skin was crackling from the cold, his torso was numb, and he couldnt feel his feet, according to the administrative review board ruling. Maddin hung up with his cousin and called TransAms Road Assist unit again. He was told to hang in there. According to the review board opinion, Maddin tried to follow this suggestion but became fearful of losing his feet, dying, and never seeing his family again. After another half-hour with no relief, he called his TransAm supervisor, reporting his physical symptoms which, by then, also included trouble breathing. Maddin explained that he wanted to unhook the trailer from the cab and drive to a gas station. The supervisor ordered him, however, according to the review board decision, to either drag the trailer with its frozen brakes or stay where he was, warning that the company could be fined if Maddin left the trailer unattended. Shortly after the call ended, at 2:05 a.m., Maddin detached the trailer and set off looking for the gas station, which he eventually found. Then, at 2:19 a.m.  three hours after originally reporting the frozen-brake issue  he was called by the repair truck operator, who had finally arrived. Maddin drove back to the trailer, where repairs to the brakes were completed at 3:20 a.m. A week later, Maddin was fired for having disobeyed the orders of his supervisor. Under the federal Surface Transportation Assistance Act, an employee cant be fired if he refuses to operate a vehicle  because the employee has a reasonable apprehension of serious injury to the employee or the public because of the vehicles hazardous safety or security condition. The review board found Maddin protected by this provision. Gorsuchs colleagues on the Tenth Circuit concluded that the boards interpretation was reasonable, given that the purpose of the law, explicitly laid out in its preamble, was to promote the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles and minimize dangers to the health of operators of commercial vehicles. Gorsuch ridiculed his colleagues reasoning, and especially their appeal to the statutes stated purpose of advancing health and safety. When the statute is plain, it simply isnt our business to appeal to legislative intentions, he wrote. After all, what under the sun, at least at some level of generality, doesnt relate to health and safety? Gorsuchs dissent in TransAm Trucking has drawn some unadmiring scrutiny in recent weeks. An Associated Press article last month described the opinion as one that appears to defy common sense and fairness, while the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center asserted in a white paper issued Friday that Gorsuchs crabbed interpretation of the law was anything but a fair reading of a statute enacted to protect worker and public safety. Realistically, nothing seems likely to derail Gorsuchs nomination at this point. He has the votes and, truth be told, he is qualified for the post in terms of credentials and experience. But Judge Gorsuchs rulings do highlight the stark disconnect between Trumps populist campaign rhetoric and the gated-community elitism of his first High Court nominee. It is in flesh-and-blood details of court cases like Maddins that the rubber of Trumps vaunted populism will meet the road. The question is how long it will take Trumps constituents to notice, and to hold him accountable."}, {"date": "2017/03/14", "title": "What You Need to Know About the Dutch Election", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-dutch-election.html", "text": " Following the unexpected success of Brexit and Donald Trump, right-wing populism will face its next test on Wednesday when Dutch voters head to the polls. Voting in the Netherlands is based on proportional representation, so parties will be awarded a percentage of the 150 seats in the Tweede Kamer, the countrys lower house of parliament. While the Dutch vote for parties, not individual politicians, the election has been dominated by Geert Wilders, a far-right, anti-Islamic candidate whos been compared to Trump. Wilders became embroiled in a U.S. controversy over the weekend when Republican congressman Steve King tweeted a cartoon endorsing him. Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny, King wrote. We cant restore our civilization with somebody elses babies. Wilders has been called the Dutch Trump, and as the New York Times reported last month, they share a number of similarities: Wilders even has some ties to Republicans in the U.S. During the 2016 election, he voiced his support for Trump, adopted the slogan Make the Netherlands Great Again, and attended the Milo Yiannopoulos Wake Up Party during the Republican National Convention. Hes also received contributions from U.S. conservatives. However, there are significant differences between the two men. Wilders began working in politics in 1990 at the age of 28, and is one of the longest-serving members in the Dutch lower house. Rather than the Dutch Trump, Politico described Wilders as the man who invented Trumpism. Hes the most strategic, smartest politician out there, Sarah de Lange, a political science professor at the University of Amsterdam, told the Times. Hes very skilled. Hes a very good debater. He has media savvy. Internationally, hes compared to Trump. But with Wilders every tweet is thought through, calculated. With Trump its emotional. Wilderss political views are more consistent, and more extreme, than Trumps. He has called for closing all mosques in the Netherlands, banning the Koran, and taxing women who wear the hijab. In December, he was convicted of inciting discrimination with comments he made about Dutch Moroccans, but he continued insulting the group. The Moroccan scum in Holland  once again not all are scum  but there is a lot of Moroccan scum in Holland who make the streets unsafe, mostly young people  and that should change, he told journalists last month. Wilders is the target of so many threats that hes been under constant police protection since 2004, and lives in a government safe house. Voters will choose between 28 parties, and the March 15 election is likely to produce the most fragmented political landscape in Dutch history. Four to six parties will probably have to band together to form a government. These are the major groups:  The Peoples Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD): The party of current prime minister Mark Rutte. The liberal party has held a majority in the government since 2012, and recent polls suggest they may come in first again, though theyll lose seats.  The Labour Party: The Labour Party came in second in the last election, and governed in coalition with VVD. Theyve been criticized for supporting austerity measures and are expected to lose seats.  The Christian Democratic Appeal: The center-right party has participated in all but three Dutch governments since 1977.  The Democrats 66: A progressive and pro-E.U. party, which favors legalized marijuana, same-sex marriage, euthanasia, and prostitution.  The Green Left: A party popular with young people, which is attempting to move from being a minor party to a major player in the new government.  The Party of Freedom: The nationalist, right-wing party Wilders founded in 2004. Its anti-immigration and in favor of the Netherlands leaving the E.U. For the last year, polls showed Wilderss Party of Freedom in the lead, but in the last month Prime Minister Mark Ruttes VVD pulled slightly ahead. Reuters reported that the latest poll from Maurice De Hond had VVD winning 18 percent of the vote and 27 seats, and the Freedom Party in second place with 16 percent and 24 seats. But on Monday Rutte warned voters not to be complacent. There is a real risk that on March 16 we can wake up in this country and Geert Wilders is leading the biggest party and that will send a signal to the rest of the world, he told reporters. No. In the Netherlands, winning the popular vote does not mean you get to lead the country  but it has nothing to do with the Electoral College. After the election, the parties will begin negotiating to form a governing coalition, a process that could take months. All of the mainstream parties have vowed not to work with Wilders, so its highly unlikely that he will become prime minister (though he claims theyll change their tune if he wins). Wilderss popularity is still significant, however, because hes shifted Dutch politics to the right. The leader of the Christian Democratic Alliance said that if Europe doesnt reform Brexit might not be the last exit from the E.U. Prime Minister Rutte tried to compete with Wilders rather than standing in opposition to him. If you dont like it here, you can leave, he said on the campaign trail earlier this month  though he added that the statement applies to everyone, be it that you are an immigrant, or that your parents and grandparents were born here. Last month the Dutch law society NoVA concluded that the platforms of all five leading parties contain policies that are openly discriminatory against certain population groups. While Wilders is in favor of Nexit, that wasnt a major campaign issue and most of the other parties are against holding a referendum on E.U. membership. On the other hand, just after the Brexit vote, a poll found 43 percent of the Dutch wanted to vote on their membership in the E.U. Several parties are in favor of reforms, even though they want to remain in the E.U. With elections approaching France, Germany, and maybe Italy, the Dutch vote may be an indicator of whether Brexit and Trump were isolated events or the beginning of a widespread embrace of right-wing populism."}, {"date": "2017/03/14", "title": "Leaked White House Analysis Says AHCA Would Be Even Worse Than Predicted", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/leaked-white-house-analysis-ahca-worse-than-predicted.html", "text": " Just after the Congressional Budget Office said it estimates that under the Republican health-care bill 14 million Americans will lose their health insurance next year, and 24 million will lose their coverage by the end of the decade, the White House said it disagrees strenuously with that analysis. We believe that our plan will cover more individuals at a lower cost and give them the choices that they want for the coverage that they want for themselves and for their families, not that the government forces them to buy, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price explained on Monday. Hours later, the White Houses internal analysis of the American Health Care Act leaked. It confirms that the Trump administration disagrees with the CBOs findings  but not because AHCA will cover more individuals. The executive branch estimates that 26 million people would lose coverage within the next decade  more than the CBOs estimate of 24 million. Politico reports: So, in light of these shockingly bad estimates, what does the White House intend to do? According to a separate Politico report, the plan is to make people lose coverage even sooner: Republicans can only afford to lose 21 votes in the House and two in the Senate. Implementing AHCA as soon as possible may appease the roughly 40 members of the House Freedom Caucus who are threatening to kill the bill. But that would also alienate more moderate Republicans, and those who come from states that took the Medicaid expansion. White House officials tell Politico that they believe the changes are necessary to get past the initial hurdle of passage in the House. Theyre aware that moving to the right makes the legislation even less likely to get through the Senate, but one person said theyd cross that bridge when we get to it. If the aim is to fulfill President Trumps promise to provide better health care for more people at a lesser cost, it doesnt make sense to push legislation that the White House believes will be even worse than expected  and in an election year, no less. But if the aim is fulfill White House chief strategist Steve Bannons long-stated goal of costing Paul Ryan his speakership, making his unpopular health bill more likely to fail is a solid plan. Breitbart appears to be throwing everything it has at the speaker and Ryancare, but surely Bannon himself would never do that to his new texting buddy."}, {"date": "2017/03/13", "title": "Chinese Firm With Government Ties Gives Kushner Family Sweetheart Deal", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/chinese-firm-give-kushner-family-sweetheart-deal.html", "text": " A Beijing-based investment firm with close ties to the Chinese government is giving a sweetheart deal to the real-estate company owned by Jared Kushners family for a stake in the firms flagship property at 666 Fifth Ave., Bloomberg reported Monday. The $4 billion deal calls for Kushner Companies, where Trumps son-in-law and adviser was CEO until January, to receive $400 million in cash and have its mortgage in the mixed-use building slashed by about 80 percent. The transactions critics tell Bloomberg that the terms of the deal are unusually favorable. The concern, as explained by Larry Noble of the Campaign Legal Center, is that Anbang Insurance Group is trying to curry favor with Kushner and, by extension, President Trump. A Kushner Companies spokesman told Bloomberg that theres no worry over conflict of interest because Jared sold his ownership in 666 Fifth Ave. to family members. But as Noble, who calls this a sweetheart deal, told Bloomberg, A classic way you influence people is by financially helping their family. Matthew Sanderson, a D.C. lawyer and Republican, told the Times earlier this year that theres nothing legally improper about the deal but it has the strong appearance that a foreign entity is using Mr. Kushners business to try to influence U.S. policy. The problem, in addition to the apparent attempt to influence Kushner, is the company doing the influencing. Anbangs murky ownership structure has come under scrutiny before and resulted in it losing its $1.57 billion bid to take over a U.S. insurance company last summer. In January, the New York Times reported that Morgan Stanley refused to advise the company because it could not get the proper information to satisfy its know your client guidelines. As this company edges closer to President Trump, its worth noting that in September 2015, President Obama went out of his way to avoid it. On a trip to New York City he did not stay at Anbang-owned Waldorf Astoria because of concerns that the Chinese government would spy on him."}, {"date": "2017/03/13", "title": "Paul Ryan Tries to Bluff and Fib His Way Through CBO Fiasco", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/paul-ryan-tries-to-bluff-and-fib-a-win-from-cbo-fiasco.html", "text": " The general reaction to the long-awaited Congressional Budget Offices scoring of the American Health Care Act was shock at how bad it was for the Republican congressional leaders to whom CBO reports. The estimated health-care coverage losses of 14 million in the first year alone and 24 million within ten years was flabbergasting. Axios post on the score featured a mushroom cloud. Ezra Klein opined that [t]his CBO report is so much worse for Republicans than I thought possible. While as of this writing there has been no reaction from the president, HHS Secretary Tom Price said the administration disagreed strenuously with the report. He also previewed what we can expect to be a regular feature of GOP criticism of the CBO report: It doesnt examine future legislation and regulatory reactions that will either save costs or improve coverage. Trouble there, of course, is that such future actions will not be included in the budget-reconciliation bill that is the vehicle for AHCA, which means at least eight Senate Democratic votes will be necessary. But the most comprehensive immediate GOP reaction was from Speaker Paul Ryan, and he chose to cherry-pick the report extensively: This is, to put it mildly, a disingenuous take. According to CBO, the AHCA will actually boost premiums in the short term, and will boost them even more for poorer and older Americans. It does not, in fact, improve access to quality, affordable care  the insufficiency of its tax credits are a big reason for the coverage losses CBO anticipates. Ryans argument that this is just part of a three-pronged approach is specious for the reason I mentioned above: The idea that any iteration of this deeply broken Republican health-care plan will conceivably command 60 votes in the Senate is pure fantasy. The one thing Ryan got right is that the CBO estimates the $935 billion in spending reductions via smaller tax credits and Medicaid cuts  all mostly affecting the working poor  will exceed the $599 billion in tax cuts, mostly targeted to the wealthy. Thats not an argument that will fare very well once it is understood. The argument that people losing coverage have the freedom to decide they dont want it anyway isnt a big winner, either. I would expect some reactions to Ryan to quote songwriter Kris Kristofferson to the effect that freedoms just another word for nothing left to lose. Perhaps Republicans will regroup overnight and come up with more convincing responses. Or maybe they will respond to the mushroom cloud of this CBO report simply by going nuclear on the source."}, {"date": "2017/03/13", "title": "MTA Will Shut Down Above-Ground Subway Service Tuesday Morning", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/mta-will-shut-down-above-ground-subway-service-tuesday.html", "text": " The dream of staying home and watching Netflix on a snow day just came closer to fruition for a lot of New Yorkers as the MTA announced plans to shut down service on its aboveground lines.

All trains will run along the local tracks starting at midnight, and some lines will stop running Tuesday morning.

The National Weather Service said the same: Do not travel, the agency warns, adding that, if you must, have a winter survival kit with you. Conditions, especially Tuesday morning into the afternoon, will be treacherous. Snow could fall at a rate of two to four inches per hour Tuesday. Visibility will be a quarter-mile or less, with whiteout conditions possible. Winds will be whipping with gusts at 55 miles per hour.

The bill would deprive 14 million American citizens of their health insurance next year, a number that would rise to 24 million by the end of the decade. It is a proposal that could only be enacted by a party in the grips of an combination of ideological and partisan fanaticism unfathomable to most of the world, and even to most Americans. The changes Trumpcare would impose upon the health-care system are easy to understand. It is, quite simply, a redistribution bill. It would reduce taxes on the rich, and thus reduce the amount of subsidies for coverage for people who cant obtain it through their job or Medicare. By 2026, CBO finds, the average subsidy would be about half as large. But the cut would not be distributed evenly. Middle- to upper-middle class customers buying insurance, especially young and healthy ones, would get larger subsidies. Poor, sick, and old customers would get enormous cuts in their subsidy levels. CBO has a graph showing the bills effect on Americans who make less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level. The dark-blue bars represent the status quo. The light-blue bars show what Republicans hope to achieve: Since the pain would be especially acute among older and rural voters  Obamacare calibrates its subsidies to the cost of insurance, which is higher in rural areas, while Trumpcare would not  many of the victims would be Republican voters themselves. An analysis quoted in todays Wall Street Journal finds that, in one Nebraska county, a 62-year-old who earns $18,000 a year, who currently pays $760 a year for insurance, would have to pay $20,000 a year under the Republican plan. Which is to say, that person would not be able to obtain insurance, since the cost of care would exceed his entire salary. The moral proposition undergirding this plan is that, if you cant afford the cost of your own insurance, that is your own problem. It would reduce average premiums, by making insurance unaffordable to people with high medical expenses, and thus driving them out of the risk pool. This proposal, the centerpiece of the new all-Republican governments legislative agenda, is an expression of its shared philosophy. Donald Trump has altered the Republican stance on trade and immigration, not to mention self-enrichment by the First Family and the routine propagation of conspiracy theories by the chief executive. But he has hewed closely to the partys conviction that the central problem in American life is a government that redistributes too much from the privileged to the underprivileged. It remains to be seen whether enough Republicans have the courage of their convictions to follow through on this plan. Depriving millions of Americans access to medical care would impose pain more directly and widely than any legislative act in modern U.S. history."}, {"date": "2017/03/13", "title": "This Blizzard Might Break New Yorks One-Day Snowfall Record for March", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/blizzard-might-break-nycs-one-day-snowfall-record-for-march.html", "text": " New York City is bracing for a ferocious March blizzard. The Noreaster will likely dump between 12 to 18 inches of snow in the five boroughs. If those predictions hold, the storm could bust the months one-day snowfall record of 16.5 inches, set more than a century ago, in March 1888. Mayor Bill de Blasio has already gifted public-school students a snow day, and the run on local grocery stores is in full swing. The MTA just announced it will shut down above-ground subway service at 4 a.m. To get an experts read on this blizzard, Daily Intelligencer called up New York Metro Weather meteorologist John Homenuk to explain why winter is coming back. Lets start with a key data point: How much snow are we going to get in New York?I would expect at least a foot. The official forecast is 15 to 18 [inches], with the potential for more. Its not going to be something that builds up gradually  its going to come in pretty intense tomorrow morning, starting a little after midnight. If anyone is trying to commute tomorrow, its going to be a disaster. Id recommend not doing that. Theres going to be some really strong winds, the potential for gusts up to 45 miles per hour. Whatever you think that the definition of a blizzard is in your head, thats what tomorrow is going to be. Is anywhere on the East Coast going to be spared?Not really. From Washington and Philly up into northern New Jersey, there will be significant snowfall everywhere  likewise up into Boston and almost all of southern New England. Clearly this is an unusual storm system. Whats going on?You have one disturbance which is going to be over the Mississippi Valley, and another one thats coming down from the Great Lakes, and theyre going to interact with each other. The initial disturbance over the Mississippi Valley slides east toward the mid-Atlantic, and the second one from the Great Lakes kind of swings down and scoops it up. That creates a very powerful storm off the mid-Atlantic coast. Whats behind the recent spell of bitter cold in New York?We knew this was coming when forecast models started to show what we call high-latitude blocking. That is, a ridge of high pressure forms in the upper latitudes  up near Greenland, the Pole, northern Canada  and all the cold air thats normally bottled up in those high latitudes gets dislodged and moves further south. So you have all the ingredients: You have the cold air to the north, and you have the block keeping the cold air there. Its slowing everything down to allow this storm to form. How rare is it for this kind of a big storm in March?Significant snow is pretty common in March. The record was set by a March storm in 1888. If we get 15, 18 inches it would be a very memorable storm for March  and anything above that would be the number one. It sounds like it will take a while to dig out, and based on the forecast, it doesnt look like its going to melt anytime soon.It definitely looks like temperatures will be below normal for the next several days, at least. The blocking is beginning to break down a bit, but the cold air will hang around a while before things start to moderate. Is there any more snow on the horizon?Nothing like this. This is the one that weve been watching. This could be the big one of the year. And when is it going to feel like spring again?I would give it a week, then we can start talking about spring weather."}, {"date": "2017/03/13", "title": "Trump Hasnt Donated His Salary to Charity Yet, But the Checks in the Mail", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/trump-hasnt-donated-his-salary-but-the-checks-in-the-mail.html", "text": " President Trump is planning to donate his salary to charity at the end of the year and is asking the White House press corps to help determine who gets the money, Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Monday. During the campaign, Trump promised not to take a salary, but that proved impossible. Federal law dictates that the president must be paid. With one monthly paycheck of $33,333 paid out in February and another due next week, NBC News asked the White House Sunday if Trump had donated the money yet. They wouldnt say, but took the next 12 hours to prepare a response. Spicers explanation is an admission that Trump isnt living up to his promise to not take a salary. Its also pretty obvious that the White House hadnt thought about this until NBC asked. Asking the press to choose a charity to receive the $400,000 salary is a decent gimmick. But based on the suggestions White House reporters are making on Twitter, that would result in Trump giving money to the very media he despises. Donating the salary would be good, if Trump does it, but the implication of his pledge to not take a salary was always that he was making a sacrifice to benefit the American people. Donating the money to charity is not going to save taxpayer money. You know what would? Biting the bullet and cancelling one of his weekend trips to Mar-a-Lago, each of which cost around seven times more than his annual salary."}, {"date": "2017/03/13", "title": "Why Trumps Personnel Crisis Is Bad and Only Getting Worse", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/why-trumps-personnel-crisis-is-bad-and-only-getting-worse.html", "text": " As the Trump administration approaches the gut-test phase of the new presidency, with a jammed-up legislative calendar and unpredictable overseas challenges, its failure to fill top policy-making positions in the Executive branch is no longer just embarrassing. Its becoming what conservative journalist John Fund, writing in the National Review, calls a personnel crisis in the Trump White House. And ironically, this leaves the new administration dependent on Obama-appointed holdovers whose very existence tends to stimulate the 45th presidents most paranoid apprehensions. So why not just fill the jobs? Explanations vary. A big New York Times piece on the matter emphasizes three factors: a poorly staffed transition operation; a double political vetting aimed not only at keeping out godless liberals but also Republicans who at some point said disparaging things about the new Boss; and a five-year lobbying ban that gives pause to those with plans to cash in. Trump himself threw everyone a curve with a fourth explanation that had the air of a tossed-off and half-baked thought: He didnt want to fill all of those useless jobs to begin with (a rather insipid thing to say about positions that might be crucial to his goal of reducing the size of the bureaucracy). But that assertion is no longer operative, according to the Times: [T]he president has not proposed any plan for trimming crucial senior positions, and a White House spokeswoman, Lindsay E. Walters, said he eventually planned to fill them. How long is eventually, though? Fund tells us we could be looking at a long stretch of time when these positions are either empty or occupied by people the new regime has no reason to trust: Wow. One can only imagine the kind of poisonous atmosphere such a long hiatus could produce across the agency landscape, where there are no Trump people in place and a smattering of commissars must police countless bureaucrats. If Stephen Bannons promise that the new administration would deconstruct the administrative state is to come true, a lot more deconstructors need to be found and appointed.

But the folks down at City Hall, and on the mayors reelection campaign team, arent celebrating just yet. True, Bharara had been tormenting de Blasio for nearly a year, with details of a pay-to-play investigation of the mayor and top aides dribbling out. And Bhararas probe  along with a separate one by Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance  is the only major wild card standing in the way of de Blasios reelection this fall. Bhararas swift exit, as one of 46 U.S. Attorneys suddenly given the gate by Trump and new attorney general Jeff Sessions, actually introduces a new level of uncertainty and risk for Team de Blasio. They didnt mind if things dragged out into early April, keeping the field of possible challengers in the September Democratic primary frozen. But if bad news, in the form of indictments, is inevitable, theyd prefer that it arrive with enough time left for de Blasio to recover. So the mayors defense lawyers had recently been pushing Bharara to make a decision sooner rather than later, by arguing that Bharara would be seen as pulling a Comey and putting his thumb on the voting scales if he waited much longer. Now, though, the mayors advisers are concerned that the transition from Bharara to whichever Republican Trump installs will slow things down to the point where the timing of any possible indictments inflicts greater damage. Another worrisome prospect for de Blasio and his team is that the internal dynamic of the U.S. Attorneys office may have shifted in a way that makes an indictment more likely than it would been under Bharara. Bharara, for all his attraction to the spotlight, was generally cautious when it came to bringing charges. As are most U.S. Attorneys, for professional and personal reasons: They take their legal responsibilities seriously, and they dont like to lose, because the boss gets the blame, particularly in high-profile cases. Line assistants  the prosecutors in individual departments  are commonly much more eager to test their cases in court. With Bharara out, his deputy Joon Kim becomes interim U.S. Attorney. Kim is well-respected, and a close friend of Bhararas, so the basic trajectory of the de Blasio case should stay the same. Another key player is Lisa Zornberg, the chief of the criminal division, who is reputed to be a highly aggressive prosecutor. She will probably want to move the de Blasio case to a conclusion before Trump names a replacement  not out of any partisan political calculation, but to follow through on the investigations natural momentum before the office is engulfed in an overhaul and a years worth of work stalls out. On the other hand, if the de Blasio case has hit a dead end, Zornberg will probably want to drop it and move on to other business. Just because Bharara doesnt get to make that call anymore doesnt mean hes done with big decisions. He became a pop-culture as well as a legal star during his nearly eight years in office  not just by convicting Wall Street fraudsters, international arms dealers, and two of New York states top-three politicians, but by doing it with a flair for the headline-stoking phrase. National magazines put his face on the cover; Bruce Springsteen shouted Bhararas name from the stage. Bhararas departure is bad for the criminal-justice system, but he played his ouster deftly in political and public-relations terms. Somehow all the details of Bhararas principled refusal to resign made it to reporters; then, having forced Trumps hand, Bharara himself broke the news of his firing on Twitter. To his detractors, it was one more overhyped, grandstanding performance. To Bhararas liberal fans, it reinforced his credibility as a tough-minded, independent, populist hero. The second one is an enviable image for a potential New York politician. Bharara has consistently and repeatedly claimed to have no interest in running for office. Yet he has just as strenuously insisted that lasting, meaningful ethics reform, something he genuinely cares about, could only come from inside government. Bhararas skills as a leader and administrator are better suited to being a mayor than governor. The timing and the optics of making a 2017 bid, however, are awful: He would need to go from investigating de Blasio to running against him within weeks, something that smacks of unseemly conflict of interest. Another scenario could be a 2018 grudge match against Governor Andrew Cuomo, who by all indications will be seeking a third term in Albany. Not that it would be an easy route for Bharara: In a primary battle against Cuomo for the Democratic nomination  Bharara is a registered Democrat  he would face some daunting disadvantages; and while its conceivable he could run as an independent candidate, the financial and ballot obstacles could be even more formidable. (A third, bank-shot possibility: State attorney general Eric Schneiderman takes on Cuomo and Bharara runs for AG.) If the Bharara-Cuomo face-off does materialize, it would be irresistible political theater between two masters of strategy, and the press, who have jabbed at and stalked each other for years. At the height of Bhararas probes of Albany corruption, in back-to-back midtown speeches, the two men advanced wildly different views of the political game. How do you get to compromise? How do you get it done? How do you avoid disagreement? Cuomo said. Government is not a debating society. I want to be judged on what we actually got done  Nothing is linked. Everything is linked. How many past bills were born of bribery? How many items in the budget? How much of the work of city and state government is tarnished by tawdry graft? And how much will be, unless there is some reform? Bharara asked, several blocks away. Public corruption has a massive opportunity cost, and it is a cost that no one can afford anymore  the problem of corruption in New York is systemic, not merely episodic. Its easy to imagine a 2018 contest as a riveting fight over the nature of New York states political culture. The governor would have a massive advantage in fundraising  Cuomo has at least $22 million in the bank now, which could grow to $40 million by next year  and in upstate Democratic votes. Bhararas appeal, though, would be that hes an un-bought, crusading outsider, and his already-high name recognition in the city would be supplemented by an abundance of free media. On Sunday afternoon, barely 24 hours after his firing was official, Bharara was already taking shots at Cuomo. By the way, he tweeted, now I know what the Moreland Commission must have felt like. It was a reference to Cuomos abrupt unplugging, in 2014, of an Albany corruption inquiry that had outlived its purpose as a political tool. The governors move infuriated Bharara and led, indirectly, to his indicting one of Cuomos closest aides. Bharara has lost his job as U.S. Attorney, but he clearly hasnt lost his sense of humor  or his desire to get under the governors skin. Does he really want to go any deeper than that? Colleagues believe a run for office remains a long shot. Besides, even without climbing down from the pedestal and taking on de Blasio or Cuomo in a messy campaign, Bharara already has the material to write a pretty good book. And then, if Bharara really wants to run for something big, in 2020 he can try to fire the man who just fired him."}, {"date": "2017/03/13", "title": "Scotland Wants Another Vote for Independence Before Brexit", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/scotland-wants-another-vote-for-independence-before-brexit.html", "text": " Scottish independence will be back on the ballot within the next two years if First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has her way.

But to offset the $54 billion increase in military spending he will seek, Trump will ask for cuts in spending on housing, the environment, government research, and foreign assistance. The requested cuts, which will need Congressional approval to become law, are expected to be so deep that one expert told the Post they will lead to an employment reduction of 1.8 percent in the D.C. area and a 3.5 percent drop in personal income. Despite winning the election by promising millions of Americans that hed bring back their jobs, President Trump is more than willing to fire those who work for the federal government. As National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn explained on Fox News Sunday, Trump has no choice. With no alternative but to boost military spending, cuts must be made elsewhere, he said.

Its no different than every other family in America that has to make the tough decisions when they need to spend money somewhere, they have to cut it from somewhere else."}, {"date": "2017/03/13", "title": "Trumps Revised Travel Ban Has Survived Its Early Legal Challenges", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/revised-travel-ban-has-survived-its-early-legal-challenges.html", "text": " If in revising its travel ban the Trump administration wanted to avoid the blizzard of judicial interventions that beset its initial effort, they are off to a pretty good start. Released on March 6, the new ban is scheduled to take effect March 16, and at this point the only broad-based challenge to its implementation is the State of Hawaiis claim that it still violates constitutional prohibitions on religious discrimination, and also abrogates the free-association rights of citizens with family members affected by the ban. District Court Judge Derrick Watson will hold a hearing on Hawaiis petition on March 15. There is a chance the judge who more or less stopped the first travel ban, District Court Judge James Robart of Seattle, could get a second bite at the apple. But over the weekend Robart rejected an effort by the state of Washington (joined by New York and Oregon) to simply apply his order against implementation of the first ban to the other. As Lyle Denniston explains, hes not ruling out later action, but is definitely demanding evidence the new ban has the same flaws as its predecessor: Meanwhile, still another federal judge in Wisconsin, William Conley, granted a temporary restraining order against enforcement of the new travel ban against a particular Syrian family, one of whose members is already in the United States. The legal status of this family is especially murky, and the government argues the ban doesnt apply to these people anyway. But Conley is protecting their status until it can be sorted out. It is hard to see how this order threatens the ban generally. In no small part because the revisions to the travel ban were designed to exempt people in transit or with legitimate visas, we probably wont see anything like the chaos that characterized implementation of the first travel ban in January, or the obvious grounds for temporary judicial intervention. The revised ban is still vulnerable to the argument that its history shows a consistent effort to discriminate against Muslims. But unless something dramatic happens in the next 72 hours, the new policy will take effect as scheduled."}, {"date": "2017/03/13", "title": "Kellyanne Conway Suggests That Obama Could Have Used Microwaves to Spy on Trump", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/conway-suggests-that-obama-used-microwaves-to-spy-on-trump.html", "text": " Its now been over a week since President Trump claimed that former president Obama wiretapped Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign.

Its typical for a new administration to replace its predecessors appointees, but Bhararas dismissal came as something of a surprise because President Trump had personally told Bharara he could keep his job back in November. Amid speculation that Bhararas firing was related to his investigations, the White House (sort of) addressed one aspect of the intrigue: a mysterious phone call a Trump aide made to the high-profile prosecutor the day before he was instructed to quit. According to various accounts, the assistant left Bharara a voice-mail on Thursday asking that he call Trump. Bharara reportedly decided against returning the call, citing rules about communication between U.S. attorneys and the president. He then informed Attorney General Jeff Sessionss office, as well as Trumps, that he would not be calling back. On Sunday night, White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders claimed that Trumps call was intended to be a friendly gesture. The president reached out to Preet Bharara on Thursday to thank him for his service and wish him good luck, Sanders told the New York Times. She declined to say anything else about the causes or execution of Bhararas firing. Bharara suggested that he didnt buy the White Houses explanation for the call, particularly given the conversation he had with Sessionss chief-of-staff Joseph Hunt about the situation. Mr. Hunt was direct and clear in our conversation that, given written White House contacts policy, my position as a sitting U.S. attorney, and my offices jurisdiction, it would be improper for me to speak directly to the sitting president without knowing the subject matter, said Bharara. Some might find that inconsistent with what is for the first time, three days later being described as a well-wishes call. Regardless of what, exactly, Trump planned to say to Bharara, this certainly wouldnt be the first time this president ignored protocols or did something unusual with his phone."}, {"date": "2017/03/13", "title": "Republican Congressman Steve King Tweets Approvingly About White Nationalism", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/republican-congressman-tweets-approvingly-about-white-nationalism.html", "text": " Congressman Steve King, long known for his bigoted anti-immigrant views, appears to have publicly embraced white nationalism.

The drawing depicts Wilders sticking his finger in a dam (labeled Western Civilization) overflowing with green fluid carrying Islams star-and-crescent symbol. In the background, bearded, knife-wielding men angrily look on. Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny, King wrote. We cant restore our civilization with somebody elses babies. This isnt the first time that King has touched on these ideas. For example, during a July appearance on MSNBC, he offered this striking complaint about the description of the Republican National Convention as wired by loud, unhappy, dissatisfied white people: This whole old white people business does get a little tired.

Whether it was Margaret Thatchers union-busting in the 1980s or Rudy Giulianis campaign to put Fox News on Time Warners cable system in the 1990s, Murdoch went all-out for leaders who allowed him to protect and expand his corporate empire. Since Election Day, Murdoch, now the executive chairman of Fox News, has personally nudged the network in a more pro-Trump direction, sources tell me. That effort included anointing Trump-friendly Tucker Carlson as the successor to Megyn Kelly as host in the 9 p.m. slot. Fox News staffers are also grumbling that segments now have to fit a pro-Trump narrative, one insider told me. Trump seems to be returning the goodwill: He asked Murdoch to submit names for FCC commissioner and tweeted praise for Fox News. Hes even taken policy ideas from the network. Now Murdoch may be poised to reap a much bigger win from a Trump administration action. Thats because on Saturday Trump oversaw the firing of Preet Bharara, the U.S attorney for the Southern District of Manhattan, whose office is in the middle of a high-profile federal investigation of Fox News. The probe, according to sources, is looking at a number of potential crimes, including whether Fox News executives broke laws by allegedly obtaining journalists phone records or committed mail and wire fraud by hiding financial settlements paid to women who accused Roger Ailes of sexual harassment. Sources told me that prosecutors have been offering witnesses immunity to testify before a federal grand jury thats already been impaneled. Trumps decision to fire Bharara ignited speculation that it was designed to blunt investigations like the Fox News probe. In November, Trump had promised Bharara he could remain in the job. But on Friday, he reversed course and requested Bhararas resignation along with 45 other Obama-appointed U.S. attorneys. (Adding to the intrigue, Trumps prosecutor purge came less than 24 hours after Sean Hannity said on Fox News that Trump should purge the Justice Department of Obama-appointed officials.) Given that Fox News is Murdochs most profitable division, the prospect of indictments is a serious problem. Theyre really worried, one source close to the network said. Another insider said that Fox News executives considered the investigation political because Bharara had been appointed by Barack Obama. Which is why, for Murdoch, it must be a relief that Bhararas replacement could be an ally. According to the Times, Trumps short list to replace Bharara includes Marc Mukasey  who just happens to be former Fox News chief Roger Ailess personal lawyer. Considering Mukaseys close relationship with Ailes, he would surely come under pressure to recuse himself from the Fox News probe if he were appointed by Trump to succeed Bharara. I have no comment, Mukasey said when I reached him on Sunday evening and asked if he planned to do so, should he get the job."}, {"date": "2017/03/13", "title": "An Atomic-Weapons Expert on the Worst-Case Nuclear Scenario", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/an-atomic-weapons-expert-on-the-worst-case-nuclear-scenario.html", "text": " Not since the 1970s, at the height of the Cold War, have most Americans been jittery about the prospect of a nuclear holocaust. Back then, it seemed like such an immediate possibility that suburban families were constructing fallout shelters and schoolkids were subjected to bomb drills. But after the fall of the Soviet Union, atomic war came to feel like an abstraction, the stuff of sci-fi movies. Then, during the presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton started talking about Trump having access to the nuclear codes, which has turned out to be more than simple campaign fearmongering. As recently as two weeks ago, the 45th president effectively called for a new nuclear-arms race, and hes also threatened to revoke the nuclear agreement with Iran and to invade North Korea on account of its recent nuclear tests. Of all the threats Trump poses, surely the gravest (if, lets hope, the most far-fetched) is that he could set off a firefight that would incinerate the globe. Atomic-weapons expert Philip Coyle was the head of nuclear-weapons testing under President Bill Clinton and an adviser to the Carter and Obama administrations. And as a scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab in California, he spent 30 years helping design both nuclear arms and the only anti-missile weapon ever deployed by the U.S. Now mostly retired and living in Sacramento, he consults for the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, a group that lobbies for arms reduction. In other words, there are few people better equipped to explain just how terrified we should be of global annihilation. Below, he discusses the best way of responding to North Korea, why we should be concerned about India and Pakistan, and his own worst nightmares of our nuclear future. Is there anything about nuclear weapons that would keep us up at night if we knew about it?Well, for one thing, because Im old enough, and because of the work I used to do, Ive actually seen nuclear weapons go off. Its an amazing, amazingly powerful thing. Once youve seen it  Its something you dont ever want to see happen during war. I would watch from miles away. If its in a place like the Nevada test site, then youre in a bunker, protected. Or if its underground, then you see the ground heave, which is amazing. If it was in the Pacific, you would watch, perhaps, from a Navy ship. I was the director of the largest underground test the United States ever did  five megatons  in Alaska. On the web, you can see pictures of the ground rising as the explosion goes off. It just goes up and up and up, and it looks like its never going to stop. We begin to get an idea [of what its like] in violent storms, tornadoes. Violent landslides. But its just not the same. What do you think of the outlook for the Trump administrations nuclear policy?Its a little hard to tell. President Trump has said that nuclear weapons are terrible, or awful, something like that. But on the other hand, he told Mika on Morning Joe, Bring on an arms race! Trump has gone back and forth on whether he supports a No First Use doctrine. Could you explain what this means and the ramifications?Yes. It means we pledge we will never be the first to use nuclear weapons. If the other side does, we might use them in retaliation, but we would never start a nuclear war. Its a way of adding security and stability to the peace process. It has always been set by the president. We dont know yet what President Trumps view is. What was the significance of the North Korea nuclear test, the one in January, that Trump responded to from his Mar-a-Lago dinner table?North Korea has tested nuclear weapons several times now, and while some of the early tests appeared to be fizzles, the more recent tests look like they have actually achieved relatively small nuclear devices. By small, I mean about the size of Hiroshima. Theyre not the big thermonuclear weapons of the sort that the United States, Russia, France, and China have. And they dont have many. And they dont have many. Congress estimates 10 to 16; other estimates are less than 10but essentially, a handful. But theyre continuing to test them, and also testing missiles that might carry those weapons. So far, North Korea does not have a missile that can reach the United States, but people worry that given enough time, it could develop one. The significance [of the January test] was that it was about the same size as the previous one, so it appears they can do it twice in a row. And the previous test may  we dont know this for sure  may have helped them make some progress toward making their nuclear device smaller. That is, more easily mounted on a missile of some kind. Mostly their problem so far has been that their missile tests simply havent been intercontinental-range. Theyve been short-to-medium range. So they dont even have the capability to reach Hawaii, let alone the continental United States. However, they certainly are a threat to South Korea and Japan. Theyve tested missiles with enough range to reach either of those countries. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the Trump administration is considering military action and regime change in North Korea, among other options, for dealing with the nuclear threat there. Whats your take on that news?I think the administration is simply considering the options, and thats not so surprising. I think every administration looks at the options. Some will be more attractive than others. The main thing North Korea wants is for the United States to stop threatening it. Instead, just last week, the U.S. started military exercises in South Korea. Is the nuclear threat at a level that could warrant an action like regime change?Certainly its a threat that we should be very concerned about. But threatening regime change  all that does is threaten them even more with the very thing theyre worried about. Thats not going to work. What North Korea wants is for us to stop threatening them and to talk with them, and to sit down and try to reach an agreement, perhaps with the help of other countries: namely, South Korea, Japan, and China. When weve done that in the past, it has produced salutary results. North Korea has followed the agreements that weve made until we do something to break them. For instance, the Clinton administration had reached an agreement with North Korea, which they were following. The guidelines were not exactly parallel with what has recently happened in Iran, but conceptually they were the same. Then President George W. Bush was elected and immediately began threatening North Korea  and the deal had been that we wouldnt do that. So North Korea stopped abiding by the terms as well?Yes. And thats the problem with these agreements: Theyre very fragile, and it doesnt take much from either side to trigger an overreaction. Besides North Korea, which countries should we be most concerned about?There are also Pakistan and India. People worry that they could get into a regional conflict involving nuclear weapons that would bring in the rest of the world, and all hell would break loose. It could involve large nuclear-weapon states like Russia and China picking sides. Pakistan is estimated to have about 130 nuclear weapons, and India about 120. They tend to match each other. Theyve done exactly the same number of nuclear tests. They keep track and deliberately dont do more, in order to avoid setting off an imbalance. Are there any areas where our fears are overblown?I dont think you can be too concerned, where nuclear weapons are involved, because theyre so destructive. Youve criticized our nuclear defenses for the way they focus on intercepting limited attacks. Could you explain what this means and why its inadequate?The missile-defense system that weve deployed in Alaska and California involves interceptors which would fly out into space and try to hit, head-on, a missile coming from, say, North Korea. The trouble is, that system has done very poorly in flight-intercept tests  and its been getting worse over time, when it ought to be getting better. If you go back over each test since, say, 2000, and look at why it failed, the reasons have varied. A couple failed because the interceptor never got off the ground; a couple failed because the interceptor never separated from its rocket booster. Its one of the most difficult things the Pentagon has ever tried to do. Youre trying to hit an enemy target thats going 1517,000 miles an hour. Youre going so fast that if you miss by an inch, you can miss by a mile. Meanwhile, what our development of this intercept system is doing is encouraging other countries to build better offense systems, so that they can overwhelm our missile defenses. Typically in the tests, theres only one target. Youre trying to shoot down one missile with another missile. Theres no reason why, if Russia were intent on attacking the United States, they would do it that way. They wouldnt just shoot one missile out of the blue and see what happened  they would fire large numbers of them. Recently Russia tested an intermediate-range missile that could be nuclear  that could hit Europe, lets say. If Russia builds a bunch of those, the missile defenses were building in Europe right now, in conjunction with NATO will be overwhelmed also. Our system in Europe has interceptors deployed in Romania, and proposed to be deployed, in a year or two, in Poland. Russia hates it because they think its aimed at them, and conservative members of Congress say it ought to be aimed at Russia  just reinforcing what Russia worries about. So Russias inclination is to be able to overwhelm that system by building more and more missiles. So its a vicious cycle?Yes, thats how it works out. If Russia were deploying missile-defense systems in Cuba or Mexico, close to our borders, in the way that Romania and Poland are close to their borders, we wouldnt like that either. And if the numbers got very large, wed be just as concerned as Russia is. What is your worst nightmare of a nuclear disaster?I have two. One is that somebody builds or steals a nuclear weapon, overseas somewhere. A military faction, for instance. William Perry, the former secretary of Defense under Clinton, has a video outlining how this could happen. The other is that the United States and Russia will get into another nuclear-arms race and create a much more dangerous world than weve had heretofore. You see this in Congress, where various members are calling for new nuclear capabilities on the part of the United States  which, obviously, Russia and China would feel they had to respond to. You see it also in a recent Defense Science Board report, where they recommend low-yield nuclear weapons as a way of deterring Russia  the idea being that, because theyre low-yield, its more believable that we would actually use them. But, of course, if the idea is to make them more usable, that makes them more dangerous  because they might actually get used! Theres a new bill Congress is working on called the Intermediate-Range Forces Treaty Preservation Act. Its ironic that they call it that. It would be more accurate to call it the Violation Act, because the things it recommends would all be violations of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty [a 1987 agreement that the U.S. and Russia would eliminate all their ground-launched missiles with a certain range capacity]. It hasnt been voted on or anything, so maybe it will never happen. But for example, theyre calling for a dual program of a dual-capable  meaning they could be nuclear or nonnuclear  road-mobile missile-launch system, with ranges between 500 kilometers and, say, 6,000 kilometers. Obviously, if the United States did something like that, Russia and China would feel very concerned and feel they had to respond. So this kind of sword-rattling could ultimately make the world a much more dangerous place. By and large, Americans arent viscerally afraid of nuclear war in the way they were in the 1950s and 60s. But how close are we actually to the threat of a nuclear holocaust, compared to the situation during the Cold War?Until very recently, I would have said that we were moving farther and farther away from nuclear war, because the U.S. and Russian stockpiles have been going down, and because other countries that have nuclear weapons have been restrained. They could have built many more than they have so far. And because of this general attitude that nuclear weapons are simply not acceptable anymore, as a moral matter, and that no sane U.S. president would ever use them. But more recently, with the sword-rattling we are talking about, Ive become more concerned. You mean since the last campaign cycle began?Exactly."}, {"date": "2017/03/13", "title": "Democrats Best Bet for 2018: Accentuate the Negative", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/democrats-best-bet-for-2018-accentuate-the-negative.html", "text": " One of the big arguments about the catastrophe that engulfed Democrats last November 8 involves the alleged insufficiency of Hillary Clintons positive message for what she would do as president. This is a particularly frequent criticism levied by former supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders, who thought a populist economic message might have trumped Trump in ways that negative attacks on his character and issue positions could not achieve. In many cases this was, of course, part of a larger argument that a candidate like Clinton was disabled owing to her Wall Street ties and allegedly unprincipled centrism, but the sour grapes involved do not invalidate the claim that going medieval on Trump was not enough. This may be an argument worth continuing in the run-up to the next presidential election, when another Democrat will likely face Trump. But the case for a positive agenda for Democrats in 2020 should not be confused with the very different question of what might work in the midterm elections of 2018. And the best answer for 2018 is that Democrats should accentuate the negative all day long. As Michelle Cottle argues persuasively at the Atlantic, midterms are fundamentally different from presidential elections in that they are almost always a referendum on the party controlling the White House, not comparative contests with positive and negative messages from each party competing on an equal plane. She quotes political scientist Larry Sabato on the recent history of midterms: Some might argue that 1994, when Republicans conquered Congress after campaigning on a vague but comprehensive-sounding ten-point Contract With America, shows the potential power of a positive midterm message. Thats the legend, but in truth Pew found on the eve of that election that only one in three voters had ever heard of the contract, and it had virtually no net effect on voting preferences. It is true that midterm negativity can be taken to counterproductive lengths, as occurred in 1998 when the GOP effort to impeach Bill Clinton backfired pretty badly. Four years later, Democrats struggled even more in a midterm, partly because they alternated between attacking and agreeing with George W. Bush in that security-haunted era, and partly because 9/11 gave Bush a level of extraordinary popularity that had only partially worn off by 2002 (his approval rating on Election Day was 63 percent). By and large, though, the presidential party loses ground in midterms, and the opposition party can enhance the natural backlash by piling on, not by offering alternative courses of action that most voters will simply ignore. Cottle emphasizes the example set by Democrats last time they were in this position, after George W. Bush was reelected along with GOP majorities in Congress. They began by going crazy negative on W.s proposal to partially privatize Social Security, and then W.s own mistakes began to snowball: The durable bitterness of the Clinton-Sanders contest of 2016 should not obscure the fact that Democrats maintained a significantly broader ideological tent in 2006 than they do today, if only because the partys Southern wing had not entirely atrophied. Democrats would have been hard-pressed to come up with a unifying, positive agenda. So they didnt even try, and prospered anyway. Donald Trump dominates the political landscape today in ways that George W. Bush  or indeed, any president since Ronald Reagan, or arguably Lyndon Johnson  could not have dreamed of equaling. His popularity ratio, however, is far worse than any recent president at this early stage of his presidency. It is an environment tailor-made for a bad White House midterm and for an opposition focused intently on making it worse. For a donkey party searching to regain its kick, the positive stuff can come later."}, {"date": "2017/03/12", "title": "New Documentary Suggests Michael Brown Did Not Rob Ferguson Store", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/documentary-claims-michael-brown-did-not-rob-ferguson-store.html", "text": " A new documentary about the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown at the hands of a Ferguson, Missouri, police officer contains previously unreported security footage which, according to the filmmaker and Browns family, complicates the police narrative about Browns final moments. Though the new footage does not pertain to the shooting itself, they claim it demonstrates that the black teenager did not, as Ferguson police had claimed, rob a convenience store in the minutes before he was confronted and killed by officer Darren Wilson on August 9, 2014. After Browns death, police had released security footage, taken minutes before Brown encountered Wilson, from a nearby convenience store that shows the teen assaulting a store employee and taking packages of cigarillos. Per the New York Times, the new documentary Stranger Fruit, which premiered on Saturday at the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, releases new security footage from the same store that the film uses as evidence to contend that Brown had already paid for the cigarillos the previous evening via a trade. The new footage, recorded at around 1 a.m. on August 9  about 11 hours before Browns fatal encounter with Wilson  shows the teen giving something to employees at the store, which Stranger Fruit filmmaker Jason Pollock contends was a small bag of marijuana. In the video, the store clerks are seen inspecting and smelling the bag. They then put two boxes of cigarillos in a bag and hand them to Brown, who walks away, then quickly returns and hands the bag back to the clerks, who put it behind the counter. It seems, from the video, that Brown and the store employees may have known each other. Pollack and Browns mother assert that Brown had in fact traded some weed for the cigarillos, then had the store employees hold them for him. When Brown returned later that day, they argue, he was simply attempting to pick them up from a different employee. A lawyer for the convenience store, Jay Kanzler, disputes this claim to the Times, saying that, There was no understanding [between Brown and the clerks]. No agreement. Those folks didnt sell him cigarillos for pot. The reason he gave it back is he was walking out the door with unpaid merchandise and they wanted it back. Around 12 p.m. on August 9, Brown and a friend were recorded returning to the store, and that footage shows Brown shoving a clerk and taking cigarillos. Wilson, who said he was notified by police dispatch of the store robbery and descriptions of the suspects, then confronted Brown and his friend nearby. Thats when the controversial shooting happened. Pollack, who works with filmmaker Michael Moore, sought out the video after reading a minor comment about it in a police report. He speculates that the police only released the second video because they wanted to destroy Browns character after his death, and not releasing the earlier video shows their intention to make [Brown] look bad and indicates a suppression of evidence. A spokesperson for the St. Louis County Police told the Times that they did not release the earlier video because they did not believe it was relevant to the investigation into the shooting. Wilson, who claimed he shot Brown in self defense, was eventually cleared of wrongdoing in the case by both a grand jury and federal investigators, but Browns death  which was widely perceived to be racially motivated  and the large-scale Ferguson protests which followed it, became one of the key events leading to the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement and an important national debate about police violence, profiling, and criminal justice. Browns parents have filed a federal civil suit against Wilson and the city of Ferguson over the death of their son."}, {"date": "2017/03/12", "title": "McCain: Trump Should Prove Wiretapping Claim or Retract It", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/mccain-trump-should-prove-wiretapping-claim-or-retract-it.html", "text": " Senator John McCain said on Sunday that he expects President Trump to either provide evidence for his claim that President Obama ordered a wiretap on him, or retract the accusation. Appearing on CNNs State of the Union, the Arizona Republican was asked by host Jake Tapper about Trumps assertion, last weekend, that Obama had ordered an illegal wiretap on him and Trump Tower during the run-up to last years presidential election. McCain said he has no reason to believe that the charge is true. To leave such an allegation out there, McCain insisted, undermines the confidence the American people have in the entire way that the government does business. All he has to do is pick up the phone, call the director of the CIA, director of national intelligence and say, Okay, what happened? McCain told Tapper. But Trump, rather than consulting or empowering the federal agencies under his control, has instead only called on Congress to investigate Obama over his claim. In addition, most reporting since Trumps tweetstormed accusation a week ago has indicated that the sole source of the presidents information was likely a Breitbart article about an unsubstantiated right-wing conspiracy theory, meaning its unlikely that Trump will be willing or able to provide the evidence McCain is calling for. President Obamas spokesperson, as well as several Obama administration officials, have all rejected Trumps claim. The House Intelligence Committee has reportedly asked the Trump administration to provide evidence for the presidents allegations by Monday, and last week the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee formally requested any Justice Department or FBI documents related to the alleged wiretaps as well. Trump himself ignored repeated requests from a reporter on Friday to back up his wiretap accusation. In addition, no one in his administration has been willing to support or even personally agree with Trumps allegations either. And in the unlikely event that there is evidence of a judge-approved FISA warrant to tap Trump and/or Trump Tower, that would draw even more attention and lend credence to the concerns that Trump officials had ties to Russia during the campaign. McCain weighed in on that subject during Sundays State of the Union interview too: Responding to the story that longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone had admitted messaging with the the Guccifer 2.0 hacker or hackers who claimed responsibility for hacking the Democratic National Committee last year, Trump McCain said that he believes Stone and others in the Trump campaign need to be questioned:"}, {"date": "2017/03/12", "title": "Winter Is Still Coming: New York Faces Possible Blizzard Starting Monday Night", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/new-york-faces-possible-blizzard-starting-monday-night.html", "text": " The National Weather Service has issued a blizzard watch for parts of the northeast coast starting late Monday night, and the powerful approaching noreaster is currently forecast to deposit as much as 12-to-18 inches of snow on the New York Metro Area.

Travel shutdowns, power outages, and other problems are probably on tap as well since northeastern trees, deceived by the balmy February, have already been leafing out, which in combination with wet snow and high winds may mean a lot of fallen branches or worse. A snow alert has already been issued by the city, and coastal flooding may also be an issue. Everywhere from D.C. to Maine and all the way west to the Dakotas are expected to get some snow through Wednesday: One forecast model shows the capital area getting as much as 10-to-15 inches, but not all models agree at this point, and temperatures seem like they will be warmer in the South. The precise track and intensity of the storm remains uncertain as of Sunday morning, but you should probably expect a seriously snowy Tuesday, as well as a lot of references to this classic Simpsons clip:"}, {"date": "2017/03/11", "title": "White House Amateur Hour Continues With U.S. Attorney Purge", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/white-house-amateur-hour-continues-with-u-s-attorney-purge.html", "text": " If the Trump administration wanted to appoint its own set of U.S. attorneys, no one would have had much of a reason to deny it the privilege. Most new administrations clean house in this area sooner or later, with more or less notice to the appointees being removed. But thats the rub: It wasnt sooner or later, it was right now, with no notice to the affected parties. The lack of preparation for this sudden purge provided another example of how inappropriate the presidents description of his administration as a fine-tuned machine actually is, and drew more negative attention than was necessary. And so, the fate of Preet Bharara hung fire, as did the fates of the only two U.S. attorneys whose resignations have been rejected by the president, current Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente (who was still calling U.S. attorneys even as their collective demise was announced) and Deputy Attorney General nominee Ron Rosenstein. The handling of this abrupt bureaucratic massacre reinforced the impression of a paranoid administration fearfully looking here and there for deep state spies more loyal to Barack Obama  or perhaps the law and Constitution and the oaths they have taken  than to Donald Trump. That impression was certainly supported by White House press secretary Sean Spicers comments on the very day the U.S. attorney firings occurred: He probably wasnt talking about U.S. attorneys, but who can be blamed for identifying the attitude with the action?

Stone told the Washington Times that he exchanged private Twitter messages with the person or people who used the pseudonym Guccifer 2.0 in August. Guccifer 2.0, self identifying as a Romanian hacktivist, took credit for compromising the DNC and supplying what was obtained in the hack to WikiLeaks. U.S. intelligence officials, meanwhile, say that the Guccifer persona was in fact a front for hackers directed by the Russian government with the intent of intervening in the election on behalf of then-candidate Donald Trump. The investigation into that meddling, as well as any possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, is ongoing. Stone downplayed the messages to the Times, explaining that the conversation was so perfunctory, brief and banal I had forgotten it. He also supplied what he said were screenshots of three private Twitter messages. The exchange apparently followed Stones writing of a Breitbart post, which claimed the DNC hack was perpetrated by Guccifer 2.0 instead of the Russian government. Transcribes the Times: I myself had no contacts or communications with the Russian State, Russian Intelligence or anyone fronting for them or acting as intermediaries for them, Stone further insisted to the Times, asking how he could have been directing the hacks if the messages happened after the fact. Stone, however, has recently bragged about having had a back channel to WikiLeaks during the campaign after having also touted his communication with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at an event in August. (WikiLeaks then denied there had ever been any contact between them and Stone.) WikiLeaks, of course, went on to slowly leak Clinton campaign manager John Podestas emails  which were allegedly obtained by Guccifer 2.0  starting in October. Back in August, less than two weeks after mentioning his communication with WikiLeaks, Stone tweeted, Trust me, it will soon the Podestas time in the barrel."}, {"date": "2017/03/11", "title": "Preet Bharara Fired After Refusing Trump Administrations Order to Resign", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/u-s-attorney-preet-bharara-is-refusing-trump-order-to-resign.html", "text": " U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara has been fired by the Trump administration after refusing an order to resign. Bharara was one of the 46 Obama-appointed federal prosecutors who were told to submit their resignations on Friday by the Justice Department, and he confirmed that he both refused to resign, and was then fired, in a tweet on Saturday: Following his election in November, President Trump had asked Bharara  arguably the most celebrated prosecutor in the country  to stay on at his current post during a meeting between the two men at Trump Tower. Senator Chuck Schumer said in a statement that Trump had also assured him that he wanted Bharara to stick around during a November phone call that Trump had initiated. Instead, on Friday, Bharara and 45 other U.S. attorneys appointed by President Obama were suddenly told to submit their resignations, and some didnt even find out about the order until reading about it on social media. What made the request all the more surprising was the fact that, according to NBC News, Attorney General Jeff Sessions had apparently spoken with the prosecutors on a Thursday conference call and gave no hint of the impending demand, even ending a call by telling them happy hunting. It is not abnormal for a new presidential administration to replace the U.S. attorneys appointed by a previous administration, but typically it is not done in such a sudden, seemingly unprepared manner. The Justice Department order also came less than 24 hours after Sean Hannity, a Fox News commentator whose show President Trump often watches, called for a purge of all President Obamas appointees at the Justice Department and elsewhere in the federal government. Last month, it was reported that Bharara was investigating Fox News over settlements paid to employees who had charged the organizations former chair and CEO Roger Ailes with sexual harassment. The focus of that investigation was to determine whether or not Fox News failed to inform shareholders of the settlements, violating criminal law. Ailes was forced out at Fox News in July following an internal investigation into the sexual-harassment allegations made against Ailes by multiple women. The Fox News investigation was just one of the many that Bharara was overseeing as the U.S. attorney for New Yorks Southern District. The Daily News has compiled a helpful list of those ongoing cases, as well as Bhararas many victories, here. New Yorks Southern District also encompasses Manhattan, where President Trump lived before moving to the White House. Last week, Trump accused President Obama of ordering illegal wiretaps of him and Trump Tower during the run up to Election Day, though Trump has provided absolutely no evidence to support his accusation, which was likely based on a right-wing conspiracy theory. Prior to Bhararas termination, some Republican lawmakers in New York had already been expressing their support for the prosecutor, who has made a bipartisan name for himself fighting corruption in the state. The minority leader of the New York State Assembly, Brian Kolb, tweeted Good for Preet, he is doing the job he was appointed to do! after seeing the news that Bharara had refused the resignation order. On Friday, GOP assemblyman Steve McLaughlin said he was opposed to the resignation as well, tweeting that [Its] definitely not a wise move at all if [Bharara] was asked to resign. This should be immediately reconsidered by [Attorney General] Sessions. Big mistake. McLaughlin then tried to start a social-media campaign to save Bhararas job: This post has been updated to reflect the news that Bharara was fired after refusing the resignation order."}, {"date": "2017/03/11", "title": "Muhammad Ali Jr. Says He Was Detained at Airport Again", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/muhammad-ali-jr-says-he-was-detained-at-airport-again.html", "text": " The son of legendary boxer Muhammad Ali says he has been detained at a U.S. airport for the second time. Muhammad Ali Jr., who last month claimed that he had been stopped by border agents and questioned about his name and religion upon returning to the U.S. from abroad, now says he was stopped and questioned again on Friday at Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C., this time after coming to the nations capital to lobby against racial profiling and to speak to lawmakers about his first detention. Alis friend and lawyer, Chris Mancini, told the Daily News that Ali Jr. was stopped at a JetBlue check-in counter on Friday, then detained by Homeland Security officials for 20-25 minutes after they rejected his state-issued ID. Ali Jr. was then not allowed to continue to his flight until he produced his U.S. passport, which he ultimately did. Reached for comment by the Daily News, a TSA spokesperson disputed the idea that Ali Jr. had been detained, or that the delay was as long as Ali claimed. The TSA instead stated that the delay was because a call was made to confirm Mr. Alis identity with TSA officials. We sometimes have to verify the identity of passengers, the TSA added, also insisting that, We work to resolve the problem as quickly as possible, which in this case took 11 minutes. Regarding Ali. Jr.s ID, the TSA said that his Illinois-issued identification card, which was not a drivers license, was not valid for flying. Mancini thinks the incident was retaliation, however. Ali Jr. had just shared the story of his first detention with U.S. lawmakers on Thursday at a forum in D.C., and Mancini speculated that quite obviously hes now been put on a different status, since Ali Jr. had no trouble with his ID on the trip to Washington  only on the way back after speaking about his first detention. If Ali Jr. had an official identification card issued by the state of Illinois, that seems like it should have been sufficient to use as ID when flying domestically. Mancini said that the family is filing a complaint with the Department of Homeland Security as well as planning a lawsuit. According to Ali Jr., he was profiled and detained by border agents for nearly two hours on February 7 after landing in the U.S. on a flight from Jamaica, then asked if he was a Muslim and where he got his name from. On Thursday, Ali Jr. told Democratic members of the House that I believe they were religiously and racially profiling me. Customs and Border Protection ultimately denied that Ali Jr., or anyone, would be profiled, but also would not explain why Ali Jr. and his mother required additional screening on that day, citing privacy concerns. Congressmember and former chair of the DNC Debbie Wasserman Schultz was on the same flight back to Florida as Ali Jr. and tweeted that his detention was an act of religious profiling:"}, {"date": "2017/03/10", "title": "The DOJ Just Called for the Firing of 46 Obama-Appointed U.S. States Attorneys", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/doj-just-fired-of-46-obama-appointed-u-s-states-attorneys.html", "text": " Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked the remaining 46 U.S. Attorneys who were appointed during Obamas tenure to tender their resignations.

Bharara, who was appointed by Obama in 2009, told reporters in November that then-president-elect Donald Trump had asked him to stay at his post. At the time, Bharara also said that he had filled in his future boss, Sessions, of his decision: He also asked that I stay on, and so I expect that I will be continuing. But the Justice Departments latest move does appear to include Bharara. Sources told the New York Times that the high-profile prosecutor received a call from Dana Boente, the acting deputy attorney general, asking him to resign. The Justice Department later confirmed. A spokesman for Bharara declined to comment earlier. Theres always the chance that the White House and Sessions refuse Bhararas resignation.

But no publication has had a more mutually beneficial relationship with our new president than Breitbart. Trumps campaign brought the sites brand of reactionary populism into the mainstream  and its former mastermind into the West Wing. By the time the ballots were cast, no other news outlet had grown its audience more over the 2016 cycle. And Breitbart, of course, supplied Trump with a megaphone, a strategist, and relentlessly positive coverage  even when the moguls campaign manager low-key battered one of the sites reporters. So, Breitbarts latest headline on the Trump-Ryan health-care plan is probably causing some consternation at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Perhaps the most shocking thing about Breitbarts headline is its accuracy. Trumpcare is a much less generous program than Obamacare  and its cuts will be felt, disproportionately, by the people who wanted Trump to Make America Great Again. Among the reasons why this is the case: (1) The bill raises the cap on how much more insurers can charge old people than young people for the same coverage. (2) Unlike Obamacare, the size of the bills subsidies dont adjust to the cost of health insurance in a given market  everyone in the same age group gets the same subsidy, no matter where they live. But health insurance costs a lot more in rural areas than it does in urban ones, where theres the more competition between insurers. Thus, Paul Ryans plan actually works out pretty well for the young, urban elites who voted for Clinton  but it just hammers the older, rural, working-class voters who backed Trump. As the New York Times Nate Cohn writes: Its one thing for the (failing) New York Times to state this plain fact. Its quite another for one of the (Trump-era) conservative movements most trusted news sources to say the same. For most on the right, the chief complaint with Ryans bill is that its too generous. Instead of the market-based solution conservatives were promised, this bill is Obamacare Lite. And theres a whiff of this in Breitbarts piece, which refers to Ryans bill as Obamacare 2.0. But the outlets analysis recognizes that virtually no one wants to live in Rand Pauls anarcho-capitalist wonderland  they want better, more affordable health care, like the Republican Party has been promising them, over and over, for eight years. Per Breitbart: The truth is, theres no Republican alternative to Obamacare that wouldnt betray a large swath of Trumps base. You cant make the ACA work better for older, working-class people when your partys first priority in reforming the law is to eliminate the part that transfers billions of dollars from millionaires to older, working-class people. Breitbarts piece seems to intuit this, even if it never mentions the tax issue (and concentrates its populist fury on the prospect that the law might keep some illegals from dying preventable deaths). The articles final recommendation is not for Trump to pursue a different health-care law, but rather to concentrate on passing pro-American immigration reform, so as to end the era of cheap labor, low wages, mass immigration, hollowed-out communities, family disintegration, drug addiction, and suicide. Breitbart is probably wrong to suggest that building a border wall will end the era of low wages and suicide. But, at least it knows that repealing Obamacare wont end that era, either. And now, so do a good number of the presidents most avid supporters."}, {"date": "2017/03/10", "title": "Watch Paul Ryan Try to Defend the GOP Health-Care Bill", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/watch-paul-ryan-try-to-defend-the-gop-health-care-bill.html", "text": "  Dont worry.

Ambassador Churkins diplomatic immunity survives his death, the medical examiners spokeswoman Julie Bolcer said in a statement Friday. Churkin died last month, after collapsing in his office on February 20. An initial autopsy was inconclusive and more tests were reportedly needed, heightening the mystery around his death.

In another letter to Mayor Bill de Blasios international affairs office, dated March 1, James Donovan of the State Department wrote, The United States has an obligation to take all appropriate steps to protect his dignity.

In his column, Burd took on the question at the heart of health-care reform: How can public policy improve citizens health outcomes while also containing the aggregate cost of care? The grocery executives answer was simple: Allow employers to punish the unhealthy behaviors of their workers more severely. Burd explained that, in 2005, Safeway had instituted a voluntary wellness program, which gave employees the opportunity to undergo tests of their tobacco usage, body fat, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. If they passed all four tests, their annual premiums were reduced by $780 for individuals and $1,560 for families. Or, put another way, if Safeway employees failed any of the tests  or refused to participate in the voluntary program  their premiums were increased by $780 for individuals and $1,560 for families. This system allowed Safeway to achieve the unthinkable: Between 2005 and 2009, the company kept its per capita health-care costs flat, even as most American companies saw theirs increase by 38 percent. Today, we are constrained by current laws from increasing these incentives, Burd noted. If these limits are appropriately increased, I am confident Safeways per capita health-care costs will decline for at least another five years as our work force becomes healthier. Burds message was cheered on both sides of the aisle. Technocratic liberals appreciated Safeways nanny-state-esque approach to nudging its employees into healthier choices, while conservatives welcomed any opportunity to increase the freedom of bosses to coerce the behavior of their workers. The Safeway program has proven so successful that the company wants to increase its incentives for rewarding healthy behavior, Mitch McConnell said, shortly after Burds op-ed was published. Unfortunately, current laws restrict it from doing so. One month later, Barack Obama hailed the great job Safeway had done in helping encourage its employees to get fit. The so-called Safeway Amendment was added to the ACA. Now, if you fail, or refuse to take part in, your employers voluntary wellness test, it can increase your premium by 30 percent  or, if youre a smoker who refuses to quit, by 50 percent. There is no evidence that this new rule produced a significant drop in Americas health-care costs. And that isnt terribly surprising  since Burds column was composed almost entirely of lies. [A] review of Safeway documents and interviews with company officials show that the company did not keep health-care costs flat for four years, the Washington Post reported in January 2010. Those costs did drop in 2006  by 12.5 percent. That was when the company overhauled its benefits  the decline did not have anything to do with tying employees premiums to test results. That element of Safeways benefits plan was not implemented until 2009. In other words, Safeway reduced costs for a single year by raising its employees deductibles. It didnt save money by encouraging its workers to lead healthier lives  it saved money by making its workers pay a larger portion of their health-care costs. And this is the story of the corporate wellness craze, more broadly. As Slates L.V. Anderson explains: This conclusion isnt just supported by virtually every study on corporate-wellness programs that isnt funded by those who profit from them. Its also supported by common sense. Many serious health conditions arent especially sensitive to behavior (asthma, Crohns disease, etc.). And those that can be impacted by lifestyle interventions arent common in the working-age population. As Anderson writes, cancer, heart attacks, stroke, and diabetes usually dont hit until retirement, even among people who have had bad habits all along. Now that its public knowledge that the story behind the Safeway Amendment was a lie  and that there is little science to support that lies broader premise  you might think that Congress would scrap the provision. If so, you dont know Congress. Rather than roll back the Safeway Amendment, the House GOP is working to expand its reach. Per Stat News: The Houses bill is one part of phase two of the GOPs health-insurance-reform plan  a package of regulatory reforms that cant pass through the reconciliation process, and, thus, need Democratic votes in the Senate. The American Benefits Council, which represents large employers, argues that their inability to coerce workers into presenting their genetic information puts at risk the availability and effectiveness of workplace wellness programs, thereby depriving employees of improved health and productivity. Under the terms of the bill, employees names would be removed from their genetic tests before those tests are handed over to employers. This would, ostensibly, allow companies to target the aggregate genetic vulnerabilities of their employees through their wellness programs, while preserving individuals privacy rights. However, at a small company  where it isnt terribly difficult to match a genetic profile to an individual  it could allow a firm to covertly identify workers who present a high risk of becoming expensive in the future. Which is to say: It might provide them an end run around their workers disability protections. It also might allow the wellness firms that companies contract with to make a quick buck. As Stat notes: Its almost as though entities that define their own wellness by the size of their profit margins cant be trusted to promote the wellness of the human beings that they view as labor costs."}, {"date": "2017/03/10", "title": "Trump Already Wavering on Trumpcare", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/trump-already-wavering-on-trumpcare.html", "text": " The last thing the imperiled GOP effort to repeal and replace Obamacare needs right now is confusion at the very top. But thats what they have, thanks to the mixed signals coming out of the White House about the presidents willingness to deal away major provisions of Trumpcare involving the speed with which the Affordable Care Acts Medicaid expansion is canceled. At a meeting with conservative leaders and OMB director Mick Mulvaney earlier this week, Trump heard complaints about the House bills generous two-year grace period for states to continue the Medicaid expansion before federal support starts to wither away and a cap on spending is imposed. According to one account from House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Trump indicated such changes in policy might be accommodated in a later bill  in other words, maana. But according to two senior administration officials and a senior House conservative aide who spoke to CNN yesterday, Trump is privately lining up behind demands from the partys right that the original Trumpcare bill be changed to kill the Medicaid expansion right away, by the end of 2017. If the latter report is accurate, Trump could be playing with fire, and perhaps making passage of the bill in the Senate impossible. Republican Senators representing states that expanded Medicaid were already in danger of defecting on Trumpcare because of complaints from GOP governors that its Medicaid provisions might endanger coverage for many beneficiaries added to the rolls up until now. Accelerating the disruption of Medicaid certainly wont help. And the longer conservatives are given the impression that they can secure concessions from Trump  with or without the knowledge or consent of Paul Ryan or Mitch McConnell  the less likely they will salute if congressional leaders order them to maintain discipline and vote for the bill as introduced.

The retired general had established himself as a proud Islamophobe  one who believed that fear of Muslims is rational, and that Democrats had tried to impose Sharia law on the state of Florida. But Flynn wasnt merely a delusional bigot (a title that belongs on the rsums of no small number of Trump appointees)  he was a delusional bigot who could be bought. In July 2016, Flynn hailed the coup attempt against Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan as an event worth clapping for. This is about what youd expect Flynn to say. Erdogan is an Islamist, after all. But in an op-ed published on Election Day, Flynn struck a radically different note. Four months after cheering an attempt on Erdogans life, the Trump campaign surrogate criticized the Obama administration for keeping the Turkish president at arms length  and demanded that the U.S. extradite the man Erdogan blamed for the coup, Fethullah Glen, who resides in Pennsylvania. The following week, Politico revealed that Flynns new perspective had less to do with a change of heart than with a change of clientele: Shortly after the failed coup, a Dutch company owned by a close ally of Erdogan hired Flynns firm to lobby on behalf of the Turkish government in D.C. Flynn collected payments from that company, even as he received classified intelligence briefings during the campaigns final stages  when Trump was savaging Hillary Clinton for supposedly selling influence to foreign governments. All this was all reported, in major news outlets, the week that Flynns appointment was announced. On Tuesday, Flynn filed paperwork with the Justice Department, formally identifying himself as a foreign agent, and acknowledging his work on behalf of the Dutch firm (and/or the Turkish government). On Thursday, the White House said that President Trump was not aware that Flynn had worked to advance the interests of the Turkish government at the time he hired him. Which is to say: The Trump administrations official line is that it appointed Flynn to one of the most powerful positions in the American government without bothering to Google him. But the White House may be more dishonest than negligent. On Friday, the Trump administration confirmed with Associated Press that the presidents transition team was informed before Inauguration Day that former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn might need to register as a foreign agent with the Justice Department.

The reason for this is that the Republican Party is unique among mainstream parties in its anti-statist ideology, and especially its fervent opposition to economic redistribution. And health insurance at its core is about redistribution. People who are too poor and sick to cover the cost of their own medical care need to be financed by those who arent, or else they wont be able to get it. One of the ways this principle pops up is in the fight over the essential benefits required by the Affordable Care Act. Obamacare regulated insurance, and defines it as a product that covers certain basic treatments. Republicans deeply oppose those requirements, on the grounds that people who dont need a certain kind of treatment shouldnt have to pay for insurance that covers it. Their posture against regulation and one-size-all requirements that big-government bureaucrats want to decide for the American people sounds better in the abstract than it does when applied to the particular. When Republicans are asked which treatments they think should be removed from the essential benefits list, their best example is usually  prenatal care. It came up in a debate in Congress again yesterday: What about men having to purchase prenatal care? asked Republican representative John Shimkus. Why should men have to pay for your damn babies? One obvious answer is that the half of the human race whose bodies are equipped for childbirth should not necessarily have to bear all the financial costs of it, given that both genders have a role in procreation and an investment in its success. But this answer brings us back to the logic of mutual obligation, and a vision of society in which a person endowed with a financial benefit (the lack of a potentially expensive uterus) should have to share his bounty with those not so fortunate. So, to the modern conservative mind Shimkus raises a rhetorical question that is easily answered in the negative."}, {"date": "2017/03/10", "title": "The U.S. Economy Created 235,000 New Jobs in the First Full Month Under Trump", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/economy-created-225-000-jobs-in-the-first-month-under-trump.html", "text": " The first official jobs report to fall entirely within the Trump presidency was released Friday morning, and it showed continued solid job growth, though nothing new or spectacular. The report indicated 235,000 net new jobs for February, well above the consensus expectation of 190,000, but also well under the 298,000 unofficial estimate by ADP that excited a lot of Trump fans earlier this week. The numbers were remarkably consistent with Januarys, which showed a 227,000 net job increase. The official unemployment rate ticked marginally down, to 4.7 percent, exactly were it was in December. Wage growth, at 6 cents (it was 5 cents in January), remains tepid, but probably strong enough to justify another small interest-rate hike by the Federal Reserve Board later this month. You can expect the White House to engage in some chest-thumping over these numbers. But the fact remains that aside from the sustained stock-market rally, overall economic gains at the beginning of the Trump era are, so far, modest. Heres how a Reuters report summarized what we know so far: Trump has pledged to raise GDP growth to 4 percent right away. The February jobs report is pretty good, but no confirmation at all that he will be able to keep his promise. This post and its headlines have been updated with the correct number of new jobs for February."}, {"date": "2017/03/10", "title": "Obamas Economy Didnt Elect Trump. But It Might Reelect Him.", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/obamas-economy-didnt-elect-trump-but-it-might-reelect-him.html", "text": " The liberal explanation for the result of the election emphasizes Hillary Clintons deep personal unpopularity, which grew out of a combination of her own bad decisions, hostile media coverage, an overblown email scandal, and the decisive intervention of FBI director James Comey. Both the right and the far left have drawn different conclusions, which use Clintons defeat as an indictment of the entire liberal policy agenda. David Brady, a political scientist at the conservative Hoover Institute, tells Tom Edsall, Why did Kankakee, Illinois, and Green Bay vote Obama and then Trump? They didnt become racist and misogynistic over the last 8 years. It has to do with the effects of slow-growth economies over time on peoples psyches. The left-wing writer Matt Stoller has made the same point repeatedly. Obama cant place the blame for Clintons poor performance purely on her campaign. On the contrary, the past eight years of policy-making have damaged Democrats at all levels, he wrote in January. Trump is the price well be paying for more than 25 years of failed Democratic policy-making, he writes this month. The argument boils down Clintons election to a simple causal chain. Obamas policies led to slow economic growth, which led to voter anger or disillusionment with Obamas presidency, which voters transferred by proxy onto his successor candidate, Hillary Clinton. This line of reasoning has come to appear so self-evidently true that many analysts on the right and the left have discussed the election as though Trump defeated Obama, with Clintons role almost incidental. Many of them assert that those of us who dont share this belief are in a bubble of elitist denial, failing to grasp the popular discontent with Obamas status quo. The supposition that Clinton lost because of her association with Obama, rather than despite it, ignores a great deal of publicly available data about both figures. At election time, Obama was quite popular, and Clinton quite unpopular. While Clinton was less unpopular than her opponent through most of the campaign, one recent analysis shows that the floor dropped beneath her support after the Comey letter came out: If there was a bubble, it was political insiders who saw Clintons email issue as a small-bore routine problem, not the image-defining scandal most Americans came to see it as. I know several Democratic political operatives who heard from swing voters who believe Clinton routinely had people murdered. Insiders never saw how badly the email issue poisoned her image, holding queasy Republicans in Trumps corner and depressing her turnout. The theory that Obamas economic policies hurt Clinton also has trouble explaining why Obama was able to win comfortably in 2012. After all, the economy was in worse shape in 2012 than in 2016, and Obamas approval was higher. So why did economic discontent with Obama hurt Democrats more in 2016 than in 2012? Indeed, the more we learn about the economy, the harder it gets to sustain the theory that Obamas economy hurt Clinton. Economic data arrives in lags, and is often revised years later before a truly accurate picture forms. Many of the indictments of Obamas economy rely on old data that does not capture his entire presidency. This turns out to be especially significant. Financial crises tend to produce slow recoveries. The elevated unemployment caused by the worldwide collapse of the financial system took about half a dozen years to come down. During that time, a glut of workers led to stagnant wages. Many of the indictments of the economy during this period reflect data collected in 2013 or 2014. Bernie Sanders repeatedly insisted on the campaign that some huge percentage of wage growth was accruing to the richest 1 percent, which was accurate in the early, slow-growth years of the recovery, but was no longer true at the time he said it. Since 2015, low unemployment has had the predictable effect of forcing employers to offer better wages to attract and keep their labor force. While incomplete, the data so far suggests wages up and down the income ladder have grown smartly for two years. In 2015, wages actually grew more rapidly at the bottom of the income ladder than at the top: Growth of jobs and wages continued through 2016 and into 2017, and income trends are likely to show that last year extended the same broad-based growth dynamic as the year before. The slow recovery from the financial crisis eventually yielded an impressive, still-ongoing recovery that is producing broad-based increases in the standard of living. Many of the indictments of Obamas policies were formed early in his administration. (Stoller, among others, has been making this critique since Obamas first term.) There is a case to be made that the fiscal response to the recession was too small, unnecessarily elongating the recovery. That said, the economy under Obama did reach low unemployment and it has, at last, produced impressive wage gains for the working class. If any number of factors had turned out differently, from Comey to WikiLeaks, people would be talking about the Obama-Clinton boom. The evaluations of his economic record that are able to account for all the data will yield conclusions far more favorable than most people afforded Obama at the time. In the meantime, the political credit will accrue to the president who inherited an economy humming along at low unemployment. Obamas economic policies may wind up helping Trump after all. But if they do, it will not be because they helped get Trump elected, but because they helped him get reelected."}, {"date": "2017/03/10", "title": "Is Intersectionality a Religion?", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/is-intersectionality-a-religion.html", "text": " Heres the latest in the assault on liberal democracy. It happened more than a week ago, but I cannot get it out of my consciousness. A group of conservative students at Middlebury College in Vermont invited the highly controversial author Charles Murray to speak on campus about his latest book, Coming Apart. His talk was shut down by organized chanting in its original venue, and disrupted when it was shifted to a nearby room and livestreamed. When Murray and his faculty interlocutor, Allison Stanger, then left to go to their car, they were surrounded by a mob, which tried to stop them leaving the campus. Someone in the melee grabbed Stanger by the hair and twisted her neck so badly she had to go to the emergency room (she is still suffering from a concussion). After they escaped, their dinner at a local restaurant was crashed by the same mob, and they had to go out of town to eat. None of this is very surprising, given the current atmosphere on most American campuses. And protests against Murray are completely legitimate. The book he co-authored with Harvard professor Richard Herrnstein more than 20 years ago, The Bell Curve, included a chapter on empirical data showing variations in the largely overlapping bell curves of IQ scores between racial groups. Their provocation was to assign these differences to both the environment and genetics. The genetic aspect could be and was exploited by racists and bigots. I dont think that chapter was necessary for the books arguments, but I do believe in the right of good-faith scholars to publish data  as well as the right of others to object, critique, and debunk. If the protesters at Middlebury had protested and disrupted the event for a period of time, and then let it continue, Id be highly sympathetic, even though race and IQ were not the subject of Murrays talk. If theyd challenged the data or the arguments of the book, Id be delighted. But this, alas, is not what they did. (I should add up-front that I am friends with both Murray and Stanger  having edited a symposium on The Bell Curve in The New Republic over two decades ago, and having known Allison since we were both grad students in government at Harvard.) But what grabbed me was the deeply disturbing 40-minute video of the event, posted on YouTube. It brings the incident to life in a way words cannot. At around the 19-minute mark, the students explained why they shut down the talk, and it helped clarify for me what exactly the meaning of intersectionality is. Intersectionality is the latest academic craze sweeping the American academy. On the surface, its a recent neo-Marxist theory that argues that social oppression does not simply apply to single categories of identity  such as race, gender, sexual orientation, class, etc.  but to all of them in an interlocking system of hierarchy and power. At least, thats my best attempt to define it briefly. But watching that video helps show how an otherwise challenging social theory can often operate in practice. It is operating, in Orwells words, as a smelly little orthodoxy, and it manifests itself, it seems to me, almost as a religion. It posits a classic orthodoxy through which all of human experience is explained  and through which all speech must be filtered. Its version of original sin is the power of some identity groups over others. To overcome this sin, you need first to confess, i.e., check your privilege, and subsequently live your life and order your thoughts in a way that keeps this sin at bay. The sin goes so deep into your psyche, especially if you are white or male or straight, that a profound conversion is required. Like the Puritanism once familiar in New England, intersectionality controls language and the very terms of discourse. It enforces manners. It has an idea of virtue  and is obsessed with upholding it. The saints are the most oppressed who nonetheless resist. The sinners are categorized in various ascending categories of demographic damnation, like something out of Dante. The only thing this religion lacks, of course, is salvation. Life is simply an interlocking drama of oppression and power and resistance, ending only in death. Its Marx without the final total liberation. It operates as a religion in one other critical dimension: If you happen to see the world in a different way, if youre a liberal or libertarian or even, gasp, a conservative, if you believe that a university is a place where any idea, however loathsome, can be debated and refuted, you are not just wrong, you are immoral. If you think that arguments and ideas can have a life independent of white supremacy, you are complicit in evil. And you are not just complicit, your heresy is a direct threat to others, and therefore needs to be extinguished. You cant reason with heresy. You have to ban it. It will contaminate others souls, and wound them irreparably. And what I saw on the video struck me most as a form of religious ritual  a secular exorcism, if you will  that reaches a frenzied, disturbing catharsis. When Murray starts to speak, the students stand and ritually turn their backs on him in silence. The heretic must not be looked at, let alone engaged. Then they recite a common liturgy in unison from sheets of paper. Heres how they begin: This is not respectful discourse, or a debate about free speech. These are not ideas that can be fairly debated, it is not representative of the other side to give a platform to such dangerous ideologies. There is not a potential for an equal exchange of ideas. They never specify which of Murrays ideas they are referring to. Nor do they explain why a lecture on a recent book about social inequality cannot be a respectful discourse. The speaker is open to questions and there is a faculty member onstage to engage him afterward. She came prepared with tough questions forwarded from specialists in the field. And yet: We  cannot engage fully with Charles Murray, while he is known for readily quoting himself. Because of that, we see this talk as hate speech. They know this before a single word of the speech has been spoken. Then this: Science has always been used to legitimize racism, sexism, classism, transphobia, ableism, and homophobia, all veiled as rational and fact, and supported by the government and state. In this world today, there is little that is true fact. This, it seems to me, gets to the heart of the question  not that the students shut down a speech, but why they did. I do not doubt their good intentions. But, in a strange echo of the Trumpian right, they are insisting on the superiority of their orthodoxy to facts. They are hostile, like all fundamentalists, to science, because it might counter doctrine. And they shut down the event because intersectionality rejects the entire idea of free debate, science, or truth independent of white male power. At the end of this part of the ceremony, an individual therefore shouts: Who is the enemy? And the congregation responds: White supremacy! They then expel the heretic in a unified chant: Hey hey, ho ho! Charles Murray has got to go. Then: Racist, Sexist, Anti-gay. Charles Murray, Go away! Murrays old work on IQ demonstrates no meaningful difference between men and women, and Murray has long supported marriage equality. He passionately opposes eugenics. Hes a libertarian. But none of that matters. Intersectionality, remember? If youre deemed a sinner on one count, you are a sinner on them all. If you think that race may be both a social construction and related to genetics, your claim to science is just another form of oppression. It is indeed hate speech. At a later moment, the students start clapping in unison, and you can feel the hysteria rising, as the chants grow louder. Your message is hatred. We will not tolerate it! The final climactic chant is Shut it down! Shut it down! It feels like something out of The Crucible. Most of the students have never read a word of Murrays  and many professors who supported the shutdown admitted as much. But the intersectional zeal is so great he must be banished  even to the point of physical violence. This matters, it seems to me, because reason and empirical debate are essential to the functioning of a liberal democracy. We need a common discourse to deliberate. We need facts independent of anyones ideology or political side, if we are to survive as a free and democratic society. Trump has surely shown us this. And if a university cannot allow these facts and arguments to be freely engaged, then nowhere is safe. Universities are the sanctuary cities of reason. If reason must be subordinate to ideology even there, our experiment in self-government is over. Liberal democracy is suffering from a concussion as surely as Allison is. Meanwhile, of course, President Trump continues his assault on the very same independent truth  in this case, significantly more frightening given his position as the most powerful individual on the planet. He too has a contempt for any facts that do not fit his own ideology or self-image. Thats why the lies he repeats are not just moments of self-interested dishonesty. They are designed to erode the very notion of an empirical reality, independent of his own ideology and power. They are an attack on reason itself. A fact-driven media has to be discredited as fake news if it challenges Trumps agenda. Equally, a bureaucracy designed impartially to implement legislation has to be delegitimized, if its fact-based neutrality challenges Trumps worldview. And so the administrative state, in Steve Bannons words, has to be deconstructed. Likewise, a health-care bill must be passed through committee before an independent CBO can empirically score it. The overwhelming conclusion of climate scientists  that carbon is warming the Earth irreversibly  is simply denied by the new head of the EPA. The judiciary can have no legitimate, independent stance if it too counters the presidents interests. A judge who opposes Trump is a so-called judge. Equally, intelligence-gathering can have no validity if it undermines Trumps interests. It suddenly becomes intelligence. It can be ignored. Worse, the intelligence agencies are maligned as inherently political, rather than empirical. Last week, Trump went even further, claiming, with no evidence, that the Justice Department colluded in a criminal wiretap with the previous president to target Trumps candidacy in the last election. Maybe this was designed merely as a distraction from the accumulating lies of his campaign surrogates about their contacts with Russian officials. Maybe it was another temper tantrum from a man with no ability to constrain his emotions by reason. But I tend to think Peter Beinarts take is closer to the mark. Trump was delegitimizing the Justice Department so that he can reject the conclusion of any investigation of his campaigns ties to Russia as politically rigged: This is the vortex we are being led into by the most reckless, feckless, and malevolent president in this countrys history. It is a vortex where reality itself must subordinate itself to one political side; where facts are always instruments of power and nothing else; where our entire Constitution, designed to balance power against power to give truth and reason a chance, is being deliberately corroded from within.

No explanation was offered for why the recusal wasnt announced at the time, but hiding from the press is already one of the hallmarks of Tillersons State Department. This week, the State Department offered a press briefing for the first time in seven weeks. (While near-daily press briefings have been a tradition for decades, the current plan is to hold just two briefings and two conference calls per week.) Acting spokesman Mark Toner took the opportunity to push back on the idea that Tillerson is out of touch. I can also assure you that Secretary Tillerson is very engaged with the White House, is very engaged with the president, speaks to him frequently, Toner said. I can assure everyone that the State Departments voice is heard loud and clear in policy discussions at the National Security Council level. Regardless of Tillersons relationship with the president, his lack of interaction with the public is shocking, particularly because the secretary of State is usually one of the most visible cabinet advisers. Since taking office, Tillerson has given no media interviews and no press conferences. During his trip to Germany last month, he answered just one question shouted by a reporter. Earlier this week, NBCs Andrea Mitchell was ushered out of the room when she tried to ask the secretary a question during a photo op with Ukrainian foreign minister Pavlo Klimkin. Tillerson has refused to take any reporters on his trip to Asia next week. D.C. bureau chiefs from major news organizations  including the New York Times, Fox News, CNN, the Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal  sent a letter protesting the decision. CNNs Jake Tapper called the decision insulting: Engaging with the public is not a priority for the CEO of an oil company, but Tillersons press avoidance may have more to do with his boss than his background.

Two months later, its still unclear what the wall will look like, and even Republicans are questioning how the administration will pay for it. Nobody knew constructing a $21.6 billion, 1,250-mile wall could be so complicated. President Trump recently insisted, Its not a fence. Its a wall, but others in his administration arent so sure. In an interview with Hugh Hewitt this week, Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said the barrier might be see-through, noting thats actually what U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials prefer. Some places, a solid concrete barrier might be desired, Mulvaney said. In other places, the border folks are actually telling us, border controls actually telling us that they like the one you can see through, because it reduces the number of violent attacks on our folks. So its a complicated program. Last month, a leaked internal Department of Homeland Security report estimated that the project would cost $21.6 billion, but Mulvaney said its impossible to guess the price tag. It just depends on the kind of wall that you want to build, and I dont think weve settled, yet, on the actual construction, he explained. The administration is taking steps toward figuring that out. U.S. Customs and Border Protection just started accepting bids from contractors to build prototypes of the big, beautiful wall. Officials said they expected to construct several versions near San Diego, and test them out for 60 days. The primary purpose of this effort is to develop design standards for a border wall that may be constructed along the southwest border with Mexico, said CBP spokesman Michael Friel. CBP began accepting proposals on Monday, and under the original plan they would have whittled down their choices and received final proposals with cost estimates by March 25. According to the Arizona Republic, experts said the timeline for such projects is usually months, not weeks. CBP has extended the first deadline to March 20, without explanation, and the rest of the new schedule is unknown. CBP did offer some details on what theyre looking for: We anticipate procuring concrete wall structures, nominally 30 feet tall, that will meet requirements for aesthetics, anti-climbing, and resistance to tampering or damage, said the post on the Federal Business Opportunities website. Senator Claire McCaskill, ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, complained this week that its irresponsible to move ahead with the project, calling on Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly to explain how much it will cost and how it will be funded. The administration floated an idea to finance the wall by making deep cuts to the Coast Guard, TSA, and FEMAs terrorism-response program. On Wednesday, Representative Duncan Hunter  a Republican  pointed out that cutting funding to national security programs to boost border security is nonsensical. On Thursday, Democratic Representative Gwen Moore introduced the No Taxpayer Funding for the Wall Act, which would prohibit the use of federal money to build Trumps wall (or fence). The bill has more than three dozen Democratic co-sponsors, and shes hoping to attract some Republican deficit hawks. Trump famously promised that Mexico would pay for the wall, but in January he and Paul Ryan began emphasizing that U.S. taxpayers would finance the barrier at first, and later theyd figure out some way to make Mexico reimburse us. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell literally laughed when asked on Thursday if Mexico will pay for the wall. Uh, no, he answered. Republican senator Cory Gardner went even further during a telephone town hall on Wednesday night, saying, A wall is not the right way to proceed. We shouldnt just build a wall and add billions of dollars because thats what somebody said should be done, Gardner said  though thats basically the position most Republicans adopted during the campaign. As it turns out, figuring out how to build that wall is less fun than chanting that phrase at rallies."}, {"date": "2017/03/10", "title": "South Korean President Park Geun-hye Removed From Office", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/south-korean-president-park-geun-hye-removed-from-office.html", "text": " Park Geun-hye, South Koreas first female president, has been removed from office following a corruption scandal that has rattled the nation for the past six months.

Since that time, the prime minister, Hwang Kyo-ahn, has been acting president. Park is the first South Korean president to be ejected from office. The scandal broke in the fall, when reporters found a tablet belonging to Choi Soon-sil, the presidents close friend since childhood. It suggested that Choi, who had no government position, was influencing policy, with Park secretly turning to her for counsel and rarely conferring with her official advisers. Furthermore, a special prosecutor alleged that Choi took advantage of her relationship with the president to enrich herself and her family. She allegedly received about $70 million in bribes from big businesses. Choi has been on trial for months, and Lee Jae-yong, Samsungs de facto head, went on trial this week for bribery, embezzlement, and perjury charges.

That might include items like modifying the prohibition on denial of insurance for those with preexisting conditions, or perhaps preempting state health-care regulations in order to set up interstate insurance sales. It is conservative Republicans who are most eager for this chore to get done, so that the ground beneath the hated Obamacare can be plowed and salted once and for all.

First, the mogul built a business career off of his wealthy fathers bequeathments; now, his presidency is being buttressed by the economy Barack Obama left him. Consumer confidence and comfort are both at decade highs, while private-sector payrolls grew by nearly 300,000 last month, according ADPs National Employment Report. Sure, one can credit some fraction of these developments to the animal spirits Trump unleashed by promising to slash taxes and cut red tape (a.k.a. let coal companies poison our drinking water). But seeing as the president has passed no significant legislation  and took the wheel with the economy already enjoying under 5 percent unemployment  it seems safe to thank Obama for the lions share of the good news in Americas business pages. The Economic Policy Institutes new report on the state of American wages adds further credence to this view. The liberal think tank takes pains to emphasize that the long-term story of wage growth in America is that the rich have been hoarding it all for themselves. But the short-term story is that, by the time Obama decamped from the Oval Office, wages were growing faster at the bottom of the income ladder than they were at the top. Here are six quick takeaways from EPIs report. The recovery is finally reaching the workers who needed it most. For much of Obamas presidency, the economic recovery was easy to see on cable-news stock tickers, but hard for most workers to find in their paychecks. In 2010, the top one percent of earners collected up to 93 percent of all the economys gains, according to Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez. Incomes among the rest of the population grew by only 0.2 percent that year  after they had fallen by 11.6 percent between 2007 and 2009. The first six years of Obamas tenure saw little improvement in the median workers earnings, even as the Dow climbed ever-higher. But in 2015, labor markets finally tightened enough to give laborers some bargaining power  and annual median-income growth hit an all-time high. EPIs report shows that growth continued in 2016  thereby narrowing the income gap that had ballooned in the recoverys early years. Last year, the median wage rose by 3.1 percent, while workers at the very bottom of Americas income ladder saw their paychecks grow by 2.9 percent  and those in the second-to-lowest percentile saw their incomes swell by 6.4 percent. By contrast, the top 5 percent of earners saw their wages grow by only 1.7 percent. Minimum-wage increases seem to be working. Part of the story behind the wage growth at the very bottom appears to be a raft of state-level minimum-wage increases that went into effect in 2016. In the 17 states that raised their wage floors, the bottom 10 percent of workers saw their pay increase 5.2 percent; in the rest of the country, that figure was 2.5 percent. Men without college degrees have had a rough decade. Since 2000, men who earned some college credits, but lack a bachelors degree  and those who finished only high school  have seen their paychecks shrink. By contrast, wages for women have grown over that period at all levels of educational attainment. For both genders, a college diploma has been no guarantee of rising prosperity in 21st-century America: The bottom 50 percent of college-educated workers still make less today than they did in 2000 or 2007. On average, women earn 83 percent of what men do. At every education level, women are paid consistently less than their male counterparts, and the gap is particularly striking at higher levels of educational attainment. The racial wage gap is still going strong. Black workers have seen weaker wage growth than whites or Latinos since 2000, and the bottom 60 percent of black workers wages remain below their precrisis peak. Last years progress on inequality was a minor victory in a decades-long class war that the one percent is winning. Since the late 1970s, American policy makers have made it evermore difficult for workers to unionize, drastically reduced enforcement of antitrust laws, allowed minimum wages to stagnate, and prioritized low inflation over low unemployment. The end result of these and other policy decisions is that the top one percent of earners enjoyed a wage growth of 156.7 percent from 1979 to 2015  while the bottom 90 percent saw their paychecks rise by a mere 20.7 percent, far below the growth in worker productivity. The Obama administration arguably abetted the growth of wealth inequality in the United States, by failing to take more aggressive action to stem the foreclosure crisis. But the presidents signature health-care law  and the smaller-bore policies of his labor department  redistributed income and economic power from Americas wealthiest to its working class. These measures, along with a tightening labor market, have just begun to arrest Americas descent into a second Gilded Age. But Donald Trump has a fondness for all things gilded. And the Trump-Ryan agenda amounts to a plan to redistribute as much wealth as (politically) possible to the richest among us. Plus, the Federal Reserve is on the cusp of hitting the brakes on the economy, opting to stymie wage growth for the sake of curbing inflation. So it probably wont be long until Trump has turned his inheritance into a garish testament to American inequality. Again."}, {"date": "2017/03/09", "title": "New NASA Pics Reveal One of Saturns Moons Looks Like Ravioli", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/nasa-pics-reveal-one-of-saturns-moons-looks-like-ravioli.html", "text": " NASAs Cassini spacecraft has been cruising around Saturn for 13 years, periodically sending pictures of the enormous planet and its many moons back to Earth.

Captured at a distance of about 15,000 miles, NASA says these are the closest images ever taken of Pan. Previous shots of the moon had drawn comparisons to a walnut, but NASA is suggesting this one is more ravioli-like, which seems about right. But as Cassini imaging chief Carolyn Porco tweets, other foods have been suggested too. Pan is about 22 miles in diameter and that bulge at its equator is the moons most notable feature. It formed over time as Pan accumulated material from the rings it passes through to form the Encke Gap. Launched in 1997, Cassini reached Saturn in 2004. Later this year, after more than 2 billion miles logged, it will run out of fuel.

Puzder was lampooned in the press shortly after his nomination was announced, with every news cycle revealing something new and damning about him  that he once employed an undocumented immigrant as a housekeeper; that his ex-wife accused him of domestic abuse; that rates of sexual harassment at his restaurants are way higher than the industry average. And then, of course, there were the ads that Carls Jr. and Hardees regularly ran showing women in very small clothing eating very big hamburgers. Puzder defended the ads in an Entrepreneur feature, and in an interview with Fox Business Network on Thursday, he said he was sorry senators were uncomfortable with them. We saved the company with those ads, we saved a lot of jobs, he said, adding that he didnt think all women found these ads demeaning  certainly the women in the ads didnt. I think that any grocery store you go into or drug store youre going to see on magazine covers things that are more revealing than you saw in many of our ads, he said. Puzder also addressed the abuse allegations his ex-wife, Lisa Fierstein (then Lisa Henning) leveled against him in the couples divorce filing. Theres a lot of arguments in every marriage, he said. There was never any substance to the abuse. I had always denied it. She admitted very shortly after the divorce that they werent true. And so it was somewhat of a surprise that the media would go after it so strongly. But senators from both sides of the aisle took the allegations seriously as well; they asked to view an episode of Oprah where Fierstein appears in disguise to talk about her abusive marriage. In the episode, which is called High-Class Battered Women, Fierstein said Puzder vowed revenge and told her shed pay for this. (In a statement to the Cut, she said she impulsively filed for divorce and was counseled to file allegations that I regretted.) Despite all the bad press, Puzder blamed his shaky support on protests and the fact that his hearing kept getting delayed.

In both the Ways and Means Committee (with jurisdiction over the tax provisions of AHCA) and the Energy and Commerce Committee (which is handling the Medicaid provisions), Republicans are whipping the bill through the proceedings without accepting any amendments, though everyone knows the bill as introduced is flawed and will never get through Congress in its original form  if at all. For their part, Democrats on these committees are offering blizzards of amendments, some aimed at getting their GOP colleague on record as opposing improvements in AHCA, and others clearly designed to bring the proceedings quite literally into the light of day. The Ways and Means Committee managed to complete its work on AHCA before sunrise, at 4:30 a.m. ET, with a 2316 party-line vote reporting its part of the bill to the full House. The Energy and Commerce Committee wrapped up around lunchtime, after a session that lasted 27 hours. In the latter committee, there was a brief hint of GOP rebellion as the panels vice chairman, Rep. Joe Barton, offered an amendment accelerating the cancellation of Obamacares Medicaid expansion from 2020 until the end of this year. He later withdrew it. What makes the whole exercise excruciating for the Republicans involved is that they are rubber-stamping a bill that could be rejected by their House colleagues, by the Senate, or by their Republican president. Its the epitome of what congressional observers call walking the plank. It is possible that these brave souls think they can disclaim their own work if the Congressional Budget Office comes in with a scoring of the AHCAs impact on the budget and on health coverage that makes the legislation a plain abomination from every point of view.

On Wednesday, the president instructed a broad White House task force to turn his infrastructure ambitions into a concrete plan. Trump stipulated that the plan should prioritize renovation of existing roads over new construction, expedite local permitting, and favor projects that states can break ground on in less than 90 days. Were not going to give the money to states unless they can prove that they can be ready, willing, and able to start the project, Trump said at a private meeting with advisers and executives that The Wall Street Journal sat in on. We dont want to give them money if theyre all tied up for seven years with state bureaucracy. Congressional Republicans have evinced little interest in Trumps bid to create jobs through new government spending. Many seem to have hoped that the presidents plan  which he has likened to the New Deal  would fall by the wayside after his election, along with the moguls other liberal campaign proposals on drug prices and increasing taxes on hedge-fund managers. The Trump administration gave fiscal conservatives some cause for comfort in late November, when it released an initial infrastructure plan composed entirely of tax breaks to private developers. But the plan that the president outlined this week couldnt possibly be funded wholly by private capital. Renovating existing roads is unlikely to attract much private investment, unless the administration plans to radically increase the number of toll booths in the United States. And several of Trumps other reported ambitions  including building high-speed railroads and expanding broadband access  are likely to require public funding. The president also expressed interest Wednesday in Elon Musks Hyperloop  a mode of public transport that would fire pods of passengers at airline speed through low-pressure tubes. Which sounds cool and terrifying, but also expensive. At present, the White Houses only idea for generating requisite revenue for its plan is to let American corporations repatriate their overseas earnings at a discount rate, a move that it expects would put $200 billion in Uncle Sams coffers. Compounding the funding problem, the GOPs health-care plan amounts to a $600 billion tax cut on the wealthiest people in America. And even if that fails to pass, the next item on the Republican agenda is a large tax cut for rich people and corporations (they say those cuts will be revenue neutral but they almost certainly wont be). And then, the president also wants to increase the defense budget by $54 billion, build a $21 billion border wall, and drastically increase annual spending on immigration enforcement. Leaked budget documents suggest the White House wants to fund those expenditures with massive cuts, to the Coast Guard and public housing, which are likely to meet significant opposition in Congress. Still, Trumps infrastructure plan may be the most (the only?) broadly popular item on his agenda. And its one that the former real-estate developer seems personally invested in  and that his chief strategist believes is key to building a majority coalition for right-wing nationalism."}, {"date": "2017/03/09", "title": "Nigel Farage Visits Embassy Where Assange Lives, Says He Cant Remember Why", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/nigel-farage-visits-embassy-where-julian-assange-lives.html", "text": " Former UKIP leader and Britains staunchest Trump supporter, Nigel Farage was seen leaving the Ecuadorian embassy in London on Thursday.

The owners of at least one D.C. restaurant, Cork Wine Bar, say the benefits for the hotel come at the expense of the rest of the industry. On Wednesday, the Washingtonian reports, Cork owners Khalid Pitts and Diane Ross filed an unfair-competition lawsuit against Trump and the Trump International Hotel. Cork hosts political fundraisers and international law firms, as many restaurants in the city do, but one of its attorneys, Scott Rome, tells the Washingtonian that the restaurant has seen significantly less income since Trump became president. Thats because, Rome argues, lobbyists, government officials, and anyone else seeking influence with the administration feel pressure to go to the Trump International Hotel. The fact that the president shows up on the weekends only further handicaps the matchup, with Rome telling the magazine, it seems to us to be a clear situation in which hes using his office of the president to get a financial gain at the expense of local businesses. Its been argued that Trump breached his hotel lease with the General Services Administration by becoming president, and the restaurants attorneys point to a specific clause they believe will make this case. Specifically, it states that no elected official should gain any benefit or have any share from the agreement. Rome  who is working pro bono alongside Mark Zaid, who has brought lawsuits against previous administrations  says the goal is to put an end to Trumps unfair advantage, and that this isnt being done just to stir things up.

Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly cited President Donald Trumps tougher immigration policies as already working to deter undocumented immigrants from trying to make the trip into the United States. The early results show that enforcement matters, deterrence matters, and that comprehensive immigration enforcement can make an impact, Kelly said in a statement. Kelly characterized the February stats as an unprecedented decline in traffic. A total of 23,589 people were caught or turned away from the southwest border in February, a decline of nearly 40 percent from January. That number also dropped 36 percent compared to February of 2016, when Customs and Border Protection logged 38,316 apprehensions. Its too early to draw conclusions about any long-term patterns, especially since they depend on a lot of variables and the numbers to tend to tick up in warmer months  though thats another trend bucked by this Februarys numbers.

That may have also been in response to anticipated policy changes, but has the practical effect of decreasing the number of people trying to make the journey to the United States.

Yet sometimes the traps can be sprung in the most unexpected locations. In an interview last night with Tucker Carlson, Ryan came prepared to defend his health-care bill against a withering attack from his partys right flank. But then Carlson asked Ryan why he decided to include a huge tax cut for the rich. Watch the exchange here. You can literally see Ryan gulp when he realizes what Carlson is asking him: So, asked about why his plan gives rich people a big tax cut, Ryan makes three points. The first is that he doesnt care  Im not concerned about that  is true, or a massive understatement. Hes not only not concerned, it is a major motivation. The third point, that it helps tax reform, is also true. As noted before, Ryans legislative strategy is designed around the goal of enabling a large, permanent tax cut for the rich. Obamacare repeal is being rushed in order to grease the skids for tax cuts later. But notice what Ryan is saying. Asked why his health-care plan (which massively cuts health care for the poor and middle class) includes a tax cut for the rich, Ryan explains that it will enable another tax cut for the rich later on! The second point is interesting, too. Ryan says hes cutting the taxes that finance Obamacare because he promised to cut them. That is true. But he made a lot of promises. As Josh Barro notes, its telling which promises Ryan decided to prioritize. Ryan has spent years making a huge deal about the cuts to Medicare that, along with the taxes on the rich, are another source of funding for Obamacare. He made this promise many times, most famously during his acceptance speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention: Republicans continued to promised to overturn this cold power play. The Better Way plan, which Ryan has held up as his mandate, promises their plan will [p]rovide immediate relief from Obamacares raid on Medicare. Our plan strengthens Medicare Advantage and repeals the most damaging Medicare provisions in Obamacare. But those cuts had to be left in to make the numbers add up. Republicans could take out the tax cuts for the rich and make their bill less cruel to the millions of poor and sick people who will no longer be able to access medical care because of their bill. Instead, they care more about reducing taxes for the rich."}, {"date": "2017/03/09", "title": "How the GOP Might Fudge the Numbers to Make Trumpcare Seem Less Irresponsible", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/gop-may-fire-congressional-budget-office-to-save-trumpcare.html", "text": " There have been a lot of raised eyebrows about congressional Republicans rushing out an Obamacare repeal-and-replace bill before it could be scored  that is, evaluated for its impact on federal spending and revenues and health-care coverage  by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Generally, CBO scoring would be a foundational step before trying to advance legislation significantly overhauling an industry that constitutes 20 percent of the national economy. One reason for the hastiness is that Republicans wanted to get something out there before its members go home for a long and potentially protest-filled Easter recess and perhaps come back gun-shy. Another is that they are on a self-imposed (and potentially self-imploding) timetable to get health care out of the way so they can deal with other legislative priorities, including a giant tax-cut bill. But it is the third reason for not waiting on CBO that is looking most compelling right now: Republicans are terrified that CBOs numbers will paint a disastrous picture of the American Health Care Acts impact. The bill has problems enough without being described by Congresss own hirelings as a bill that blows up budget deficits, throws many millions of people out of their health insurance, and, perhaps most importantly, undermines the tax cuts and defense-spending increases Republicans are itching to enact by setting a baseline that already looks bad. Indeed, as Jennifer Haberkorn reports, there is so much Republican angst over what CBO might say that there is a sudden barrage of advance criticism of the agency, which is likely to reveal its score later this week or early next week: When former House Speaker Newt Gingrich called for the abolition of CBO back in January, most observers probably chuckled at the old bomb-thrower insisting that an objective assessment of GOP plans would screw everything up. Now thats rapidly becoming the conventional wisdom. Keep in mind that Republicans, after taking control of both congressional chambers in 2014, hired CBOs current director, George W. Bush administration veteran Keith Hall. Its safe to say that Hall hardly resembles Gingrichs description of CBO as a left-wing, corrupt, bureaucratic defender of big government and liberalism. So whats the solution? Republicans seem to have found an alternative source of authoritative-sounding numbers that is more ideologically reliable: the Office of Management and Budget, which is directly under the control of the president. This helps explain why Trumps OMB director, Mick Mulvaney, is suddenly being described as a player in the GOPs very crowded health-care-policy arena. As budget maven Stan Collender pointed out when Gingrich proposed eliminating CBO, such a step would quite literally turn the clock back to those pre-1974 days when OMB was the only scoring entity, and Congress had no independent source of information. In the end Congress can use whatever numbers it chooses. But trying to boost the credibility of its agenda by cooking the books is probably not going to be a very persuasive approach. One would normally think Mulvaney had enough on his plate  developing Trumps first budget, for example  without having to leap into the middle of the health-care fray. Thats how panicked Republicans have become by the consequences of their shoddy work on repealing and replacing Obamacare. Its one thing to work the refs when you are in danger of losing a game. Its another thing altogether to fire and replace the scorekeeper while the balls in play."}, {"date": "2017/03/09", "title": "Trump Mulls Cutting Billions From Public Housing to Fund Larger Military", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/trump-mulls-cutting-usd6-billion-from-hud-to-fund-defense.html", "text": " Last October in Charlotte, Donald Trump detailed his vision for bringing urban renewal to Americas inner cities.

Five months later, the Trump administration is considering cutting $6 billion from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to help fund a $54 billion increase in Americas defense budget, according to documents obtained by the Washington Post. The U.S. already spends more more on its military than China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, France, India, and Germany  combined. Apparently, when Trump said that the conditions in our inner cities were unacceptable, he meant that our public housing is too well-maintained, urban communities are too well-developed, and the rent (for low-income people) is too damn low. The presidents budget proposal would slash $1.3 billion from the public-housing capital budget, and $600 million from its operating fund. Funding for capital repairs in public housing is already so insufficient, tens of billions of dollars in backlogged repairs plague the nations facilities, according to a 2010 HUD report.

The program brings bike trails, affordable housing projects, gyms, recreation centers, and other development projects to urban communities. The Trump budget would eliminate the program entirely. The Post offers this rundown of the cuts to rental assistance: The budget document is just a draft, and is likely to go through revisions before the administration unveils its budget proposal next week. But even if the White House maintained all rental subsidies at their current levels, inflation alone would reduce the number of low-income families with access to affordable housing. The administrations current HUD budget is, in essence, a plan to increase homelessness. You cant overload the human brain. If you learned one new fact every second it would take more than 3 million years to challenge the capacity of your brain, HUD secretary Ben Carson said during his first speech to the department, ostensibly describing his philosophy on housing policy. So we need to focus a little less on what we cant do and a little more on what we can do. After all, this is America, the can-do society  not the, what can you do for me society. Apparently, what our society can do is throw more of its poorest children onto the street for the sake of financing new weapons systems  and then tweet its shocked revulsion at the carnage in Chicago."}, {"date": "2017/03/09", "title": "The 2017 Mayoral Race Is Shaping Up to Be Wildly Exciting  or Extremely Boring", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/the-2017-mayoral-race-will-be-exciting-or-very-boring.html", "text": " Preet Bharara has a Broadway producers flair for the dramatic and a stand-up comics sense of timing. So it would have been a characteristically bravura, publicity-grabbing touch if the U.S. Attorney had chosen the end of last week to unveil a federal indictment of Mayor Bill de Blasio on campaign-finance-related charges  while de Blasio was out of town, jetting to Chicago and Fort Lauderdale and Beverly Hills raising money for his reelection campaign. Bharara did indeed generate headlines Friday, but on an uglier, more urgent issue. The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District announced the arrest of a St. Louis man for making bomb threats against Jewish community centers. His investigation of the mayor and several aides appears to be nearing a conclusion, however. Bhararas prosecutors have been reviewing whether de Blasio traded government favors for campaign donations since at least April 2016; a grand jury has heard testimony; and two weeks ago Bhararas lieutenants grilled the mayor for four hours. Separately, Manhattan district attorney Cy Vance has been looking into whether de Blasios operatives improperly funneled campaign dollars through party committees to help Democratic candidates for the New York State senate. So the 2017 mayoral race is poised to become either wildly complicated or crashingly dull. The handicapping among city political insiders shifts rapidly, though the current speculative consensus has the mayor dodging an indictment. De Blasio partisans interpret every day that goes by without bad news as a good thing, believing Bharara and Vance wouldnt want to drop a bombshell close to Election Day and be accused of pulling a Comey. Which may be wishful thinking: Judicial vets believe the investigations would have been closed by now if nothing incriminating had surfaced. Neither prosecutors office is commenting. Where the calculations would get really interesting is if Bharara were to render a split decision: declining to charge de Blasio, but indicting one or more of his aides. If there were a Las Vegas line on the outcomes, this one would be the chalk bet. An even thornier, less likely scenario? Bharara names the mayor as an unindicted co-conspirator, a middle path hes taken in cases involving hedge-fund billionaire Steve Cohen and real estate tycoon Leonard Litwin. For de Blasio, that outcome would be nearly as politically damaging as being charged. In the meantime, there is a campaign going on, sort of; you are forgiven for not noticing, unless you are a sought-after donor or a blood relative of one of the little-known candidates. But whether there will be an actual competitive contest is up to Bharara and Vance. The playing field is frozen by the investigations, says Bradley Tusk, the political consultant who was co-manager of Michael Bloombergs successful 2009 reelection bid, and who has spent much of the past year unsuccessfully trying to recruit a credible challenger to de Blasio. Thats his biggest vulnerability, and if the prosecutors clear him, I dont think anyone of note will step up. Donald Trumps presidential win should instill permanent humility in anyone dismissing the chances of long-shot candidates. Yet the existing mayoral field isnt causing de Blasio any worries. On the Republican side, theres real estate executive Paul Massey Jr., who has spent more money ($2 million) than he has raised ($1.6 million); Michel Faulkner, who played one season as a defensive lineman for the Jets and is now the pastor of a small Baptist church in Harlem; and Darren Dione Aquino, an actor and an activist for the rights of the disabled. Donald Trump Jr. is apparently too busy cashing in on his dads new gig to mount a bid, after dropping hints that he might last summer. The willing Democrats are greater in number if not plausibility. Sal Albanese, a former city councilman from Brooklyn, has run twice before, finishing a distant third and eighth. Tony Avella, a Queens state senator, has lately been posing for photos with a 180-pound pig that the city is trying to evict from a Staten Island residence. Neophytes Eric Armstead, an East New York security manager, and Michael Basch, a field organizer in Hillary Clintons Wisconsin presidential campaign, also say theyre in. Ex-NYPD detective and current Fox News contributor Bo Dietl, thwarted in his efforts to switch his party registration from Republican to Democrat, says hes now aiming for the Conservative and Independent ballot lines. Other potential candidates are more formidable  potentially. Their ranks include Chris Quinn, who in 2013 rapidly went from consensus favorite to dispiriting third-place defeat, and for the past two years has done admirable work running a nonprofit group that helps homeless families. Scott Stringer skipped the crowded 2013 City Hall race and instead beat Eliot Spitzer in a nasty contest for comptroller. Ruben Diaz Jr., the Bronx borough president, and Hakeem Jeffries, a Brooklyn congressman, are personal friends who could become political rivals in a mayoral field. Melissa Mark-Viverito, the city council speaker, and Dan Garodnick, an East Side councilman, are both about to be out of jobs due to term limits; Tish James, the public advocate, has won a citywide race and could cut into de Blasios share of black votes. All of them are keeping an eye on what happens with de Blasio, but none show any signs of putting together a campaign apparatus. And there are strong reasons to wait until 2021 to run. De Blasio has delivered on several of his big first term promises  expanding prekindergarten, raising the citys minimum wage, and building new affordable-housing units. The mayor has presided over a continuing decrease in crime  while smoothly handing the NYPDs reins from Bill Bratton to Jimmy ONeill  plus a rise in employment, and hes reoriented City Hall priorities after 12 years of its being run with an eye toward New Yorks elites. To beat an incumbent mayor, you need a significant event. With Abe Beame, it was the collapse of city finances. With David Dinkins, it was crime, says Joe Lhota, the Republican nominee for mayor in 2013 who lost in a landslide to de Blasio. And there is no cataclysmic event now. The citys numbers are fine. So the fact that De Blasio is incompetent doesnt make him unelectable. Lhotas phrasing may come with, oh, just a slight personal edge. But hes poking at de Blasios soft spot: the mayors image as a poor manager who is more interested in waging ideological crusades than in efficiently delivering city services. That reputation is reflected in de Blasios schizophrenic poll numbers. The two most recent surveys, by Quinnipiac and Marist, show him demolishing any and all possible opponents this fall. Yet Marist recorded a mediocre 39 percent of city residents rating the mayors job performance as good or excellent. Quinnipiac showed de Blasio scoring his highest job-approval number in a year  all the way up to 50 percent. A decent 52 percent credited him with strong leadership qualities. That was after a Trump bump. The mayor has seized every opportunity to promote himself as the rhetorical and policy leader of the resistance, rallying along with paleoliberals like Michael Moore and Susan Sarandon and vowing to maintain New York as a sanctuary city in the face of Trumps anti-immigrant push. The demographics of a Democratic primary are also in de Blasios favor. Anyone attempting to unseat him would likely need to win more than two-thirds of the white vote and close to half of the black and Latino vote, in a primary where 500,000 or fewer of the citys 4.5 million registered Democrats show up. That meager turnout skews heavily toward liberal whites and union members, who are mostly black and Latino. De Blasio has sufficient support from the first group, and is on solid footing with the second. Hes already trotted out endorsements from ten unions, including heavyweights like the UFT, DC37, and SEIU 32BJ, plus the union-backed Working Families Party. We wanted to have a very early, very muscular operation, to begin to communicate with the people of New York about the mayors record and where he wants to take the city in the next four years, says Phil Walzak, a key mayoral adviser who shifted from City Hall to the reelection campaign in October. Were not complacent. Absent any major surprises, Quinn seems loath to risk a second defeat to de Blasio, something that could end any future hope of elective office. Stringer looks content to bide his time and exercise a decent amount of power as comptroller until the mayoral seat is open again. And Jeffries was recently given a House Democratic leadership role by Nancy Pelosi. For now, its all idle chatter to occupy the few moments that pols dont spend obsessing over Trump. I dont worry about it, because I know that at the end of the day the mayor and our people are going to be fully vindicated, Walzak says. I know that the mayor and our people are honest and ethical and law-abiding. And I think that will be revealed when this whole thing comes to a close. One of the possible mayoral candidates predicts that, short of the mayor himself being indicted, de Blasio ends up basically unopposed in a Democratic primary. And then says, But who knows whats gonna happen? Well, two prosecutors do."}, {"date": "2017/03/09", "title": "Flynn Admits Lobbying May Have Helped Turkey", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/flynn-admits-to-lobbying-for-firm-linked-to-turkey.html", "text": " Michael Flynn was fired after just 23 days as President Trumps national security adviser so there wasnt time to get into the potential scandal over his business ties to Turkey. This week Flynn filed paperwork with the Justice Department to retroactively register as a foreign agent. Flynn disclosed that his firm was paid $530,000 from August through November for lobbying that could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey. During that time, Flynn was serving as a top national-security adviser to the Trump campaign. U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of a foreign entity are required to register with the Justice Department. Failing to do so is a felony, but the DOJ usually works with lobbyists to file the proper disclosures rather than charging them. Flynn Intel Group Inc. was hired by Inovo BV, a Dutch consulting firm whose owner, Ekim Alptekin, has ties to Turkeys President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Part of Flynns work involved hiring researchers to look into Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic cleric who lives in rural Pennsylvania. Erdogan blames Gulen for orchestrating an attempted coup in 2016 and wants the U.S. to extradite him. The AP reports that during an unrelated meeting with a representative of the House Homeland Security Committee, the Flynn Intel group suggested that Congress hold hearings about Gulen. Flynn also published an op-ed in the Hill on Election Day in which he said Gulen is a radical cleric and the U.S. should not provide him a safe haven. Despite these efforts to change U.S. policy, Gulen still lives in Pennsylvania. Flynn said in the filings that he decided to write the op-ed on his own, and was not paid by Alptekin or the Turkish government. Alptekin denied that he hired Flynn to benefit Turkish authorities, and said Flynn was only filing with the Justice Department owing to political pressure. I disagree with the filing, he said. It would be different if I was working for the government of Turkey, but I am not taking directions from anyone in the government. Flynn Intel received a final payment of $145,000 on November 14, less than a week after Election Day. The firm was shut down around the same time."}, {"date": "2017/03/09", "title": "Trumps Backup Plan: Let Health-Care System Explode, Blame Democrats", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/trump-blame-democrats-health-care.html", "text": " Having President Trump pressure wavering Republicans is a key part of the GOP leaderships strategy for passing the American Health Care Act, but so far the president has been uncharacteristically reserved. His public commentary mainly consisted of claiming, falsely, that everybody likes the bill, and making one mild jab at Rand Paul on Twitter. Trump has been meeting with critics of the bill at the White House, but his commitment to passing the AHCA in its current form is unclear  perhaps intentionally. He has leaned all the way in and has had a deft touch, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told the Washington Post. Weve had an open-arms, olive-branch, politely-nod-your-head mentality. Some details about Trumps stance on specific provisions emerged on Wednesday during an Oval Office meeting with representative from anti-AHCA Republican groups, including the Heritage Foundation, Club for Growth, Tea Party Patriots, and Americans for Prosperity. Trump and other White House officials defended the tax credits that allow lower-income Americans to buy insurance, though some conservatives say that creates a new entitlement. There was no budging on tax credits, one official in the meeting told Politico. That remains the biggest sticking point. But the White House isnt completely opposed to making the AHCA even worse for poor people. When the conservative groups brought up rolling back Obamacares Medicaid expansion next year rather than holding off until 2020, Trump aides said they were open to discussing it, according to CNN. The Post reported that the White House also seemed open to allowing insurance companies to offer less robust health plans in 2018, rather than waiting to 2020. Trump seemed confident that the bill would pass in the House, though the changes that would make the AHCA acceptable to extreme conservatives would make it toxic to moderate Republicans. As Politico notes, backing the AHCA may be the riskiest for the roughly two dozen Republicans from swing districts where Trump isnt very popular. Trumps tweets might not have much power over those Republicans, but hes more focused on winning the Senate anyway. He told the conservative groups that he intends to target Democratic senators from red states who are up for reelection next year. Trump said he will have football stadium events in states where he won by 10-12 points and he is going to dare people to vote against him, said a source who was at the meeting. A White House official said Trump made it clear that this is the chance to repeal and replace, but Politico and CNN reported that he also brought up his fallback plan: Let Obamacare fail on its own, blame the Democrats, and push another Republican health-care plan two years from now. This is one of Trumps most consistent arguments about health-care reform. In remarks earlier this year at the Republican retreat CPAC, and on Twitter, Trump mentioned that the smartest political move would be to do nothing to improve the health-care system. I actually talked with Paul [Ryan] and the group about just doing nothing for two years, and the Dems would come begging to do something because 17 is going to be catastrophic price increases, your deductibles are through the roof, you cant use them, and they will come to us, Trump said at the annual GOP retreat in Philadelphia. However, Trump concluded that its too cruel to let millions of Americans suffer just to score some political points. Im serious if we waited two years its going to explode like youve never seen an explosion, he said. Thats politically what we should do but we dont want to do that. So Trump is betting that after promising to repeal and replace Obamacare immediately, backing a bill everyone hates, failing to make members of his own party pass it, then doing nothing for two years as Americans go broke and even die, the country is going to blame Democrats for failing to fix the health-care system.

Politico reports that Huntsman was offered the job of U.S. ambassador to Russia, and he plans to accept. Navigating U.S.-Russia relations isnt easy even when there isnt an ongoing controversy over alleged election hacking, and Huntsman has an awkward personal history with the president. About a month after Huntsman suspended his 2012 presidential campaign, Trump attacked him on Twitter: Huntsman endorsed Trump for president in April 2016, then called for him to drop out of the race after the grab-em-by-the-pussy video emerged in October. A senior administration official told CNN that Huntsman was selected because he is a tough and brilliant guy, and understands what Trump wants. This is the second time Huntsman has been given an ambassadorship amid speculation about his political ambitions. He served as ambassador to Singapore under President George H.W. Bush and as ambassador to China under President Barack Obama. Obamas team thought sending Huntsman to China would take him out of the running in 2012, but he resigned his post in 2011 and launched a short-lived presidential campaign. As Bloomberg notes, going to Moscow will likely prevent Huntsman from challenging 82-year-old Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah in the 2018 Republican primary. Polls show that Huntsman is far more popular than Hatch in Utah. The position requires Senate confirmation.

Hawaii is technically amending its earlier complaint against the earlier travel ban, but thats central to the states claim that this and the first travel ban represented veiled efforts to impose the Muslim ban Donald Trump initially promised as a presidential candidate. The religious discrimination argument is one the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals pointed to, but did not definitively decide upon, in rejecting the Trump administrations efforts to quash District Judge James Robarts suspension of the original ban.

On the left, roughly a half-dozen Senate Republicans have expressed concern that the bill is too disruptive, throwing millions of Americans off their insurance and wreaking havoc in the medical industry. On the right, ultraconservatives oppose the bill for not being disruptive enough, phasing out the Medicaid expansion too slowly and still leaving some form of tax credits to subsidize insurance. It has been difficult for me to take the latter seriously, given that their only leverage is to threaten to leave the hated Obamacare status quo in place. But there are growing signs they are truly crazy enough to do it. The House Freedom Caucus, which represents the 40 or so right-wing members who frequently oppose the leadership and refuse to compromise, is meeting with Trump today. A source tells Mike Allen the caucus needs major changes to support Trumpcare, like eliminating the tax credits and a faster phase-out to the Medicaid expansion. A bill they could support is not going to look anything like what the leadership wants, says one aide. Meanwhile, Rand Paul  who last week embarrassed Republicans by holding a public hunt for their still-secret bill  is growing more adamant in his opposition to Trumpcare. Now Im thinking were so far apart, he tells Politico. I never believed in my wildest nightmares that were going to keep the Obamacare taxes or that were going to have a new entitlement program or that were going to keep the individual mandate in another form. And Breitbart, which has lambasted the bill, appears to be completely earnest in its opposition. Steve Bannon is reportedly furious with the alt-right publication, but its current editorial leadership does not care. We are Breitbart, editor Matt Boyle wrote in an internal Breitbart editorial chat, according to a screenshot obtained by Business Insider. This is war. There are no sacred cows in war. It is possible that some of these right-wing critics of Trumpcare are merely bluffing in order to maximize their leverage. But even that puts the bill at risk. The changes at stake in this law mainly fall on a simple spectrum of more or less. The ultraconservatives oppose a bill that provides too little care to pass the Senate on the grounds that it already provides too much care. Almost any change that makes the bill more acceptable to the right flank makes it even less acceptable to the center. So, would the far right really kill the bill? Would they rather keep Obamacare in place than pass Trumpcare? It still seems unlikely, but there are reasons to imagine why a putatively insane course of action might make some degree of sense. The right-wing dissidents are correct that Trumpcare leaves Obamacares structure in place, but simply funds much less of it. It is Obamacare lite. Now, the bill is far too lite for liberals or even moderates, leaving wholly inadequate funding levels to insure the poor and sick. But it is precisely that gap between promise and reality that raises suspicions on the right. If the GOP has given its imprimatur to a plan to cover the uninsured, after having promised repeatedly that they would take care of the uninsured, then what happens if and when people discover they can no longer afford insurance? Theyll take out their frustrations on the party that passed it and whose president bears its name. And then, eventually, Congress will ease or restore the cuts to funding, and Obamacare will live on. It might be easier for conservatives to sustain their opposition to funding and operating the program if they havent embraced a version of it in their partys name. A glimpse into the rights mentality can be seen in this telling quote from Ryan Williams, a former Mitt Romney aide, who explains why the term Trumpcare hurts the bills standing with the far right: Pretty much anything with the pejorative suffix on it  care  is going to be viewed unfavorably by conservatives. This sounds a bit like the old joke about a police officer who beats a protester at a left-wing rally, and when the protester insists, Officer, Im anti-communist, replies, I dont care what kind of communist you are! But there is some real meaning to this linguistic preference. Williams is not calling the prefix, Trump, a pejorative. Hes calling the suffix, care, pejorative. Yes: Conservatives hate the term care. It implies, after all, that theyre taking care of people. They truly do not believe the government should claim such a responsibility, and they have reason to suspect that making such a promise and failing to follow it through will lead to it being followed through anyway. To be sure, an American liberal  or a conservative or liberal in any other industrialized country, where universal health insurance is taken for granted  would consider these sentiments monstrous. But there is something appealing about a faction of a party that is willing to state its principals openly rather than conceal them behind obfuscatory jargon."}, {"date": "2017/03/08", "title": "Marines Set Up Outside Raqqa, Escalating U.S. Involvement in Syria", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/marines-set-up-outside-raqqa-in-escalation-of-u-s-involvement-in-syria.html", "text": " In what marks a new escalation in the U.S. war in Syria, a group of Marines have arrived in Syria to join in the fight for Raqqa, the city considered the capital of the Islamic State, the Washington Post reports.

Classes have been canceled; children, left to their fathers; boardrooms, left unmanaged; dinners, left uncooked; blog posts, left unwritten. The strikers are giving their communities a taste of a day without a woman, so as to highlight the indispensable contributions that women make to our society  even as our society suppresses their liberation. There is broad agreement among American feminists that Trumps election is a testament to our nations unpaid debts to the female population. But there is decidedly less agreement about what, precisely, is owed  and to whom. Many of Wednesdays protesters believe that they are owed the pussy-grabber-in-chiefs prompt eviction from the Oval Office; equal pay for equal work; access to legal abortion; and stricter enforcement of laws against sexual assault. Others believe that the ledger runs far longer. To them, if the government wants to settle its debts with womankind, it must provide them with universal health care; free higher education; free child care; an end to mass incarceration; expanded collective-bargaining rights; a $15 minimum wage; the cancelation of the Dakota Access Pipeline; and the decolonization of Palestine  along with a bevy of other social democratic policies necessary for ending decades of neoliberalism. The organizers of the womens strike fall into this latter category. And this fact has led some in the former group to question the wisdom of such a broad and divisive platform. In their view, the feminist movement should restrict its focus to a narrow set of specifically gender-related issues  the ones that all feminists can agree on. On first brush, this seems like a reasonable view. Social movements are as strong as their ranks are wide. And surely, there are more women in the United States who support abortion rights than there are women capable of locating the West Bank on a map  let alone, of passionately arguing for its decolonization. Still, there is a fatal problem with demanding that the feminist movement focus on the issues that are of deep concern to all feminists: No such issues exist. This point is well-illustrated by one of the most widely read arguments against the International Womens Strikes sweeping platform. In a New York Times op-ed, Does Feminism Have Room For Zionists, Emily Shire laments that the feminist movements desire to be inclusive has actually made it anything but. Specifically, she argues that by insisting that feminism is connected to a wide variety of political causes, the movement has alienated feminists who dont adhere to far-left orthodoxy: Instead of picking divisive fights over the minimum wage, oil pipelines, and Zionism, Shire suggests that the movement focus on the key womens issues of reproductive rights, equal pay, increased female representation in all levels of government and policies to combat violence against women. The trouble with this proposal is that not all feminists share the same key issues. For example, a woman at the bottom of Americas income ladder may find a $15 minimum wage far more relevant to her struggle than equal pay for equal work  earning the same poverty wage as her male co-workers wont make her children less hungry. Nor, for that matter, would it make her less vulnerable to exploitation by male domestic partners. And this points to another problem with Shires argument  even if all feminists accepted her priorities, different feminists could arrive at diametrically opposed means of honoring them: One might believe that combating violence against women requires longer jail sentences for sexual assault; another might point to the epidemic levels of rape in American prisons and argue for the abolition of the carceral state. Similarly, one could make a strong argument that universal health care and child care, stronger union rights, and a higher minimum wage are actually more relevant to combating violence against women than many policies that explicitly address that problem: Women at the bottom of the income ladder are six times more likely to be sexually abused than those at the top. Policies that reduce the number of low-income women who are economically dependent on their partners will likely do more to reduce the incidence of rape than, for example, reforming how campuses handle allegations of sexual assault. This isnt to suggest that the latter isnt necessary  nor that the specific forms of gender oppression encountered by women on college campuses and in corporate headquarters dont need dismantling. The point is simply that the stances Shire champions arent the core issues for all feminists  theyre the core issues for feminists like her. To a Palestinian woman in the West Bank, no issue may appear more central to her liberation than the end of the Israeli occupation. To a Zionist woman in Tel Aviv  whose family tree lost branches to Hitler and then to Hamas  no issue may seem less relevant to her interests. The feminist movement has no choice but to represent one woman, and not the other. It is probably easier to argue for the irrelevance of the decolonization of Palestine to feminist goals than it is to say the same about the social democratic reforms on the strikers agenda. Far fewer women in the world suffer from Israeli occupation than are afflicted by poverty or exploitation in the workplace. Still, it is precisely for this reason that left-wing movements like the International Womens Strike and Black Lives Matter feel a responsibility to champion the Palestinian cause: Without the solidarity of larger left-wing movements, the prospects for Palestinian liberation are quite dim. In my view, it is reasonable to argue that the preservation of a majority Jewish state and the liberation of women arent incompatible goals  or else, that anti-Zionism is too divisive and peripheral a stance for the feminist movement to prioritize. But making this argument effectively requires engaging with the substance of the matter. Which is to say: It requires debating Middle East politics. To suggest that the Israel-Palestine conflict, the minimum wage, and opposition to fossil-fuel extraction are intuitively marginal to the feminist cause is to presume a universality of female experience that does not exist. For women who support the maintenance of a majority-Jewish Israel, it is obvious that anti-Zionism has nothing to do with womens rights. For those who see Israel as an apartheid state, that argument is profane. Nearly two months before Shire wrote her plea for a feminist movement more tolerant of heterodox views, Erika Bachiochi made a similar case in an editorial for CNN  but the source of Bachiochis alienation was the movements dogmatic insistence on reproductive choice. Shire would not want the feminist movement to abandon its commitment to legal abortion to make room for women like Bachiochi. Others feel the same about Shires stance on Israel-Palestine. The feminist movement cannot make room for all feminists  or, at least, it cannot represent all feminists core concerns. Those who wish for the movement to disown parts of the strikers platform accomplish little by declaring, as Shire does, that the stances they oppose have nothing to do with feminism. Such claims only reiterate the point of contention."}, {"date": "2017/03/08", "title": "Mayor Bill de Blasio Teases Citywide Ferry Service, Coming This Summer", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/mayor-de-blasio-teases-citywide-ferry-coming-this-summer.html", "text": " A clear, springlike Wednesday offered a nice backdrop for Mayor Bill de Blasio as he announced details about a new citywide ferry service that will start chugging this summer. New ferry routes will connect Astoria, the Rockaways, and South Brooklyn to the existing East River Ferry Service. The Brooklyn Navy Yard will be the home port of the new system, where all the boats will dock and refuel. A ferry stop will also open there in 2018. (Heres a full list of routes and stops.) A ferry ride will cost $2.75, the same price as a subway ride, but with that classic East River stench. The boats will operate from 6:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily. Theres no set date for the official summer launch; de Blasio said to expect an update next month. But Hornblower, which has a pretty unassailable ferry-company name and is operating the service, has started hiring 200 people to fill jobs at Brooklyn Navy Yard, where the new 56,000-square-foot facility is being built. Right now, the boats are apparently being battle-tested in the Gulf of Mexico before they arrive in city waters. Mayor de Blasio said about 500,000 people live within the ferry routes, and the city will add a free shuttle service to Brooklyn Navy Yard to help people access that terminal. Right now, the city is predicting about 4.6 million trips annually. The estimated cost of this endeavor, as reported last year, is about $325 million over a six-year period. The city is spending about $55 million to construct the ferry stops and make other infrastructure upgrades, and about $30 million per year will go to subsidizing the cost ($6.60 per rider) of a ticket to keep it on par with a MetroCard swipe.

Timed to coincide with International Womens Day, the strike, dubbed A Day Without a Woman and the Womens Strike, calls on women to not work, not shop, and to wear red in solidarity with women everywhere who cannot afford to join them. A protest kicked off at noon in New York City, with demonstrators gathering in Columbus Circle. Organizers of the Womens March, who were also involved in the planning of Wednesdays demonstrations, took to the street outside of the Trump International Hotel as a form of civil disobedience. They were arrested. Meanwhile, in D.C., a handful of women U.S. representatives walked out of the Capitol and held an event on its steps honoring International Womens Day. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, of California, was the most high-profile member of the walkout, which included at least nine other congresswomen, and was greeted by an enthusiastic crowd of supporters. We walked out today for A Day Without a Woman to send a clear message: that we stand with our sisters across the country who have walked out in defense of equal rights for women  We are raising our voices for the millions of women who cant, said Representative Barbara Lee of California. The congresswomen eventually returned to the chamber, where they will take part in a typical workday. The strikes goal is to make clear the enormous value that women of all backgrounds add to our socio-economic systemwhile receiving lower wages and experiencing greater inequities, vulnerability to discrimination, sexual harassment, and job insecurity, wrote organizers of the Womens March. Women are encouraged today to forego any duty that feels like work, from diapering and dishes to wearing makeup and putting on fake smiles. The White House released a statement Wednesday to celebrate and reflect upon the meaningful progress women have made throughout society. The statement also declared the Trump administrations intention to advance the economic empowerment of women. Asked at todays White House press briefing if any women in the Trump administration were skipping work as a part of the Womens Strike, Press Secretary Sean Spicer said hes not aware of any [staff] that are not here. Inspiration for the strike came from a similar demonstration called A Day Without an Immigrant that sought to remind people of the grueling, unnoticed work so many immigrants perform in the U.S. That strike shut down businesses across the nation, while the Womens Strike appears to be hitting schools the hardest. That makes sense. Women make up three-quarters of teachers, and their planned participation in Wednesdays strike has led a handful of school districts, in cities such as Alexandria, Virginia, and Chapel Hill, North Carolina, to take the day off. The strike has received some criticism for excluding working-class women who cant afford to miss work or may lose their job for doing so. But organizers have pushed back against that. And as the editors of the Cut wrote in the only piece set to publish there today, even with lingering questions about inclusivity, they decided to strike today to show solidarity with the women around the world who are standing up for equal pay and equal opportunity, reproductive freedom, an end to sexual assaults, an end to bigotry of all kinds, and policies that support our families, like parental leave, health care, and child care."}, {"date": "2017/03/08", "title": "ISIS Attackers Dressed As Doctors Kill Dozens at Afghan Military Hospital", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/attackers-dressed-as-doctors-kill-dozens-at-afghan-hospital.html", "text": " Terrorists dressed as doctors attacked a military hospital in Kabul Wednesday, killing at least 38 and wounding more than 50.

The three gunmen worked their way up to the upper levels of the hospital and dug in for a firefight with Afghan special forces, who were dropped by helicopter onto the roof of the hospital. As the firefight raged on, patients could be seen climbing out of the building and waiting on window ledges, Reuters reports. At one point, another explosion was heard inside the complex when a car reportedly blew up. The siege ended hours after it began with all three gunmen dead. In all religions, a hospital is regarded as an immune site and attacking it is attacking the whole of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani, the Afghanistan president, said Wednesday. If ISIS did indeed carry out the hospital attack, it will mark a change in strategy for the group, the BBC notes.

It means more choices and competition so that you can buy the plan that you need and that you can afford, he said. The plan creates a better, patient-centered system, and gives people the freedom to buy the plan they want and can afford. If you dont know exactly what all these terms mean  choice, competition, freedom, patient-centered  thats fine by him. Its better than fine, actually. Its the point. All these terms are meant to complicate the real choice his plan presents, which is a very simple one: more versus less. Obamacare was designed in an intensely budget-conscious atmosphere, with the requirement that it reduce the deficit, which put severe pressure on its costs. The result is that, while it gives some 20 million people access to insurance, much of that insurance is fairly stingy. To the extent that people dont like Obamacare, it is mostly because they think the law does not cover enough. This recent poll is illuminating: Those who want to keep the law or have it do more outnumber those who want to eliminate it or have it do less by almost two to one. The most popular position by far is to change Obamacare to make it do more  commanding 46 percent. Changing Obamacare to make it do less gets just 7 percent. That public-opinion landscape explains why Republicans have relentlessly attacked the law for its skimpiness and promised more generous coverage. Yet that latter position, the one preferred by just 7 percent, is what Trumpcare does. Right-wing dissidents have dismissed Ryans bill as Obamacare Lite. Theres some truth to this. Conservatives do have ideas for radically redesigning the health-care system in a way that relies on the power of patients as educated consumers to drive down costs. The terms Ryan threw around, like patient-centered and competition, are normally associated with those policies. As Ross Douthat points out, very few of these ideas made it into Ryans bill. Thats because implementing those ideas correctly would either cost money or alienate enormous constituencies. (The biggest idea conservatives have, cutting or eliminating the tax deduction for employer-sponsored insurance, was left out because its politically radioactive.) And so what emerged from the frantic, tax-cut-deadline-driven process was a bill thats essentially Obamacare, but less of it. Obamacare created two vehicles to cover people who couldnt get insurance. It expanded Medicaid to cover the poorest of the uninsured, and those who made more money received tax credits they could use to buy insurance on new state-based exchanges. Trumpcare cuts funding for Medicaid by $370 billion over a decade, and the cuts are heavily backloaded: And it reduces funding for subsidies on the exchanges by $2,409 per person by 2020. To be sure, that is an aggregate figure. There are huge variations. Young people, the affluent, and customers in low-cost markets would do better, and some of them actually get more support from Trumpcare than they do from Obamacare. On the other hand, older, poorer customers in high-cost markets (like rural areas, especially) would get absolutely hammered. Abby Goodnough and Reed Abelson report on a few of them. In North Carolina, a 55-year-old would see her tax credit cut from $8,688 to $3,500. A 60-year-old would see his familys tax credit reduced from $25,164 to $11,500. Those cuts would make any decent insurance plan not remotely affordable. And there is no design reform, no theory, that could make up for the gap between those peoples resources and the cost of their care. (The cost of modern medical care is beyond the resources available to them.) Youre either going to give them enough money to access medical treatment, or youre not. Paul Ryan prefers not because he has a deep philosophical aversion to the kinds of income redistribution required to cover the uninsured. But rather than make that unpopular case, he obscures it with a lot of vague lingo about choice and competition. The most naked and revealing moment of Ryans press conference came when he was asked about why his plan provides a huge tax cut for the rich. You can watch his response, ten minutes in. Ryan scoffs and makes a dismissive hand gesture, like hes been presented with an utterly frivolous objection. Then Ryan says, Read the bill! Go to readthebill.gop! and moves on to next question while he and his lieutenants share forced laughter at the absurd query. It is of course incontrovertibly true that Ryans bill provides a big tax cut for the rich. Its a $600 billion tax cut, almost all of which would accrue to the very rich. His tax cut is a major reason why his plan provides fewer resources to cover the poor and sick. He believes that feature is so unpopular and objectionable he literally cannot even acknowledge its existence. It is emblematic of his entire approach. Ryans strategy is to pass his plan into law without ever admitting its central objective."}, {"date": "2017/03/08", "title": "The Statue of Liberty Went Dark Overnight", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/the-statue-of-liberty-went-dark-overnight.html", "text": " The Statue of Liberty usually glows at night in New York Harbor, illuminated by spotlights trained on the monument.

And so it is appropriate that political heat surrounding Republican plans to kill federal funding for Planned Parenthood is one of several challenges threatening the new House GOP blueprint for repealing and partially replacing Obamacare. It is unclear at this point how many Republican members of Congress would actually vote against the American Health Care Act  as Trumpcare is formally known  solely on grounds of its Planned Parenthood defunding, though at most it would be a few House members and two senators (Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska). Collins is the only surviving Republican senator to have voted against the dry run Obamacare-repeal legislation of 2015 (subsequently vetoed by President Obama) on grounds of its Planned Parenthood provisions. If this were the only controversy surrounding AHCA, it probably would not be fatal, even if Collins and Murkowski both defected, since two Democratic senators, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, have voted to defund Planned Parenthood in the past. But the real peril represented by the conservative obsession with destroying Planned Parenthood is that it might only take one defector  again, Collins is the most likely  in combination with other senators who have other issues with AHCA to deny Republicans the 50 votes they need. So far the ACHA, which is being opposed by a vast array of advocacy groups, including such major forces as AARP, is not tempting any Democrats to cross the line to give Republicans a cushion. Thus if, say, Rand Paul (who has denounced the new plan as Obamacare Lite) and Mike Lee oppose AHCA from the right and Collins opposes it from the left, it could be dead, even if Mitch McConnell and the White House somehow manage to keep waverers like Ted Cruz and Lisa Murkowski in line. Republicans do not, moreover, have the luxury of taking out the Planned Parenthood provisions, even if they promise to enact them separately. That would be a deal-breaker for a significant number of conservatives, and an act of betrayal for anti-abortion activists. And worse yet, separating the Planned Parenthood fight from the Obamacare debate would mean efforts to defund the organization would shift to the appropriations process, and to the must-pass bill that will be needed to fund federal operations after the old omnibus funding measure expires on April 28. Since Democrats can filibuster appropriations bills, another Planned Parenthood fight in that arena could definitely produce gridlock and maybe even another government shutdown, which is the last thing Republicans need. So no matter what other adjustments are made with the AHCA to shore up Republican support on the left or right or to seduce Joe Manchin into supporting it (maybe some special deal for West Virginia akin to the infamous Cornhusker Kickback that won Ben Nelsons vote for Obamacare), the GOPs health-care bill is most definitely going to bear the red badge of shame associated with the vengeful effort to deny women life-saving and rights-respecting health-care services. Thats a deal with the devil the GOP made a long time ago."}, {"date": "2017/03/08", "title": "China Wants to Play Peacemaker in North Korea", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/china-wants-to-play-peacemaker-in-north-korea.html", "text": " This week, American and South Korean troops gathered for their annual simulation of a war with North Korea. Pyongyang promptly got into the spirit of the season  and fired barrages of missiles in the general direction of U.S. military bases in Japan. The U.S. responded to this display by beginning to deploy its advanced anti-missile battery system  Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)  to South Korea. China believes THAAD could be used to spy on its airspace. And so, it responded to Americas move by by threatening sanctions against Seoul  and, then, imploring North Korea and the U.S. to suspend their belligerent activities. Chinas suggestion is, as a first step, for North Korea to suspend nuclear activity, and for the U.S. and South Korea to also suspend large-scale military drills, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said Wednesday, according to the Washington Post. The two sides are like two accelerating trains coming toward each other with neither side willing to give way  The question is: Are the two sides really ready for a head-on collision? Our priority now is to flash the red light and apply the brakes on both trains. Yi suggested that once these brakes are applied, the two trains could be rerouted to a negotiating table. Yis proposal is not a new one  North Korea has proposed suspension for suspension for years. But that old offer is on the desk of a new president, one faced with a North Korean adversary that has never been closer to developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the coast of California (though, by all appearances, theyre still a ways away). It is difficult to anticipate President Trumps approach to the crisis. And not just for outside observers. Last week, the White House ordered a review of all policy options toward the Korean peninsula  one assessing the pros and cons of everything from preemptive airstrikes on Pyongyang, to recognizing North Korea as a nuclear power. On the one hand, Trumps bellicose rhetoric toward China suggests hed be unlikely to embrace Beijings preferred diplomatic solution: withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea in exchange for a suspension of North Koreas nuclear program. On the other hand, the presidents desire to validate his reputation as a dealmaker could make the bargaining table an attractive prospect. Up to now, the U.S. has sought to deter North Koreas nuclear ambitions through economic sanctions. And on that front, it has secured Chinas limited cooperation. Beijing has worked to curb North Korean coal imports. But Kim Jong-uns regime may be willing to suffer grave economic impairment to protect a nuclear program that it views as the fountainhead of its security against an American attack. Meanwhile, in South Korea, left-wing presidential candidate Moon Jae-in  who expressed support for a North-South confederation in 2011  has been polling well. Jae-ins victory could lead to years of South Korean accommodation of the North. With that prospect on the horizon, Pyongyang is unlikely to unilaterally deescalate its conflict with the U.S. All this puts Washington in a sticky wicket.

But the business of Trump, the commercial brand, is marching onward. In January, shortly before taking office, the president formally ceded his corporate holdings to a trust, and handed management responsibilities at the Trump Organization over to his sons, Donald Jr. and Eric. While the president promised that the company would do no new foreign deals, to avoid potential ethical and constitutional entanglements, the younger Trumps are otherwise bound by few constraints as they seek to expand the family business. The head of the Trump Organizations hotel division recently disclosed that the company is planning an ambitious domestic expansion, and has signed letters of intent with developers in cities around the country, including New York, Austin, Cincinnati, and Nashville. Last month, the first of these local partners stepped forward, revealing plans for a hotel in Dallas. I think they are just moving full steam ahead, the developer, Mukemmel Sarimsakci, told me. Sarimsakci, a gregarious 50-year-old immigrant, likes to introduce himself as the Turkish Trump  a sobriquet he claims he was given by the press in his home country. He is enthusiastically hoping to play a role in the Trump sons plans to launch a new mid-priced hotel chain, fittingly called Scion. In keeping with the patriarchs business model, the Trumps will license the name and play a role in management and promotion, but it will be up to developers like Sarimsakci to actually finance and build the hotels. He signed a preliminary letter of intent with the Trump Organization on December 6, a month after the election, and if all goes well, hopes to start construction in September. There is no reason why it shouldnt be, Sarimsakci told me when I recently visited him in Dallas. After all, its a business relationship, right? Of course, that question is never quite so simple when it comes to dealing with the Trump Organization. The presidents name is still on the marquee, and that brings all kinds of unprecedented complications, as Sarimsakci has discovered. The day before I visited him, Sarimsakci was surprised to hear that a formerly friendly Democratic city councilman had vowed to oppose his Dallas project as a rebuke to Trump, telling Politico: I think that guy is an invalid human and I wish nothing but failure for him. This wasnt the developers first encounter with the Trump resistance. Sarimsakcis proposal to develop another Scion in St. Louis was scuttled by street protests in November. As a naturalized citizen and a secular Muslim, Sarimsakci found himself in a strange defensive position. Anyone is free to invest in the United States, he said. Sarimsakci, who goes by Mike here in his adopted country, went to graduate school at Stanford and still lives in the Bay Area with his family. Although he is involved in an unusually diverse array of business ventures around the world  office construction in Central Asia, renewable-energy projects in the nation of Georgia, a development for the government of Niger  he spends much of his time these days in Dallas. He is known there for the role he has played in the revival of the citys urban core, which was a dead zone until recently, as well as his Trumpian flair for promoting his big plans, only some of which have come to fruition. Mike was an early mover downtown, said Mayor Michael Rawlings, a Democrat who supports his Scion plan. Sarimsakci thinks that Trump Organizations new hotel concept, which is meant to target millennial business travelers, is well-suited to the area, which he has tried to reposition as a tech mecca. Last week, I met Sarimsakci at his largest project to date, the conversion of the century-old Butler Building into another hotel and loft-like apartments. A compact, bald man whose face was flecked with gray stubble, he led me around the polished concrete floor of the basement common area, which was subdivided for various whimsical purposes: an art studio, a music performance space, a lounge filled with games. Walking out to the street, past the future location of a bespoke tailor and barbershop, Sarimsakci lit up a big Monte Cristo cigar and surveyed the nearly completed renovation. Everyone thought we were nuts to purchase this property, because its surrounded by homeless shelters, Sarimsakci said. It was a huge risk, and a huge challenge to find financing. Sarimsakci relies on funding from overseas for his projects  a common strategy in the realm of real-estate finance. More than half of the capital for the $90 million Butler Building project, for instance, came via the federal EB-5 program, which offers green cards to foreign investors. (The investment was marketed primarily in China.) For the Scion project, Sarimsakci says he has lined up a group of private investors, many of them dear friends he has known since childhood in Turkey, along with individuals from Kazakhstan and Qatar. Its interesting, because all the local people thought it wasnt a good idea to do all these things, said Sarimsakci, as he walked me around downtown at lunch hour, pointing out new fashionable restaurants and residential construction sites. This was empty four years ago, he said. You didnt see any of it. Sarimsakci said he originally connected with the Trump Organization around two years ago, when he began working with the company on plans to develop Trump-branded hotels in Turkey, Georgia, and northern Iraq. We wanted to do it, and then it turned out that he won the election, and Mr. Trump became the president, Sarimsakci said. As the Trump Organization pivoted, so did Sarimsakcis plans. Domestic was always in play, he said. He initially floated the idea of putting a Scion into a historic building in downtown St. Louis that he is redeveloping. But after a November protest outside the building he dropped the idea, which would have been subject to city approvals. The emotions were very, very high, and we decided at that point it was not constructive to put that through, Sarimsakci said. We said, well do a Marriott. Sarimsakci moved on to developer-friendly Dallas. The site he is eyeing for the Scion is currently a parking lot across the street from the Butler Building and the Dallas City Hall, as well as a soup kitchen that currently attracts crowds of scruffy people to the block. Rawlings, who protested the presidents original ban on travelers from seven Muslim countries, said he nonetheless welcomed the Trump Organizations participation in the redevelopment of the area. I have to separate it from my politics, and what I think of the president, he said. Im thumbs-up on the project, and want to make sure that Dallas continues to receive the benefits of Mike being smart about this. Last month, Sarimsakci unveiled architectural renderings of a six-story glass-walled Scion, inspiring an onslaught of national press attention  and some local opposition. But realistically, even critics of the project admit there is little they can do to stop the hotel, so long as it requires no subsidies and conforms to the zoning code. (You cant discriminate in building permits, said Philip Kingston, the Democratic councilman who has been critical of the Scion project.) Nonetheless, the development is far from being a fait accompli. A letter of intent is a nonbinding agreement, and the Trump Organization has declined to comment publicly on the deal. But Sarimsakci did say that after the news broke, he received a congratulatory phone call from Donald Trump Jr. He has never met the president, though he says he has long been an admirer. Mr. Trump has been my idol in the real-estate development business, Sarimsakci said. I read all his books when I was a teenager and in college. Before signing the letter of intent, Sarimsakci said, the Trump Organization reviewed and approved his architectural plans, which include a big collaborative office space on the ground floor. They want it to be a start-up entrepreneur atmosphere, he said, which he says fits with the vibe he and other developers have been trying to create in downtown Dallas. I think its actually a good model for up-and-coming cities, he told me. Our next stop after this will be St. Louis  which will happen. He says he has already picked out a new St. Louis site that wont face the same political hurdles as the first one. He envisions building more Scion hotels in cities like Detroit, Pittsburgh, and San Jose. The next day, Sarimsakci told me, he would be flying off to Mexico City, where he was working on a bid to buy a major shopping mall in Panama City. (The former owner was being forced to divest because of U.S. money-laundering sanctions.) Its the most prominent piece of property in Central America  its amazing, an amazing piece of property, the Turkish Trump said, sounding very much like his namesake. He too has political ambitions: He says hed one day like to be the first Turkish-American member of the U.S. Senate. (Although his planning process hasnt gone much further than that.) But even Sarimsakcis admiration for Trump has limits. I didnt do a campaign contribution to Mr. Trump, nor to Ms. Hillary, he said. I didnt vote because I liked certain things in both candidates and disliked certain things both candidates, so I was torn. I dont know Mr. Trump, he said. I just like his business."}, {"date": "2017/03/08", "title": "Suddenly, New Yorks Rich Are Obsessed With Importing Pandas", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/suddenly-new-yorks-rich-are-obsessed-with-importing-pandas.html", "text": " Children love pandas! declared Representative Carolyn Maloney with the giddy conviction of a politician getting behind something incontrovertible.

And suddenly the list of inoffensive causes had shrunk so radically that it seemed maybe a couple of fat black-and-white bears  who eat almost exclusively what is the worlds least nutritious vegetation and who take a rather lackadaisical approach to procreation  were the only thing these people could agree on anymore. Its panda populism: Check out the National Zoos panda cam! And so, on the evening of February 8: the Black & White Panda Ball. Maloney was dressed, intentionally, rather like a panda, in a sleeveless black-with-white-polka-dots L.K. Bennett dress shed bought for the occasion. Onstage at the Starlight Roof, she was extolling what pandas could do to heal this city, maybe even this country, in the face of American Carnage. They are also a symbol of good luck, and after the tumultuous time we had over the past two decades, I think its time to have some of these pandas. The room was crowded, with guests paying $1,000 for a ticket. PNC Bank, Bank of America, and Leonard Lauder were among the $25,000-a-table Bamboo-level sponsors; China Construction America, Cushman & Wakefield, JPMorgan Chase, and China Merchants Bank had their logos on the program. Guests included Maurice Hank Greenberg, who for many years ran AIG, which has been in China since 1919; Joe Piscopo, the now-leathery former Saturday Night Live star turned Trump surrogate, who, shortly after this event, told the Times he wants to run for governor of New Jersey; former mayor David Dinkins; retired representative Charlie Rangel; Stephen Baldwin, the Republican Baldwin; the 85-year-old fashion model Carmen DellOrefice; Larry and Wendy Rockefeller; Chinas consul general to New York, Ambassador Zhang Qiyue; and the admittedly befuddled musician and performance artist Casey Spooner, whod come along as someones guest to fill out a table, but, when I ran into him during the cocktail hour  in which crab cakes and Peking-duck egg rolls were passed, and a professionally friendly person dressed in an actual panda outfit mingled with the crowd, posing for selfies  he wasnt sure what the whole evening was about, exactly, and made it clear that he is personally rather uncomfortable with the entire idea of animals being kept in captivity. I just want to say hello. Were lucky to have this happen, said John Catsimatidis, Maloneys chief ally in the panda crusade. The garrulous Gristedes-supermarket-and-oil-refining mogul, municipal-gadfly radio host, promiscuous political contributor, and perennial mayoral aspirant was holding forth from the stage as guests ate candy-cane beet and mango salads and perused the program, which read, on the cover, THE PANDAS ARE COMING TO NYC (adding parenthetically, in smaller type, perhaps helpfully for those unfamiliar with where pandas live when not in zoos, that they are coming all the way from China). What we want  we want the pandas in Central Park, he added. We love the pandas. Were going to have an additional 5 million tourists to New York City. (Hmm  5 million?) Everybody will do great  and most important, the cultural exchange between New York and China, which will bring everybody closer together, and thats what we want, right? The evenings emcee was Fox 5 NYs implacably affable Ernie Anastos, who had just a short time before he confronted the Asian-American children of the Joyous String Ensemble  whod navigated a recognizable version ofEvery Breath You Take and whod, Anastos told us, been on both Fox & Friends and, my tablemate and I agreed we heard him say, Helen DeGeneres  with this demand: that they tell him about their love of the pandas. Were so excited for two cute, cute pandas to come to New York City, one said. Wouldnt it be cute to name one of the pandas Joy? Maloney has been in panda pursuit for a number of years now; for her powerful friends, its a testament to her quirky determination. But pandas clearly mean something to her  something like a symbol of a kind of state of cozy grace in this dirty, unlucky world. You can see it in her face in an August 2014 photo of her with a panda, looking a bit smitten, on a visit to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding in the Sichuan province of China; it was projected on a screen at the event. Thats a real panda, not a stuffed animal, and were holding hands, Maloney said wistfully. When I asked Maloney later what caused her to be so interested in the bears, she said one of her daughters, Virginia, was obsessed with them when she was a child, going so far as to decorate her room with a map of China, showing where they could be found. Today, Virginia is collecting graduate degrees from MIT and Harvard and going to work for Facebook, so her phase of wanting to be a panda scientist turned out to be just a phase. But Maloney says shes always brought up pandas whenever she meets officials in China, and it would always break the ice to talk about pandas  everybody was happy. It wasnt quite the same back home. After her trip to China in 2014, she went on Catsimatidiss radio show to complain about how the Chinese authorities she spoke to about getting pandas for the city had wanted to confirm that the local authorities were onboard. The mayor wasnt interested, she said, before adding that Mayor de Blasio doesnt like horses [in Central Park], and I guess he doesnt like pandas [either]. She said Governor Andrew Cuomo backed her efforts and had dispatched State Parks commissioner Rose Harvey to help. Who wouldnt want a panda? De Blasio was worried they were too expensive  the bamboo alone!  and the Wildlife Conservation Society, which runs the world-class zoos in the city, wasnt interested in reshuffling resources to the people-pleasing pandas just to please a congressperson. At one point, the Times reported, a Conservation Society official complained to City Hall that Maloneys advocacy had reached a new level of absurdity, and suggested, I think a statement saying that we appreciate her passion but we are not interested in pandas would be very helpful  Clearly she doesnt hear it when we say it to her respectfully. The conservationists understood, in ways a crushed-out panda lover might not, that what makes them lovable is also what makes them difficult: They are incompetent creatures who somehow lucked into an evolutionary loophole by which they seduced the worlds most powerful creatures into swooning over them because they are so cute (cuteness being, evolutionarily speaking, how humans process vulnerability and lack of independence). In the wild, pandas are solitary creatures, designed, like other bears, with a digestive tract to eat meat but who subsist instead on a great deal of bamboo every day. Its a foraging-intensive diet, and pandas low metabolic rate accounts for their stoner allure  all they do all day is sort of roll around and munch. Panda males in captivity arent particularly amorous, either: Researchers have taken to showing them panda porn to try to get them in the mood. Or just orient them. On top of that, female pandas can become pregnant on only a few days a year, occasionally accidentally crush their offspring, and seem able to raise only one of them at a time if they happen to bear twins (or, in one super-adorable case, triplets). In addition to all that, all pandas are the property of China and must be leased, with heavy regulations, at about a million dollars a year for a set, if the government bureaucracy lets you have them at all. According to the terms of a cooperative breeding agreement, any offspring  which everyone agrees are of course the cutest  must be returned before their fourth birthday, as happened just last month with Bao Bao, the National Zoos beloved cub (CNN covered her journey home to China closely). Until about a hundred years ago, pandas were virtually unknown in the West, outside of a few improbable taxidermied specimens in science museums. But since the arrival of Su Lin, the first panda to survive the journey to America, in 1936, pandas have been cuddly, spectacular draws for zoos: Su Lin spent some time in New York before being sold to suburban Chicagos Brookfield Zoo, drawing hundreds of thousands of visitors, including Helen Keller and Al Capone. Within a decade, six more pandas had arrived in the U.S., including two at the Bronx Zoo. They became the main attraction of the 1939 New York Worlds Fair. The Bronx Zoo got another gift of two in 1941, Pandah and Pandee, from Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek, as a gesture of friendship by the non-communist Chinese to this country. Once the communists won, panda emigration was banned, and America became panda-depopulated. Then came Richard Nixon and his 1972 trip to China, which brought Ling-Ling (196992) and Hsing-Hsing (197099). In return, the U.S. government sent China a pair of musk oxen. Good deal! Maloneys is a different kind of diplomacy  the power of private money. She eventually got the mayor to come around by promising no public funds would be used (the governor had a similar stipulation). The core backers are Catsimatidis; Yue-Sai Kan, the Chinese-American television personality; and Hank Greenberg  the guy who sued the government for $40 billion for overstepping its legal authority in how it bailed out his company, AIG, in 2008. Along with Maloney, the three run The Pandas Are Coming to NYC, a pro-panda 501c3. When I met with Greenberg a couple of weeks after the Panda Ball, at his Park Avenue office decorated with Asian art both ancient and modern, he wanted to make sure I understood why theyre all allied in this project. All for different reasons, he said, with the sageness of a very rich 91-year-old man. If youre a politician, it helps your constituency. If youre an aspiring politician, youre hoping it will help you. He paused. Im not either of those. So what is he in it for? Its a beautiful animal, he said. I noticed inch-high role-playing figurines on his desk that appeared to show one man begging for his life while another, in a metal helmet, held a sword over him. I asked him if that was inspiring for doing business, and he laughed a little. At the panda ball, Catsimatidis introduced Ed Cox, the chairman of the New York State Republican Party (whose son was married to Catsimatidiss daughter for a while). All right, a little bit of history here, Cox said, mounting the stage in front of American and Chinese flags. I was a senior in college in 1968. I was dating this beautiful girl, Tricia Nixon. Wed been together for four years since high school. Her father was running in the New York primary against Nelson Rockefeller  whose nephew Larry was at the Panda Ball. Cox asked Nixon what this rumored secret plan for peace was that Rockefeller kept going on about. And you know what he said? I am going to go to Beijing and Moscow, and were going to bring a Generation of Peace in the world. Thats what he said. And then he became president. The world was facing a potential nuclear war between the Warsaw Pact and nato. And the Chinese were fighting all these border wars. And we were losing 300 draftees a week in a proxy war in Vietnam. All this was going on. And whats the symbol of that? The panda. That is the hope for peace in the world. China is emerging on the world stage, the second biggest economic power in the world, and there is the dispute over the islands in the South China Sea  More than ever, we need to have this symbol. As a symbol of peace in the world. Yes, there are pandas in Washington, D.C., but it doesnt count unless there are pandas here in NYC, the capital of the world! Am I right? Most at the ball would tend to agree. Where it gets complicated is that zoos in New York dont want pandas imposed on them. So what to do? How about building your own single-species exhibition pavilion for the pandas, paid for with private funds, in the northern section of Central Park (Maloney says they will have a design competition, but I.M. Pei is interested). Maybe even get the Trumps involved: Catsimatidis told the New York Post that he spoke to a representative of the Trump Organization about Donald Jr. and Eric Trump maybe cottoning to pandas the way their dad had to Wollman Rink in the 1980s. What Id say to Eric is, Youd be doing for the panda project what your father did with the Wollman Rink. Can you build a panda facility that follows in the footsteps of your father? Catsimatidis told the paper. He later said to me, You bring the pandas up to people on the street, and 80 percent of them say, Yeah, bring the pandas! Which seems accurate. Its a plus-plus for the hotel-and-restaurant industry. I think it will increase the relationship with the Chinese and New Yorkers  I jokingly was saying to the Chinese people, Im going to talk to Trump; you guys build good walls. They have a good sense of humor. And how did Yue-Sai, whom Catsimatidis calls the Barbara Walters of China, get involved? Ten years ago, she had the same idea and even went to the Bronx Zoo and asked the guy who was the head of the zoo how to do it, she told me on the phone from Shanghai, where her allergies were bothering her (Today its so smoggy and scary. You cant see across the street). The zookeeper said he remembered the last time they had pandas, she told me, in 1987, for six months under a deal Ed Koch had brokered. (In the 1980s, the Chinese were offering pandas on short-term rental, but after the World Wildlife Fund sued the U.S. government on grounds that this was bad conservation policy, new regulations were put in place offering them for only ten years at a time. Koch told the Times that having pandas in town got him reelected.) Its so expensive, Yue-Sai realized, so she was happy to join Maloneys crusade. The Panda Ball raised $500,000, which isnt much for a project like this, even though Maloney told me she thought it could be done for less than the $50 million estimate, and others involved told me they thought they could even cut a deal on the pandas from China for less than the usual $1 million a year. Yue-Sai also had some other ideas. Why not get a construction company to donate the materials? That would be phenomenal. And someone to sponsor all the bamboos? That would be so cool, so, so cool, Yue-Sai said. You need a very big anchor sponsor, she thought. She had a thought about that, too: Panda Express, the fast-food chain. I think that would be ideal, she said. How perfect is that? *This article appears in the March 6, 2017, issue of New York Magazine."}, {"date": "2017/03/08", "title": "Senate Calls for Swift Action As JCCs Face Another Round of Bomb Threats", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/senate-calls-for-swift-action-amid-more-jcc-bomb-threats.html", "text": " The Senate sent a letter to top Trump administration officials on Tuesday urging them to do more to combat anti-Semitic threats just as Jewish Community Centers faced another round of bomb threats. Fifteen Jewish organizations in the U.S. and Canada received the phone calls on Tuesday, in the sixth wave of threats this year. The Anti-Defamation League said that 110 institutions have received 140 bomb threats. We write to underscore the need for swift action with regard to the deeply troubling series of anonymous bomb threats made against Jewish Community Centers (JCCs), Jewish day schools, synagogues and other buildings affiliated with Jewish organizations or institutions across the country, said the letter, which was signed by all 100 senators. It continued, We are concerned that the number of incidents is accelerating and failure to address and deter these threats will place innocent people at risk and threaten the financial viability of JCCs, many of which are institutions in their communities. The letter was addressed to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and FBI Director James Comey. The FBI has been investigating the incidents, and last week the bureau charged Juan Thompson, a former journalist, with making at least eight threats as part of a campaign to harass and intimidate his ex-girlfriend. Hes believed to be a copycat who only started making threats after seeing news reports. Comey also met with Jewish community leaders to discuss their progress. Afterward, they praised the extraordinary effort that the FBI is applying to the ongoing investigation, according to the Washington Post. Last week, the Department of Homeland Security said it would help Jewish institutions improve security. Sessions has not discussed the incidents, but President Trump and others in his administration have continued to condemn them. Trump was initially criticized for giving vague, defensive answers when asked about the threats.

The presidents going to be very pivotal in this, Representative Dennis Ross, a member of the House GOP whip team, explained last month. Hes got to go into these districts and give air cover to these members who are weak-kneed on some of these issues. After House Speaker Paul Ryan unveiled the American Health Care Act this week, members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus made their own bet: that Trump isnt very committed to passing Ryans vision for health-care reform and can be swayed to their way of thinking. Their plan got off to a rocky start. During a meeting with 20 House GOP whips on Tuesday, President Trump said he would do everything he can to get the Republican health-care bill passed, and did not acknowledge that the reaction so far has been almost uniformly negative. I really believe were going to have tremendous support, he said. Im already seeing the support not only in this room, Im seeing it from everybody. This meeting was a confirmation from the president that he will do whats necessary and will have our backs, said Representative Dennis Ross, who was in the meeting. He basically said whatever we need him to do  hell do that, because its really, as Mike Pence said, is a binary choice: you vote keep Obamacare or you vote to repeal it. President Trumps first contribution was tweeting out a mild jab at Senator Rand Paul, whos branded the AHCA Obamacare Lite. But there were other early signs that the Freedom Caucuss gamble might pay off. The GOP leadership plans to pass the AHCA at lightning speed; Ryan said he plans to have a floor vote in two weeks, and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said hell bring it directly to the Senate in early April. Yet multiple White House officials suggested on Tuesday that the current legislation is just a starting point for negotiations. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said the bill is a work in progress. Vice-President Mike Pence described the AHCA as the framework for reform and said the administration is certainly open to improvements. Members of the Freedom Caucus actually seemed emboldened after a closed-door meeting with Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, on Tuesday evening. Mulvaney, a former Freedom Caucus member, talked with the group on behalf of the Trump administration, but Representative Mark Meadows said he didnt tell them they had to back the AHCA. He let us know theyre still open to negotiations. That this is not something that is set in stone, said Meadows, who chairs the caucus, according to The Hill. Representative Dave Schweikerts takeaway from the meeting: If you have other creative things, the White House will look at that too. While Ryan said earlier in the day that he can guarantee that the bill will have the 218 votes needed to pass when it goes before the full House, several Freedom Caucus members said they dont see how thats possible. Right now, the speaker of the House does not have the votes to pass this bill unless its got substantial Democrat support, said Representative Mo Brooks. Mulvaney reportedly didnt get into which parts of the AHCA are up for debate, but Representative Raul Labrador said members of his caucus would have to see major changes. I dont think there is any tinkering that will get us to 218, he said. Entertaining creative ideas and negotiating major changes does not seem possible when youre trying to rush legislation through Congress in record time. But perhaps the president has learned some tricks for navigating the legislative process since he lamented last week, Nobody knew health care could be so complicated. At Tuesdays meeting, Trump declared, Its a complicated process, but actually its very simple. Its called good health care."}, {"date": "2017/03/08", "title": "Felony Accusation Puts New Strain on Obama-Trump Relationship", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/obama-trump-relationship-strained-by-felony-accusation.html", "text": " Since Election Day, President Trump has often seemed torn between his passion for pushing Obama conspiracy theories and his excitement that the leader of the free world was being nice to him. Days after his Oval Office meeting with the Kenyan-born founder of ISIS, Trump told 60 Minutes that Obama is terrific and they have great chemistry. A month later, Trump tweeted that Obama was undermining his transition, but claimed hours later, We talked about it and smiled about it. Then in early February, Trump bragged to Bill OReilly that he and Obama get along, I dont know if hell admit this, but he likes me. I like him. But Obama seems to be having a hard time laughing off his successors evidence-free claim that he personally ordered the wiretapping of Trump Tower. The Wall Street Journal reports: Trump is reportedly having second thoughts about hurling felony accusations as well  though he still thinks Obama and his allies are working to undermine him. It appears the source of Trumps claim is an old, sketchy British report on a FISA warrant related to the Trump campaign, which was distorted as it passed through conservative media. According to the New York Times, Trump also appeared to be confused about certain presidential powers: Trump settled for having the House and Senate intelligence committees add his wiretapping claim to their ongoing investigation of Russias election meddling. The chairmen of those committees, who are both Trump allies, said they have yet to see any evidence to back up the presidents accusation. Regardless of their findings, it seems this may be the end of the Obama-Trump bromance. While 44 and 45 chatted on the phone several times during the transition, according to the Journal, Obama couldnt find time to talk while he was relaxing in the Virgin Islands: Its like Obama completely lost interest in their relationship once he wasnt required to be civil to Trump for the good of the nation."}, {"date": "2017/03/07", "title": "Dakota Access Pipeline Could Open As Early As Next Week", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/dakota-access-pipeline-could-open-as-early-as-next-week.html", "text": " A federal judge denied another attempt by the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes to temporarily block the construction of the last section of the Dakota Access Pipeline. It clears the way for its completion, and as the Associated Press reports, the pipeline could go online and start moving oil as early as next week. Opponents had claimed that the last stretch of pipeline  to be laid under Lake Oahe, off the Missouri river in North Dakota  would violate the tribes ability to freely practice their religion, which relied on clean water from the sacred Oahe. This was a slightly new legal approach; previously, the tribes had argued that the pipeline would cross sacred tribal lands and threaten their clean water supply, both violations of treaty rights. The Standing Rock Sioux also filed a challenge to review the governments decision-making process, especially for giving the go-ahead to the project without completing a full environmental impact review. (The Obama administration halted the DAPL project so the Army Corps of Engineers could conduct that study; it was nixed with an easement in February. Officials and Energy Transfer Partners, which operates the pipeline, have defended its initial review process.) The actual legal question of whether the DAPL violates the religious liberty wasnt ruled on by the judge  and the same goes with some of the other legal challenges. That ruling will likely come in April, and the other cases are still unresolved and could wind through the courts. But whats key, for now, is that the pipeline construction wont be halted, and hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil could start moving before these issues are finally settled. This latest decision comes almost two weeks after police ousted the last stragglers at the protest site near Standing Rock in North Dakota, and about a month after the Army Corps of Engineers issued an easement to permit construction, following President Donald Trumps executive order calling for the completion of DAPL and the Keystone XL pipeline. And yet this week Dakota Access Pipeline protesters are gathering in Washington, D.C., to continue the fight. Teepees were popping up on the National Mall Tuesday: The activists are planning a four-day protest, where they will also lobby lawmakers on indigenous rights more broadly. Organizers got a permit for a ceremonial bonfire on the National Mall, and will march Friday from the Army Corps of Engineers office to the White House."}, {"date": "2017/03/07", "title": "Trump Says Everybody Hes Seen Supports the GOPs New Health-Care Bill", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/trump-everybody-supports-the-gops-new-health-care-bill.html", "text": " President Trump has, to this point, taken a hands-off approach to Obamacare repeal. The White House did not release its own health-care plan, opting instead to merely supervise the House GOPs drafting process. And while Trump has used his bully pulpit (and/or Twitter account) to denounce critics of his immigration policies and military judgments, hes declined to browbeat the House Freedom Caucus for opposing any version of Obamacare repeal that could actually survive the Senate.When the president has spoken about health-care reform, hes often sputtered platitudes about the need for a more universal and affordable health-care system, which his party has no interest in creating. On Tuesday afternoon, Trump sputtered such sweet nothings once again. But this time, he did so while singing the praises of Paul Ryans American Health Care Act. I think were going to have a tremendous success, the president said at the White House, during a meeting with his House deputy whip team. Its a complicated process, but actually its very simple. Its called good health care. So, were going to do something thats great and Im proud to support the replacement plan released by the House of Representatives and encouraged by members of both parties, Trump continued. Its a great bill, were going to have tremendous  I really believe were going to have tremendous support  Im already seeing the support not only in this room, Im seeing it from everybody. Apparently, everybody does not include a large swath of the House GOP; at least seven Republican senators; a bevy of conservative interest groups; multiple medical lobbies; Republican health-care wonks; and most right-wing media outlets. Trump then described this imaginary popular bill, saying it will lower costs, expand choices, increase competition, and ensure health-care access for all Americans. This will be a plan where you can choose your doctor. This will be a plan where you can choose your plan, Trump said, apparently ad-libbing. And you know what the plan is  this is the plan. Nothing in the AHCA would guarantee any individual Americans ability to choose their own doctor or health-care plan. The initial response to the AHCA has led many observers to conclude that Obamacare repeal is on its way to a speedy death. Paul Ryans alternative to Obamacare appears to be too liberal for House conservatives  and too conservative for Senate moderates. At this point, the best thing for the party may be to let this health-care experiment die and get back to what theyre good at  cutting taxes for rich people. From one angle, Trump should be fine with that: There is no reason to think the president has any sincere convictions about health-care policy. But then, he is deeply committed to being perceived as a winner who fulfills his promises. And as a candidate, Trump made few promises more vigorously  or repeatedly  than his vow to repeal Obamacare. So the next couple weeks should be interesting. Trump could either disassociate himself from Paul Ryans bill, and just start braying about tax cuts (and/or Obama trying to poison his food). Or he could lash out against Obamacare repeals enemies in rabid defense of his wounded ego. Regardless, as of now, it looks like hes going to need some kind of narrative to explain how his failure to pass Obamacare repeal was actually a success.

But the president also believes that building a border wall is so important, we must be willing to radically reduce funding to the Coast Guard, TSA, and FEMAs terrorism-response program to finance one  or so new budget documents seem to suggest. Per Politico: Heres what the Trump administration hopes to buy with those savings: New detention beds and transportation costs for deporting the undocumented: $1.9 billion. Border-wall funds: $1.4 billion. New border-surveillance technology: $920 million. High-priority replacement fence projects: $560 million. 1,000 new ICE agents: $185 million. 500 new CBP agents: $100 million. Striking fear into the hearts of Americas most vulnerable workers and all who love them: Priceless (apparently). In other words: To make America safe again, were going to make steep cuts to the agency tasked with emergency response; weaken airport screenings; slash $1.3 billion from the Coast Guards budget  and spend the savings on the deportation of day laborers; the construction of new fences in the desert; and new toys and members for Americas most fervently pro-Trump unions. As national-security experts who spoke with Politico note, this plan has a major logistical problem: If you build up security on the land border, more migrants and contraband are going to be redirected toward the maritime border  where a depleted Coast Guard will have less capacity to intercept them. (In 2016, the Coast Guard intercepted 6,346, 201 metric tons of cocaine and 52,613 pounds of marijuana.) Still, the budget proposal has one great virtue  it clarifies the Trump administrations priorities. The president sold his travel ban on the argument that America must be willing to restrict immigration for the sake of preventing terrorism. This argument never made much sense, given the paucity of evidence that the ban would prevent terrorism  and the many reasons to suspect it might actually spur radicalization and anti-American sentiment. But Trumps new budget document suggests a more coherent rationale for that infamous executive order: We must be willing to accept a higher risk of terrorism, for the sake of restricting (non-white) immigration."}, {"date": "2017/03/07", "title": "Why Is McConnell Rushing Through a Trumpcare Bill Everybody Hates?", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/why-is-mcconnell-rushing-through-a-bill-everybody-hates.html", "text": " Following the unveiling of the House Republican plan to shrink Obamacare dramatically, two surprising things happened. The first is that the conservative-movement apparatus has lined up rapidly against the bill. The major right-wing pressure groups  FreedomWorks, the Club for Growth, Americans for Prosperity, and Heritage Action for America  all announced opposition, and were quickly echoed by the most right-wing members of Congress, like House Freedom Caucus chair Jim Jordan and Senator Rand Paul. The second surprising thing is that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced his intention to jam the House bill through the Senate quickly. Rather than develop its own bills through committees and the normal debate process, McConnell declared he plans to bring it directly to the Senate floor. Neither of these decisions makes a great deal of sense on their own, and they make even less sense in conjunction with each other. The grounds for the rights opposition is that the House bill would replace Obamacare with a new entitlement, albeit one funded almost entirely through cuts to an old entitlement (Medicaid) and which would provide such meager benefits as to be useless to large numbers of its purported beneficiaries. What makes this revolt so confounding to the party leadership is that the House bill, while too liberal for the partys right flank, is also almost certainly too conservative to pass the Senate. Senators Lisa Murkowski, Cory Gardner, Rob Portman, and Shelly Moore Capito signed a letter yesterday opposing the bills repeal of the Medicaid expansion. A fifth, Dean Heller, has raised concerns about protecting Medicaid. Susan Collins and Bill Cassidy have proposed a much more moderate replacement bill, which has also been co-sponsored by Capito and Johnny Isakson. Additionally, Lamar Alexander, Jeff Flake, and Lindsey Graham have urged caution and deliberation  all of which run counter to the leaderships strategy of ramming a bill through as quickly as possible in order to enable the passage of a big tax cut later in the year. That makes 11 Republican senators who have, in some form or fashion, expressed reservations about the party leaderships preferred health care strategy. Even assuming the three senators who object to the law from the right  Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Mike Lee  can be corralled, Trumpcare seems to be very far from corralling the necessary 50 Senate votes. And this is before the Congressional Budget Office produces its score, which will probably show millions and millions of people losing coverage, and may possibly also show the deficit blowing up. While McConnells plan might be necessary in order to keep the partys legislative strategy on track, it is highly and even delusionally optimistic, given the state of his vote count. It also runs counter to the Senates institutional culture. Senators cherish their power to shape and control legislation. A strategy of photocopying the House bill and ramming it through seems almost designed to violate the Senatorial ego. This raises a question: Is it designed to violate the Senatorial ego? And thus to fail? Neither the conservative revolt nor McConnells plan make a lot of sense if you view them as strategies designed to yield the most right-wing health-care policy that is attainable. They do make sense as a strategy designed to insulate Republicans from failure. Republicans have made two promises that cant be reconciled. They promised to repeal Obamacare, and to replace it with a terrific law that would take care of everybody. As the House Republican ad put it, they promised, more choices and better care, at lower costs.  peace of mind to people with preexisting conditions  without disrupting existing coverage. Those things cannot be reconciled. If Republicans repeal Obamacare, they will put in place something that not only fails to provide the better, cheaper care they have promised the country, but does not meet even the minimal threshold of access to basic care for people who currently receive it. From that standpoint, the winning play for the GOP might be to try to repeal and replace Obamacare but fail. If they are seen trying and failing to repeal the law, it might upset the base, but most Republican lawmakers will have their opposition to Obamacare on the record. And if it is to fail, it should fail quickly, so they can move on to cutting taxes. This may all be wrong. It is never safe to assume rational thought on the part of public actors, especially in the reality-distortion field of Trumps Washington. Maybe ultra-conservatives think they are using their leverage to push the bill to the right. Or maybe McConnell believes he can whip his caucus into line. Whatever the explanation, the strategy behind the bill is almost as incompetent as the bill itself."}, {"date": "2017/03/07", "title": "Trump Picks Interesting Spot to Surprise First White House Tour Group", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/trump-picks-interesting-spot-to-surprise-white-house-tour.html", "text": " The White House finally welcomed tour groups again Tuesday after an uncharacteristically long hiatus dating back to Inauguration Day.

This release, called Year Zero, is the first of multiple planned document releases. Among its contents are details of the CIAs knowledge and exploits of zero day vulnerabilities, weaknesses that are unknown to the technology provider, and therefore ripe for abuse. Among the software targeted were both major mobile operating systems, iOS and Android, and desktop-software Windows and macOS. By compromising phone hardware, the CIA was apparently able to bypass encryption on protected messaging apps, such as Signal and WhatsApp. (To be clear, there is virtually nothing Signal or WhatsApp can do themselves to guard against this vector of attack. If the devices are compromised, so is everything on it.) Also compromised, according to the documents, were Samsung smart TVs. Using software code-named Weeping Angel, the CIA was able to turn the TVs into covert recording devices. The Internet of Things, which is already notoriously insecure, has already been compromised by U.S. intelligence. But wait! Theres more! According to the records, the CIA has been hoarding zero-day vulnerabilities, rather than disclosing them to tech companies so that they can be patched. This is not particularly surprising  you can assume every intelligence agency does it. But thats the thing: every agency, which means if the CIA knew about these exploits, you can bet other foreign and domestic actors did as well. WikiLeaks claims that the exploits and documents have been circulating for a while now. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive, they write.

By the first week of March, the president was already consumed by rage; his staff, by bitter divisions. Relations between the White House and the federal bureaucracy were already soured by mutual distrust; and the administrations messaging, especially on foreign policy, had become riddled with contradictions. This is what the Trump presidency looks like when the economy is (relatively) strong, and there is no major foreign or domestic crisis demanding immediate executive action. Soon, well get to see what the Trump presidency looks like when one of the most vexing problems in American foreign policy reaches its boiling point. An authoritarian rogue state with nuclear weapons  and the support of the worlds second-greatest power  has been making progress toward an intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach the coast of California. And this week, it practiced firing barrages of missiles at Americas military bases in Japan. Ideally, this is where China would step in, and use its considerable economic clout to discipline its wild-eyed buddies in Pyongyang. But instead of sanctioning North Korea for such acts of aggression, Beijing is sanctioning South Korea for taking steps to protect itself against incoming missiles. Before we get to that, though, lets review the details of North Koreas latest display of bravado. Per the Washington Post: If the United States or South Korea fires even a single flame inside North Korean territory, we will demolish the origin of the invasion and provocation with a nuclear tipped missile, North Korean state media declared. Pyongang (probably) cant put its nuclear-tipped warhead where its mouth is: While the nation has conducted multiple nuclear tests, it has not demonstrated an ability to attach a nuclear warhead to a missile, nor to deliver a missile to a target. And the missiles that North Korea showed off on Monday werent anything new  theyve tested this same model of weapon before. Whats new is the pace at which the North Koreans fired them. They want to know if they can get these missiles out into the field rapidly and deploy them all at once, Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute, told the Post. They are practicing launching a nuclear-armed missile and hitting targets in Japan as if this was a real war. The United States responded by deploying the advanced antimissile battery system  Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)  to South Korea on Monday. However, its not clear that THAAD would be capable of intercepting four missiles at once. Meanwhile, China warned that South Korea would face consequences for deploying the anti-missile system, which it regards as a threat to its military (and an unwelcome act of American meddling in East Asian affairs). Its unclear exactly what those consequences will be. But China has already sanctioned the South Korean conglomerate that helped Seoul secure land for THAAD, while restricting Chinese tourism to South Korea. And soon, China may not be Kim Jong-uns only friend in the region, as B.R. Meyers explained in a recent interview with Slate: This is a geopolitical crisis that has no easy answer  and weve entrusted Donald Trump with finding the right one."}, {"date": "2017/03/07", "title": "Cash-strapped New York City Public Housing Authority Faces Cut in Federal Funds", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/nycha-faces-at-least-usd35-million-in-cuts.html", "text": " Ben Carson was sworn in as secretary of Housing and Urban Development Monday, delivering a rambling speech that, among other things, celebrated the can-do spirit.

The cuts reportedly came down before Carson took control of HUD, but this bleeding out of funds may only be the beginning. NYCHA officials told the Journal that, based on talks with HUD officials, its federal monies could be slashed to the tune of $150 million, an amount that threatens further the already cash-strapped and crumbling public-housing system. NYCHA faces approximately $17 billion in unmet capital needs to repair the sprawling systems buildings, from leaky roofs to broken elevators.

That inability has been clear to the partys outside critics for many years. Republicans have fervently denied this, and probably believed their own denials. As a result they locked themselves into a course of action that forced them to propose a bill on a deadline. They seem to have realized the impossibility of the task midway through, but, unable to retreat on their commitment, they instead rushed out a plan that is shambolic and cruel. The best indication of the quality of the plan is that it has drawn almost universal scorn from the health-care-policy community. Its predictable that experts on the left would dislike Trumpcare. But the right seems barely any more favorable. Conservatives like Peter Suderman, Philip Klein, Bob Laszewski, and Avik Roy, who have spent years savaging Obamacare, are united in their disdain for its replacement. The artificial role of the House GOPs self-created deadline played a crucial role in the development of Trumpcare. After the surprising election handed them full control of government, Republicans quickly decided to capitalize on power with a pair of lightning-strike budget assaults. First, they would repeal Obamacare while delaying any consideration of its alternative, perhaps for several years. Having eliminated Obamas health-care law  and, especially, the taxes on the affluent that helped finance it  the baseline of expected revenue would be lower. This would enable Republicans to then pass another huge tax cut later in the summer, which they could construct in a way to appear not to lose any revenue (and thus, because of arcane but important budgetary rules, be permanent). After passing their tax cut, they could leisurely set out to design a new plan to replace Obamacare. When Republicans quickly discovered repealing Obamacare without a replacement was wildly unpopular  polling under 20 percent  they had to change strategies. The new approach would force them to pass a repeal-and-replace all at once, so Republicans in Congress could reassure voters they had something in place after taking away Obamacare. But now they had a vastly more complicated task. They had to do something very hard on a schedule that was designed to do something relatively easy. Republicans believe they need both chambers of Congress to pass a repeal and replacement of Obamacare by Easter, in order to keep the legislative schedule on track to allow for the passage of the tax cuts they crave. Republicans apparently believed they could grab one of the many conservative plans that have floated around Washington, or perhaps patch a few of them together. They quickly encountered an insurmountable obstacle. The main challenge in drafting any health-care plan is financing it. If you want to finance health-care access to people who cant afford it, then other people have to pay for it. This is always a challenge in politics, since Americans dont like paying for other people to get things, but its a special challenge for a party that has elevated opposition to new taxes to the status of theological precept. There seemed to be one way out of the trap. Conservative health-care wonks wanted to eliminate or cap the tax deduction for employer-sponsored health insurance. This would be a mechanism that could pass philosophical muster among the keepers of the Reaganite flame, while potentially raising the hundreds of billions of dollars needed to finance coverage in any Republican plan. But, as the conservative analyst Christopher Jacobs explained yesterday, when Republicans modeled out the effects of capping the tax deduction, it turned out to have a deadly result. Reducing the tax incentive for employer-sponsored insurance, they found, would cause businesses to dump more people out of their employer-sponsored insurance. Not only would this be a political catastrophe  millions and millions of Americans who were covered through their work and considered themselves safe would suddenly be tossed off their plans  it was a fiscal disaster as well. These newly uninsured people would now be eligible for the tax credits Republicans were trying to provide for the people already getting insurance through Obamacare. Jacobs likened the problem to quicksand. The more they thrashed to get out of the quicksand  by increasing the subsidies or adjusting the cap on the employer exclusion, or both  the deeper they sank, he reported, by increasing the erosion of employer-sponsored insurance. Republicans responded to this trap by giving up on their plan to cap the tax break for employer-sponsored insurance. That rescued them from their quicksand trap. But it also left them without their favorite financing mechanism. Now they had to find a way to pay for tax credits for the people they were throwing off Obamacares markets. How to do that? This is where they landed, by financing Trumpcare with the one source of fiscal savings Republicans inevitably fall back upon when their fiscal plans dont add up: poor people. Trumpcare now finances the tax credits for the uninsured primarily by cutting Medicaid. We dont yet know whether this will add up. The Congressional Budget Office will score the bill only after it has started to move through committees in the House. If it does, it means that the Republicans will have done an astonishing thing, by financing the cost of replacing Obamacare entirely out of the budget that already financed health care for the desperately poor and sick. And so the Republicans are left with an utterly inadequate financing source for their plan. Because of the ideological construction of their party, they have no plausible way to find more money. Indeed, the main threat to its passage through the House is that the most conservative wing of the GOP caucus considers the plan too generous. The House Freedom Caucus is threatening to oppose any bill that gives coverage subsidies to people with moderate incomes, however meager those subsidies may be. There are other massive problems as well. Obamacare concentrates its benefits on people with the most modest incomes. Republicans would spread them much higher up the income ladder. Obamacare ties its subsidy levels to the cost of health insurance in a market. Trumpcare does not. As a result, people in high-cost areas  like rural markets  would have their subsidy cut in half or more. When you combine all these problems  a smaller overall pool of money for subsidies, and targeting the subsidies less efficiently  you have a recipe for massive harm. The Kaiser Family Foundation calculates the changes to customers in two sample markets: Reno, which is a cheap market, and Mobile, which is expensive. A 60-year-old in Mobile who earns $20,000 a year currently qualifies for a tax credit of $13,235 to buy insurance. Under Trumpcare, that tax credit would be reduced to $4,000 a year. On the other hand, people who earn $75,000 a year, who currently get nothing to help them buy insurance, would get a $4,000 credit from the Republican plan. That is not the end of the problems with Trumpcare. Republicans have committed to eliminating the individual mandate to purchase insurance, which is an important component to making the law work. (If insurers cant deny coverage to people who are sick, there needs to be an incentive to prevent people from going uninsured until they get sick and need coverage.) Keep in mind that Republicans used to consider an individual mandate uncontroversial. Conservative health care plans in the 1990s included one, and Mitt Romney encountered almost no opposition when he defended the idea during his 2008 campaign. But after Obamacare created an individual mandate, Republicans came to fixate on this provision as the plans most sinister provision. In part they did this because the mandate was the only portion of the plan that they could mount a halfway plausible legal case against. Conservatives went to court to eliminate the mandate and narrowly lost, in 2012. So, because Republicans have spent years dismissing it as tyranny, Trumpcare has to eliminate the individual mandate. They came up with a different kind of penalty for going uninsured. If you go two months without coverage, then insurers are allowed to charge you 30 percent if you want to buy back into the system. Republicans may think this is a clever way to penalize people for going uninsured. It is likely to fail to accomplish its purpose, or even to backfire. People lose their coverage all the time. If youre facing a 30 percent rate hike to get back on insurance, then your incentive changes: Now you want to wait until you really need insurance to pay those hefty premiums. In other words, rather than giving healthy people a reason to stay in the insurance pool, this gives them a reason to stay out. In the absence of a CBO analysis, we can only guess at the effects of this bill. But the inadequacy of the subsidies, the deep cuts to Medicaid in future, and the horrible design of the insurance requirement all suggest a bill that would fail utterly to replace Obamacare. The affordability problems that hamper some markets now would explode into full-blown crises. Many markets would probably enter actuarial death spirals (which, contrary to the insistence of Republican officials, are not happening now). The national health-care debate began in 2009. Republicans have had eight years since then to draw up and unify around a plan of their own. They have spent this time insisting they could do so easily. For most of the year, in fact, House Republicans have been running a television ad assuring the public they already have a plan with wonderful features: Health insurance that provides more choices and better care, at lower costs. Provides peace of mind to people with preexisting conditions  without disrupting existing coverage. Eventually they had told the lie so long it became impossible for them to abandon it. And so Republicans have found themselves frantically scrawling out a hopelessly inadequate solution in order to meet a self-imposed deadline driven by their overarching desire to cut taxes for the rich. Expanding subsidies for high earners, and cutting health coverage off from the working poor: it sounds like a left-wing caricature of mustache-twirling, top-hatted Republican fat cats, writes the Republican health-care adviser Avik Roy. The caricature is true."}, {"date": "2017/03/07", "title": "Chaffetz: GOP Bill Will Let Americans Choose Between Health Care and iPhones", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/gop-plan-lets-you-choose-between-healthcare-and-iphone.html", "text": " The House GOPs Obamacare replacement asks the American people to make some pretty unpopular trade-offs: The bill would essentially finance a large tax cut on the rich by cutting health benefits for the poor and working class. It would also reduce health-care subsidies for working families  while giving insurance companies a tax break to incentivize higher CEO pay. At first glance, this might seem like it presents a messaging problem for the Republican Party. After all, the GOPs argument against Obamacare has never been that it unfairly limits the compensation of insurance executives, while redistributing too much income from the very wealthiest to the poor. Rather, their argument was that Obamacare left too many uninsured, while producing unaffordable deductibles and premiums  all problems that their own bill would (almost certainly) make worse. But Paul Ryan need not fear: Utah congressman Jason Chaffetz has found the perfect message to push the American Health Care Act across the finish line: This bill provides Americans with access to choice  specifically, the choice between buying a new smartphone and paying their medical bills. In an interview with CNNs New Day, Chaffetz explained that the GOPs new bill would guarantee access to health insurance for all Americans. Of course, all Americans enjoy access to their nearest Mercedes-Benz dealership  but few can afford to buy their wares. After this was pointed out to the congressman, he replied, You know what, Americans have choices  So maybe, rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love  and they want to go spend hundreds of dollars on  maybe they invest it in their own health care. Theyve gotta make those decisions themselves. This is a winning message: If theres one thing Americans resent about Obamacare, its that the law made it too easy to afford both health care and an iPhone. Low-income Americans want to live less materialistic lives, but lack the self-control to do so. Now, they will finally be forced to enjoy the austerity theyve always dreamed of. Granted, Barack Obama once deployed a similar message about the need for Americans to prioritize health care above consumer spending  and that wasnt enough to make his signature law popular (at least, not while he was in office). But the problem with Obamas statement is that it wasnt paired with action. Sure, he suggested Americans make hard choices on household spending  but he didnt force them to do so, by cutting the subsidies that they had been depending on. Chaffetzs message, by contrast, reflects the spirit of his bill. And its concise enough to fit onto a bumper sticker: If you love your iPhone, you cant keep it."}, {"date": "2017/03/07", "title": "Trump Wants Everyone to Think Obamas Guantnamo Policy Was a Dangerous Disaster", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/the-trump-administration-is-pushing-a-false-guantanamo-claim.html", "text": " Some of Donald Trumps irresponsible statements are difficult to debunk. For instance, its hard to prove that Obama didnt wiretap Trumps conversations at Trump Tower, even if theres no affirmative evidence he did. Others, on the other hand, are very easy to knock down, like this tweet from this morning: Trump is right that 122 Gitmo prisoners have reengaged, as the government puts it. But a look at the governments own statistics shows that the vast majority of those who did were released by the George W. Bush administration: Its not a small difference: Fewer than 10 percent of the confirmed reengagers were released under Obama, who, as the bottom of the chart indicates, signed an executive order beefing up the vetting process (that same document ordered Gitmo to be shuttered within a year, which obviously didnt happen). Obamas new vetting process seems have worked  17.6 percent of Guantanamo prisoners released by Bush are confirmed to have returned to militant activity, while under Obama that number fell below 6 percent. Trumps misleading statement about Obamas Gitmo record is part of a pattern in the new administration  in late February, Sebastian Gorka, one of Trumps top counterterrorism advisers, made a similar claim on Fox & Friends. We know theres at least 30 if not more than 40 percent recidivism rate from the people released at Gitmo, Gorka said. President Obama released lots and lots of people that were there for very good reason, and what happened? Almost half the time they returned to the battlefield. And back during the campaign, Trump famously contrasted Obamas shut-it-down promise with his own stance: We are keeping [Guantnamo] open  and were gonna load it up with some bad dudes, believe me, were gonna load it up. It isnt yet clear exactly how Trump is going to fill Guantnamo Bay with bad dudes. But what is clear is the story hes trying to tell: Obama had a weak, feckless Guantnamo Bay policy that has put us at risk by releasing scads of dangerous people into the world, and Trump is going to fix Obamas errors on this front by toughening things up. But the numbers dont back up that claim, no matter how many times its repeated."}, {"date": "2017/03/07", "title": "What We Know About the Investigations Into Trumps Russia Scandal", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/what-we-know-about-the-probes-into-trumps-russia-scandal.html", "text": " In December, President Obama ordered a review of Russias alleged effort to hack the U.S. election. A month later, the FBI, CIA, and NSA said they had concluded with high confidence that Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election  with the goal of helping Donald Trump. Months later, we still dont have many answers about Russias operation, or regarding the explosive allegations about the Trump campaign. Thats not due to lack of trying; U.S. intelligence agencies have reportedly been investigating for more than a year, and at least four congressional committees have discussed conducting their own probes. But each step of the process has been complicated by leaks and political accusations  and to make matters worse, the president keep blasting out dubious allegations on Twitter. Heres what we know about the efforts to get to the bottom of Russias efforts to influence the U.S. election  and why many say they arent going far enough. The FBI doesnt usually comment on the existence or nonexistence of investigations (though weve seen some notable exceptions in the last year). Shortly before Trumps inauguration, FBI director James Comey angered senators by refusing to comment on whether the bureau was investigating Trumps ties to Russia, or even on his criteria for acknowledging an investigation. Thanks to a number of leaks, however, we have an idea of what the Russia probe entails. According to McClatchy, last spring the FBI, CIA, Justice Department, NSA, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and Treasury Department began investigating Russian attempts to influence the election, and the possibility that Kremlin money had secretly made its way to the Trump campaign. The BBC reported that this coordinated investigation, which is being led by the FBI, was launched after the director of the CIA saw a recording about Russias attempt to influence the U.S. election: The current scope and status of the investigations are unclear. In February, Reuters reported that the FBI was pursuing at least three separate probes. The FBIs Pittsburgh office, which often handles cybersecurity investigations, is working to identify who was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committees computer systems. The San Francisco office is trying to identify Guccifer 2, the person or group who hacked Clinton campaign manager John Podestas emails. FBI counterintelligence agents in D.C. are looking into leads from informants and foreign communication intercepts, including financial transactions by Russians believed to have links to Trump associates. The New York Times reported in January that the counterintelligence agencies are looking at intercepted communications and financial transactions as part of its investigation into possible ties between Russian officials and Trump associates. The FBI was said to be examining former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, as well as former Trump advisers Carter Page and Roger Stone. Last month, the Times said phone records and calls intercepted by U.S. intelligence agencies show that Trump campaign officials and associates had repeated contact with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election. The Trump camp denies this. The most robust congressional investigation is taking place in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence  though, like all of the congressional probes, it relies on information collected by the intelligence community. The committee announced it would conduct an independent review after the intelligence agencies said in January that they believed Russia had tried to influence the election on behalf of Trump  though the senators stressed that they had no reason to doubt the findings. Chairman Richard Burr and ranking Democrat Mark Warner said this would include any intelligence regarding links between Russia and individuals associated with political campaigns. FBI director Comey briefed the committee behind closed doors on February 17. I have a high level of confidence that well get what we need, Senator Warner said after the meeting. The committee is still gathering information. Last month it sent letters to more than a dozen organizations, agencies, and officials, asking them to preserve records related to the investigation. White House staffers were ordered to comply. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said its highly likely that the committee will look at former national security adviser Michael Flynns discussions with the Russian ambassador, and Warner said he wants Flynn to testify. Initially Burr told reporters that the probe wouldnt look into the Trump campaign, but Politico reported that he backtracked after Democrats threatened to boycott the investigation. For a few weeks the committee appeared united, but in late February, reports emerged that the White House had asked Burr to help knock down stories about Trump associates communicating with Russians during the campaign. Burr was one of Trumps staunchest supporters in the Senate and served as a national security adviser to the campaign. Burr acknowledged that he talked with the White House, then disputed the Russia report in conversations with reporters. I felt I had something to share that didnt breach my responsibilities to the committee in an ongoing investigation, he said. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Burr had been put on notice, and Warner said he had grave concerns about the independence of the investigation. Democratic operatives told Politico that theyre pleased with the progress of the investigation so far, so theyre holding back on airing their issues with Burr. Theres yet more tension between the two representatives leading the corresponding investigation in the House. Intelligence chair Devin Nunes was an early Trump supporter and a member of his transition team. Like Burr, the White House asked Nunes to help knock down reports that there were repeated contacts between Trump officials and Russian operatives. As of right now, I dont have any evidence of any phone calls. It doesnt mean they dont exist  What Ive been told by many folks is that theres nothing there, Nunes told the Washington Post last week. Echoing the president, he said the real problem is the frequent leaks about the Russia investigation, not their content. Representative Adam Schiff, the committees top Democrat, said it was too early to rule out ties between Trump aides and Russian officials. We dont know whether there were U.S. persons involved, but it is our responsibility to find out, Schiff said on MSNBC. And I dont think anyone on the committee, or our chairs in the House or Senate, ought to be stating a conclusion or deeming it their responsibility to push back on unfavorable press stories. Last week, Nunes and Schiff said they had approved a six-page classified document laying out the scope of their investigation. It includes possible contacts between the Trump team and Moscow, as well as possible leaks of classified information from the intelligence community. But the two committee leaders have continued to clash. After President Trump accused President Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower, Nunes said the House Intelligence Committee would make inquiries into whether the government was conducting surveillance activities on any political partys campaign officials or surrogates. Schiff called Trumps claim as destructive as it was baseless. Another issue: The House Intelligence Committee is underfunded and understaffed, according to the Daily Beast. Schiff said he suggested to the Senate Intelligence Committee that they could work together, but they werent interested. I would have to imagine one of the concerns  and Im just speculating here  that the Senate may have is if they feel that their investigation is proceeding very much in a bipartisan fashion, and their concern may be that the House isnt, they may have concerns about combining the two, Schiff said. Committee chair Jason Chaffetz has been resistant to calls to investigate the Trump administration, and hes taken little action on the Russia matter. Following Flynns resignation, Chaffetz said the House Oversight Commitee wouldnt be looking into the issue because its working itself out. Instead, he and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte wrote a letter to the Justice Departments inspector general, demanding an investigation into whether officials mishandled classified information when they leaked about Flynns communications to the press. Chaffetz did eventually join a Democratic effort to look into whether Russian officials paid Flynn for his appearances in Moscow in 2015, which may have violated the Constitutionss Emoluments Clause. Chaffetz and Representative Elijah Cummings, the senior Democrat on the committee, sent a letter to the company that handled Flynns speaking engagements, requesting more information. The top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee Chuck Grassley and Dianne Feinstein, respectively  asked the Justice Department and the FBI to brief them on the circumstances of Flynns resignation, and to share transcripts of Flynns intercepted calls to the Russian ambassador. In February, Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse, who lead the panels Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, announced they were launching their own investigation into Russias election meddling. Our goal is simple  to the fullest extent possible we want to shine a light on Russian activities to undermine democracy, the senators said. Our efforts will be guided by the belief that we have an obligation to follow the facts wherever they may lead. Graham said this week that they would also look into Trumps wiretapping claims. It would be earth-shattering if the former administration illegally wiretapped a campaign, he said. If the FISA court issued a warrant that would be pretty stunning too, because theyd have to have probable cause, he said. The fact that Trump supporters helm the key congressional probes didnt inspire much confidence, even before it was revealed that they were commenting on the Russia scandal at the behest of the White House. Democrats and even some Republicans have called for a more rigorous investigation, either by a special congressional committee or a special prosecutor. However, while those options may be perceived as more independent, they do have their drawbacks. As the Washington Post notes, it can take years for a special congressional probe to complete its investigation. And, like with the House Select Committee on Benghazi, Republicans and Democrats may not be able to agree on their conclusions. Now that Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from the investigation, Senator Schumer is demanding that Deputy Attorney General nominee Rod Rosenstein commit to appointing a special prosecutor during his confirmation hearing this week. A recent CNN/ORC poll found that about two-thirds of Americans agree that a special prosecutor, not Congress, should oversee Trumps alleged ties to Russia. But Peter Zeidenberg, who served as an assistant special counsel in the prosecution of Scooter Libby, argued that, in this case, appointing a special prosecutor would likely be a mistake. That persons mission would be to determine if a crime was committed, not to make information public: When the allegations involve the undermining of U.S. institutions, theres only so much the government can do to restore public confidence."}, {"date": "2017/03/06", "title": "House Republicans Unveil Their Bill to Repeal and Replace Obamacare", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/house-republicans-unveil-their-obamacare-replacement.html", "text": " Paul Ryan has let the House GOPs Obamacare-replacement bill out of the basement. On Monday night, Republicans introduced the American Health Care Act  a bill that, if passed, would repeal and replace president Obamas signature achievement. Here are the bills key features:  The AHCA eliminates Obamacares controversial individual mandate. Instead of penalizing people for not having insurance, the AHCA encourages people to maintain continuous coverage by allowing insurers to increase their premiums by 30 percent if their coverage has lapsed. After a year, the premiums would go back to the standard rate.This might actually discourage healthy people from buying insurance, driving up costs for everyone. A healthy person who lets their insurance lapse for more than 63 days has two options: 1) Buy insurance on the individual market immediately, and start paying premiums plus a 30 percent surcharge, or 2) remain uninsured while looking for a job that provides insurance, and pay nothing. Buy insurance and start paying the 30 percent surcharge if you happen to get sick.  Obamacares income-based subsidies for people buying insurance through public exchanges would be replaced by tax credits tied to income and age. People under 30 would get a credit of $2,000 per year, gradually increasing to $4,000 for people over 60. To ensure that the credits arent available to wealthy Americans, they would drop off for individuals who make more than $75,000, or households that make more than $150,000. For every $1,000 earned over that mark, the credit would decrease by $100. While it appears that older and poorer Americans are getting more help, as Vox notes, under the GOP plan insurers would be allowed to charge the oldest Americans five times as much as the youngest Americans. (Now they can only charge three times as much.) Poorer Americans could also see a decrease in their subsidies, while higher-earners would benefit from the new system:  The Medicaid expansion would continue  until 2020, when enrollment would freeze, and states would be barred from adding new low-income people to the rolls. Medicaid would also adopt per capita funding limits  meaning states would get a set allotment from the federal government for each enrollee. Currently, the federal government pays all of their bills.  As of 2020, insurers would not be required to offer the essential health benefits package implemented under Obamacare. That means healthy people could buy cheaper, skimpier plans, but the cost of comprehensive plans would likely go up. The requirement that larger employers offer insurance to full-time employees would be axed.  Obamacares taxes would remain in place until 2018. Drafts of the bill would have required people with high-cost employer-sponsored health insurance to pay income and payroll taxes, but that was dropped after employers and some Republicans framed it as a tax hike.  Federal payments to Planned Parenthood through Medicaid and other government programs would be blocked for one year. People who receive tax credits to help pay for their premiums would not be allowed to buy plans to cover abortions.  Insurers still wont be able to discriminate against people with preexisting conditions, and children can stay on their parents plans until age 26. Paul Ryan declared that the new plan will deliver relief and peace of mind to the millions of Americans suffering under Obamacare. But so far, no one else seems particularly excited about the AHCA. Of course, Democrats were quick to criticize the plan, and they indicated that they have no intention of working with Republicans to pass it. Trumpcare doesnt replace the Affordable Care Act  it forces millions of Americans to pay more for less care, said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. But many Republican lawmakers attacked the bill for being insufficiently conservative. The House Freedom Caucus, which has about 40 members, voted last month to oppose any measure that falls short of the 2015 repeal bill. Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the caucus, said Monday evening that at first glance, we have concerns. Freedom Caucus member and former chairman Jim Jordan said he didnt see any significant changes from previous drafts. My guess is this bill looks a lot like the last one, and we didnt like the last one, Jordan said. Some Republicans may be challenging the legislation from the right, when their real issue is that they dont want hundreds of thousands of constituents to lose their health-care coverage. Four Senate Republicans  Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Cory Gardner of Colorado, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska  raised concerns that the Medicaid overhaul may hurt low-income Americans. We are concerned that any poorly implemented or poorly timed change in the current funding structure in Medicaid could result in a reduction in access to life-saving health-care services, they said. Even if Republicans try to pass the measure through the budget reconciliation process  which requires only a simple majority  they can only afford to lose 2 votes in the Senate and 22 in the House. While Republicans did not offer estimates of how much the plan will cost or how many people will lose their coverage, two House committees  Ways and Means, and Energy and Commerce  are set to take up the legislation on Wednesday. House Republicans hope that the full House will vote on the measure before a recess that begins April 7. The Senate timetable is unclear.

But at least one plaintiff, a former Trump University student from Florida named Sherri Simpson, is rejecting the terms of the agreement and wants to opt out of the settlement so she has the option to go ahead and sue the president. Her attorneys have asked federal Judge Gonzalo Curiel, whom Trump famously attacked on the campaign trail because of his Mexican heritage, to reject the entire deal if students cant drop out of the deal and pursue litigation individually. The request could delay the settlement, or, if granted, unravel the entire thing. President Trump said he settled to avoid the hassle of a trial as a president. Simpsons attorney is arguing that a letter sent to class-action participants in 2015 made it appear that individuals could later request to pull out of a settlement, but that wasnt the case once the agreement had been reached, reports the New York Times. This was absolutely unsatisfactory to her, Simpsons lawyer, Gary Friedman, told the New York Daily News. She wants to take him to trial. Any settlement with her would have to have an admission of liability for it to be acceptable. Shes very angry. Simpson took Trump University seminar in 2010, and then signed up for a $35,000 Gold Elite program with another classmate. She paid about $19,000 for that course, which promised access to mentors and the resources of the Trump Organization  all of which Simpson says she never received. Judge Curiel will hear her motion, but even if he denies it, Simpson could appeal his decision to another source of Trumps ire, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

But one line, in particular, stands out, in part because its only tangentially related to the travel ban itself. The order dictates that the secretary of the Department of Homeland security will regularly and publicly publish information regarding the number and types of acts of gender-based violence against women, including so-called honor killings, in the United States by foreign nationals. This is actually holdover language from the last executive order, but its still striking: How often does the government go out of its way to highlight a specific category of crime committed by a specific category of perpetrator? Its especially interesting when combined with Trumps VOICE program, also created by executive order, which is geared toward a similar sort of awareness raising pertaining to crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. On its face, honor killings, or crimes in which (usually) female family members are murdered by male ones for sullying a familys honor by, for example, having premarital sex, are a very sensible thing to be concerned about. In some parts of the world honor killings are a major problem  Pakistan is one example, as groups like Amnesty International have pointed out. And to a lesser extent, some Western countries, like the U.K. and Germany, have also dealt with honor killings, often committed by first-generation immigrants from parts of the world where the practice is more common. This isnt a fringe concern  it has garnered attention from mainstream outlets like the BBC and Der Spiegel. What makes the language of Trumps EO odd, though, is that in the U.S. theres effectively no evidence that honor killings are common at all, according to one of the only (if not the only) studies attempting to estimate how prevalent that crime is. Its a study that, despite having never been formally published anywhere, is cited fairly frequently, and its origin story is telling. Three or four years ago, Ric Curtis, a professor at the John Jay College College of Criminal Justice at the City University of New York, said he was approached by the AHA Foundation, which was founded by Ayaan Hirsi Ali and which bills itself as the leading organization working to end honor violence that shames, hurts or kills thousands of women and girls in the US each year, and puts millions more at risk. The foundation asked him to write a report about the prevalence of honor killings in the U.S. They were interested in law enforcement taking a more serious look as a crime that they should collect regular data on, Curtis said. Similar to how they do in Germany, for example, or England. They wanted that done here. The idea was that the report would provide fodder for that push. Because so little is known about honor killings in the U.S., Curtis and his team  a group of researchers from John Jay, as well as one from the University of Oxford  had to resort to generating a proxy estimate of their frequency. Basically, they combined statistics about the prevalence of honor killings in the U.K., Germany, and Holland with crime and demographic stats from the U.S. Out popped what Curtis acknowledged is a very rough estimate: 23 to 27 honor killings per year. There are a number of important assumptions embedded in that estimate, though. For one thing, the paper assumes, as the authors note, that the rate of honor killing in the US is comparable (or perhaps even higher) to rates found in other industrialized Western countries. But if, as many scholars think, Muslims face more challenges to full assimilation and integration in the EU than in the U.S., that assumption might be wrong. On the other hand, if Curtis and his team misjudged other variables, as he pointed out, it may be that they underestimated the prevalence of the crime. But taking the numbers at face value, 23 to 27 killings per year just isnt a lot in the grand scheme of American crime policy. Frankly, that number of honor killings nationwide doesnt justify making this a special thing, said Curtis. So I think they [the foundation] were  I wouldnt say disappointed in the numbers  but I think they were disappointed that it wasnt a big deal for law enforcement. In other words, The fact is that if theres only 25 honor killings a year nationwide, what agency is going to make this a separate category in their database when they will never have an entry to put in that slot? Curtis acknowledged that he and his team were forced into an approach that wasnt ideal. Its not terribly scientific, but I havent seen anyone else try to do any kind of credible evidence, he said. So its something  its a start, anyway. The problem that weve had up to this point is all weve had is anecdotal cases. But because theres so little data on this subject, the 23 to 27 estimate, despite its flaws, ended up casting a surprisingly long shadow. Soon the Curtis teams numbers found their way into into another report, this one commissioned by the Justice Department, that took a broader look at what is known about honor killings in the U.S. One line from that paper lays out the scope of the problem: Taking the Curtis teams estimate, the authors write that Expressed as a rate, honor killing occurs approximately 0.008 offenses per 100,000 persons compared with 4.7 for homicide, 27 for rape/sexual assault, and 113 for robbery in the United States. That is very low. (Some outlets falsely reported that the DoJ itself had come up with the 23 to 27 figure, lending the estimate a sense of rigorousness that doesnt quite match up with Curtiss assessment of his teams process as not very scientific, or with the fact that the paper was never peer-reviewed or published anywhere.) What all this suggests is that the Trump administration has no significant basis to think honor killings are a significant problem in the U.S. Of course, the genuine desire for better data is just one reason to highlight a certain category of crime. Another reason is to convince people that that crime is more common than it really is  if people hear about honor killings over and over, they will naturally come to the conclusion that they are a serious problem. Since Trumps cabinet is well-stocked with adherents of a rather fringe counter-jihad movement whose members are worried the U.S. is just one or two steps away from the widespread implementation of Sharia law, it makes sense that Trump and his aides would make a concerted effort to sound alarm bells about honor killings, regardless of how rare they really are. Its not for nothing that the L.A. Times recently quoted a senior White House official  likely Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller, or Sebastian Gorka  saying that without tighter controls on immigration, the U.S. could be facing the kind of large and permanent domestic terror threat that becomes multidimensional and multigenerational and becomes sort of a permanent feature. Trump and his counter-jihadists genuinely believe that Muslim migration poses a serious threat to the future of American values, and it is in their political interest to stoke this sentiment. So while homegrown radicalism, whether perpetrated by Christian or Muslims terrorists, is and always will be a problem in the U.S.  one which warrants informed, evidence-based policy responses  theres just no evidence to suggest that honor killings deserve this sort of spotlight. Not unless the real goal is to gin up fears of Muslims, migrants, or both."}, {"date": "2017/03/06", "title": "Ben Carson Makes HUD Employees Take the Niceness Pledge", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/ben-carson-makes-hud-employees-take-the-niceness-pledge.html", "text": " The new secretary of Housing and Urban Development is a retired neurosurgeon and self-help guru who boasts iconoclastic views on slavery and ancient Egypt  but has no experience in government or housing policy.

Carson supplemented this argument by praising the can-do spirit of the other immigrants who came here in the bottom of slave ships, worked even longer, even harder for less. Then, things got weird.

While Carson made multiple appeals to public-private partnerships and the harms of government dependency, he announced no specific funding cuts and honored the niceness pledge throughout his remarks. At the end of his remarks, one HUD staffer stood up and thanked Carson for his speech, saying that it had reassured her that he believes in the departments mission.

The charge originated on the left, from sources like the Nation and Glenn Greenwald, to the libertarian right, and finally migrated to Trump and his supporters. The president, they charge, is the victim of a smear campaign harkening back to the most notorious demagogue in American history. Just found out that Obama had my wires tapped in Trump Tower just before the victory, tweeted the president Saturday. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! Devin Nunes, the chairman of the committee tasked with investigating (or, alternatively, not investigating) the Russia scandal, has dismissed the issue in similar terms. I have to have some evidence that some American actually had contact with Russians, Nunes proclaimed last month, and I dont have that now. This is almost like McCarthyism revisited. That we do have evidence of Americans having actual contact with Russians  quite a lot of evidence about quite a lot of Americans in Trumps orbit  ought to be a clue that McCarthyism is not the most apt analogy. Indeed, it is a much closer description for the methods used by Trump himself. Since McCarthyism means different things to different people, a brief reminder of just what Wisconsin senator Joseph McCarthy did may be helpful. During and after World War II, conservative Republicans considered Franklin Roosevelts domestic and foreign policies socialistic and un-American. Conservative critics linked the two criticisms together: Roosevelt had enlarged the role of the federal government, and he and his successor, Harry Truman, had cooperated with the Soviets during and after the war. At times his coalition included some communist spies, a fact that gave enough surface plausibility for McCarthy to claim that the New Deal under Roosevelt and Truman was fundamentally a communist conspiracy. McCarthyism was a series of specific lies in service of the larger conceptual lie. The specific lies insisted that the federal government was honeycombed with Soviet spies who were colluding openly with the Democratic Party. The larger lie was an attempt to erase the distinction between communists and New Deal Democrats, whose points of contact were short-lived and minimal, and by the postwar era had grown deeply estranged as Harry Truman confronted the U.S.S.R. McCarthy and his allies, of course, viewed it just the other way around. To them, the partnership between the New Deal and communism was a larger truth, which justified McCarthys smaller lies. There are certainly some parallels between the charges made by McCarthy then and the charges made against Trump now. Both involve accusations of improper ties to Russia, and both rely on parsing evidence that is not wholly public. And it is also true that, if you search the internet, you can find some unfounded or even silly claims being made against Trump. This is a big country, after all. That said, the differences overwhelm the similarities. The differences begin with the factual basis. If McCarthy had limited his accusations to cases where he had some solid basis for suspicion  like Alger Hiss, a State Department employee who really was a Soviet spy  then McCarthyism would not be a word. To apply the term McCarthyism to any suspicion of hidden or inappropriate relations with a hostile foreign power is to dilute the term beyond any useful meaning. The case for concern about Trumps relationship with Russia does not rely on conspiracy thinking. There is an extensive public record. It is the parallels between McCarthy and Trump, rather than McCarthy and Trumps adversaries, that are most compelling. As some have noted, Trump was literally mentored by Roy Cohn, McCarthys right-hand man. Trump, like McCarthy, alleges the existence of a shadowy cabal of government bureaucrats to which he attributes near unlimited power. Representative Steve Kings plea for Trump to purge Leftists from executive branch before disloyal, illegal & treasonist acts sink us is indistinguishable from McCarthys plan. Had the phrase deep state been in general circulation 70 years ago, one can only imagine what McCarthy could have done with it. Trump, like McCarthy, uses reckless accusations to whip his supporters into a frenzy and disorient his foes. A White House official, speaking to Mike Allen, inadvertently let slip Trumps most McCarthyite quality: his indifference to truth. The president just has a great nose for these things, the official told Allen. Its the bureaucratic leaks  the deep state  that bother him most. Even if it turns out not to be true that they surveilled Trump Tower, he will have a very good point to make about the level of sabotage coming from Obama holdovers. The giveaway is even if it turns out not to be true. Trump didnt float this scenario as a possibility, he asserted it as fact. But like every conspiracy theory he has floated  from Obamas allegedly forged birth certificate to Rafael Cruzs alleged role in the Kennedy assassination  the facts of the case have no relevance to Trump. Another parallel is the relationship between the two demagogues and their party. Few conservatives wanted to defend McCarthy flat-out. He was too buffoonish and unpredictable. Yet they found him useful. He was raising important issues, changing the terms of the debate, rallying the kinds of people they wished to see engaged in public life, and above all, making the right enemies. The style of anti-anti-Trump polemic that has become fashionable on the right is precisely the tone that conservative intellectuals took toward McCarthy. Leading voices of the right like Irving Kristol and William F. Buckley defended McCarthy as a necessary evil who raised the vital anti-communist issue, exposed the failings of the Democratic Party, and, while he may have gone too far here and there, was the subject of hysterical overreaction by fussy liberal elites. Indeed, conservatives still occasionally trot out defenses of McCarthy. Steve Bannon did it in 2013. Trump and McCarthy both captured the passions of the conservative base in a way no other Republican politician of their time had managed. They channeled populist, anti-intellectual paranoia that frightened elites in both parties by threatening to tear apart the structures of republican government. The main way that the two men differ should not come as comfort: It is that McCarthy was a senator and an insurgent within his party, and Trump is the president who commands his."}, {"date": "2017/03/06", "title": "SCOTUS Defers to Trump on Transgender Student Rights", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/scotus-defers-to-trump-on-transgender-student-rights.html", "text": " In a simple one-sentence order today, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in favor of transgender Virginia student Gavin Grimm being able to access the bathroom that accorded with his gender identity.

The new ban, as expected, cures a lot of the problems that led to its suspension by the federal courts (most definitively by Judge James Robart, with an assist from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals). It explicitly does not apply to legal permanent residents, which the White House tried to exempt the day after the original order. It is limited in scope to future visa applications (or renewals), which helps avoid more chaos at airports, as does its more deliberate timetable for implementation (taking effect on March 16, not immediately). An indefinite ban on refugees from Syria now has an end date, one of a number of steps made to buttress the frayed national-security rationale for the ban. And perhaps most significantly from a legal standpoint, there is no longer a preference for Christian refugees, which removed one of the grounds for concluding this whole exercise is just a thinly veiled recasting of the clearly unconstitutional Muslim ban Trump originally promised on the campaign trail. The exclusion of immigrants from Iraq from the new travel ban focuses on a political, not legal, problem with the original ban: embarrassing incidents of Iraqis who risked their lives for the American military being kept from seeking refuge in the U.S., and blowback from the Iraqi government, which is heavily engaged in joint operations against ISIS. The new executive order generally supplies more language justifying various elements of the ban on national-security grounds, in part to counter the impression given by recent Department of Homeland Security reports that immigrants from the countries covered by the travel ban do not represent that distinctive or imminent a threat. So at first blush the revised policy looks likely to survive an initial wave of lawsuits seeking to prevent its implementation. It does, for example, revoke the old order, despite some concerns that the president would never concede his black-robed critics were right. But looking ahead, there is very little the administration can do to completely prevent judicial consideration of the many statements made by Trump and his surrogates during the campaign that a Muslim ban was their ultimate goal.

In May, the Obama administration issued guidelines designed to protect transgender students from discrimination; the guidelines said schools could lose federal funds if they didnt comply. The Virginia appeals courts initial ruling on the case dodged the question of whether Title IX protects transgender students by deferring to Obamas guidelines. But the Trump administration revoked those guidelines last month, saying the treatment of trans students is a states-rights issue. After the Trump administrations decision, both Grimms lawyers and lawyers for the school board asked the Supreme Court to go forward with the case, although the school board asked that hearings be delayed to give the Trump administration time to weigh in.

Breitbart): Barack Obama had tapped the phone lines of Trump Tower, shortly before last Novembers election. The president promptly drafted a carefully worded statement, informing the public of this extraordinary development. It quickly became apparent that Trumps claim derived from no special intelligence (quite the opposite, in fact). The president appears to have embellished on the details of a Breitbart article, which was based on a rant by conservative radio host Mark Levin, which itself embellished on reporting from the British press  reporting that American newspapers have failed to confirm. Heres the core of Breitbarts story: The Obama administration secured a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (FISA) court to monitor links between a computer server in Trump Tower and Russian banks. This turned up no evidence  but the administration left the wiretaps in, anyway. Then, they monitored Trumps presidential campaign, ostensibly to aid Clintons candidacy. After Trump won, Obama changed the rules governing information-sharing between intelligence agencies, thereby putting his ill-gotten intelligence into the hands of Democratic loyalists throughout the government. These loyalists then began leaking misleading bits of that intelligence to generate bad press for the Trump administration  and, thus, aid Obamas silent coup. Notably, Breitbarts account does not claim that Obama, personally, ordered the FISA warrant (requests that normally come from intelligence agencies). Nor does the site describe an illegal procedure  the administration ostensibly received judicial approval for everything it did. Which is to say: The administration amassed sufficient evidence to convince a FISA judge that there was reason to suspect illicit collaboration between Trumps associates and the Russian government. So, even in the right-wing fever swamps telling, this is rather different from Nixon/Watergate  tricky Dick did not get into trouble for successfully pursuing a FISA warrant to monitor the DNC. But the White House isnt going to let a lack of evidence ruin a perfectly good paranoid fantasy. On Sunday, Trump press secretary Sean Spicer suggested the presidents allegation was supported by reports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations. Asked to substantiate that claim, the White House provided the Post with five articles from outlets including The Guardian, the BBC, and the National Review. The Posts Glenn Kessler found these reports less than compelling: That last bit is not lost on the FBI. The bureaus director, James Comey, pushed for the Justice Department to publicly reject Trumps claim over the weekend, according to the New York Times and NBC News. But on Monday, the White House suggested that Trump trusts his own misreadings of Breitbart articles over the word of the FBI director. Asked if the president accepts Comeys denial of the alleged wiretaps, Sarah Huckabee Sanders told Good Morning America, No, I dont think he does, explaining that Trump wants the truth to come out to the American people and he is asking that it be done through the House Intelligence Committee and that that be the process that we go through. With Trumps most outlandish conspiracy theories, its often difficult to discern whether the president is selling snake oil or imbibing it. Initially, his tale about how the popular vote was stolen from him (by undocumented immigrants) read like a cynical attempt to give his Electoral College victory greater legitimacy. But subsequent reports revealed that he insisted on this baseless fantasy even in private conversations with friends and lawmakers. Similarly, reports following Trumps tweetstorm suggest that he genuinely believes Barack Obama tapped his phones. Per the Washington Post: Axioss Mike Allen corroborates this  and suggests that some in Trumps inner circle are actively encouraging the presidents delusion. Meanwhile, Trump has ordered his chief counsel, Donald F. McGahn, to secure access to the alleged FISA order that would vindicate Trumps story  a move that the Justice Department would view as a stunning case of interference, according to the New York Times. So, perhaps the president genuinely believes hes calling Comeys bluff. Then again, it may be a mistake to suggest that Trump is either genuinely deluded or cynically baiting the media into amplifying his desired narrative.

For eight years he has dominated his states politics, first as a successful bipartisan problem-solver with a knack for making his opponents look bad, and then a scandal-plagued punching bag and early lame duck. Until just over a year ago, his ambitions for higher office obscured his steadily declining status back home, aside from the Bridgegate scandal that dogged his presidential campaign. But then his close association with Donald Trump defined his national profile, and when Trump surprisingly won, it was widely assumed Christie was headed to Washington in some capacity. Now, after being passed over for the attorney general gig he supposedly craved, leading him to turn down less exalted posts, Christie looks likely to stick out the last year of his governorship. But he may have thoroughly worn out his welcome in New Jersey. His job approval ratio fell to an abysmal 17/78 in a Quinnipiac survey at the end of January. His own lieutenant governor and the most likely Republican to succeed him, Kim Guadagno, has been trying desperately to distance herself from her former mentor and political sponsor. Another competitive GOP candidate for governor, Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, hasnt had to do that because hes long fought Christie, and even called for his resignation for spending too much time outside the state. For his part, Christie seems to be taking a less abrasive approach as he fills out his term, backing off on a controversial education-funding proposal. But the key question is whether hes doomed Republicans to lose in November. They are already suffering from the handicap of being the party that controls the White House, occupied by a man who lost New Jersey in a 14-point landslide last November. Its been 32 years since the presidential party won a gubernatorial election in New Jersey. Perhaps unsurprisingly, some New Jersey Republicans are pining for a nonpolitician to run for governor this year. And they may get one in former Saturday Night Live comedian and current talk-show host Joe Piscopo, a former Democrat and more recently an independent, who nonetheless ran second to Guadagno in a poll of New Jersey Republicans. Piscopo was a Trump backer and is testing out a sort of conservative-populist platform: Unlike Guadagno and Ciattarelli, who will probably have to rely heavily on New Jerseys system of publicly financed matching funds for campaign contribution, Piscopo could probably raise a lot of money. That, too, is a big advantage since the likely Democratic nominee, former Goldman Sachs executive and Obama administration ambassador to Germany Phil Murphy, has money to burn. Hes already loaned his campaign 10 million smackers, and theres more where that came from. Murphy benefited from decisions by better-known Democratic pols to skip this race. But he could face a tenacious primary challenge from veteran assemblyman John Wisniewski, who played a central role in exposing the whole Bridgegate scandal. Of equal importance, perhaps, is the fact that Wisniewski was Bernie Sanderss New Jersey campaign manager last year. Hes right out of central casting to take on Murphy, whose Goldman Sachs background not only has unsavory national implications, but will also remind Garden State voters of the less-than-popular governor Jon Corzine, the former Goldman exec Christie beat in 2009. While a Murphy-Guadagno matchup remains the most likely scenario, a lot could happen between now and the June 6 primary, not to mention the November general election. For one thing, Christie could still wind up resigning for a Trump gig if the tempests surrounding his White House and cabinet continue to howl, giving Guadagno the dubious distinction of running as an incumbent. And state issues will also unpredictably pop up. One wild card is whether anti-incumbent sentiment could affect Democrats as well as Republicans since the donkey party has controlled both chambers of the state legislature continuously since 2001. All New Jersey legislators will face the voters this year, and while Republican gains are possible, Democrats currently control the lower house by a 52-28 margin and the upper house 24-16. All in all, New Jersey is more likely than Virginia to play into a narrative of the presidents party losing ground in off-year elections as a prophecy of things to come in the midterms. You can thank Donald Trump for that, not to mention his buddy Chris Christie."}, {"date": "2017/03/05", "title": "Trump Asks Congress to Investigate His Unsubstantiated Obama Wiretap Claims", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/trump-asks-congress-to-investigate-wiretap-conspiracy-theory.html", "text": " President Trump is asking Congress to investigate his own seemingly baseless allegation that President Obama ordered a wiretap on him in the run up to the 2016 election, despite the fact that the White House is refusing to provide any evidence that such a wiretap even happened. Press Secretary Sean Spicer, in a statement released Sunday morning, instead insisted that reports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations immediately ahead of the 2016 election are very troubling, though he, like Trump, did not cite any sources for that claim. Thus far, the only original reports making the wiretap allegation have been been a Breitbart, Infowars, and Sean Hannityamplified conspiracy theory put forward by a conservative radio host, and Trumps Saturday morning tweetstorm, which was likely referencing the same theory. Nonetheless, Spicer says that President Trump is requesting that as part of their investigation into Russian activity, the congressional intelligence committees exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016. He then says that neither the White House or the president will comment further until such oversight is conducted. President Obamas spokesperson has categorically denied the allegation that Obama ordered a wiretap on Trump, or any other American, during his presidency. The Obama administrations former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper Jr. further added on Meet the Press Sunday that, to his knowledge, there were no secret intelligence warrants regarding Trump or his campaign to begin with. News also broke on Sunday afternoon that FBI Director James Comey reportedly thinks Trumps claim is false and he has been trying to get the Department of Justice to publicly rebuke the president  though that effort appears to have failed. Newsmaxs Christopher Ruddy wrote on Sunday that he twice spoke with Trump about the wiretaps on Saturday, confirming that he hadnt seen [Trump] this pissed off in a long time. Continued Ruddy, When I mentioned Obama denials about the wiretaps, [Trump] shot back: This will be investigated, it will all come out. I will be proven right. House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes  who has said that requests to investigate the potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia are almost like McCarthyism revisited  responded in the affirmative to Trumps request on Sunday. The GOP congressman insisted in a statement that the U.S. governments response to possible Russian interference in the 2016 election was already one of the focus points of the committees investigation, and that they will make inquiries into whether the government was conducting surveillance activities on any political partys campaign officials or surrogates and will continue to investigate this issue if evidence warrants it. On the Sunday morning political-show circuit, White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders, appearing on ABCs This Week, also declined to provide details about what reports Spicer was referencing, instead misleadingly alluding to the same inconclusive stories that the original conspiracy theory was based on. Lets find out, lets have an investigation, Sanders proposed, further claiming that if [the Obama-ordered wiretap] happened, if this is accurate, it would be the greatest overreach and the greatest abuse of power that I think we have ever seen and a huge attack on democracy itself. Pressed by host Martha Raddatz to account for why Trump would say the wiretaps had happened when it now seems clear there is no definitive evidence to support that claim, Sanders unconvincingly explained that, I think hes going off of information that he has seen that had led him to believe that this is a very real potential[.] This additional exchange was particularly telling, as well: The lack of clarity from the White House is not surprising considering the reports that Trump aides were themselves surprised by Trumps allegations on Saturday. There was then radio silence from the White House for an entire day, though the New York Times and Washington Post report that, according to administration sources, White House counsel Donald McGahn is now trying to obtain evidence that FISA warrant had been issued to tap Trump, should that evidence even exist. However, that inquiry in itself might be an unprecedented act of White House interference in an ongoing Justice Department investigation. Pressed by the media and GOP lawmakers to back up Trumps very serious allegations against Obama, the White House has chosen simply to express alarm over the presidents report without making any credible attempt to explain it, while simultaneously continuing to suggest that President Obama ordered a Watergate-level illegal investigation, and then pass the buck to Congress to confirm whether or not that even happened. Lastly, for a good analysis of the scattered reports that underpin the Breitbart-boosted wiretap theory, read this Just Security post from the Cato Institutes Julian Sanchez. His conclusion is that both Breitbart and Trump have advanced claims far more dramatic than anything the public evidence can support, though, in his libertarian opinion, Congress might as well take a look just in case: Its also worth noting, however, that Trump might not ultimately like the outcome of the very investigation he is calling for. Thats because if hes right that FISA warrants were issued to investigate him or his campaign, that likely happened for a good, legally supported reason, and independent of any alleged Obama order. Wireds Brian Barrett, as part of his excellent explainer on the FISA process and how it might have come into play regarding the Trump-Russia investigation, cautions that Trumps wiretap claims carry presumably inadvertent implications: This post has been updated to include Rep.

According to leaks via unnamed White House officials to ABC News and others, Trump apparently feels that Sessionss sudden recusal was uncalled for and only encouraged the administrations enemies. A Politico source explained that Trump didnt like Sessionss recusal because it made it seem like the attorney general, and thus the Trump team, had done something wrong. A source also added that Trump is tired of everyone thinking his presidency is screwed up, and told his staff that he expects them to do a better job fighting back. One senior White House official summarized to ABC that, We should have had a good week. We should have had a good weekend. But once again, back to Russia. Following the Friday meeting, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Chief Strategist Steve Bannon canceled their plans to go with Trump to the presidents Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, though its not clear whose idea that was, and it appears that Bannon eventually left for Florida on Saturday afternoon anyway. Trumps senior advisor Jared Kushner; the presidents daughter, Ivanka; White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer; communications director Mike Dubke; and White House counsel Don McGahn were also in attendance on Friday. If the takeaway of the meeting was to fight back, Trump may have been trying a new tactic himself on Saturday when he claimed, in an evidence-free early-morning Twitter rant, that President Obama had ordered wiretaps of Trump Tower before the election. Obamas spokesperson has categorically denied Trumps new claim, which seems likely to have been based on a new right-wing conspiracy theory that White House staffers were circulating on Friday."}, {"date": "2017/03/03", "title": "Mothers and Children Would Be Ripped Apart Under Reported DHS Proposal", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/families-would-be-ripped-apart-under-reported-dhs-proposal.html", "text": " The Department of Homeland Security is considering a proposal that would separate mothers and children if they are caught illegally crossing the border into the United States, Reuters reports. The proposal would have mothers remain in custody while they wait for an asylum hearing or a date with an immigration judge, while their children would be put into protective custody with the Department of Health and Human Services. Under current policy, families awaiting a court date are generally released and allowed to live with relatives in the U.S. as they wait for their court date, which could take years to arrive. The point of the proposal, according to the officials who spoke to Reuters, is less about keeping undocumented women off the streets than punishing them for crossing the border with their children. The ultimate goal would be to deter families from illegally entering the U.S., the officials said. Implementing the proposal would present two obvious and immediate challenges. First, long-term detention of mothers who are now released would require space that may not exist and it would be expensive. More severely, the children who are stripped from those mothers would potentially suffer lifelong psychological trauma, Marielena Hincapi, of the National Immigration Law Center, told Reuters."}, {"date": "2017/03/03", "title": "Why the Alt-Center Is a Problem, Too", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/why-the-alt-center-is-a-problem-too.html", "text": " Not everyone on the left side of the American political spectrum shares the same policy vision and electoral strategy. Some believe Barack Obamas tenure was a model of progressive governance (save, perhaps, for the appointment of James Comey). Others see the ex-presidents neglect of the foreclosure crisis, expansion of the drone war, and crackdown on whistle-blowers as profound betrayals of the lefts core values. Some were thrilled to vote for the first female major-party nominee  and the historically progressive platform she campaigned on. Others morosely cast their ballots for a candidate whose past support for the Iraq War and welfare reform they couldnt forgive  and whose progressive policy commitments they couldnt believe. (And, a few maddeningly misguided devotees of the categorical imperative burned their ballots on the altar of Jill Stein). Some believe progressives must defend the Affordable Care Act unequivocally; others, that they must push for a single-payer system. Some feel little ambivalence about the prospect of the deep state sabotaging Trumps presidency; others fret about that precedent. Some believe Trumps Russia scandal is an excellent issue for the 2018 midterms; others feel that bread-and-butter issues will be more resonant. Some believe the party should unite its coalition around issues of identity; others favor an emphasis on class. Some believe that the (enlightened) interests of capital and working people are not irreconcilable; others say they are. Some are repulsed by a strategic alliance with Wall Street; others, by one with dissatisfied Trump supporters. The preceding litany is not meant to encompass every relevant position on the subjects it addresses. Nor is it intended to imply that there is a clean dichotomy on the left, such that everyone who favors single-payer healthcare was unenthusiastic about Hillary Clintons candidacy. (Personally, I sympathize with some on some things, and with others on others.) The point is, simply, that Donald Trumps enemies disagree about many things, including how to handle their disagreements: Some believe that the Trump presidency requires the left to put aside its divisions  and focus its fire on the reactionary regime that threatens all it holds dear. Others claim that the choice before us is Sandersism or barbarism. In my view, a strong case can be made for a popular front. But few are actually making it. Instead, some liberals who claim to favor unity are going out of their way to exaggerate the lefts divisions  and likening their socialist critics to neo-Nazis. Vanity Fairs James Wolcott is among them. The esteemed culture critics new column, Why the Alt-Left Is a Problem, Too, opens with the phrase, Internet clickbait promotes mental tooth decay  and proceeds to convincingly establish that its author has fallen prey to that very malady. Which is to say: Bad left-wing hot takes seem to have (temporarily, one hopes) rotted a great writers critical faculties. Here is the core of Wolcotts argument: The columnist proceeds to distort the reality of the internecine disputes on the lib-left, and thus, to foster factionalism. Wolcott defines the alt-left as left-wing writers and publications that share the alt-rights disillusionment with Obamas presidency, loathing of Hillary Clinton, disgust with identity politics, and  craving for a climactic reckoning that will clear the stage for a bold tomorrow. He then provides a rundown of the alt-lefts core membership: This list reveals two fundamental problems with Wolcotts conception of the alt-left: (1) It is capacious enough to include writers whose political views barely overlap. (2) Almost no one whom he identifies as alt-left fits his definition of that term. The notion that Mickey Kaus and Jacobin belong to the same faction of the left is an absurdity. The latter has published multiple columns describing open borders as a moral necessity. The former defected to the right years ago, after realizing that no policy was more central to enlightened progressivism than immigration restriction. Whats more, when Kaus was on the left, he was precisely the kind of moderate liberal that Jacobin contributors live to decry. More fundamentally, few, if any, of the outlets and writers Wolcott cites identify as accelerationists  which is to say, almost none of them crave a climactic reckoning that will clear the stage for a bold tomorrow. This is a major problem for his column, since he makes no argument for why it is both unjustified  and dangerous  to feel disillusioned by Obamas presidency, or to loathe Hillary Clinton. Nor does he offer a rebuttal to the left-wing critique of (class-blind) identity politics. Instead, he cites some of the dumbest things that Susan Sarandon and Jill Stein have said in their lives  and implies that these are the core beliefs of every leftist who has ever annoyed him on Twitter.You can tell that Donald Trumps victory serves the revolution is a marginal view on the American left by the fact that a couple quotes from the star of Dead Man Walking appear in virtually every column that argues the opposite. This isnt to say that there arent worthwhile critiques to be made of Jacobin, the Intercept, or their partisans on social media. Wolcott comes closer to landing a punch in noting some leftists odd use of the word McCarthyism to describe widespread alarm over the possibility that our last election was compromised by the intervention of a foreign, authoritarian regime. (Though Wolcotts implicit dismissal of leftists concerns about the possibility of this alarm giving way to a new Cold War is odd, given Jeanne Shaheens comments one day earlier.) But worthwhile critiques of the American far left would posit good-faith objections to its strongest arguments  not frame all leftists as the collective authors of Jill Steins worst tweet. Such critiques would also recognize the diversity of the far left, rather than imply it is occupied entirely by white men. Most crucially, effective critiques of left-wing factionalism would not posit bizarre falsehoods  like Wolcotts suggestion that Jacobins editors harbor a deep admiration for congresswomen Tulsi Gabbard  so as to link the far left to Trump, and paint a wider progressive divide than actually exists. Unfortunately, Wolcott is far from the only liberal pushing critiques that do the very opposite. In his column, he cites the Tumblr blog Trumpian Leftism, which aggregates tweets from leftists who (allegedly) evince sympathy for Trumpism. Here is one entry. An alt-leftist suggests that supporters of Keith Ellison do not dislike Cory Booker because they are racists, but rather, because they disagree with his positions on political issues. The alt-centrist suggests this is the kind of argument a racist would make. Without question, you can find plenty of bad-faith arguments and ad-hominem attacks on the far-left corners of your social-media feed. But when liberals respond in kind, they do nothing to clarify  or resolve  all that divides our side of the aisle."}, {"date": "2017/03/03", "title": "Despite Trumps Promise, Keystone XL Pipeline Wont Use U.S. Steel", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/despite-trumps-promise-keystone-wont-use-u-s-steel.html", "text": " The company building the Keystone XL pipeline will not have to use U.S. steel on the project, despite multiple promises from President Trump and an executive order requiring domestic materials be used on pipelines within U.S. borders. The order, signed on the same day that Trump fast-tracked the building of the pipeline with a separate order, says U.S. steel must be used on all new pipelines, as well as retrofitted, repaired, or expanded pipelines, inside the borders of the United States. As a White House spokesperson tells Politico, Keystone is none of those: The Keystone XL Pipeline is currently in the process of being constructed, so it does not count as a new, retrofitted, repaired or expanded pipeline. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders elaborated on Friday. Since this one is already currently under construction, the steel is already literally sitting there, its hard to go back. Everything moving forward would fall under that executive order, she said. While the language of the executive order does leave the White House some room to maneuver, allowing Keystone to go ahead without using U.S. steel directly contradicts statements from the president. Only eight days ago, Trump told U.S. Steel CEO Mario Longhi that the companies building both the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipeline had to buy  steel made in this country. The next day in speech at CPAC, Trump recounted a conversation about the pipelines that went like this: Of course, keeping that promise as it relates to Keystone was never very realistic.

In an interview with Stat, Marshall draws upon his medical experience to explain why the laws expansion of Medicaid is a bad thing. It is quite an interesting explanation: There are a few points to make here: 1. Measuring the impact of any medical treatment is usually hard. But the overwhelming weight of studies suggests eligibility for Medicaid makes people physically, mentally, and financially better off. 2. If Marshall thinks poor people need to do more preventative care, there are programs that can encourage it. Eliminating their access to regular medical care is the opposite of that. Indeed, he is complaining that Medicaid-eligible people only use health care when their arm is chopped off or they get pneumonia and visit the emergency room, and his solution is to deny them access to medical care other than the emergency room (which by law has to treat anybody who comes in). 3. Note that Marshall is not merely proposing to identify those poor people who refuse to take care of themselves and to cut off their insurance. He has decided this applies to Medicaid-eligible people as a group, and the punishment should be meted out to all of them. Medicaid doesnt force anybody to go to the doctor, so if Marshall is sure the poor dont want health care, he can let them stay on the program, and then only the poor people who do want health care will use it to visit the doctor. Taking away peoples right to choose something on the grounds that they dont want it anyway is a proposal suffering from a basic conceptual problem. 4.

Some of the resultant coverage has been heartbreaking  images of tiny little kids hustled out of buildings, scared and confused about what is going on. These threats, combined with several instances in which Jewish cemeteries were vandalized, appear to mark a real uptick in the expression of anti-Semitic sentiments. Today, authorities announced their first break in figuring who was calling in the bomb threats, announcing the arrest, in St. Louis, of Juan Thompson, a former Intercept writer who left that job after it became clear he had engaged in widespread fabrication. Thompson, authorities say, was responsible for at least eight of the JCC threats that have been called in. It is believed that these were copycat acts inspired by other recent bomb threats, and were part of a pattern of abusive and harassing behavior directed at an ex-girlfriend, whom he tried to implicate in the acts. That word copycat should catch the eye of anyone who has been watching the recent spate of anti-Semitic threats unfold. After all, these threats have received a huge amount of media attention. So maybe it will sound like an odd question, but its worth asking: Should national media outlets be covering each and every bomb threat so aggressively? When you zoom out from the shock and outrage elicited by these acts and examine the broader landscape, theres a strong case to be made that the wall-to-wall coverage only invites more threats from troubled individuals like Thompson who have no intention of actually planting a bomb anywhere. Thats because it is remarkably, scarily easy to issue anonymous threats these days, whether over the phone or online. With just a bit of technological know-how, any idiot can do a decent enough job concealing their identity to significantly reduce the odds they will be easily caught. There are also entire internet subcultures, some of them quite psychotic, which are gleefully obsessed with threatening anyone they dont like. Some of these subcultures are driven by true anti-Semitism and other ideologies, others by 4chan-type nihilism (not that anyone should act like theres a meaningful distinction between a bomb threat issued for lulz versus for genuine reasons). What everyone who makes a bomb threat has in common, though, is that they want attention. They want their threat to spread fear and cause chaos. And they have an easier time accomplishing this goal than ever before, since any threat, even a not-very-credible one against a small-town location, will quickly be able to hop aboard social media for a free ride to national coverage and outrage. These threats are almost always bunk. Its hard to find any hard stats on this, but when is the last time an actual bombing or attack was preceded by a phoned- or emailed-in warning? Authorities do need to always take these threats seriously, of course  it would be ridiculous to argue that a JCC shouldnt be evacuated after a threat, or that authorities shouldnt aggressively seek out the perpetrator of that threat. On that front, the threateners will always have something of an upper hand: They will always be able to cause at least a little bit of chaos. But media outlets do have some power here to mitigate the damage caused by those who call in threats. They can decide whether it makes sense to pay attention to and publicize such threats, knowing that if they do it will make the act itself appear more appealing. And in fact, media outlets have had these sorts of conversations before, particularly with regard to covering suicides in a way that will minimize the very real possibility of so-called contagion effects in which people, particularly adolescents, view suicide as a somehow glamorous or valorous act. Now, just as the people who call in threats are operating on the basis of certain incentives, so too are media outlets. These stories are compelling, theyre scary, and, to be frank, they get clicks. Moreover, no one wants to be accused of anti-Semitism by not covering a bomb scare against a JCC everyone else is covering (the same logic applies for hate crimes directed at other groups, of course). Perhaps most important, theres a growing sense among progressives  one which surely motivates media outlets decisions  that any expression of hatefulness needs to be visibly, forcefully responded to, that to not respond is an act of complicity. This belief is couched in some unexamined assumptions, though. If it could be shown that aggressively covering and publicizing the anger caused by bomb threats had the effect of reducing peoples incentive to issue those threats, that would be one thing. But the truth is very likely the opposite: It is almost certainly the case that breathless coverage of bomb threats, on balance, emboldens and encourages the Juan Thompsons of the world to issue them. Technology has obviated certain deeply ingrained bits of folk wisdom about the efficacy of pointing to a bad act and saying We find this unacceptable in unison. This only works if everyone considers themselves part of the same community and adheres to the same values, and if there is a reputational or disciplinary cost to deviating from the norms being promoted. What if youre part of another community  a community that delights in terrorizing people? And what if youve accurately gauged that, should you decide to go through with a bomb threat, your odds of being caught are fairly close to zero? Of course, even if media outlets decided tomorrow to stop publicizing some bomb threats (which they wont), social media, which operates on its own track according to its own rules, would continue to do so. But its still worth questioning whether every threat has to be publicized, and whether the trend toward doing so might bring with it some unintended consequences."}, {"date": "2017/03/03", "title": "Judges to Kansas Governor: Fund the Schools Already!", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/judges-to-kansas-governor-fund-the-schools-already.html", "text": " The latest incident in the long saga of terrible fallout from Governor Sam Brownbacks disastrous fiscal experiment in tax-cutting comes from the Supreme Court of Kansas. It has ordered the state to provide a new, fairer, and more generous formula for funding schools in order to comply with constitutional requirements for public education. More specifically, it struck down a block grant system tossing out limited money indiscriminately that Brownback devised after a fiscal deadlock with the Republican-controlled legislature made the old formula impossible. The court agreed with less-well-funded schools that the block grant unconstitutionally underfunded them. So now the governor and the state, already in the throes of another fiscal crisis, will have until June to come up with a new formula. One quick estimate is that it will cost between $431 million and $893 million to comply. As Edwin Rios of Mother Jones notes, [t]he demand for extra education funding couldnt come at a worse time for Brownback. Hes already in a struggle with the legislature in an effort to deal with the massive budget deficits attributable to his 2011 tax cut experiment, which did not create the business boom he predicted but did decimate revenues. His stubbornness led to the defeat of many of the governors allies in GOP primaries last year, which has intensified the intra-party fiscal battle. So if youre keeping score at home, Brownbacks Republican opponents want to pare back education spending and some of Brownbacks tax cuts, while Brownback wants to cut education even more and keep the tax cuts. The courts are saying no, and maybe hell no, to both. Brownbacks answer to the whole problem is to divert even more tax dollars from public schools: At least Brownback is consistent: When one bit of conservative ideological dogma fails, he reaches for another."}, {"date": "2017/03/03", "title": "Two House Republicans Join Dems and Demand Trumps Taxes", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/two-house-republicans-join-dems-and-demand-trumps-taxes.html", "text": " Two House Republicans joined congressional Democrats Friday in signing a letter demanding the release of President Trumps tax returns.

Jones and Sanford arent the only two Republicans to signal their discomfort with Trumps refusal to release his tax returns. Last month, Maine senator Susan Collins, a Republican, suggested that the Senate Intelligence Committee might have to subpoena Trumps tax returns as a part of its investigation into his Russia ties. On Wednesday, South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham suggested that a law be passed requiring future presidential candidates release their tax returns. His proposed law would apply to Trump if hes a candidate for president in 2020, Politico reported. At least two lower-profile House members have also called on Trump to release his tax returns, with both coming last month while voters pressed them on the issue at town hall meetings. Florida Republican representative Matt Gaetz told a questioner that he absolutely believes the returns should be released.

But more important, three GOP senators  exactly the number needed to kill a repeal bill  have taken to demanding a simple repeal bill like the one Congress approved and Obama vetoed early last year, without a lot of added provisions designed to cushion the blow and protect coverage. Speaker Paul Ryan professes not to be worried: Indeed, says Politico, leadership figures believe Trump will take rebellious conservatives to the woodshed if they dont fall into line. That assertion reflects an entirely unprecedented degree of certainty about the thinking of the 45th president, on Obamacare or much of anything else. Maybe its a coincidence, but Politico has also gotten its hands on what is purported to be the latest draft of the House Obamacare repeal plan, and it shows few if any concessions to right-wing objections. Yes, it is reported that the sponsors might add a cap on income eligibility to the otherwise age-based tax credits for insurance purchases. But the real conservative angst involves the other end of the income spectrum, where people without income-tax liability would be given refundable tax credits  i.e., a check from the IRS. That makes it welfare instead of a tax cut, you see  redistribution instead of letting people keep more of their own money. But refundability is pretty much essential if you want to avoid millions of low-income Obamacare beneficiaries falling back into the ranks of the uninsured. The main changes in the House bill seem to reflect not the demands of conservatives but the needs of private health-insurance companies, to keep them playing ball during the transition from one system to the other. So the question of the day is whether these developments represent icy Establishment confidence or a bluff? And that may come down to whether Team Trump is actually onboard. The excited Politico account of Establishment muscle-flexing puts great stock in an appearance by Vice-President Mike Pence and HHS Secretary Tom Price in Paul Ryans hometown today: Maybe, though, the appearance is a nonpublic event for employees and executives of an agricultural-supply company. And according to a C-Span notice, it will be followed by a Pence speech on jobs and the economy. These are not the most obvious opportunities for a message on Obamacare designed to strike fear into the hearts of Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, and their fellow-rebels in the House. They scoffed at the last alleged display of administration solidarity with Ryan, the presidents vague reference to health-care tax credits in his speech to Congress. Its doubtful conservatives will really get worried unless they hear unambiguous discouragement from Donald Trumps Twitter account."}, {"date": "2017/03/03", "title": "What We Know About Trumps Ties to Russia Amounts to Treachery to the Republic", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/trumps-ties-to-russia-amount-to-treachery-to-the-republic.html", "text": " The high point of Donald Trumps presidency to date  the moment when those who desperately wanted to close their eyes and imagine a normal president standing before the country got something resembling their wish  came during his late-February speech to a joint session of Congress. Trump managed to read his address without narcissistic digressions, and the message he delivered (Nationalism with an indoor voice, as one White House official put it) would have been obvious to any casual listener. Over and over, Trump blamed Americas problems on foreigners or the willingness of past leaders to accommodate them: Weve watched our middle class shrink as weve exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries; Weve defended the borders of other nations while leaving our own borders wide open for anyone to cross; America must put its own citizens first; Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States; My job is to represent the United States of America. The display of overt, bellicose nationalism presents a morbid contrast with the unfolding Russia scandal, which exposes the presidents boasts of domestic loyalty as containing all the irony of the title of the television show The Americans. The scandal is spinning off in multiple directions, but at bottom it suggests a betrayal of American sovereignty by Trump that is unprecedented in the history of the republic. For a still-unclear combination of reasons  greed for power, greed for money, vulnerability to blackmail, or motivations unknown  the incoming administration cooperated with the undermining of American democracy by a hostile foreign power. Heres what Donald Trump has actually said about Putin in public: This is already known. On July 4, Franklin Foer wrote in Slate the first major story in the American media identifying a Russian plan to influence the presidential election. He pieced together such evidence as Trumps extensive financial ties to Russia; Vladimir Putins pattern of intervening in elections in the West in order to support his preferred candidates; Russias hacking of Democrats emails; and the fact that a number of Trump advisers had been paid by sources loyal to the Kremlin, including Trumps then-campaign manager Paul Manafort, who had carried out a similar strategy on behalf of a pro-Russian candidate in Ukraine that he seemed to be doing in the United States. In the months that have followed, more reporting on this strange and sinister axis has emerged, mostly in the form of reports that have burst onto the scene as bombshells, only to be quickly displaced by other stories in the disorienting, surreal news environment that is Trumps Washington. The New York Times has found that phone records and intercepted calls reveal that Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials and that U.S. allies had uncovered meetings in European cities between Russian officials and Trump associates. It is not illegal to meet with Russian agents or spies. However, Trump and his advisers have repeatedly lied or contradicted themselves about these meetings. Former national-security adviser Michael Flynn lied to the FBI about his discussions with Russia following the election. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who told a Senate committee during his confirmation hearings I did not have communications with the Russians, in fact met twice during the campaign with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Only after the Washington Post reported on the meetings did Sessions agree to recuse himself from his own departments investigation into the matter. Trumps statements on his relations with Russia have oscillated wildly. Asked in 2013 if he had a relationship with Putin, Trump said, I do have a relationship, and I can tell you hes very interested in what were doing here today. In 2014, he recounted, Putin even sent me a present, beautiful present with a beautiful note, I spoke to all of his people, and that he spoke indirectly and directly with Putin. In 2015, he boasted, I got to know [Putin] very well. Last year, he insisted, I have no relationship with Putin and that I dont know Putin  I never met Putin. One well-known explanation for this relationship was supplied by a dossier compiled by Christopher Steele, a British intelligence officer turned private investigator. Steeles report alleged a deep web of financial and personal ties between Trump and Russia, including, spectacularly, a videotape of the now-president engaging in sexual fetishes with prostitutes in Moscow that was being used to blackmail him. The accusations in the dossier remain largely unverified. But since it was made public in January, its credibility has grown. Last month, CNN reported that American investigators corroborated some of the claims in the dossier, and the Washington Post reported that the FBI believed Steele credible enough to considered hiring him to continue his investigation. While Trump has kept hidden his own financial ties to Russia, enough public evidence has emerged to suggest they are extensive. After his companys bankruptcies made him untouchable by American banks, Trump grew increasingly dependent on foreign sources of capital. Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets, Donald Trump Jr. told a real-estate conference in 2008. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia. Trump hired a Russian gangster named Felix Sater, who even worked out of Trump Tower and used Trump Organization business cards. Trump has tweeted, For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia, a defense that evades the question of whether Russia has any investments in his properties. Asked last summer if Trump had no financial relationships with any Russian oligarchs, Manafort delivered a comically unconvincing denial, averting his eyes from the camera, shrugging his shoulders, and stammering, Thats what he said  Id  thats what I said  obviously, thats what our position is. The most obvious untapped source of information on Trumps contacts with Russia would be his tax returns, which Congress could require him to release. But Congress has refused to do so. Instead, with the exception of a handful of critics, the Republican Party has sheltered its president in a protective envelope. At the behest of the White House, the chairmen of the House and Senate intelligence committees contacted reporters to dispute news of Trump contacts with Russian officials. Theyve looked, and its all a dead trail that leads me to believe no contact, not even pizza-delivery-guy contact, said House chairman Devin Nunes. On March 2, House Speaker Paul Ryan asserted that he had seen no evidence that anybody on the Trump campaign or an American was involved in colluding with the Russians. What evidence would he like? A Trump adviser coyly revealing his advance knowledge of stolen email dumps, then admitting he has a back-channel communication with Assange? Because that exists. Maybe video of Trump asking Putin to hack his opponents email? Because that exists, too. Russia, if youre listening, I hope youre able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing, Trump announced at a press conference last summer. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. (Trump later claimed he was joking.) Even if Trump had nothing to do with encouraging the Russian hacking, aggressively exploiting it was a conscious choice. Other Republicans, like Marco Rubio  in one of his periodic outbreaks of conscience  asserted that the GOP should renounce the use of information from WikiLeaks rather than reward foreign interference in American elections. Trump made the opposite decision. And Trumps party has mostly decided likewise. All of it is fine  the nondisclosure of tax returns, the unprecedented self-enrichment, the fantastic lies and authoritarian lingo. Republicans in Washington see Trump as a useful vehicle for their policy objectives. Indeed, at least for the time being, Trumps nationalist ravings have utility for special interests from the Kremlin to Wall Street, all of whom look upon the American president with smugness and satisfaction at a deal well struck. In Trumps short tenure as president, his demagogic claim that elites have betrayed the American people out of solicitousness to foreign powers has finally become true. *This article appears in the March 6, 2017, issue of New York Magazine."}, {"date": "2017/03/03", "title": "FBI Charges Former Intercept Journalist With Making Threats Against JCCs", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/fbi-charges-ex-journalist-with-making-threats-against-jccs.html", "text": " The FBI has charged a St. Louis man with making at least eight threats to Jewish Community Centers across the country and to the Anti-Defamation League in Manhattan as a part of a campaign to harass and intimidate his ex-girlfriend. Juan Thompson, 31, made the threats after months of harassing his ex and used both her name and his own when doing so. He would later claim the threats using his name were made by her. Authorities reportedly consider Thompson a copycat who only began making threats after seeing reports of others. Waves of bomb threats have swept Jewish schools and JCCs five different times since January 18, with the most recent wave coming on January 27, when 23 JCCs and Jewish schools had threats called in. The threats cover 81 different locations, in 33 states. Headstones have also been toppled at several Jewish cemeteries. No one has been arrested for making the nationwide robocall JCC threats. Thats still an active FBI investigation, New York State Police spokesman Beau Duffy said Friday. According to the criminal complaint, Thompson was behind a bomb threat to the ADL headquarters in Manhattan last week, which he emailed in the name of his ex. The email said she was behind the bomb threats against the jews. She lives in nyc and is making more bomb threats tomorrow. A bomb threat was made over the phone the next day. Another threat made to a JCC in Manhattan last month included Thompsons name and said he wants to create Jewish newtown. A Twitter account linked to Thompson references these threats and says his ex-girlfriend was making them in his name in an attempt to smear him. In one tweet, he lamented the threats to JCCs. Thompson is the same man who was fired from the Intercept last year after it became clear he was fabricating quotes and sources. His most widely read piece was an interview with the cousin of Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof. The cousin did not exist."}, {"date": "2017/03/03", "title": "Will a Former Exxon CEO Save the Paris Climate Deal?", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/will-a-former-exxon-ceo-save-the-paris-climate-deal.html", "text": " The Paris agreement was a triumph of global governance  one that represents humanitys last, best hope for averting ecological ruin. But the climate change deal has a major flaw: Its only enforcement mechanism is our collective fear of the disaster it was designed to prevent. At the time it was signed, there was reason to think this might be enough to keep everyone honest. After all, only one major political party on planet Earth denies the reality of climate change  and the GOP was well on its way to nominating a sure loser as its standard-bearer in April 2016. But, of course, the sure loser won. And now, President Trump can kill off every climate-related program at the E.P.A.; tear up the Obama administrations emissions reduction plans; or, heck, pass subsidies that encourage diesel drivers to roll coal  all without violating the terms of the Paris agreement. In fact, theres only one legally binding burden that the deal imposes on Trump: His government must publish an emissions reduction target, and draft reports explaining how it is meeting those targets. But the target, itself, is up to Trump. Obama pledged to cut Americas carbon pollution 26 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. Trump could pledge to cut them by a sum that would require no significant government intervention. Market forces alone are already phasing out coal and propelling the growth of wind and solar power. All of which is to say: The Trump administration has little to gain from initiating the arduous, four-year legal process required to exit the Paris agreement. It does, however, have much to lose  including Americas credibility as a world leader and an upholder of its international commitments. The Paris agreement binds together 194 of the worlds nations, on an issue of existential importance. Its hard to imagine a better way for the U.S. to marginalize itself than forfeiting its seat at that table. But Steve Bannon wants America to push back its chair, anyway. Bannons apparent rationale, per the New York Times, is that Trumps commitments to his supporters take precedence over Americas commitments to other countries (especially when those commitments concern the globalist hoax that rootless cosmopolitans call climate change). Trump repeatedly promised to cancel the Paris agreement on the campaign trail. But some in Trumps inner circle think it would be a bad idea to sabotage Americas standing in the world for the sake of avoiding Breitbarts disapproval. Among them is former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson and former Nordstrom business partner Ivanka Trump. Tillersons old company may have played a leading role in the despoliation of the planet  and in the obstruction of public awareness of climate change. But Exxon now publicly acknowledges the hazards of fossil fuels and (officially) supports taxing carbon dioxide pollution. Its possible that the secretary of State shares this position. But even if he doesnt, there are plenty of other reasons why Americas top diplomat might oppose needlessly souring Americas diplomatic relationship with (virtually) every other nation in the world. Ivanka has previously leaked word that she intends to make climate change one of her signature issues. Whether this interest derives from concern for her lifestyle brand  or for the planet shed be leaving her grandchildren  is unclear. Regardless, she has been the point person for celebrities looking to beg the president to take mercy on the environment. This puts Trump in a difficult position: He must choose between his favorite child and the demon he made a deal with to become president. And hes supposed to decide in the next week  the administration wants to announce its stance the same day Trump signs an executive order rolling back Obamas climate regulations. But the president may have already found a way out of his conundrum. According to the Times, Trump is considering declaring the Paris deal a treaty that must be ratified by the Senate. The primary reason why world leaders left an enforcement mechanism out of the climate pact was to keep the deal safe from the Capitol Hills upper chamber  which was, and is, controlled by the only major political organization committed to bringing about the collapse of human civilization as quickly as possible. By throwing the decision to the Senate, Trump would essentially be asking Mitch McConnell to take the deal behind the barn for him. Its a move akin to Obamas decision to let Congress prevent him from upholding his red line in Syria. Only this time, instead of stopping America from bombing a Middle Eastern country, the presidents decision to defer to Congress would allow the U.S. to blow up humanitys best chance to save the only home its ever known."}, {"date": "2017/03/03", "title": "Trump Cant Find Existing Funds to Start Building Border Wall As Promised", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/trump-cant-find-existing-funds-to-start-building-wall.html", "text": " In late January, when President Trump signed an executive order to build his big, beautiful wall on the border between U.S. and Mexico, he said the Department of Homeland Security will begin immediate construction. But where would the money to do that come from? White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer clarified that the beginning of the project would be paid for with existing funds and resources. Turns out, theres not much existing. DHS has found only $20 million that it can redirect toward the border wall, which is only enough to begin building prototypes, according to a memo leaked to Reuters. That $20 million comes from money already appropriated for a fence on the border in Naco, Arizona, which was the rare government project to come in under budget. The rest is being reallocated from a project meant to put cameras on top of trucks patrolling the border. Because both of these projects were already a part of the the DHS budget for border security, the department did not have to ask Congress to approve the maneuvering, Reuters reports. But with only $20 million available and the wall projected to cast as much as $25 billion, Trump will soon have to go to Congress to ask for more funding. And that may present a problem. As many Republicans told CNN in February, Congress wont allocate billions to the border wall without offsetting the cost.

It suddenly beams, and the voice calms. You feel the warmth again and are momentarily overcome with gratitude and relief. Suddenly, all the mans malice and rage and narcissism disappear and the world turns suddenly normal. And you thrill to that normality. Its what youve craved for so long, and been denied for so long. You forgive. You hope. You wonder if all the fear and dread you felt only a few moments ago were just in your imagination. Any victim of an abusive spouse knows this dynamic. And now America is getting used to it. The Donald Trump who put on his grown-up voice last Tuesday night, and fit into a reassuringly familiar ritual of civic democracy, was the very same Donald Trump who had spent much of his first month in office in a series of unprecedented dyspeptic fits against the media, NATO allies, illegal aliens, Meryl Streep  well, you know the list by now. For the first time in public, he spoke in his indoor voice. He occasionally smiled, even as he cant quite rid himself of the Mussolini back-step whenever he earns his craved applause. He used a teleprompter. And of course the media swooned. Who wouldnt at this point? Its somewhat unfair to lambaste them for their instant acknowledgment of the speechs success. It was a success  an emotional blast of pseudo-normality for a serial abuser of liberal democratic norms. It was an irresistible moment when the foreboding and fear suddenly became sunlit uplands in a near parody of political happy talk: Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need.  Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, airports, and railways gleaming across our beautiful land. Beautiful. He loves that word. You always know when Trump is putting on the charm  because he randomly attaches it to anything. And its all a complete fantasy, of course  a campaign speech without the snarl or chants, a rapture with absolutely no explanation of how this new beautiful world will be paid for, or legislated. But it works because its such a dramatic switch, and for a moment, even Jake Tappers amygdala seemed flooded with relief. For a moment. A little less than 24 hours, to be precise. We can all now thank Jeff Sessions for bringing us back, bumpily, to the far more sinister reality. And he lied, of course. And I dont mean in the speech itself. He lied directly to the faces of the media muckety-mucks that afternoon, telling them that he was going to embrace some kind of immigration reform. For a few hours, much of the press duly reported this  until they heard the speech itself, which did no such thing. The lie, we were told, was a misdirection, in order to get some favorable coverage from the media that afternoon. But think about that for a minute. This wasnt a trial balloon, delivered by some anonymous sources to see the impact of a potential policy. This wasnt even a defensible fib, for national-security reasons. It was an outright lie from the president himself in order to delegitimize the press. If the New York Times or the evening news reports something completely untrue  indeed refuted just a few hours later  what happens to their credibility? Bannon is not kidding when he describes the free press as the opposition. For shameless demagogues, it always is. And this creepily authoritarian administration will happily lie to its face. Ive always been unusually attached to places. Its one reason I still call myself a conservative. Travel doesnt attract me. Ive now lived in the same loft in D.C. since I bought it, in 1991 (apart from an ill-fated year and a half in New York City); Ive spent 20 consecutive summers in the same little town at the end of Cape Cod, and have no desire to go anyplace else. Even when I go home to England, I tend to spend around half my time near where I grew up. I wouldnt go so far as Malcolm Muggeridge, who famously said: Travel, of course, narrows the mind. (Dont you love that of course?) But I would say that the reverse can also be true. Staying put allows you to really get to know a place deeply at different times and in different seasons, to capture, often serendipitously, a small detail youd never seen before, or arrive at a street corner and suddenly remember that this was where you first met an old friend. But staying home brings grief with it as well. Everything changes, and when your beloved tree at the end of the street is cut down, or a new Safeway replaces the corner baker, or, more fatally, the factory that used to be the linchpin of the place lies empty and crumbling, it stings and wounds and demoralizes. When Ive visited my own hometown in England, so much is the same. And yet, on closer inspection, many of the once-vibrant shops are selling secondhand clothes, or given over to real estate offices. My old church has a broken window where the rain comes in. The services have dwindled to near nothing. Maybe its being away for so long, but it seems familiar and yet a little empty, as if something in it has somehow died, a continuity somehow lost. And more and more, I suspect, the shifting winds of this merciless global economy and the impact of mass migration are bringing about similar changes all over the West. This beautiful but deeply sad story about how a provincial town in France has slowly died  as its young people flocked to cities, as its shops were supplanted by a supermarket, says a lot about the moment we are in: Down another street is the last toy store, now closed, and around a corner is the last independent grocery store, also shuttered. Walk down the empty, narrow streets on some nights and the silence is so complete that you can hear your footsteps on the stones. The town, Albi, is not alone. In America, as Charles Murray has shown in his extraordinary book, Coming Apart, the young and the smart and the talented  the people who would once have formed the core of these small towns  have long since fled to distant colleges and cities. They dont come back. They would once have been the police chief or the town librarian or the school principal. They once helped make the town a well-run place with a clear identity, where the same families and networks lived together, died together, belonged together. These connections have attenuated  as economics supplants culture, as efficiency erases the individuality of inefficient places, as Amazon rips the heart out of shopping districts, as the smartphone removes us from physical space, and as many more immigrants and their culture alter the feel of a place in ways that disorient those with memories and loyalties. I dont think we can understand the politics of this moment  Brexit, Trump, Le Pen  without noticing this abiding sense of loss. The middling city and small town are going the way of the middle class. Patterns of farming in rural America are being devastated. I loved this English farmers account of the changes he is seeing: The future we have been sold doesnt work. Applying the principles of the factory floor to the natural world just doesnt work. Farming is more than a business. Food is more than a commodity. Land is more than a mineral resource. Jobs are vital not simply because of money  but because they give lives meaning, a meaning that now seems so remote people medicate themselves with opiates. People are grieving for a lost way of life. This is not racist or retrograde or even backward. It is, rather, deeply human. For it is in these places that a deeper identity forms, that Americanness, Britishness, la France profonde, endures. And what were seeing right now, across the developed world, is a bid to retain the meaning of a culture and a way of life in the headwinds of faceless, placeless economics. Nationalism is one response. The answer to it is not globalism, which is as cold as it is remote, but patriotism, that love of country that does not require the loathing of other places or the scapegoating of minorities or a phobia of change, that confident identity that doesnt seek to run away from the wider world but to engage it, while somehow staying recognizable across the generations. If the Democrats hope to come back, that patriotism is going to have to define them once again. But can they get past their racial and sexual and gender obsessions and reach for it? Since I wrote about digital addiction, Ive been constantly and understandably asked what might be the antidote. Well, heres one: the dumbphone. Nokia is now making the once-beloved 3310 model again  and the new ones look pretty cool. You can call and text but youre not carrying around that addiction device called a tiny mobile computer. Theyre a fraction of the cost of a smartphone  and have a variety of uses, as this great review in The Atlantic explains. You can use it in places where a smartphone might be easily damaged; or as a replacement for the home landline; as a way to stay in touch while staying sane. Sadly, the new ones arent yet available in the U.S.  but the demand, I suspect, could be huge. Think of them like the extraordinary revival of vinyl for music  a return to the actual pleasure of a simple activity, a reminder that change isnt always for the better, that the past is always retrievable in the present. We dont have to be trapped in our culture. We can choose to defy it. Increasingly, it seems to me, we must."}, {"date": "2017/03/03", "title": "Pence Used AOL Account for State Business As He Complained About Clinton Emails", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/pence-used-aol-account-as-he-complained-about-clinton-emails.html", "text": " Back in September, thenIndiana governor Mike Pence said Hillary Clintons handling of her emails disqualify her from serving as president, during an appearance on Meet the Press. She either knew or shouldve known that she was placing classified information in a way that exposed it to being hacked and being made available in the public domain, even to enemies of this country, Pence explained. As Pence said this, he was using an AOL account to conduct state business  and hed been hacked three months earlier. IndyStar reported on Thursday that Pence routinely used his personal account to discuss state matters, such as Indianas response to terror attacks and an update from the FBI on charges in a terrorism case. Following a public records request, IndyStar was given 29 pages of emails from Pences AOL account. An unspecified number of emails were withheld because they were deemed too sensitive, which raises further questions about why they were on an AOL account in the first place. The vice-presidents office responded with this statement: Similar to previous governors, during his time as Governor of Indiana, Mike Pence maintained a state email account and a personal email account. As Governor, Mr. Pence fully complied with Indiana law regarding email use and retention. Government emails involving his state and personal accounts are being archived by the state consistent with Indiana law, and are being managed according to Indianas Access to Public Records Act. It isnt uncommon for state officials to use personal accounts for business, and its not against the law in Indiana. Pences office said his campaign hired outside counsel to determine which of his personal emails involved official business and should be transferred to the state. This is worrisome for all the reasons described when Clinton deleted what were ostensibly emails about her yoga routine and Chelseas wedding. Of course, as secretary of State, Clintons emails were far more sensitive than those of the governor of Indiana. Clintons email controversy is also different from Pences because, as far as we know, her private server was never hacked. Back in June, a hacker sent an email from Pences address to all of his contacts claiming that he and his wife were robbed and needed friends to wire them money. Pence joked about the incident, and an aide said he shut down that account and opened a new one. So it appears the hack did not convince Pence that using an AOL account  especially for state business  was unwise, or make him more sympathetic to Clintons email issues."}, {"date": "2017/03/03", "title": "Line Between Senator and Surrogate Sessions Is Murkier Than White House Suggests", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/line-between-senator-and-surrogate-sessions-is-murky.html", "text": " The thrust of Attorney General Jeff Sessionss explanation of why he told the Senate he didnt have communications with the Russians despite meeting Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak twice in 2016 is that he was referring to his role as a Trump campaign surrogate, not a U.S. senator. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer echoed this point at Thursdays briefing, saying, He was literally conducting himself as a United States senator  this is what senators do in the course of conducting themselves in their job. Spicer was responding to the question Where does one role begin and the other one stop? He didnt really answer, and a report from The Wall Street Journal on Thursday night highlighted the difficulty of trying to separate the two roles. Sessionss first meeting with Kislyak was an informal discussion at a Heritage Foundation event on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention in July. The Journal reports that Sessions paid for the trip out of his own campaign funds, rather than money that would cover his travel as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Sessions, who was chairman of Trumps National Security Advisory Committee at the time, also made comments related to the Trump campaign during the event. One attendee said Sessions remarks were about Trumps trade policy, and he was left with the impression that the senator was at the event in his capacity as a campaign surrogate. Sarah Isgur Flores, Sessionss spokeswoman, said aides dont recall Sessions mentioning the election when he talked with Kislyak, but they couldnt be sure because the room was loud. In an interview with Fox News on Thursday night, Sessions said he doesntrecall any discussion of the campaign in any significant way during his meetings with Kislyak. When Tucker Carlson referred to a phone call with Kislyak, Sessions said he couldnt remember whether they had a phone conversation. The attorney generals office called in to say he hadnt. Sessions is not the only Trump associate whos confused about the campaigns contacts with Russian officials. President Trump and several top figures in his administration  including Vice-President Mike Pence, Reince Preibus, Kellyanne Conway, Hope Hicks, and Spicer  have repeatedly denied that members of the campaign talked with Russians during the election. But USA Today reported on Thursday that J.D. Gordon and Carter Page, two members of the Trump campaigns national security team, spoke with Kislyak at the same diplomacy conference during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Id consider it an informal conversation just like my interactions with dozens of other ambassadors and senior diplomats in Cleveland, Gordon said. Page was less forthcoming. Last month he told PBS NewsHour that he had no meetings with any Russian officials in 2016. But he told USA Today he had an informal conversation with Kislyak during the RNC. Page left the Trump campaign in September, saying accusations about his meetings with Russian figures during a trip to Moscow in July had become a distraction. Asked to clarify whether hed met with Kislyak Thursday night on MSNBC, Page said, Im not going to deny that I talked with him. The White House also disclosed on Thursday that Kislyak had a December meeting with former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Trumps son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner in Trump Tower.

When asked several hours later if Sessions should step down from investigations into Russias alleged election meddling, President Trump said, I dont think so at all  I dont think he should do that at all. Then late on Thursday afternoon, Sessions held a press conference and announced that he would recuse himself from any Justice Department probe involving the Trump campaign. Sessions said he had notified White House counsel of his decision to step down from the investigations, and on Thursday evening the president released a statement defending his attorney general, claiming that Democrats are only interested in Russias activities because Hillary Clinton lost. The Democrats are overplaying their hand, he said, though the scandal has already forced Sessions to give in to their demands that he recuse himself. Trump said: For weeks the Trump administration has insisted that the leaks, not their content, are the real concern, even as aides implored top officials to leak positive stories to the press and the president himself acted as an anonymous source. According to Politico, now Trump advisers are blaming holdover Obama appointees for the leaks and are urging the president to hire more people who are loyal to him: Trump has only nominated a few dozen candidates for the 550 Senate-confirmed positions across the federal government, but even if he were to fill those positions, that wouldnt solve the problem. Hundreds of thousands of career civil servants cant be fired, there are leaks coming from inside the West Wing, and now some in Trumps inner circle increasingly fear that the FBI and the intelligence community are out to damage him, according to Politico. While Trump claimed that he only cared about leaks during the scandal over Michael Flynns undisclosed contacts with the Russian ambassador, Flynn was still forced to resign as national security adviser. But Sessions may avoid the same fate. As the Washington Post explains, the attorney general and the president have a nearly indestructible bond. Plus, as one person familiar with the dynamics in the West Wing told Politico, Trump probably wont get too upset about the Sessions scandal as long as it doesnt splash up on him.

NBC News reports that the Senate Intelligence Committee is considering seeking testimony from the former MI6 agent whose infamous 35-page dossier launched multiple deep state investigations  and innumerable pee jokes. That dossier spun a narrative fit for a (rather kinky) spy novel: More than five years ago, Russian intelligence operatives began cultivating an American reality star, shaping him into their agent through flattery and sexual blackmail. The Kremlin then eased Donald Trumps career transition, feeding his presidential campaign valuable intelligence on his opponents (including, of course, the Clinton campaigns hacked emails)  all as part of Vladimir Putins grand plan to end the ideals-based international order that rose from the ashes of the Second World War. Several aspects of this narrative sound implausible. And the fact that Steele was paid to assemble his materials by Trumps political opponents  during the primary and general elections  offers further reason for skepticism. But not every piece of the story needs to hold up for a few of its most damaging bits to be true. The dossier was built off raw intelligence mined from a variety of sources, some of whom may be more credible than others. The FBI, for its part, did not laugh off Steeles allegations. After all, the former MI6 agent had credibility with the bureau, having provided crucial help to its investigation into corruption within FIFA. The CIA also knew of Steeles work, and considered him a reputable intelligence officer, according to NBC News. Whats more, subsequent investigations have produced evidence that comports with one of Steeles central claims that there were repeated exchanges of information between Trump campaign surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government. As the New York Times reported Wednesday night: Since his identity became public knowledge, Steele has been in hiding in Europe. Its unclear whether he would be willing to come to Washington. In October, the FBI reportedly offered to pay Steele to continue investigating Trumps Russian ties. But the spy pulled out of that arrangement, because he had grown frustrated with the FBI. He isnt the only one.

The paroxysms of praise for it on CNN were remarkable, particularly given the presidents attacks on the network. On the pro-Trump right, the reaction was typified by this headline over a Roger L. Simon column at PJ Media: Is February 28, 2017, The Night the Democratic Party Died? And the public sure seemed to like it according to the snap polls conducted in the wake of the address. Even curmudgeons like yours truly conceded the speech was well-delivered, if not terribly substantive. Heres the thing, though: Youd think a speech that so many observers thought had changed American politics forever, or at least changed the trajectory of the Trump era of American politics, would have produced an immediate and sizable bump in Trumps less-than-sterling job-approval ratings. So far, it just hasnt. The traditional arbiter of these things, Gallup, which has done a daily tracking poll of presidential job approval since the Van Buren administration or so, had Trump at 43/52 the day of his speech. The day after he was at 43/51. Rasmussen had Trump at 50/50 on both days (though he did move up to 52/48 today, down a net point from where he was on February 24). Economist/YouGov had a poll that included some post-speech data. It showed Trumps job-approval rating at 45/51, a deterioration from 48/48 last week. Yes, I know, its early days, and its possible its taking some time for Trumps distinctly non-feral performance, or media approbation of same, to sink in. But on the other hand, positive impressions from single events like a speech with a middling TV audience tend to wear off pretty fast, too. If Trumps speech was really the epochal event some of his fans and even some of his detractors believed it was, we should be seeing major evidence of that in how Americans feel about their president. So far, it aint happening.

Indeed, the recusal will extend to investigations of any issues related to the 2016 election, though it is hard to imagine any issue eclipsing this one in significance. It is also worth noting the recusal only extends to events occurring before Election Day, which means Sessions could involve himself in a probe of alleged contacts occurring between November 8 and today. At a brief press conference announcing the step, Sessions claimed this decision had already been made and was well in the works before news broke of his meetings with the ambassador. And he also denied any wrongdoing or impropriety in negatively answering questions during his confirmation hearings about interactions with Russians. He is taking the very hard line that all he was asked about was contacts made with him as a Trump surrogate. Since the alleged meetings were, he said, held with him in his capacity as a U.S. Senator, they were not relevant to the questions. In a rather casual description of the one meeting with Sergey Kislyak that seemed to be substantial, Sessions made it sound like a social call or even an effort by the Russian to collect political gossip. While he has adamantly stated the meeting was not on behalf of the Trump campaign, he would not rule out the possibility the campaign came up, it being such a hot topic, doncha know. This gives Sessions a prearranged second line of defense if someone else in the meeting suggests the campaign was discussed after all. While Sessions constantly denied he had done anything wrong, he did at the very end of his press conference allow that he should have probably mentioned the meetings when Al Franken asked him at the confirmation hearing about contacts with Russians. His explanation for not doing so was that he was taken aback by this line of questioning. To hear Sessions talk now, the idea of Russians interfering with the presidential election on Trumps behalf was a new one to him when he held the meeting in September and when he was asked about meetings in January of this year. Since Hillary Clinton made global headlines by accusing the Russians of interference immediately before the September meeting, this hardly seems credible. But thats his story and hes sticking to it. Absent new evidence, we can expect Republicans in Congress, if not Democrats, to call the recusal enough and shift attention from Sessions to the broader investigation, or try to bury the whole thing. But as with his decision not to disclose the meetings in January, Sessionss reputation as a straight shooter is taking a big hit. Once again, hes splitting hairs like a shady lawyer instead of living up to his responsibilities as chief law-enforcement officer of the United States."}, {"date": "2017/03/02", "title": "Why Rand Paul May Not Want the GOP to Find Its Obamacare Bill", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/rand-paul-may-not-want-the-gop-to-find-its-obamacare-bill.html", "text": " On Thursday, the House GOP unveiled its latest draft of an Obamacare replacement bill  to select members of their own caucus, in an undisclosed basement room guarded by Capitol Hill police. Congressional Republicans have long disdained backroom deals, particularly ones concerning health-care reform. And, just days earlier, Paul Ryan had boasted that his party wasnt hatching some bill in a backroom and plopping it on the American peoples front door. So, it isnt hard to see why liberal pundits would have a field day with the bills basement debut. Why Rand Paul did, however, is a bit less intuitive. The Kentucky senator proceeded to take the Capitol Hill press corps on a whimsical journey designed to paint his own partys legislative process as a Kafkafesque absurdity. He was joined on this quest by the Republican chair of the House Ways and Means Committee Kevin Brady, along with some disgruntled Democrats, including House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (and/or, her hounds). Word spread that the bill was in Room H-157, a nondescript conference room in the House of Representatives. But by the time Paul and his aggrieved colleagues arrived there, the legislation had been moved to a more secure location, according to BuzzFeed News. The metaphoric had become literal  congressional Republicans could not find their alternative to the Affordable Care Act. Memes ensued. Thus, Ryans attempt to give his caucus a sneak peek at their new Obamacare replacement bill  while avoiding press scrutiny  ended in a PR disaster of Rand Pauls creation. On one level, Pauls endgame is fairly obvious: The Kentucky senator wants to sabotage Ryans bill because it isnt conservative enough. Specifically, the legislation appears to preserve some form of Medicaid expansion, along with tax credits to subsidize the health-care costs of low-income Americans. Of course, the bill is far less generous on both these fronts than Obamacare is  as the Kaiser Family Foundations scoring of a leaked discussion draft makes clear: Still, the bill would condemn too few poor people to preventable deaths for the tastes of Rand Paul and the House Freedom Caucus: Their position is full repeal or bust. Now, theres no reason to doubt the sincerity of Rand Pauls commitment to protecting personal liberty (by amplifying the suffering of the indigent). But the same can be said about Paul Ryans. The House Speaker isnt against fully abolishing the ACAs redistributive aspects for ideological reasons, but for practical ones: Several Republican senators have made it clear that they have no interest in throwing large numbers of their constituents off of Medicaid. And even if they did, the GOP still needs eight Democratic votes to get their Obamacare replacement through the Senate. Its hard to believe that Rand Paul doesnt understand this. But if hes cognizant of the fact that Ryans bill  or something like it  is his partys best hope for repealing Obamacare, why is he trying to sabotage it? One answer is that he understands the political realities of ACA repeal all too well: Medicaid expansion is quite popular in Kentucky, where it has provided 400,000 people with access to health insurance. By supporting an extreme, unpassable version of Obamacare repeal, Paul can keep his tea-party base happy, while avoiding the backlash that might result from making hundreds of thousands of his constituents lives appreciably worse. When Paul wishes to shame Capitol Hills RINOs, he notes how they were happy to fully repeal Obamacare  back when they were powerless to actually do so. But thats precisely what the Kentucky senator is still doing, today."}, {"date": "2017/03/02", "title": "Ben Carson Wins Confirmation As Trumps HUD Secretary", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/ben-carson-wins-confirmation-as-trumps-hud-secretary.html", "text": " Dr. Ben Carson, a celebrated neurosurgeon and former presidential candidate who took himself out of the running for a cabinet position in November because of his inexperience, became the newest head of the Housing Department Thursday.

Some fear he will dismantle HUDs affirmatively furthering fair housing rule, which seeks to end racial and income segregation in housing. Last year, Carson called the rule a mandated social-engineering scheme. Others see Carsons views on poverty as a threat to the families who most rely on HUD. As New York City Councilman Jumaane D.

Committee chairman Orrin Hatch is holding a second vote today, and presumably his staff will round up enough pachyderms to clear Verma for confirmation by the full Senate. The snafu does, however, give opponents of Verma more time to ask questions about the direction she will take at perhaps the most critical sub-agency of the federal government (with the possible exception of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division). A health-policy consultant mainly know for her role in designing Indianas program to use expanded Medicaid funds for conservative policy experiments, which brought her into proximity to (now Vice-President) Mike Pence, Verma is drawing heat for that programs punitive measures to get tough with low-income Medicaid beneficiaries. Depending on what if anything ultimately emerges from Congress in the way of an Obamacare repeal-and-replace scheme, Verma could wind up with powers over the health-care system at least as vast as those exercised by her Obama administration predecessors, who approved Indianas experiment. For the time being, though, the Trump administration needs her in place to deal with intense public scrutiny of its administration of health-care programs, and the more technical questions about proposed Obamacare replacements and what will happen between passage and implementation of legislation.

On Thursday morning, the Senate Minority Leader called for Jeff Sessions to resign, following revelations that the attorney general had met with the Russian ambassador to the United States twice last year  contacts that appeared to contradict Sessionss testimony to Congress during his confirmation hearings. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians, Sessions told the Senate Judiciary Committee in January, when he was asked what he would do if he learned that Trump campaign officials had been in communication within the Russian government during the 2016 campaign. On Wednesday night, the Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal revealed that Sessions did have communications with at least one Russian  the ambassador and alleged spy Sergey Kislyak. The two first spoke at an event hosted by the Heritage Foundation during the Republican National Convention. Then, they had a meeting in Sessionss Senate office in September. Sessions does not deny that these meetings took place. But he insists that his congressional testimony was accurate, nonetheless, because he had met with the Russian ambassador in his capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, not as a surrogate for the Trump campaign. The Senate Minority Leader finds this explanation unsatisfying. The information reported last night makes it clear beyond the shadow of a doubt that Attorney General Sessions cannot possibly lead an investigation into Russian interference in our elections or come anywhere near it, Schumer said, reiterating his belief that Sessions should have already recused himself from the investigation, given his role in the presidents campaign. Recusal shouldve been given, but this goes beyond that. He had weeks  Attorney General Sessions had weeks to correct the record that he made before the Judiciary Committee. But he let the record stand  because the Department of Justice should be beyond reproach for the good of the country, Attorney General Sessions should resign. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi reached that very same conclusion last night, as did many other congressional Democrats. Jeff Sessions lied under oath during his confirmation hearing before the Senate, Pelosi said. We now know that statement is false. Democratic senator Claire McCaskill challenged Sessionss explanation for his meeting with Kislyak Thursday morning  and inadvertently strengthened his defense against charges of perjury in the process. Apparently, meetings with Russian ambassadors are easy to forget. At his press conference Schumer seemed to acknowledge that Sessionss resignation was a reach goal, saying, Whatever ones views are on resignation, the most important thing we must do is ensure the integrity of the investigation. Some Republicans agree. Senator Lindsey Graham and House Oversight Chair Jason Chaffetz have both called for Sessions to recuse himself from further investigations into Russian interference  a reasonable proposition, considering that, per the Journal, Sessions has, himself, been a subject of the FBIs inquiries. Late Thursday morning, Paul Ryan suggested that, if the Journals reporting holds up, Sessions would of course recuse himself. Early Thursday morning, Sessions told NBC News, I have said whenever its appropriate, I will recuse myself. Theres no doubt about that. The attorney general did not say whether it was now appropriate. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy appeared to recommend Sessionss recusal Thursday morning, telling MSNBCs Morning Joe, I just think for any investigation going forward, you want to make sure everybody trusts the investigation  that theres no doubt within the investigation. But, less than an hour later, McCarthy told Fox & Friends, Im not calling on him to recuse himself  its amazing how people spin things so quickly."}, {"date": "2017/03/02", "title": "Trump Picks Putin Critic for Top Position on Russia Policy", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/trump-picks-putin-critic-for-top-position-on-russia-policy.html", "text": " Shortly after Donald Trumps victory last November, a reporter asked Fiona Hill whether the moguls election would mark a turning point in U.S.-Russia relations.

In the KGB, Putin learned how to probe peoples vulnerabilities, uncover their secrets, and use compromising information against them, Hill wrote last summer, in a column analyzing why the Russian leader might have interfered the 2016 election. In other words, blackmail and intimidation are part of his stock in trade. A little over two weeks ago, the Trump administration lost its first national security adviser to a scandal involving undisclosed discussions with a Russian ambassador. A little more than 12 hours ago, the administrations attorney general found himself in hot water for the very same thing. It would be tempting then, to read Hills appointment as an act of damage control. But if it is, then it was a response to damage that preceded Michael Flynns departure: According to Foreign Policy, National Security Council chief of staff Keith Kellogg had offered Hill the position while Flynn was still in charge.

During his confirmation hearings and the debate in the Senate, Sessionss friends again and again cited his integrity as so unquestionable that those alleging impure motives on his part during his days as a federal prosector were guilty of slander and even character assassination. The notion that Sessionss reputation for integrity was the crown jewel of his career was also the basis for Mitch McConnells extraordinary action in silencing Elizabeth Warren for trying to read a letter from the late Coretta Scott King challenging his self-characterization as an evenhanded enforcer of civil-rights laws. McConnell himself went to great lengths to reinforce the argument that whatever one thought of Sessionss politics and policy positions, his straight-arrow awe for the law made it all good: Well, maybe not so much in the equal application of the law to himself. Under pressure from Republicans as well as Democrats in Congress, Sessions has agreed to recuse himself from any investigation of possibly inappropriate discussions between the Trump campaign and Russian officials or agents. But even if nothing more comes out about his contacts with the Russian embassy or what went through his mind when he chose not to forthrightly answer questions about such contacts, Sessions is now seriously damaged goods after all the endless and interminable and redundant assurances he and his friends have made about his spotless honesty and love for the majesty of the law.

New reports on Wednesday shed light on how the Yemen raid was authorized just five days into the Trump administration, and the intelligence collected. As previously reported, President Trump approved the raid  a major escalation of U.S. counterterrorism operations in Yemen that was planned by the Obama administration  during a dinner with his top advisers on January 25. The Washington Post reported that according to a senior administration official, Trump was first briefed on the operation during his morning intelligence briefing, and he briefly stopped by a discussion of the raid happening in Defense Secretary James Mattiss office. On January 26, sub-Cabinet officials reviewed the operation during a meeting chaired by K.T. McFarland, Trumps deputy national security adviser. They went over the increased risk to U.S. forces, but several sources told the Post that the discussion only lasted about 25 minutes because there were other topics to cover and Trump had already approved it. The senior administration official said it was more like 40 minutes, but former officials say thats still inadequate. In previous operations like this, we would sit around the table for two hours and scrub everything. The intelligence agencies would put down maps.

The State Department would do its political assessment, said Colin Kahl, who formerly oversaw Middle East issues at the Pentagon and was national security adviser to Vice-President Joe Biden. You cant cover the complexity of a topic like that in 23 minutes. On Monday, a day before President Trump recognized Owens during his address to Congress, he distanced himself from the decision to authorize the raid, emphasizing in a Fox News interview that others planned the mission. This was a mission that was started before I got here. This was something that was, you know, just they wanted to do. They came to see me. They explained what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very respected, he said. My generals are the most respected that weve had in many decades I believe. And they lost Ryan. Trump was facing new scrutiny after Ryan Owenss father publicly questioned the motivation for the operation over the weekend, and called for an investigation. U.S. officials had also told NBC News that the raid produced no significant intelligence. Trump rebutted this during Tuesdays speech, saying: The AP reported that a large amount of information was found on the laptops, hard drives, and cell phones scooped up during the raid: What appears to be in dispute is the value of that intelligence. On Wednesday night, NBC News reported that ten U.S. officials across the government who have been briefed on the mission say there have yet to be any truly significant findings. One senior Pentagon official said it was mostly information they already knew, though another U.S. official said they did glean contact information that may link terrorists in Yemen to Europe and the U.S. The New York Times reported on Wednesday that the materials, which are still being analyzed, may further U.S. officials understanding of Al Qaedas tactics and new nonmetallic bombs the group is developing. However, theres nothing about specific plots, and the information has not led to any new strikes. Initial descriptions from the Trump team suggested far more dramatic findings.

Sessions met with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in July and September, when he was a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a top foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. The first meeting was an informal exchange with Kislyak and other diplomats after Sessions spoke at a Heritage Foundation event during the Republican National Convention. The second meeting was a private conversation in Sessionss office, which came as Russia was allegedly engaged in a cyber campaign to upend the U.S. election. During Sessionss confirmation hearing on January 10, Senator Al Franken asked what he would do if he learned that Trump campaign officials had been talking with the Russian government. Sessions volunteered that he was a campaign surrogate and had not communicated with the Russians. Im not aware of any of those activities, Sessions said, adding, I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians. The Post reports that Sessions also denied discussing the election with the Russians in his written statements to the Senate Judiciary Committee: Sarah Isgur Flores, Sessionss spokeswoman, told the Post that there was nothing misleading about his answer. She said he didnt think the conversations with Kislyak were relevant to the senators questions, and didnt remember what they discussed in detail. After the Post story broke, Flores said in a statement that Sessions met with Kislyak as a member of the Armed Services Committee, not a Trump surrogate: The Post contacted every senator who served with Sessions on the Armed Services Committee and asked if theyd met with Kislyak in 2016. Twenty said no, and the other six have yet to respond. Several hours later, Sessions released another statement: I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign. I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false. The White House issued its own statement, suggesting that Senator Franken leaked the story to ruin President Trumps good press from his speech on Tuesday night. Frankens team denied this. After the story broke, Democratic lawmakers renewed their calls for Sessions to recuse himself from investigations into the Trump teams alleged ties to Russia. Sessions had resisted, but on Monday he suggested that he would step down in certain circumstances, saying he would recuse myself on anything that I should recuse myself on, thats all I can tell you. Senator Franken said Sessionss response at his confirmation hearing was, at best, misleading, if the reports are true. It is now clearer than ever that the attorney general cannot, in good faith, oversee an investigation at the Department of Justice and the FBI of the Trump-Russia connection, and he must recuse himself immediately, he said. During a CNN town hall with Senator John McCain, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said that if the FBI investigation turns up any evidence of wrongdoing then a special prosecutor is needed. It is clear to me that Jeff Sessions, who is my dear friend, cannot make this decision about Trump, he said. Early Thursday morning, Sessions told NBC News,I have said whenever its appropriate, I will recuse myself. Theres no doubt about that. The attorney general did not say whether it was now appropriate. Meanwhile, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told MSNBCs Morning Joe that it would be easier if Sessions recused himself from the investigations into Russian hacking. I just think for any investigation going forward, you want to make sure everybody trusts the investigation, McCarthy said. That theres no doubt within the investigationI think it would be easier from that standpoint, yes.House Oversight Committee chair Jason Chaffetz also called on Sessions to recuse himself. Some top Democrats went even further. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Representative Elijah Cummings, and Senator Elizabeth Warren said Sessions should resign. After lying under oath to Congress about his own communications with the Russians, the attorney general must resign, Pelosi said, adding, Sessions is not fit to serve as the top law enforcement officer of our country. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was forced to resign last month following reports that he discussed sanctions in phone calls with Kislyak before Trump took office. Vice-President Mike Pence and other Trump administration officials had publicly denied that Flynn talked about sanctions. Earlier on Wednesday evening, the New York Times reported that officials in the Obama administration  but not the former president himself  worked to spread information about Russias election meddling and possible links to the Trump campaign around the government. This included foreign intelligence on contacts between Trump associates and Russian officials: The Obama officials were concerned that the information would be concealed or destroyed by the Trump administration and wanted to make sure it would still be available to investigators. In addition to the intelligence agencies, the House and Senate Intelligence Committees are conducting their own Russia probes. White House PressSsecretary Sean Spicer said, The only new piece of information that has come to light is that political appointees in the Obama administration have sought to create a false narrative to make an excuse for their own defeat in the election. He added, There continues to be no there, there.

This is about the ability of the NYPD to deepen its relationship with neighborhood residents, Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a press conference Wednesday. A lot more information is flowing to the NYPD, allowing our officers to be more effective. That is one of the X factors here and why the city continues to get safer. February saw 40 shootings, 85 rapes, 965 robberies, 1,287 felonious robberies, 878 burglaries, and 2,973 grand larcenies  all lower numbers than February last year. Murder was the only crime to see an uptick as compared to last February. There were 18 last year and 20 this year, but that number does come with a caveat. Five of the murders recorded in February 2017 were reclassifications of crimes previously committed. Despite the drop in overall crime stats, hate crimes did rise year over year in February. These include swastikas drawn inside of subway cars and bomb threats against Jewish centers.

The rock in which the tubes were found is some of the oldest in the world, thought to have formed around undersea vents around four billion years ago. Over time, the rock emerged from the sea. The tubes themselves, pictured above, appear to have been formed by prehistoric microbes that would have congregated around these vents, researchers say. The fact we unearthed them from one of the oldest known rock formations suggests weve found direct evidence of one of Earths oldest life forms, said Dominic Papineau, the University College London scientist who led the study. If the research teams estimates are right and the fossils are between 3.77 and 4.3 billion years old, then they are, at most, a half billion years older than the fossils previously thought to be the oldest discovered. Those fossils, found in Greenland, lived 3.7 billion years ago. So even the low estimate dates these Canadian fossils 70 million years before that. This discovery helps us piece together the history of our planet and the remarkable life on it, and will help to identify traces of life elsewhere in the universe, Papineau said in a press release. Not everyone is so sure of his discovery though. I am frankly dubious, Frances Westall of Frances Centre for Molecular Biophysics told the Times. She cited the size of the tubes, which should be smaller if they are so old, she said. Other doubters were even less generous with their assessment. As Wouter Bleeker, of the Geological Survey of Canada, told the Times, These authors built their research on pushing speculative ideas and appear totally unaware of the considerable evidence against their interpretation."}, {"date": "2017/03/01", "title": "Democrats Worry That Trump May Eliminate One of Their Few Remaining Powers", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/dems-worry-that-trump-may-eliminate-one-of-their-few-powers.html", "text": " For much of American history, institutional norms prevented partisans on Capitol Hill from deploying the full extent of their legal powers in service of their ideological goals. For example, even though a Republican-controlled Senate could technically prevent a Democratic president from ever filling a Supreme Court vacancy, they wouldnt actually do so  because norms dictated that the Senate approve the presidents judicial nominees, so long as they displayed a modicum of competence and qualifications. Similarly, while members of the Senate minority could disrupt the functioning of an agency whose work they oppose by filibustering every appointment to said agency, that kind of thing simply wasnt done. And this restraint on the minoritys part ensured that, even though the upper chambers majority party could eliminate the filibuster for such appointments, it would have no cause for doing so. These three norms did not survive the Obama presidency  or, more precisely, Mitch McConnells strategy for undermining it. And, ultimately, those norms probably needed to die. In an era of ideologically polarized parties, chummy gestures of deference dont make much sense. If your party believes that abortion is genocide  and has the power to save a seat on the Supreme Court for a justice who agrees  who cares about norms and precedents? Millions of lives  and decades of judicial rulings are at stake! Separately, if one believes in democratic rule, the power of a minority (within in the grotesquely undemocratic Senate) to block appointments and legislation aint a power worth preserving. Still, while small-d democrats might welcome the erosion of these checks on the majoritys power to govern, the timing of their erosion couldnt be much worse for those of the big-D variety: After Republican intransigence forced Harry Reid to nuke the filibuster on non-Supreme Court appointments, Democrats were left powerless to prevent President Trump from handing the executive branch over to a motley crew of racists, reactionaries, and dimwits. And Mitch McConnell has made it clear that if Democrats try to block Neil Gorsuchs path to Antonin Scalias (and/or Merrick Garlands) old seat, the Supreme Court filibuster will be laid to rest. Its unclear whether the Senate GOP has lost all restraint; many still insist they have no intention of killing the legislative filibuster, even if Democrats withhold cooperation on an Obamacare replacement. But if some Republicans still feel a bit of fealty towards institutional norms, Donald Trump isnt one of them  and Senate Democrats are worried that he has one of the minoritys few remaining powers in his crosshairs. Federal regulatory commissions are generally staffed by either five or six members. The majority party is statutorily prohibited from having more than three of its members on any one commission. This has historically guaranteed that the minority party will have significant  if not equal  sway on these regulatory bodies. But in recent days, the president has begun withdrawing the nominations of duly selected (would-be) regulators, leading Democrats to suspect that Trump may try to keep them off certain commissions, entirely. The Huffington Posts Sam Stein and Ryan Grim explain: Stein and Grim suggest that McConnell may be too strong an institutionalist to abet Trumps power grab. But Democrats can be forgiven for lacking faith in on Mitch McConnells commitment to procedural conservatism."}, {"date": "2017/03/01", "title": "Only Republicans Are Allowed to See New Health-Care Plan", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/only-republicans-are-allowed-to-see-new-health-care-plan.html", "text": " Yesterday, House Speaker Paul Ryan boasted that his party would follow a deliberate, transparent process to repeal and replace Obamacare.

Today, House Republicans made it known that they will release their plan tomorrow and that it will only be made available to House Republicans. Representative Chris Collins tells the Washington Examiner the plan would be made available Thursday morning to Republicans in a basement room of an office building that adjoins the Capitol. It is not clear what distinction Ryan draws between a backroom and a basement room only members of his party may access. The reason Republicans want to keep their plan hidden is fairly obvious. It would leave millions of Americans who currently have insurance unable to afford coverage. The Kaiser Family Foundation, working off an early discussion draft that Republicans circulated, calculates the difference in subsidy levels between the current system and what House Republicans reportedly would offer. Bottom line, if you have relatively low income, your life is about to get a lot less healthy: Republicans say the real version of their plan will differ in some regard from the discussion draft, but they have not yet said how. The Congressional Budget Office will officially estimate the bills effects on insurance coverage and the deficit. Alas, Collins also tells the Hill newspaper that the committee will vote on the bill before CBO releases its score, so exactly who will get hurt will not be known precisely. It looks like unfortunately, based on the delays, we may be marking this up and voting on it before we have a score, Collins said. Unfortunately.

But a new path to the presidency has now been paved and we should probably get used to seeing stories like the one in Wednesdays Hollywood Reporter suggesting that Disney CEO Bob Iger may run for the Democratic nomination in 2020. Last June, the 66-year-old executive told THR that a lot of people  a lot  have urged me to seek political office, an early sign that he has the ego to pull off a Trump-like pivot from business to politics. He denied any interest in becoming Californias governor or one of its U.S. senators, but wouldnt rule out a run for the White House. Since then, Iger has reportedly spoken with Michael Bloomberg, who made the jump from businessman to New York City mayor in 2002, about running for office. Given Trumps path to the presidency, its worth noting that Iger just joined Twitter. Is he following Trumps lead to communicate with voters without a media filter? If so, hes taking it slow, with only two tweets sent since joining. But if you look closely, a sign of Trumps influence can be found: Hes used three exclamation points in those two tweets. As Iger flirts with a run for office, hes not the only wealthy, business mogul considering world domination.

Putting aside for a moment the question of whether there was any empirical basis for this finding, there is no question a national-security rationale was legally the strongest ground for Team Trump to stand on, given the fairly broad powers Congress has granted to the president to ban the entry of immigrants who pose a threat to national security. Thats why it is interesting that Trumps senior advisers, most especially Stephen Miller, who was heavily involved in the travel-ban fiasco, are now making public noises about economic reasons, and especially downward pressure on wages for American citizens, being an alternate and perhaps competing rationale for building a higher, er, wall against immigrants and refugees. Greg Sargent makes the case: Sargent wrote this before Trump himself repeatedly mentioned higher wages as a purported benefit of tighter immigration policies in his speech to Congress last night. And now we hear of another indirect admission by the administration that restricting entry into the United States might be something other than a national-security emergency. As Alex Shephard notes, the sudden delay in releasing a new version of the travel ban is clearly to avoid stepping on the rosy glow from Trumps speech, and to avoid mixing messages. Trumps lawyers may discover this next time they stand before a judge or a court, demanding that review of a travel ban be brushed aside because of an imminent threat to the safety of Americans. If the ban could be put off until a day without competing media narratives, it can probably be put off until it undergoes judicial review."}, {"date": "2017/03/01", "title": "Days After Trashing Anonymous Sources, President Trump Becomes One", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/days-after-trashing-anonymous-sources-trump-becomes-one.html", "text": " Last Friday, the president told CPAC that fake news outlets like CNN shouldnt be allowed to use sources unless they use somebodys name. Four days later, he instructed CNN to quote him as a senior administration official. The time is right for an immigration bill as long as there is compromise on both sides, this official told a group of national news anchors in a private meeting Tuesday afternoon, BuzzFeed News reports. The source went on to suggest that he was open to a pathway to legalization for the noncriminal portion of the undocumented population. However, this unnamed insider emphasized that he did not support citizenship for those people  except, perhaps, for those who were brought into the United States illegally as children. While Trump initially floated this trial balloon behind the veil of anonymity, by 6 p.m. the White House had put many of the presidents closed-door remarks on the record. CNN updated its story accordingly. Though amusing, the presidents latest display of brazen hypocrisy is probably less consequential than the substance of his (temporarily) anonymous tip. During his campaign, Trump tiptoed toward moderation on immigration multiple times, but always retreated back to more familiar, xenophobic ground. At a meeting with Democratic senators in early February, Trump expressed openness to revisiting aspects of the 2013 Gang of Eight immigration-reform bill. The White House then reiterated the presidents opposition to that bill, and any other legislation that would give amnesty to the undocumented. Trump repeated this seesaw pattern on Tuesday. In his speech to Congress, the president never mentioned a pathway to legalization, opting to tout his plans for a border wall  and new office of Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement  instead. So, it would be easy to dismiss Trumps noises about moderation as just that. Especially, considering that his administration just made virtually every undocumented resident of the United States a priority for deportation. Still, if anyone can pull a Nixon goes to China on immigration reform, its Donald Trump. And the kind of compromise hes gesturing at  mass legalization without citizenship  is the ultimate win-win for his partys Establishment: Corporations would (likely) retain access to an underclass of workers who lack the full protections of American labor law, while GOP politicians would be spared the fear of 11 million new low-income, Hispanic voters turning red states blue. Of course, if one believes that undocumented immigrants provide a source of unfair competition to low-skilled American workers  as Trump claims to  than establishing a permanent labor underclass does little to solve the problem. So, that senior official probably didnt mean what he said.

These May-like highs on the first day of March are part of a historic warm spell across a huge swath of the northern hemisphere. But the bigger story here is climate change, say government scientists. Spring is arriving earlier  literally, or more accurately, phenologically. The U.S. Geological Survey says the season is showing up two to three weeks earlier than normal in the southeast United States, from Texas to Washington, and making its way gradually north. The agency measures this based on when nature wakes up and says, its time, which scientists track, in part, by monitoring the blooming and leafing dates for certain plants, and comparing that data to historic averages. Spring already arrived in the southeastern United States. It started 22 days early in Washington, D.C., where the cherry blossoms are expected to hit their peak bloom about two weeks early, around March 15. If that prediction is accurate, it will tie a record, set in 1990. So that unusually hot February is really just a pleasant moment in a pattern that will likely feel much less agreeable in, say, August 2050.

It complicates growing season for farmers. It is very bad for allergy sufferers. It throws ecosystems severely out of whack, as the Atlantic explains: Its hard to say what causes a given weather event, but springs party-crashing this year is exactly the kind of thing that happens on a warming planet. Or, as the U.S. Geological Survey says (for now), climate change is variably advancing the onset of spring across the United States. But, at least this time, weird spring weather wont last in New York.

This was one of many obvious falsehoods in a speech brimming with platitudes but bereft of new ideas or policy details. By the end of Trumps address, he had touted the creation of a new government office called Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement  which appears to have little purpose beyond encouraging Americans to associate immigrants with crime  but had offered no new information on his plans for Obamacare repeal. One of the best speeches in that setting I have heard any president give, Fox News Chris Wallace said, shortly after Trump stepped down from the dais. And Wallace was not alone. There was broad consensus among the enemies of the American people that Trump had turned in a praiseworthy performance. In his first address to Congress, Trump wins high marks for his steady, muscular tone, declared the Washington Post. Was this the Trump that could win in 2020? a headline atop Politicos homepage asked. Even Racheal Maddow conceded the political efficacy of Trumps remarks, saying, This will be a very well-received speech. Her fellow left-wing pundit Van Jones went several steps further, offering laudatory praise for the substance of a section of the speech. One of Trumps first acts as commander-in-chief had been to order the raid of a compound in Yemen  an endeavor that (reportedly) generated no useful intelligence, while claiming the lives of many small children and a Navy SEAL named Ryan Owens. Earlier in the week, Trump had disclaimed responsibility for the raid, telling Fox News that it was his generals who had lost Ryan. His administration had previously argued that anyone who questioned the success of the raid did a disservice to Owenss memory  a claim that did not sit well with the SEALs bereaved father. But on Tuesday night, Trump repurposed his deadly blunder into a piece of uplifting political theater. As cameras fixed on Owenss weeping widow in the audience, the president assured her that her husbands mission had been a great success  and that Ryans legacy is etched into eternity. Jones was overcome. That was one of the most extraordinary moments you have ever seen in American politics, period, he effused on CNN. And he did something extraordinary. And for people who have been hoping that he would become unifying, hoping that he might find some way to become presidential, they should be happy with that moment  he did something tonight that you cannot take away from him. He became president of the United States. Its unclear why Jones believes it was extraordinary for a president to use the memory of a fallen soldier as a shield against criticism of his foreign-policy mistakes. But he wasnt the only member of the chattering classes to commend the utterly mundane. If youre taken aback by the presss enthusiasm for Trumps address, then you and the Trump administration see eye to eye (on one thing, at least). What, then, explains the warmth of the punditocracy? One answer is that the mainstream press does not like being the opposition party. The past year has provoked a crisis of faith in the church of both sides do it. But while the ideal of balance in political coverage has become ever more difficult to sustain philosophically, it remains a convenient value to uphold. Trumps frequent failures to respect the norms of liberal democracy  and/or common decency  have forced many news outlets into a stridently adversarial posture. But relentlessly negative coverage of the president undermines access to the administration, and risks alienating a large swath of potential readers and viewers. This leaves straight-news outlets ravenous for an excuse to highlight something positive about the president, thereby reaffirming their credibility as neutral umpires. And, to be fair, Trumps speech did offer some solid excuses to do just that. The president began his speech by calling for unity in the face of anti-Semitism and bigotry  and ended it without ever having mentioned fake news, Hillary Clinton, or Vladimir Putins more admirable qualities. The presidents address to Congress is supposed to be a largely empty, reassuring spectacle. Trump has conditioned the media to expect him to twist such events into theater of the grotesque. But on Tuesday night, he provided a (mostly) convincing facsimile of normality. And one that could very plausibly prove politically beneficial. This is a break in the pattern that Trump has established. Which makes it news. So, even if the media had no incentive to give the president a cookie, it would be difficult to convey the key takeaways from his speech without engaging in low-barism. And while some pundits and headline writers deployed baseless hyperbole, most of the coverage in mainstream print outlets highlighted the speechs lack of substance, while assessments of the speech in the op-ed sections of the New York Times and Washington Post were mostly critical. Which is to say: If the media has a low bar for Trump, he has a low bar for what constitutes laudatory media coverage. The president delayed the signing of a new executive order Wednesday so as not to interrupt the conversation about his speech. And on Wednesday morning, he signed onto Twitter for a kind of curtain call. Its worth noting that the media and Trump are, in one sense, unnatural enemies. The moguls candidacy and election were the two best things to happen to Americas beleaguered news business in a long, long time. And Trump owes nearly everything he has  in politics and in commerce  to the media. Where would the president be had tabloids, reality-show producers, and cable-news executives never decided that he was fascinating? And that fascination is wholly requited: Cable-news channels have never had a president more passionately invested in what they do. This comity between the president and the Fourth Estate is unlikely to last.

Ivanka was reportedly unhappy about Conways remarks, and the counselor to the president was also hit with a formal ethics complaint by a watchdog. The OGEs letter urged the White House to take disciplinary action against Conway, and noted that she seemed to have escaped any sort of punishment thus far. Writing to the OGE, Passantino explained that he spoke with Conway both before and after receiving the OGEs letter, and each time advised her that her comments about Ivankas products implicated the prohibition on using ones official position to endorse any product or service.

It is true that in a largely detail-free speech, Trump did mention some specific health-care policies he embraced, though most of them were conservative boilerplate prescriptions like tort reform, health savings accounts, and interstate insurance sales that actually do not divide Republicans. But for those parsing every presidential word for a clue about his imperial will on Obamacare, this passage was dynamite: This, we were told, meant Trump was siding with House Republican leaders against conservative opponents who feared a new system of tax credits for purchasing insurance (replacing Obamacares tax credits) would represent another entitlement, this time one the GOP would own. Trouble is, those self-same conservative opponents of leadership plans for Obamacare sat there and listened to the same speech and did not come away chastened. When House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy proudly interpreted Trumps words as endorsing his teams efforts, Representative Mark Sanford begged to differ: Senate conservatives were not moved, either. More than likely, it would only take three Republican senators to derail any Obamacare plan. Right-leaning health-care expert Philip Klein also noted that the refundability of tax credits  the ability of those too poor for income-tax liability to get federal subsidies in cash, making it welfare in the eyes of many conservatives  was not endorsed by Trump, giving conservatives hope the administration would ultimately side with them on the structure of any assistance in purchasing insurance. The dog that is not barking here, of course, is that even as congressional Republicans examine the presidents words as though he is a latter-day Oracle of Delphi, the normal channels for communicating an administrations policy preferences seem to be empty. Yes, HHS Secretary Tom Price is new at his job, but unless they have not yet given him a telephone or an email account, youd think hed be letting his former colleagues in Congress know what Trump wants in the way of an Obamacare repeal-and-replace bill directly, and every other minute. The fact that rebellious conservatives see no reason to stand down is an indication that Trumps real position on the many outstanding problems Republicans are having on this subject ranges somewhere on a scale that runs from Huh? to Check back later."}, {"date": "2017/03/01", "title": "Kim Jong-un Has 5 Security Officials Executed With Anti-Aircraft Guns", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/kim-jong-un-has-officials-executed-with-anti-aircraft-guns.html", "text": " As the world continues to gawk at the bizarre assassination of his brother Kim Jong-nam, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has quietly had five security officials blown to bits by anti-aircraft guns.

All five of the officials were mid-level deputies of Kim Won-hong, the former head of North Koreas notorious prison camps, who was fired in January. South Korean intelligence agents believe his firing was due to corruption and bad information passed along to Kim Jong-un, who was enraged by the screwup. And so, as is often the case when Kim Jong-un gets upset, he decided to kill some people in spectacular fashion.

You know the weirdness in question: It seems like lately, every time the nations focus is trained on the same event, whether its the NBA Finals or the election or the Super Bowl or now  the incident that sparked Gopniks article  the Best Picture screwup, something completely unbelievable happens. Nothing like this has remotely happened before has been the refrain over and over and over, he explains. The simulation hypothesis is less crazy than it sounds  perhaps no crazier than any coherent story about the origin of the universe. Academics like David Chalmers and Nick Bostrom have posited arguments that make the numbers work, at least if you squint a bit. Over a span of trillions of years, in a universe or universes of inconceivable size(s), maybe there are a lot of intelligent species, and maybe they tend to like simulating other universes (as Homo sapiens has already begun to do on a very modest level). If so, then any intelligent species that examines the odds carefully will come to the discomfiting conclusion that it  and its universe  is very likely simulated rather than the genuine article (whatever that means, given that its impossible for any species, even one that has created a universe simulator, to prove it is not itself part of a simulation  maybe the simulations go up and up and up and up). The oomph of this argument lies in the math, but naturally its thought-provoking to try to imagine what might constitute evidence that were in a simulation. To Gopnik, all the recent weirdness points in that direction, and Chalmers, he notes, also sees things this way. Heres how Gopnik lays out his argument: Theres something exciting about getting swept up in this feeling that we are tacking into uncharted waters, weirdness-wise, that theres no real precedent for the current state of affairs. But those bolded sentences are doing a lot of work. Indeed, part of whats going on here is that over the last few decades, the world has gotten so much less weird  in mostly good ways  that its now easier to highlight and harp upon what are, in the grand scheme of things, relatively minor weirdness flare-ups. When you look at recent history, its just very hard to come up with a case that our current smattering of unreal events is sturdier proof of a simulation thesis than all the 20th-century horrors Gopnik gestures at but doesnt name: two world wars and the Holocaust and the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings and starvation in the USSR and the Khmer Rouge and the Cold War and all the rest. Not that conflict or loss of life should ever be seen as normal, but this was consistently weird carnage and near carnage. A military superpower built a vast and horrifying machinery of death to rid Europe of a religious minority, and mostly succeeded. For decades, the two reigning superpowers pointed enough nukes at each other to turn the planet into an uninhabited glass marble several times over, and if not for several instances of coolness in impossibly tense situations, wed all be gone. The Khmer Rouge raised the bar on human atrocity in countless ways, but its crimes are so drowned out by all the other bloodshed from that century that most people dont know the first thing about it. In fact, if someone plopped a century-long timeline of human history on your table and asked you to circle all the evidence you could find that were living in a simulation, youd likely find the fewest instances in this, the first chunk of the 21st century. Thats not to say weird stuff doesnt still happen, and its definitely not to say some of that weirdness isnt inconceivably bloody  the Syrian civil war would be at home in the 20th century  but overall we deal with a lot less surreality than we did in the recent past. We pay more attention to the Patriots coming back from 283 in an impossibly short span of time because were less distracted by the U.S. trying to napalm its way out of an inconceivably stupid jungle quagmire. We gawk at the Oscar craziness and dwell on it because it stands out in a saner world than many of our parents and grandparents inhabited. Hell, its too early to say, but in the long run, barring an unforeseen catastrophe, maybe even Donald Trump  God or superintelligent alien simulators willing  will end up getting a mere footnote, rather than a chapter, in the Book of Weirdness humanity continues writing every moment of every day."}, {"date": "2017/03/01", "title": "Flint Residents Must Pay Full Price for Water They Cant Drink Without a Filter", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/flint-must-pay-full-price-for-undrinkable-water.html", "text": " As of Wednesday, residents of Flint, Michigan, will have to pay full price for their water, though they still cant drink it without a filter. Since the water crisis began in 2014 the state has put roughly $41 million toward offsetting local utility bills, giving Flint residents a 65 percent credit and businesses a 20 percent credit toward their water bills. The Washington Post reports that state officials are now ending that program because levels of lead in the citys water system no longer exceed federal limits. This is good news and the result of many partners on the local, county, state and federal levels working together to restore the water quality in the City of Flint, said Heidi Grether, director of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. The Flint water system is one of the most monitored systems in the country for lead and copper, and that commitment will remain to ensure residents continue to have access to clean water. While that may be a step in the right direction, residents are still advised not to drink unfiltered tap water, and the state will continue to provide filters. Its expected to take several years to replace the pipes that were damaged when untreated water was unintentionally run through the system in an attempt to cut costs. When theyre replacing a main or theyre replacing a pipe some of the lead and other contaminants can become dislodged and get into the main, and that can affect water for your neighbors down the street, on the next block, said Anna Keaton, Governor Rick Snyders press secretary. Thats why out of an abundance of caution we are continuing to provide filters, but that construction is expected to go on for two to three years. Many residents dont trust reports that Flints filtered tap water is safe, and are still relying on bottled water. On Tuesday night, Congressman Dan Kildee, who represents Flint, and Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, who helped bring the water contamination to light, said they were disappointed that President Trump did not mention the ongoing crisis in Flint in his address to Congress, and reminded him that he promised the problem would be fixed quickly and effectively if he were elected. Dr. Hanna-Attisha attended the speech as Kildees guest. She immigrated to the U.S. from Iraq as a young child, and the congressman said he hoped her presence would highlight both Flints plight and the many important contributions immigrants make to our nation. In their statement, Kildee and Hanna-Attisha also criticized the president for proposing cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency. If we have learned anything from the Flint water crisis, it is that we should be strengthening  not weakening  protections to ensure clean drinking water, they said. Now is not the time to be cutting support for the important work federal agencies are doing to protect our environment, promote public health and support our children."}, {"date": "2017/03/01", "title": "New Travel Ban Reportedly Delayed So Trump Can Bask in Good Press From Speech", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/travel-ban-delayed-due-to-trumps-good-press-report.html", "text": " In his speech to Congress on Tuesday night, President Trump defended his travel ban, and said his administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe  and to keep out those who would do us harm. The new executive order was expected on Wednesday, but now it wont be issued until the end of the week. When the initial travel ban was blocked by the court, Trump accused the judge of putting the country in peril and claimed many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. Clearly, the president believes theres an urgent need for a new travel ban  but apparently its not as urgent as his need for good press. Late on Tuesday night, multiple outlets reported that the White House decided to hold off on issuing the new executive order after seeing the positive reviews for Trumps impersonation of a competent president. A senior administration official told CNN that they dont want to undercut coverage of the presidents speech. We want the (executive order) to have its own moment, the official said. No other reasons were offered for the delay, but one factor may be a Department of Homeland Security report that contradicted the White House, saying citizenship in one of the seven Muslim-majority countries included in the ban is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of potential terrorist activity. The White House dismissed that report, and it appears Iraq is the only country that may be removed from the list. According to the AP, the Pentagon and State Department pushed to omit Iraq due to the countrys role in fighting ISIS. The Wall Street Journal reports that the new executive order will be toned down in a number of other ways. Its expected to only apply to future visa applicants from the seven (or six) countries, not legal permanent residents or current visa holders. The ban on refugees will likely be revised as well, dropping the provision giving preference to religious minorities, and treating Syrian refugees like those from other countries. The new executive order is being crafted to avoid violating constitutional protections against religious discrimination, and, as Reuters notes, excluding legal permanent residents may make it harder for the orders opponents to show they have standing in U.S. courts. However, several legal experts predict the revised order will spark a new batch of legal challenges, whenever its actually issued. Exempting lawful permanent residents and current visa holders will not cure the core legal problem  that the ban was motivated by religious discrimination, as evidenced by the presidents repeated statements calling for a Muslim ban, ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt told CNN. That discriminatory taint cannot be removed simply by eliminating a few words or clever tinkering by lawyers."}, {"date": "2017/03/01", "title": "Beshear Responds to a Speech Trump Chose Not to Give", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/beshear-responds-to-a-speech-trump-chose-not-to-give.html", "text": " Former Kentucky governor Steve Beshear had the traditionally difficult task of trying to anticipate and respond to a speech he had not yet heard. It was all the more difficult because Donald Trumps middle name is Unpredictable. He was chosen for this gig because the most urgent thing going on in Congress before and after Trumps speech was the GOP struggle to repeal and replace Obamacare. Kentucky under Beshears leadership had a notably successful Obamacare implementation, so he was in a position to provide an upbeat Democratic message no matter what Trump did. But the effectiveness of Beshears response was undermined by a Trump speech that was not dark and divisive, and did not address in any kind of detail the issues the Kentuckian raised, including Obamacare. The president stayed at 30,000 feet on most policy issues, and provided no more than a few minutes on health care, and even less on two other topics Beshear discussed: the intelligence community and financial regulation. Beshear did find some traction on immigration policy, where he was responding not only to Trumps speech, but to his executive actions: But it is not clear anyone will listen to Beshears rebuke with the mainstream media excitedly pursuing Trumps advanced hint that someday, somehow, he might promote comprehensive immigration reform. All in all, Besmear did himself and his party no harm, and its doubtful the path not taken by Democrats, who might have offered a fiery rebuke to the Trump of the past and the future, would have worked any better.

Today: President Trumps first address to a joint session of Congress. A new presidents first address to a joint session of Congress is typically a chance to show how campaign promises will become a policy agenda, something thats been notoriously tricky for the Trump administration so far. Did the speech leave things any clearer?Not at all. It was the same old Trump swill served up in perfumed linguistic packaging and presented in a far fancier setting in an effort to retool his image after more than a month of bombast, chaos, and dysfunction in his White House. The litany of promises he recited are the same ones hes made from the get-go  the repeal and replacement of Obamacare with better health care for everyone, a massive retooling of Americas infrastructure, an end to terrorism and the drug epidemic, tax cuts for everyone, a renaissance in coal mining, not to mention the Great Wall  with no explanation of how he will achieve any of them, what they will cost, who will pay, and whats in any fine print (or even medium print). Endlessly regurgitating your campaign promises does not turn them into achievements. And they are unlikely to be realized anytime soon given that Trump knows nothing about governance and believes that basically you can run the country by tweeting, holding rallies, issuing executive orders, and pretending that the other two branches of government dont exist. Nonetheless, there were already signs that the press would be grading on a very high curve. An ABC News correspondent, Jonathan Karl, tweeted early on that we were watching Trump at his most presidential. Thats true. Trump wasnt yelling and was rarely improvising, choosing instead to read a written speech that told us it was unifying and poetic, in case we didnt get it: A message of unity and strength  deeply delivered from my heart. (If it were in fact deeply delivered from his heart, he wouldnt have to provide his own rave review of his performance.) I think Glenn Thrush of the Times got it exactly right when he tweeted: For any other president this would be a boring, laundry list speech. For Trump  amazing, responsible, detailed, united, presidential. Brian Williams of MSNBC went even further, noting the soaring rhetoric at the end. His colleague Joe Scarborough could be found on the floor of the House applauding Trump before he even started to speak. After all, Trump actually began by mentioning Black History Month, decrying anti-Semitism, and referring briefly and obliquely to last weekends murder of Indian immigrants in Kansas City. Theres unity for you. And you want specifics? Well, some CEOs told him that they will create tens of thousands of new jobs. You can take that to the bank, surely. Best of all, our president promised us that everythings that broken can be fixed. Problem(s) solved. I am sure Trumps base loved it, but for other viewers most of it will disappear from memory fast, perhaps even as you are reading this  with a single exception. Trump took one big risk in this speech, which was to politicize the death of the U.S. Navy SEAL William Ryan Owens, who was killed in last months botched Yemen raid, by showcasing his widow, Carryn, understandably in tears as she watched from her seat in the balcony. Owenss father has called the raid a stupid mission. It has been reported to be a failure that also killed a score or so of civilians, including young children, while yielding no significant intelligence, according to an NBC News scoop this week. But clearly Trump feels that reports of the missions failure are fake news. He doubled down on his previous claims that it was a highly successful raid and said that his secretary of Defense, James Mattis, had tonight confirmed that claim. Official and further journalistic investigations will tell us whether Trump is telling the truth or not, and whether Mattiss sterling reputation for probity has now been sullied. In any case, theres no way of proving Trumps related claim, his jocular, self-congratulatory assertion that his salute to Ryans heroism broke a record for applause. For sheer tastelessness, however, it is in a class by itself."}, {"date": "2017/03/01", "title": "Trump Treats Congress to Convincing Impersonation of a Competent President", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-just-did-an-impersonation-of-a-competent-president.html", "text": " Donald Trump could be a much more popular president than he is. The moguls first month in office was a marathon of unforced errors  most of which could have been averted by the observation of a few best practices:(1) Dont let right-wing bloggers write your executive orders.(2) Avoid telling demonstrable lies. (3) Dont hesitate to condemn hate crimes. (4) Accept that you are worthy of love, even if your electoral margin and inaugural crowd size were run-of-the-mill. (5) Never tweet. When the president isnt running afoul of these rules, he has a few things going for him. The man is a talented self-promoter. And when you sand off the edges of his right-wing populism, it has the potential for majority appeal: His narrative acknowledges the economic insecurity of Americas working families and offers reassuringly simplistic answers for how broad-based prosperity can be restored. On Tuesday night, Trump offered an impersonation of the more popular president he could, theoretically, become. Trump began his speech by calling for unity in the face of anti-Semitism and bigotry. And he ended it without ever having mentioned the fake news media, Hillary Clinton, or Vladimir Putins more admirable qualities. Instead, Trump laid out an agenda that was vague enough to be palatable to many Americans who dont own MAGA hats. The president called for tax relief for the middle class, a level playing field for American companies and workers, a merit-based immigration system, a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure, an Obamacare replacement that provides better health care, school choice, fewer murders, paid family leave, affordable child care; and clean air and clear water. If Trump were capable of exercising message disciple  and the congressional GOP were united around a detailed version of the agenda he described  this could be the beginning of a successful presidency. The trouble for Trump, and his party, is that neither of those things are true. Congressional Republicans cant find consensus on the issues that were supposed to bind the party together (repealing Obamacare and cutting corporate taxes), let alone on Trumps wholly unsolicited proposals for infrastructure spending and child-care subsidies. And while Trumps resolute vagueness may earn him warm reviews, it did nothing to advance his legislative agenda. The GOP needs Trump to get behind a specific Obamacare proposal  and use his bully pulpit to browbeat dissenting Republicans into submission. Instead, he merely reiterated his commitment to keeping the parts of Obamacare that people like  while scrapping the ones that they dont (which are mostly necessary to retain the former). On tax reform, the president proved even more useless. Right now, the GOPs tax plan is faltering amid controversy over the border-adjustment tax  a measure that would lower taxes on American exporters but (arguably) raise them on importers. In his speech, Trump articulated one rationale for this tax: But he never actually named border-adjustment  or any other specific measure  to address this problem. In fact, after several paragraphs lamenting the inequities of global trade, this was the closest thing Trump offered to policy proposal: Trump turned in a decent performance Tuesday night. But the vacuousness of his vision, the pathologies of his personality, and the ideological divisions within the GOP will prevent him from ever becoming the kind of president he just played on TV."}, {"date": "2017/03/01", "title": "Republicans Were Hoping for More Information From Trump.

He followed the script, and threw in some unexpected rhetorical flourishes, like a shout-out to civil rights and outrage about anti-Semitic incidents at the very beginning. But if one of its main functions was to give confused congressional Republicans some clear direction on the big agenda items that are about to be fulfilled or squandered, it was a total washout. Republicans are practically at each others throats over how to repeal and replace Obamacare  the partys top policy priority. Trump has in the past complicated this effort by endorsing a quick replacement plan  on which Republicans are far from agreement  and by insisting the new plan cover as many people as the system being demolished. He did almost nothing tonight address the quandaries his fellow Republicans face on health-care policy, other than a brief statement of support for the idea of tax credits to help pay for insurance, presumably a rebuke to conservatives who openly worried such credits would represent a new entitlement. What did Trump want Congress to do about Medicaid, which Obamacare optionally expanded, splitting Republican governors over that key safety net programs function and future? [W]e should give our great State Governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out. Thats about as vague as you can get. And there was nothing at all about how to pay for whatever comes next after Obamacare. Speaking of taxes: Tax cuts are right behind Obamacare on the congressional GOPs urgent action list. There are big differences of opinion among Republicans about the size and structure of tax cuts, and in particular how to deal with the new administrations demands that the tax code discriminate against companies that import goods and export jobs. In tonights speech, Trump devoted more time to the feelings of Harley-Davidsons executives about other countries tax codes than to any exposition on what the U.S. tax code should look like. And indeed, his only real mention of taxes was as an intro to an equally vague disquisition on the need for fair as well as free trade  a theme that has provided leaden ballast to thousands of political speeches for many decades. The third big topic on which Republicans needed his guidance was the budget, and if they expected any specificity on that crucial priority, they were bitterly disappointed. Trump repeated his commitment to a big defense-spending increase, and did display an understanding that providing that would mean getting rid of the spending cap agreement under which defense spending would be sequestered if budget targets were missed. As to how those caps would be cast aside  something that in the normal course of events would require 60 Senate votes and a lot of Democratic support  we heard nada. And there was also nothing about the rest of the budget, including the fraught subject of which entitlement programs would be on and off the table. The huge gaps of information in Trumps speech are not just a matter of a refusal to give guidance to congressional Republicans who are all over the map on Obamacare and taxes and the budget, and cannot spare more than a few dissenting votes. He also failed to give Americans the details that separate bogus and magical promises from an actual, realizable agenda. Yes, it would be nice if Congress could fix health care and reform the tax code and set budget priorities without making tough choices. But that is simply not possible. And for all the rave reviews Trump received for delivering an upbeat message tonight, it was mainly upbeat because it dodged all the real questions."}, {"date": "2017/03/01", "title": "Trump Rebuts Criticism of Yemen Raid in Address to Congress", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-rebuts-criticism-of-yemen-raid-in-address-to-congress.html", "text": " The most moving moment of President Trumps first address to a joint session of Congress was when he recognized Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy special operator, Senior Chief William Ryan Owens, the Navy SEAL who died during last months counterterrorism raid in Yemen. Ryan died as he lived: a warrior, and a hero  battling against terrorism and securing our nation, Trump said. Then he quoted Secretary of Defense James Mattis: The entire chamber broke into applause, giving a tearful Carryn Owens, who was seated next to Ivanka Trump, a standing ovation. And Ryan is looking down right now and I think hes very happy because he broke a record, Trump ad-libbed, apparently suggesting that Owens would be pleased at the length of his standing ovation. In addition to recognizing an American hero, Trumps comments served the secondary purpose of rebutting criticism of the Yemen raid. Soon after the mission, reports emerged that just about everything went wrong. While Owens was the only U.S. service member who lost his life, six others were wounded. Yemenis were reportedly incensed by photos of children killed in the 50-minute firefight. After reports emerged that Trump had approved the raid over a dinner with his top advisers, some anonymous military sources suggested that the president shouldnt have given the go-ahead. Officials told NBC News on Monday that contrary to claims made by the White House and the Pentagon, the mission did not produce any significant intelligence, which is why Trump noted that Mattis had reconfirmed the missions success. But perhaps the most significant criticism of the raid came over the weekend, when Ryan Owenss father revealed that he refused to meet with Trump when he visited Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to witness the return of the remains. Why at this time did there have to be this stupid mission when it wasnt even barely a week into his administration? Why? For two years prior, there were no boots on the ground in Yemen  everything was missiles and drones  because there was not a target worth one American life. Now, all of a sudden we had to make this grand display? Bill Owens said. Referencing White House Press Secretary Sean Spicers claim that anyone who criticizes the raid does a disservice to the life of Chief Owens, Bill Owens added, Dont hide behind my sons death to prevent an investigation. The Trump administration noted that the Pentagon is already conducting a routine review of the matter.

Repeatedly, Trump implored Democrats to join together to pass his agenda. (On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the American people.) It takes some slight familiarity with the details to recognize how hollow his offer is, and how unlikely Democrats are to take it up. Trump promised massive tax relief for the middle class. In fact, his tax proposal overwhelmingly benefits the rich, and the plan being designed by his allies in Congress benefits the rich exclusively. He proposed subsidies for private, charter, magnet, [or] religious schools. There is Democratic support for public school choice, and evidence to support its effectiveness, but the private school vouchers Trump insists on subsidizing are a dismal failure. Theres no bipartisan support for an ideological crusade to divert resources to sectarian institutions. Trump proposed a plan to make child care accessible, but that plan is a giveaway to the rich and does not help families that need help the most. He dismissed Obamacare as a disaster, while asking Democrats to help fix it. If he believes a law that has given 20 million Americans access to medical care, come in well under budget, and seen the lowest levels of medical inflation on record is a disaster  as opposed to a law that needs small improvements  there is no common basis from which to proceed. And Trumps suggested principles for replacement offer too little detail for any evaluation. His promise to invest in clean air and water is a sick joke, given his decision to hand environmental enforcement over to polluters and to slash the budget for regulation. Trump repeatedly invoked the possibilities of a massive infrastructure boom. But, in a rare outbreak of specificity, he made clear his proposal would do no such thing. Trump urged Congress to pass legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the United States  financed through both public and private capital. That means, rather than direct spending, he remains wedded to a scheme of tax breaks for builders, which would merely confer windfall benefits on existing firms and yield few new projects, and those that are built would have little public utility. On the whole, Trumps agenda shows a president who has not departed from the plutocratic agenda that has dominated his party for a quarter-century, but only added grotesque, cruel, racist, and deeply stupid selling points. He has nothing to offer a party not enamored of the opportunity to carry out a massive and historic upward redistribution of wealth."}, {"date": "2017/02/28", "title": "Publishers Are Willing to Pay a Lot of Money for the Obamas Memoirs", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/publishers-will-pay-a-lot-of-money-for-obamas-memoirs.html", "text": " The Obamas memoirs have reportedly sparked a record-setting $60 million bidding war.

To Spicer, this was no honest mistake. It was yet another example of a reckless media out of control.

Spicer then accused Thrush of making excuses for himself. They got it wrong and never asked, Spicer said to me, at 9:44 p.m. They and others are quick to judge others but hold themselves to a very difficult set of standards. So, I asked. Where was he born? After both Politico and Mashable disclosed personal information I see no need on further sharing of my information, he said at 11:05 p.m., apparently referring in the latter case to a story about web domain names Spicer had registered and which still showed up in his WHOIS listing. (Its unclear which Politico story he meant.) In any presidential administration, the clich that there are no victims, only volunteers, is true. Spicer signed up for this very public job, and he is paid by your taxes. His basic biographical details, then, are a matter of legitimate public curiosity. But, when I noted this, Spicer only grew more frustrated. Are you serious? He asked. Btw you continue to overlook the main issue: the nyt was wrong. They never asked the question in the first place. That was the last I heard from him on the question. Spicer, it would seem, had had enough. The nastiest and most public of Spicers disputes with media in recent days involved a Politico story by Alex Isenstadt and Annie Karni. The piece reported that Spicer called an emergency meeting with his communications staff to crack down on leaks, going as far as demanding to search their personal cell phones. In that story, Spicer also reportedly cited encrypted messaging apps like Signal and Confide as being off limits, saying that using them would place administration staff in violation of the Presidential Records Act. But, when I glanced through my contacts on Confide, there was Spicers name, staring out at me from a sea of other political operatives (the app shows users which contacts from their phone book have also downloaded it). Things got much weirder, though. In an apparent effort to dissuade Isenstadt from publishing the story  or to punish him for doing so  Spicer made a threat. During a call with the journalist, he accused Isenstadt of laughing at the recent death of Navy SEAL Ryan Owens (Isenstadt had heard that Spicer made an underling cry and was following up on that; Spicer countered that the person in question was emotional about Ryans death). Then, in an email, Spicer told Isenstadt he would be sure to get that out. Not long after Politico ran the story about the cell-phone checks, the Washington Examiner published a story with the headline, Claim: Reporter laughs at Trump aides emotion over SEAL death. The report is sourced to one informed official. Not everyone agrees that Spicer is spiraling. A source close to the press secretary who didnt want to be named told me that senior administration officials are increasingly very happy with his job performance. This source said that Spicers recent press briefings had been noticeably calmer than in the earliest days of the administration, and that calmness should be interpreted as proof that he is firmly in control of his actions. Spicer stopped replying to me about his birthplace at 7:54 a.m. on Sunday  not even answering a question about whether he was born in Kenya. Later that day, a Wikipedia user by the name Trumpetrep, citing a birth announcement in the Newport Daily News, took the liberty of updating Spicers page to state that he was born on September 23, 1971, at North Shore Hospital in Manhasset, Long Island. Its pretty convincing evidence  if you trust whats printed in newspapers."}, {"date": "2017/02/28", "title": "Trump Still Deciding Whether to Abandon Main Policy Stance Tonight", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-deciding-whether-to-abandon-main-policy-stance-tonight.html", "text": " Donald Trump suggested today to CNN that immigration policy might need a softening on both sides.

This is, however, the first time a president has publicly contemplated reversing his central campaign pledge on the day of his first major speech to Congress. What is so breathtaking is not the reversal but the fact that the reversal is being contemplated, without any certainty. With hours to go before the speech, Trump may or may not throw his most famous position overboard. It could be good for everyone, Trump/senior administration official tells CNN.

This fatalism was unjustified but not entirely baseless. Ellison had declared his bid shortly after the 2016 election and quickly garnered the support of prominent Democrats, both Establishment and progressive. For some left-wing activists, the partys initial embrace of the Minnesota congressman  who had supported Bernie Sanders in 2016 and a Robin Hood tax in the House  had symbolic weight. It suggested that the Democrats were interested in the energy and vision that the left hoped to bring to the party. Tom Perezs entry suggested the opposite. Shortly after the former Labor Secretary declared his candidacy, the New York Times reported that the Obama White House was anxious to derail Ellisons bid: So, in the eyes of some Sandernistas, the DNC race became a referendum on whether the Democratic Party sees them as a force to be nurtured or one to be stymied. And Perezs victory signaled the latter. But pessimistic leftists who take this dour view should remember what a wise Italian political consultant once said: It is better to be feared than loved. Do some in the Democratic Establishment have a distaste for Bernie Sanders and the social democratic vision he espouses? Yes. But does that Establishment feel compelled to appease the left  in ways both substantive and symbolic  to a degree thats unprecedented in the partys modern history? Without question. The last DNC chair was a vocal opponent of medical marijuana  and a staunch defender of the payday-loan industry. Chuck Schumers preferred candidate in the race to succeed her was a black, Muslim populist who wants to decriminalize weed and tax Wall Street speculation. The Establishment stooge who ran against him was a Labor Secretary who extended employment protections to home health-care workers, expanded access to overtime pay, and passed a rule preventing retirement advisers from fleecing their clients. And, despite the (alleged) support of the partys popular ex-president, Perez barely fended off Ellisons challenge. The DNC race was a testament to the Democratic lefts vitality, not its impudence. That vitality was affirmed again, on Tuesday, when Cory Booker joined Bernie Sanders in backing a bill to allow American consumers to reimport cheaper drugs from Canada. Last month, Sanders introduced an amendment to a budget resolution that would have instructed the Senate to draft legislation allowing for the reimportation of cheaper pharmaceuticals from our neighbor to the north. The amendment was largely symbolic  its passage would not have bound the Senate to lift the ban on reimportation. Nonetheless, 13 Democratic senators, including Booker, voted against it, and found themselves instantly branded as corporate shills  whod rather protect drug-industry profits than the indigent sick  by every principled leftist with a Twitter account. Sanders, himself, accused his colleagues of lacking guts, and then predicted in the coming weeks and months youre going to see many of them develop the courage to stand up to pharma. On Tuesday, Booker had his come to Bernie moment. After the January vote, the New Jersey senator claimed that he had only opposed the measure because it had lacked language ensuring safety standards. This rationale wasnt terribly convincing  especially considering how large the pharmaceutical industry looms in the Garden State (and on Bookers OpenSecrets page). But now, Booker has put his co-sponsorship where his mouth is, offering his support for Sanderss latest attempt to expand free trade in pharmaceuticals. (The new bill includes provisions preventing the Canadians from selling us poison.) Of course, drug reimportation is a long way away from single-payer health care (which is a long way away from collective ownership of the means of production). And there are perfectly sound reasons for leftists to do much of their organizing outside the Democratic Party. Still, Bookers support for Sanderss bill shows how far his party has come since the heyday of the DLC. Centrist Democrats once tried to distance themselves from the left ahead of their presidential runs. Now, they do the opposite. Come 2020, the lefts two least-favorite Democratic presidential candidates may well be a senator who supports ending the War on Drugs; expanding access to Medicare; and taxing carbon emissions  and a governor who effectively banned fracking in his state; raised the minimum wage to $15; established a system of paid family leave; and pushed for free public college for working-class kids. This isnt to say that leftists should stop worrying and learn to love Andrew Cuomo. But they should appreciate the fact that hes learned to fear them."}, {"date": "2017/02/28", "title": "Retired Generals to Congress: Please Dont Cut International Spending", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/generals-to-congress-please-dont-cut-foreign-spending.html", "text": " President Donald Trump is expected to propose close to a $54 billion increase in defense spending, a 10 percent hike that would be offset by slashing other programs.

First, he is crudely ethno-nationalist, which drives him to reject free trade and immigration reform, and rather than gesturing toward reconciliation with minorities, uses them as foils to gin up white racial paranoia. Second, he is personally ignorant and undisciplined in a manner that sets him apart not only from traditional Republicans but most human adults, and renders any position of his confusing and protean. Yet Trump is attracting a great deal of attention and criticism for a third dimension of allegedly idiosyncratic behavior that is in fact perfectly orthodox: his economic-policy agenda. That Trump is mostly proposing classic Republican fiscal policy is not the sense you may have gotten from coverage of his forthcoming budget and quasiState of the Union address. Trump, reports the New York Times, has set up a battle for control of Republican Party ideology with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who for years has staked his policy-making reputation on the argument that taming the budget deficit without tax increases would require that Congress change, and cut, the programs that swallow the bulk of the governments spending  Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Traditional conservative sources like Representative Tom Cole (the numbers dont add up) and National Review (Trumps Unrealistic Budget) have lambasted his fiscal incoherence. What is the substance of the supposed schism between Trump and the regular GOP? The Times depicts the president and the House Speaker as split over whether to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. But, while Ryan has made it known that he would like to cut Social Security (a position that has won him immense inside-the-Beltway Establishment credibility), he has not persuaded his party to go along. The Better Way plan crafted by Ryan and endorsed by House Republicans makes no mention of Social Security at all. It does propose privatizing Medicare, but only for workers who are not retired or are near retirement  which means, despite its long-term significance, it has no impact on the budget over the next decade. And both Trump and Ryan are planning deep cuts to Medicaid. The similarities continue. Both favor increases in defense spending and dramatically weaker enforcement of labor, environmental, and financial regulation. Both favor deep cuts to anti-poverty spending. Trump is more enthusiastic than the regular GOP about infrastructure spending, but he has decided to postpone that issue until next year and use it as an election messaging vehicle rather than a real legislative priority. Most important, both agree that large, upper-income tax cuts are the partys highest priority. Trump has even endorsed Ryans legislative strategy of sequencing Obamacare repeal first in order to grease the skids for bigger tax cuts. (Statutorily and for budget purposes, as you know, we have to do health care before we do the tax cut, he said this week.) It is true, as conservatives say, that Trumps budget numbers do not really add up. But he is relying on the same voodoo economics assumptions that are de rigeur in his party. The money is going to come from a revved-up economy, Trump said on Fox & Friends. I mean, you look at the kind of numbers were doing, we were probably GDP of a little more than 1 percent. And if I can get that up to 3, maybe more, we have a whole different ballgame. Remember that ultra-Establishment Republican Jeb Bush promised tax cuts and deregulation would produce 4 percent growth, so Trumps 3 percent growth promise is actually moderate and realistic by Republican fiscal standards. The illusion that Trump has radically altered his partys agenda is convenient for all sides. Trump ran a wildly unconventional race, and won several blue states in part by presenting himself as an economic populist. He is surrounded by a handful of advisers who fashion themselves strategic geniuses on a world-historic scale, not just hacks attached to the president whos going to sign whatever Paul Ryan puts in front of him. They have every personal and institutional incentive to play up their ideological novelty. The infamous Steves Bannon and Miller have not really innovated Republican policy in any major field. They have taken sides with a long-standing minority right-wing faction in Congress that opposes free trade, viscerally hates immigration, and longs to use terrorism and crime as racial edge issues. The politicians who pioneered those Trump-y ideas in Congress, like Michele Bachmann and Jeff Sessions  Millers former bosses  also endorsed standard-issue Republicanomics. At CPAC, Steve Bannon grandly promised to set about deconstructing the administrative state. But this is just a pretentious way of saying he wants to cut regulation and bureaucracy, which is a goal of every Republican leader since Reagan. The only twist is that the guy saying it wears black shirts and no tie. Trumpism is mainly a post hoc attempt to build an intellectual edifice around a race-baiting demagogue. Since it did not spring from any serious analysis, it has mostly grabbed onto ideas that were already lying around the conservative movement. Traditional Republicans likewise see the value in playing up the presidents uniqueness. While Republicans in Congress stand with Trump because they want him to sign their bills, and they fear crossing their Trump-loving constituents, they are aware that the political formula he used is unstable and risky. If he collapses  hopefully, from their perspective, after signing as much of their agenda as possible  they want to rescue their ideas from the fallout. Just as conservatives fulsomely embraced George W. Bush during the first three-quarters of his presidency, and then swiftly disowned him after his collapse, they may need to blame any Trump failure on his un-conservative traits. An axiom of conservative movement thought, coined by Rick Perlstein, holds that conservatism never fails, it is only failed. Republican domestic policy has collapsed time and again over the last quarter-century: under George H.W. Bush, Newts Republican revolution, and Dubya. Conservatives have gained control over the party, but never figured out a way to reconcile the gap between their preference for low taxes on the rich and low social-insurance spending and a public that demands the opposite. The tensions are evident again already: Obamacare repeal and tax cuts are both floundering because the party cant agree on allocating the middle-class sacrifices (throwing people off their insurance, taxing employer-provided health-care plans, a border-adjustment fee) required to make the numbers add up. Trumps very real indecisiveness and ignorance of the policy substance has made it much harder for Congress to unify. But the main reason these policies are floundering is their inherent unpopularity. Trump would almost surely sign whatever tax cuts and repeal legislation Congress sends him. They arent writing the laws because no version of these policies can be written without exposing Congress to high levels of blowback. Parties are large herds of people and tend to change very slowly. A smart, strategic politician with a keen policy vision might be able to harness a populist campaign to take control of a party and steer it in a sharply new direction. That sort of transformative feat is well beyond the capabilities of a lazy, television-addled huckster like Trump."}, {"date": "2017/02/28", "title": "Every Terrifying Thing That Donald Trump Did This Week", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/every-terrifying-thing-that-donald-trump-has-done.html", "text": " Its been a little over a month since Donald Trump became commander-in-chief. But for the presidents detractors, its felt like centuries  long medieval centuries chock-full of plague, illiteracy, and barbarians running roughshod through the ruins of the old republic. But we arent actually living in the dark ages (yet). So we might as well shed some light on what the barbarians have been up to. Trump has given progressives so many causes for fear and outrage, it can be difficult  both practically and psychologically  to keep on top of them all as they happen. To help you stay informed despite this challenge, Daily Intelligencer will provide regular inventories of Trumps assaults on civic norms, common decency, and/or liberal democracy. Here is a rundown of everything the president has done on that front in the period between February 10 (the date of our last edition of Terrifying Things) and February 26, arranged in rough order of each affronts apparent significance and severity. Prior editions can be found below. Declared the mainstream media the enemy of the American people. Trump and his administration have been waging a war on objective reality  and those tasked with describing it  from the moment he was sworn in. In his first appearance as White House press secretary, Sean Spicer demanded that reporters believe the presidents estimate of the size of his inaugural crowd over their own lying eyes. Trumps tumultuous (and not terribly productive) first month only widened the chasm between the presidents grandiose self-conception and what he sees reflected back at him in the mirror of the mainstream press. And this gap has produced evermore extreme attempts to nullify the Fourth Estate. In late January, chief White House strategist Steve Bannon branded the mainstream media the opposition party, and suggested that it keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while. Bannons remarks were widely described seen as outrageous; at a subsequent White House press briefing, Spicer distanced the administration from Bannons sentiments, saying, The press plays a very healthy role in democracy, no question about it. But last week, the president decried the media in terms far more inflammatory than even the former Breitbart mastermind had mustered. Trump did not have second thoughts about describing several of Americas leading journalistic institutions as enemies of its people. Nor did he subsequently evince concern for whether his rhetoric would inspire some Second Amendment people to defend the American people against its enemies through extralegal means. Instead, he reiterated his charge one week later, at the Conservative Political Action Conference. A few days ago I called the fake news the enemy of the people. And they are. They are the enemy of the people, Trump said. Because they have no sources, they just make em up when there are none  Im against the people that make up stories and make up sources. Previously, the president had criticized the press for printing illegal leaks from anonymous government officials and suggested that those officials have often shared false information. But hed never before claimed that major newspapers were fabricating sources out of whole cloth and presenting works of fictions as reportage. Still, Trump insisted that he had no problem with the real media. Im not against the media. Im not against the press, Trump said. I am only against the fake-news media or press. He then lambasted the fake news media for failing to appreciate this nuance. Fake, the president said. Fake. They have to leave that word. On Friday afternoon, the White House appeared to put the presidents distinction into practice: When reporters from the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, Politico, CNN, and other major mainstream outlets showed up for a scheduled, off-camera briefing from Sean Spicer, they were denied entry to the White House press secretarys office. Breitbart News, the Washington Times, and One America News Network were waved in. Spicer also welcomed some mainstream outlets, including erstwhile enemies of the people ABC and CBS. Reporters from Time magazine and the Associated Press were allowed in, but chose to boycott the briefing in protest of the other outlets exclusion. Nothing like this has ever happened at the White House in our long history of covering multiple administrations of different parties, Dean Baquet, the executive editor of the New York Times, said in a statement. We strongly protest the exclusion of The New York Times and the other news organizations. Free media access to a transparent government is obviously of crucial national interest. Held a nuclear strategy session in the public dining room of his Florida resort. Instead of hosting the Japanese prime minister at the White House, Trump opted to fly Shinzo Abe down to the private resort he owns in Palm Beach, Florida. This choice of venue cost American taxpayers millions in additional travel-and-security expenses. But it also allowed the president to directly profit off the diplomatic meeting, while increasing the perks of being a member of his club. Now, Mar-a-Lago members dont merely have access to golf, a private beach, and a network of fellow plutocrats  they also get seats in the presidents open-air Situation Room. Per CNN: The White House later claimed that Trump and Abe did not engage in detailed security discussions in Mar-a-Lagos dining room. But Trump indisputably took a break from discussing the nuclear crisis to reward one of his longtime members with a wedding-night visit from himself and the leader of Japan. Trump also allowed one of his guests to post a picture to Facebook of the man tasked with carrying Americas nuclear football. Trumps weekend visits to Mar-a-Lago cost American taxpayers more than $10 million in his first month in office, according to the Washington Post. Allowed one of his senior advisers to complain about CNNs political coverage to the networks parent company  which has a proposed merger pending before the government. The fact that the American president has displayed a fondness for authoritarianism  and an indifference to ethical norms  is concerning for a whole host of reasons. One is that these qualities raise the possibility that Trump might use the powers of his office to coerce private industry into doing his administrations bidding. Shortly after the moguls victory, Voxs Matt Yglesias treated this subject at length in an essay titled, We have 100 days to stop Donald Trump from systemically corrupting our institutions. In that piece, Yglesias argues that America has long been prey to venal corruption, which consists of rich people buying favors through campaign contributions. The U.S. is not, however, a systematically corrupt nation  one in which political favor becomes the primary driver of economic success. To explain how Trump might begin systemically corrupting American institutions, Yglesias writes the following: Earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal reported that senior White House adviser (and Trump son-in-law) Jared Kushner complained to Gary Ginsberg, executive vice president of corporate marketing and communications at CNNs parent Time Warner, about what Mr. Kushner feels is unfair coverage slanted against the president. Allowed his administration to ask the FBI to leak favorable information, in violation of rules protecting the Justice Departments independence. Earlier this month, anonymous U.S. officials told the New York Times that Trump campaign aides contacted Russian intelligence operatives, multiple times, during the 2016 race. The day after the Times reported on the Trump campaigns Russia contacts, FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus had a conversation. Which one of these men brought up the Times story is unclear  according to the White House, McCabe told Priebus that the papers report was overblown. However the subject came up, Priebus eventually asked McCabe to tell the press that the Times story was baloney  or, at least, have that information leaked, anonymously. Even if the White Houses story is true  and the Times story is false  this request was problematic for at least two reasons. For one, Justice Department rules forbid the White House from discussing the details of ongoing investigations with the FBI  let alone investigations into the president himself  unless those details are vital to the presidents duties. For another, the FBI is not supposed to publicly comment on ongoing investigations. Hours after his administration admitted that it had asked the FBI to leak classified information, the president condemned the FBI for leaking information. Declined to publicly condemn the shooting of two India-born engineers by a man who (allegedly) said get out of my country, as he fired. Declared himself the least racist person  then asked a black reporter to set up a meeting for him with her friends in the Congressional Black Caucus. Minutes after declaring himself the least racist person in existence, Trump took a question from American Urban Radio Networks D.C. bureau chief, April Ryan. Ryan asked if Trump planned to seek the advice of the CBC when crafting his urban agenda. The president was confused. Ryan explained that she was referring to the Congressional Black Caucus. Do you want to set up the meeting? Are they friends of yours? Trump asked the African-American journalist. No, Im just a reporter, Ryan said. Set up a meeting, the president interrupted. I would love to meet with the Congressional Black Caucus. Trump also informed a Jewish reporter that he was the least anti-Semitic person youve ever seen in your entire life, before explaining that a lot of supposed acts of anti-Jewish intimidation are really just false-flag attacks designed to make Donald Trump look bad.*An earlier version of this list included the presidents failure to condemn the shooting of two India-born engineers in Kansas by a man who (reportedly) shouted, get out of my country, as he fired. But, after more than a week of silence, the White House did release a formal statement condemning the shooting on Tuesday.Week 8 (February 4 through February 10)Declared the court system a threat to national security. Donald Trump spent much of his presidential campaign promising to use executive power to discriminate against Muslims. Upon election, he promptly banned immigration from several Muslim-majority nations, via an executive order that was Breitbart-tested but not cabinet-agency-approved. This led to chaos at airports, on-the-fly revisions to the governments interpretation of its own order, and a bevy of legal rebukes. Last week, judges in New York, Massachusetts, Virginia, and California stayed the order  or aspects of it  on a variety of legal grounds. Then, on Friday night, U.S. District Judge James Robart delivered the body blow. Unlike other plaintiffs, the state of Washington did not challenge discrete provisions of the executive order, or merely the process by which it was implemented. Rather, the state argued that the order was in fundamental tensions with both federal law and the Constitution. Robart ruled that Washingtons argument was likely to succeed on the merits  and ordered a halt to nationwide enforcement of the travel ban. The president responded by suggesting that Robart might not actually be a judge. Then, he framed the existence of judicial review as a sign of national decline. Still, superficially, Trumps complaint was with an individual judge, not the Judicial branch, itself. But then the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the White Houses request for an emergency stay of Robarts decision  and the president made his contempt for the rule of law explicit. This was not merely an intemperate tweet. It was the president instructing the American people to view the next terrorist attack on U.S. soil as an indictment of the judiciary. And it isnt just Trump himself whos pushing this line. In its legal challenge to Robarts ruling, the White House argued that the federal judge was in no position to rule on the propriety of the executive order, because he lacks access to classified intelligence. This is an argument for allowing our fear of terrorism to overwhelm our commitment to the rule of law  a line of reasoning that poses a far greater threat to the American form of government and way of life than any closeted-jihadist refugee ever could. Insisted that his Supreme Court pick had no problem with attacks on the judiciary, in the face of blatant evidence to the contrary. Trumps Supreme Court nominee had little choice but to condemn the presidents attacks on his branch of government. In private meetings with senators ahead of his confirmation hearings, Neil Gorsuch described Trumps remarks demoralizing and disheartening. But the president found it hard to believe that his Supreme Court pick would object to attacks on the court system. And so  even though White House adviser Ron Bonjean had confirmed that Gorsuch had criticized Trumps comments in his meeting with Richard Blumenthal  the president accused the Democratic senator of lying. The presidents case here was airtight: Richard Blumenthal once apologized for saying that he had served in Vietnam, when, in fact, the senator had merely served as a Marine Corps Reserve during the Vietnam War, but was never sent overseas. (By contrast, the president spent his Vietnam fearlessly weathering round after round of unprotected sex.) Therefore, both Blumenthal and Bonjean are lying. Trump proceeded to chastise CNNs Chris Cuomo for refusing to ask Blumenthal about his Vietnam record during a Thursday-morning interview  even though Cuomo asked Blumenthal about his (utterly irrelevant) Vietnam record during that Thursday-morning interview. There seems to be no lie too obvious  nor attack too hypocritical  for the president to deploy as a means of evading responsibility for his mistakes. Trashed New START during a call with Putin  after putting the phone aside to ask his advisers what that (nuclear-arms treaty) was. I was a good student. I understand things, President Trump assured America on Wednesday. I comprehend very well, okay? Better than, I think, almost anybody. But many within the White House beg to differ. In leak after leak, anonymous administration officials paint the president as less teachers pet than class clown  one who refuses to do his homework, demands the Cliffs Notes for every reading assignment, and struggles to comprehend the most basic aspects of the curriculum. The latest SOS from the West Wing was intercepted by Reuters: New START is pretty fundamental to U.S.-Russian relations. At his confirmation hearing, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson expressed his support for the agreement. Trump, himself, was aware of the treatys significance  if not of its proper name  last year, when he complained that Russia outsmarted Obama on START Up. To avoid such lapses in memory, presidents typically request an in-depth briefing from the National Security Council before dialing up world leaders. But, according to Reuters sources, Trump received no such briefing before hopping on the horn with Putin. (Considering that Trump has often bragged about being too smart to read long things, it seems safe to take Reuters word on this one.) The source of Trumps antipathy for New START is unclear. On the one hand, the president has expressed enthusiasm for a new arms race. On the other, he has called nuclear weapons the single greatest threat we face  and has a habit of disparaging any deal that he did not, himself, negotiate. Which is to say: The best-case scenario here is that our president would like there to be fewer nuclear arms in the world  but is willing to jeopardize that objective if it means honoring an agreement Obama negotiated. Publicly condemned a private company for dropping his daughters (increasingly unpopular) fashion line. Trump long ago concluded that it would be unreasonable for the American people to expect him to divest from his business interests, just because they elected him president. To forfeit the empire he spent his whole life building was simply too great a sacrifice. While he would cease managing the Trump Organization, he would, nonetheless, retain majority ownership of its assets. Most Americans sympathized with this position. Then, Trump decided that having someone outside his family run the organization in his stead  so as to put meaningful distance between himself and its management  was also too great a burden for him to bear. Trump proceeded to reason that he couldnt fairly be expected to not invite the children running his business to policy meetings with tech entrepreneurs; or to not meet with his business partners while president-elect; or to ensure that his D.C. hotel did not court the patronage of foreign diplomats (in arguable defiance of the Constitution). And, then, on Thursday, the president decided that we also cant expect him not to attack private companies that refuse to maintain a relationship with his daughters poorly performing brand. Suggested that publicly criticizing his military decisions is tantamount to aiding the enemy. Last week, President Trump sent a team of Navy SEALs to raid a compound in Yemen  with the aim of capturing or killing the head of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, Qassim al-Rimi. When the raid was over, al-Rimi was still alive, and on the lam  while one SEAL, 14 (alleged) Al Qaeda fighters, an 8-year-old American citizen, and an unconfirmed number of other civilians lay dead. The SEALs did manage to collect some phones and computers, though the value of the information contained therein is not publicly known. Meanwhile, in light of the raids many civilian casualties, the Yemeni government is starting to rethink its support for U.S. ground operations on its soil. Surveying these results, Arizona senator and prominent war enthusiast John McCain dubbed the mission a failure. On Thursday, Trump suggested that McCains comment was harmful to national security  and also the kind of thing that a loser would say. Got angry at his press secretary for being impersonated by a woman. Per Politico: Week 7 (January 27 through February 3)Used the executive branchs immense authority over border control to inflict arbitrary cruelty on thousands of Muslim immigrants, create chaos at airports all across America, and sour diplomatic relations with the rest of the world. Many of the actions catalogued in this post serve as testaments to our new presidents incompetence; others, to his mindless bigotry. Late last Friday, Trump signed his name to a document that affirmed both of his signature qualities  and upended the lives of tens of thousands of innocent people. That executive order  as of Friday evening temporarily blocked by a Seattle judge  suspended the admission of all refugees to the United States for 120 days; suspended the admission of Syrian refugees indefinitely; prioritized the refugee claims of non-Muslims in the Middle East; and banned citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. These measures were advertised as means of protecting national security. But there is little evidence that they will do any such thing. America already has one of the worlds most rigorous systems for vetting refugees, and the deadliest terror attacks on U.S. soil in recent years were executed by our own disaffected citizens. Even if one believes that protecting homeland security requires barring travelers from the Muslim world, there is no coherent argument for why visitors from Saudi Arabia should be allowed, while those from Iran should not. In fact, no foreign national from any of the seven blacklisted countries has committed a fatal terrorist attack in the United States since 1975. As an effort to prevent terrorism, Trumps executive order is incoherent, and likely counterproductive. The orders broad, overt denigration of the Muslim world aids every jihadist who wishes to tie his heinous cause to a broader war between Islam and the West. But jihadists arent the only ones who long for such a clash of civilizations  some of the most powerful people in the Trump White House believe Judeo-Christian civilization really is at war with Islam. Many of those same people see Muslim immigrants as threats to national security, whether theyre terrorists or not. The two main authors of last weeks order  Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller  have explicitly argued that such immigrants are a threat simply because their religion will prevent them from assimilating into our society. Once you stipulate this view, the order becomes more coherent: The goal is not to stop terrorism but to halt the dilution of the white Christian population in the United States. Its about protecting ethno-national security. Nearly 60,000 immigrants had their visas revoked to satisfy Bannons Islamophobic paranoia. Countless refugees were stranded. But the costs of Trumps order dont merely fall on nonU.S. citizens. America relies on many of the countries Trump blacklisted to provide doctors for our understaffed hospitals. Now, some medical groups are preparing for a shortage of physicians in our nations underserved rural areas. The order has also disrupted the smooth functioning of American universities and tech companies that rely on immigrant labor. Finally, even if one shares Bannons worldview  and believes all this is a small price to pay for saving America from the Muslim hordes  the implementation of the order revealed the new administrations profound incompetence. The White House sought little input from legal counsel, Congress, and relevant cabinet agencies. It provided Customs and Border Protection with little notice of its plans. This led to chaos in airports all around the United States as visa-holders arrived to find their legal status had been terminated while they were midair. And the vagueness of the orders wording produced confusion about who was and was not impacted by the rules. At the beginning of the weekend, the order applied to legal permanent residents and dual citizens of the blacklisted countries; by Monday it did not. Violated court orders against his travel ban. The sloppiness of the order did have its own silver lining: It exposed many of the Trump administrations directives to effective legal challenge. Days after the order went into effect, judges in Massachusetts and California had issued injunctions, restraining the orders enforcement. But the rule of law does not seem to matter very much to the law and order president. As Slates Jeremy Stahl wrote Thursday: Heres what Stahl means by Kafkaesque and legal chicanery: The judges in Boston ordered the government to cease detaining or removing individuals with valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas. But the Trump administration claims that it had already revoked the visas of all nationals from the blacklisted countries, prior to the order  a fact that was not publicly confirmed until Friday. And so, Customs and Border Protection agents have carried on following their orders. Created a diplomatic crisis with Australia  and threatened to invade Mexico. Australia is the kind of friend that takes your side even when youre wrong. In geopolitical terms, this means that when the United States asked for some help with our quagmire in Afghanistan, Australia sacrificed 42 of its young people to our cause. So, when Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull reminded President Trump of Americas commitment to take in 1,250 refugees currently residing in an Australian detention center, he had little reason to believe that hed be met with a torrent of verbal abuse. But he was. This is the worst deal ever, the president said during the Saturday call, according to the Washington Post. Trump proceeded to inform our dear ally that he had spoken with four other world leaders that day  including Russian President Vladimir Putin  and that this was the worst call by far. When Turnbull tried to direct the conversation to less contentious subjects, Trump abruptly ended the call  35 minutes before it was scheduled to expire. Later in the week, Trump tried to patch things up with Mexican president Enrique Pea Nieto  and kind of, sort of, threatened to invade our southern neighbor. You have a bunch of bad hombres down there, Trump told Pea Nieto, according to the excerpt obtained by the Associated Press. You arent doing enough to stop them. I think your military is scared. Our military isnt, so I just might send them down to take care of it. Mexican officials later characterized this as a friendly offer, rather than a military threat. Nonetheless, neither of these phone calls increases ones confidence in the diplomatic chops of our commander-in-chief. Allowed his press secretary to falsely claim that Iran had committed an act of war against the United States. The Trump administration spent much of the past week rattling sabers at Iran. Not all of this belligerence was unprovoked  Iran did test an intercontinental ballistic missile Sunday, in (arguably) a violation of a U.N. Security Council resolution. But one thing Iran definitely did not do was take action against an American Navy vessel. But that didnt stop White House press secretary Sean Spicer from saying that it had. I think General Flynn was really clear yesterday that Iran has violated the Joint Resolution, that Irans additional hostile actions that it took against our Navy vessel are ones that we are very clear [we] are not going to sit by and take, Spicer said Thursday, intimating that Iran had committed an act of war against the United States. In truth, a Saudi Arabian warship was attacked by fighters that the Pentagon suspects were Houthi rebels  a Shia militant group in Yemen that the Saudis have been slaughtering for over a year. Iran does back the Houthis, but the latter isnt really the puppet of the former  the Houthis are less concerned with expanding Tehrans sphere of influence than winning their nations civil war. And yet, the White House eagerly painted a (suspected) Houthi attack on Saudi Arabia as a (confirmed) Iranian attack on America. Which makes you wonder whether or not the Trump administration will do everything in its power to avoid launching another Middle Eastern war. Retained the author of a reactionary screed that likened the 2016 election to Flight 93 as a national-security staffer. Michael Anton is a former Bush administration speechwriter and current national-security official in the Trump administration. This week, we learned that he is also the author of an essay titled The Flight 93 Election. In it, Anton argued that the 2016 election put conservatives in a position akin to passengers of Flight 93 on 9/11: They could either charge the cockpit or die. If you dont try, death is certain, Anton wrote. To compound the metaphor: a Hillary Clinton presidency is Russian Roulette with a semi-auto. Antons reasoning was simple: The ceaseless importation of Third World foreigners with no tradition of, taste for, or experience in liberty means that the electorate grows more left, more Democratic, less Republican, less republican, and less traditionally American with every cycle. Thus, absent an immediate restriction of Third World immigration, America, as conservatives knew it, would end. This is not merely an argument against Hillary Clinton, but an argument for authoritarianism. If a Democratic victory in 2016 could have brought national ruination, surely the same would be true in 2020. Which is to say: One of the presidents senior national-security staffers is an opponent of American democracy. Suggested that Frederick Douglass is still alive in speech on Black History Month. At his speech honoring African-Americans historical contributions to our republic, the president said this about Martin Luther King Jr. And this about Frederick Douglass: Sean Spicer was later asked what Trump had meant by this. I think he wants to highlight the contributions that he has made, Spicer said. And I think through a lot of the actions and statements that hes going to make, I think the contributions of Frederick Douglass will become more and more. Week 6 (January 7 through 27)Told a demonstrable lie about the size of the crowd at his inauguration  and predicted that the media would pay a big price for refusing to repeat it. Donald Trumps inauguration attracted a much smaller crowd to the National Mall than Barack Obamas did in 2008. This was not a surprise: Washington, D.C., is a majority African-American city, and the first black president won its vote overwhelmingly. Trump, by contrast, received a mere 4 percent of the districts ballots. Further, Obama entered office with an approval rating of 80 percent; Trump was sworn in with one around 40. But while Trumps (comparatively) sparse inaugural crowd comported with demographic and polling realities, it was wildly inconsistent with the presidents expectations. And so, as he often does when reality disappoints his fondest wishes, Trump discovered a set of alternative facts. I get up this morning and I turn on one of the networks and they show an empty field, Trump said. I said wait a minute, I made a speech, I looked out, the field was, it looked like a million, a million and a half people  it went all the way back to the Washington Monument. So, we caught the media, Trump said, and we caught them in beauty. And I think theyre going to pay a big price. That big price turned out to be a scolding from the new White House press secretary. Armed with visual aids, an ill-fitting suit, and secondhand indignation, Spicer condemned the presss shameful attempts to minimize the enormous support that had gathered on the National Mall. This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, Spicer baselessly declared, before vowing, Were going to hold the press accountable. Spicer then informed the White House press corps that the CIA had given Trump a five-minute standing ovation at the end of his speech (the audience stood throughout the speech, having never received permission to sit. Trump would later claim that this had been the biggest standing ovation since Peyton Manning had won the Super Bowl). Thats what you guys should be writing and covering, Spicer said, then left without taking a single question. Told congressional leaders at a private meeting that he only lost the popular vote because undocumented immigrants cast millions of ballots against him. In November, Trump tweeted that he had actually won the popular vote, if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally. That was disturbing for several reasons, all detailed in an earlier installment of this list. But Trumps repetition of the claim  in a private meeting with congressional leaders, whom he has no hope of conning on this subject  raises the alarming possibility that the president genuinely believes in his own conspiracy theory. Which is to say, the president believes that 3 to 5 million undocumented immigrants risked deportation to illegally vote against him. Even though there is literally no evidence for that claim. And no losing down-ballot Republican candidate has demanded an investigation into the matter. And he, himself, loudly opposed all attempts to audit the elections results  until reporters alerted him to this apparent contradiction. Then, the president announced an investigation into such acts of voter fraud as being registered to vote in two states (which is a crime committed by several of his advisers and family members, if it were actually illegal). On Tuesday, Sean Spicer affirmed that this is, in fact, the presidents genuine understanding of how Hillary Clinton won more votes than he did. The president does believe that, he has stated that before, Spicer told reporters at a White House press briefing. I think hes stated his concerns of voter fraud and people voting illegally during the campaign and he continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence people have presented to him. If true, then Trumps claim about illegal votes is not just a dangerous challenge to popular perceptions of democratic legitimacy and a pretext for voter suppression  though it is both these things. It is also a sign that the president may have developed his talent for conning the insecure by practicing on himself. Suggested America might once again have the opportunity to confiscate Iraqs oil. Trump has long maintained that one of the biggest mistakes the United States made in Iraq was that it did not expropriate the nations most valuable natural resource. The president is fairly certain that, had the U.S. stolen Iraqs oil, the region would be far more stable than it is today. Trump reiterated this view in his speech at the CIA on his first weekend in office  and then suggested that his administration might have a chance to rectify Americas great error. Now I said it for economic reasons, Trump said while introducing Representative Mike Pompeo, his pick to lead the intelligence agency. But if you think about it, Mike, if we kept the oil, you probably wouldnt have ISIS because thats where they made their money in the first place, so we should have kept the oil. But, okay, maybe well have another chance. This is the kind of thing a reality-television star can say to Fox & Friends, without putting lives in danger. Thats less true when the president of the United States says it to the CIA. There are 6,000 U.S. troops in Iraq right now. It will not make their lives easier if Iraqis believe that America wants to steal their oil. Nor, for that matter, will it help if the local population thinks that the United States created ISIS. And yet, President Trump has said both those things in just the past few weeks. Allowed his company to leverage the cachet of his election into a massive expansion of its hotel empire. There are 26 major metropolitan areas in the U.S., and were in five, Trump Hotels CEO Eric Danziger told Bloomberg Tuesday. I dont see any reason that we couldnt be in all of them eventually. Meanwhile, the Trump-owned Mar-a-Lago country club will be doubling its initiation fee from $100,000 per year to $200,000. What, precisely, made membership in the club twice as valuable as it was one year ago is anybodys guess. If all goes as planned, future generations will have convenient access to Trump-owned properties wherever they are in the country. Ordered the Department of Homeland Security to issue a weekly list of crimes (allegedly) committed by undocumented immigrants in sanctuary cities. There is little evidence that undocumented immigrants commit crimes at higher rates than the general public. Trumps list serves no purpose other than to sow fear and loathing of a vulnerable minority group. It is move as vile and absurd as having though government publish a weekly list of robberies committed Jews or, say, sexual assaults perpetuated by real estate moguls. Prepared to radically reduce American funding to the United Nations. In the wake of the Second World War, the United States led the effort to establish the United Nations  an institution that would, among other things, promote American values and protect American interests. To this day, the U.S. enjoys the power to unilaterally veto any substantive resolution that comes before the body, and, less officially, to defy the U.N.s understanding of international law whenever it feels like invading a sovereign country. But now, Donald Trump is preparing to undercut this tool of American hegemony  and global peacekeeping and poverty reduction  with a stroke of his pen. The Trump administration has drafted an executive order that would reduce American funding of the U.N. and other international organizations by at least 40 percent, thereby devastating international peacekeeping and refugee-aid efforts. Signed a bevy of executive orders that were drafted by the White Houses Breitbart wing  and no one else. Part of why Trump was able to dash off executive orders at such a frenetic pace during his first week in office  even as the rest of his transition is woefully behind schedule  is that he neglected to have them reviewed by relevant cabinet agencies, congressional committees, or legal counsel. Rather, the documents were drafted with the consultation of virtually no one but Breitbart mastermind Steve Bannon, and his fellow right-wing nationalist Stephen Miller, according to Politico. And as it turns out, governing by Breitbart op-ed has its drawbacks. For example, Trumps executive order on the Keystone XL was drafted without the consultation of the State Department, despite the fact that the company behind the pipeline is suing the U.S. for $15 billion  and aspects of the order could plausibly strengthen the companys case: Among other things, the order requires any company building a pipeline to use materials manufactured domestically  a provision that may contravene various trade treaties that the U.S. is bound by. Stood by as his top advisers leaked like a sieve. Before Trump finished his fourth day in office, nearly a dozen of his senior aides and advisers had planted embarrassing stories in the Washington Post, New York Times, and Politico about how their boss cant handle embarrassing coverage in the mainstream media. Specifically, advisers detailed the presidents fury and anguish while watching cable-news coverage of the Womens March and reports that the crowd at his inauguration was  less than record-breaking. Those advisers also spilled the beans on every power struggle currently being waged in the West Wing  including who might be trying to get who fired. In some ways, these developments are the opposite of terrifying. On many fronts, its probably better for Trump to have a bizarrely transparent and dysfunctional administration than a well-organized, tight-lipped one: Its hard to organize mass deportation when everyones trying to keep the boss from having a temper tantrum  or else scheming to get each other forced out. But these are still the people were relying on to keep the government functioning and avert nuclear war. The fact that the U.S. president is a a 70-year-old child  or, at the very least, that his own advisers are eager to portray him that way in the press  is more than a bit disconcerting. Declared that his election had restored American democracy, in an angry, authoritarian inaugural address. On Friday, a president who had lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million ballots announced that, with his inauguration, the American people had been put in charge of their own government for the first time in decades. Today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people, Trump declared. January 20, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. The new president went on to assail the various elected leaders arrayed in front of him as a parasitic cabal that had protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Thus, Trump established himself as the only true representative of the American people. But Trumps speech forgot the 54 percent of the electorate that did not join that movement  along with every American who felt that Barack Obama represented them, during his time in the Oval Office. Not once did Trump acknowledge the existence of such voters. But he didnt need to, because his claim to being the peoples president did not rest on objective measures of popular opinion, but on his unique ability to divine  and execute  the national will. Trump is the voice of the people, because the people said so, in his own voice. Replaced the White House websites page on climate change with a vow to drill for oil on federal lands. Minutes after Trump was sworn in, all mentions of man-made climate change were erased from the White Houses official website. In its stead appeared the presidents America First Energy Plan, which promises the elimination of the Obama administrations harmful and unnecessary restrictions on carbon emissions and water pollution. We must take advantage of the estimated $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil, and natural gas reserves, the plan reads, especially those on federal lands that the American people own. This is in the wake of reports that 2016 was the warmest year in recorded history  as had been 2015 and 2014 before it. It is not unusual for presidents to excise their predecessors pages from the White House website. But Trumps revision put his priorities into sharp relief. At his first press conference as president-elect, Trump revealed that he had no intention of divesting from his globe-spanning business interests, despite government ethicists insistence that he do so. Defamed a hero of the civil-rights movement in a series of racist tweets. Georgia congressman John Lewis announced that he would not be attending Donald Trumps inauguration, as he believed that Russian interference rendered his election illegitimate. Considering the lack of public evidence that the Trump campaign actively abetted Russian hacking, one could reasonably argue that Lewiss claim was hyperbolic, or even irresponsible. But Trump made no such argument when he responded to Lewiss slight. Instead, he decided to defame the congressman and the voters he represents. Beyond the bleak comedy of a millionaires son  who spent the late 60s dodging the draft and STDs  deriding a hero of the civil-rights movement as all talk, no action, Trumps tweets are remarkable for their naked racism. Since winning the White House, Trump has largely eschewed the appeals to white racial resentment that fueled his campaigns early days. But Lewiss insult brought the presidents racial animus back to the surface. Its true that Lewis represents much of Atlanta, which, like many other American cities, suffers from an unacceptably high rate of gun violence. But the city is also among one of the nations most economically vibrant metro areas  and is not falling apart. Whats more, Lewiss district also encompasses some of his states wealthiest suburbs. Thus, its hard to avoid the conclusion that Trumps dire portrait of the place Lewis represents was based entirely on the color of the congressmans skin  the president saw that Lewis was an African-American, and then described the conditions that he believes African-Americans live under. Trumps final tweet to Lewis is his most alarming, as it describes a completely fictional crisis of urban disorder  there was a time in our history when Americas inner cities were set ablaze by the rage of the dispossessed, but we arent living in it. Thus, Trumps tweet appears designed but to stimulate his white, rural followers fear and loathing of urban America, and all that infests it. Suggested that Americas intelligence agencies might be turning the United States into something akin to Nazi Germany.Earlier this month, CNN reported that intelligence officials had alerted the president-elect to the existence of an unverified research report, assembled by an exBritish spy, which claimed that Donald Trumps campaign had been in close contact with the Russian government through much of 2016  and that the Kremlin possessed compromising information about him. Its not clear who leaked word of these salacious allegations. The dossier that BuzzFeed published had been commissioned by Trumps opponents during the 2016 campaign, and had been circulating among journalists and political operatives  as well as intelligence officials  for months. It is possible that CNN would have needed an intelligence-community source to report that our spy agencies had briefed Trump on the dossier. But the list of people who could have sent the documents themselves to BuzzFeed extends well into the private sector. Nonetheless, Donald Trump decided to pin the blame on the intelligence agencies he would soon rely upon  and in the most incendiary possible terms. Allowed his secretary of State nominee to pledge that America would block Chinas access to its disputed islands in the South China Sea  a promise that, if kept, would almost certainly mean war. In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, would-be secretary of State Rex Tillerson promised to block Chinas access to its disputed islands in the South China Sea  an action that would almost certainly entail a military confrontation between the worlds two greatest powers. Were going to have to send China a clear signal that, first, the island-building stops, Tillerson said. And second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed. Its unclear whether Tillerson conferred with Trump about that stance. But Trump has been nothing but belligerent toward Beijing since winning the White House. Beyond threatening to slap massive tariffs on Chinas exports and revoke Americas support for the One China policy, the president has also staffed his administration with multiple China hard-liners, including Peter Navarro, who has described the nation as a despicable, parasitic, brutal, brass-knuckled, crass, callous, amoral, ruthless, and totally totalitarian imperialist power. In response to Tillersons statement the Communist Partycontrolled Global Times wrote, Unless Washington plans to wage a large-scale war in the South China Sea, any other approaches to prevent Chinese access to the islands will be foolish  If Trumps diplomatic team shapes future Sino-U.S. ties as it is doing now, the two sides had better prepare for a military clash. White House press secretary Sean Spicer reiterated the administrations position, saying, If those islands are in fact in international waters and not part of China proper, then yes, were going to make sure that we defend international territories from being taken over by one country. Named his son-in-law a senior White House adviser, in defiance of norms (and, very likely, laws) against nepotism. Two weeks ago, Trump named his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as a senior White House adviser. Anti-nepotism laws prohibit federal officials from hiring relatives to work for the agencies they lead, but Kushners lawyers have concluded that the White House is not an agency. And the Justice Department has decided to buy into that theory. Called NATO obsolete. Last week, Trump once again suggested that Americas support for NATO was contingent on its allies paying their fair share, while calling the organization as currently constituted obsolete. He also predicted the slow collapse of the European Union, and suggested that such a collapse would be a good thing. In response to his remarks, German president Angela Merkel said that Europe has its fate in its own hands. ****Week 5 (December 22 through January 6) Repeatedly denigrated Americas intelligence agencies, then leaked plans to downsize them. Trump initially claimed that the CIAs findings could be dismissed  sight unseen  because the agency is staffed by the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. He then argued it was impossible for anyone to know who had hacked the Democratic National Committees email account. Last week, Trump reiterated that argument, telling reporters, the whole age of the computer has made it where nobody knows exactly whats going on. Then, the president-elect went a step further, suggesting that regardless of who committed the hack, we ought to get on with our lives. Trump then falsely claimed that his intelligence briefing on Russian hacking had been delayed  and suggested that this was because the CIA needed more time to fabricate intelligence. He then treated the claims of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange with more credulity than those of 17 U.S. intelligence agencies. The troubling thing about this behavior is not that the president-elect views the claims of the deep state with a critical eye, but rather that he appears to judge the veracity of their claims on the basis of whether or not he wants them to be true. Trump rejected the CIAs assessment of Russian hacking before he was ever presented with its case, out of a belief that the findings were the product of a political witch hunt, aimed at tarnishing the legitimacy of his electoral triumph. They got beaten very badly in the election. I won more counties in the election than Ronald Reagan. They are very embarrassed about it, Trump told the Times on Friday, ostensibly explaining the motivation behind the intelligence communitys focus on Russian hacking. To some extent, its a witch hunt. They just focus on this. As this 2014 tweet makes clear, Trump is no long-time, principled critic of the CIA. Rather, he is a staunch opponent of any entity that publicizes information he does not want to hear. And now, hes reportedly drafting plans to take his opposition beyond merely shooting his mouth off at the messenger. This week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump and his advisers are drafting plans to pare back the office of the Director of National Intelligence and the CIA. The view from the Trump team is the intelligence world has become completely politicized, one anonymous source close to the Trump transition told the paper. They all need to be slimmed down. Declared his openness to reviving a nuclear arms race. Just before Christmas, Trump went nuclear. Specifically, the president-elect appeared to upend a decades-old bipartisan consensus that less is more when it comes to nuclear weapons. This tweet was widely interpreted as a declaration of Trumps intent to pursue nuclear proliferation. But could that really have been what he meant? Why would Trump want to give the worlds other nuclear powers an excuse to proliferate when America already has enough weapons to wipe out humanity so many times over  and when arms races are so damn expensive. Surely, the words nuclear capability were meant to signify a modernization of our existing arsenal, like the one president Obama is already pursuing (which is, itself, an arguably reckless policy). Shortly after Trumps tweet, his communications director suggested that he had, in fact, been referring to modernization. But one day letter, the president-elect had an early morning chat with MSNBCs Mika Brzezinski  and declined the cable news hosts invitation to disavow his interest in a nuclear arms race. Let there be an arms race, Trump told Brzezinski, because we will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all. Disparaged the sitting American president, while praising a hostile foreign autocrat. Trump lacks many of the characteristics that one might want in a commander-in-chief. But punctuality isnt one of them. In fact, the president-elect has taken the unprecedented step of showing up for his new job 11 weeks early. Instead of abiding by the principle that there can only be one president at a time  which is to say, that president-elects should keep mum on foreign policy, so as to avoid sowing confusion among Americas allies and adversaries about whos in charge  Trump has comported himself as though he were already ensconced in the Oval Office. The president-elect has hosted a meeting with the prime minister of Japan; cancelled two of the U.S. militarys most expensive projects; attempted to dictate Americas actions at the United Nations; and, most ambitiously, spoken with the president of Taiwan by phone and then publicly questioned the wisdom of respecting the One China policy  an action that threatens to transform Americas relationship with the worlds second-greatest power and which was taken without the consultation of the Obama White House or State Department. And yet, despite all these signals that Trump is ready to take things from here, Barack Obama has carried on as though he were still the president of the United States. Obama has even had the audacity to use the power of his office to advance policies that Trump doesnt like, including sanctions on Russia and pardons of nonviolent drug offenders. The president-elect publicized his displeasure with this state of affairs at the end of last month. Then, when Vladimir Putin announced that he would withhold retaliatory sanctions against the United States  until he got a sense of where the Trump administration would like to take U.S.-Russia relations  the president-elect praised the autocrats wisdom. Continued to use Twitter as a tool for souring diplomatic relations with the worlds second-greatest power. Trump began 2017 the way he ended 2016  antagonizing China for no good reason. In the wake of that missive, Chinas state news agency, Xinhua, (essentially) advised the president-elect to delete his account. In a commentary titled, An obsession with Twitter foreign policy is undesirable, the media organization wrote. Everyone recognizes the common sense that foreign policy isnt childs play, and even less is it like doing business deals, according to a translation by the New York Times. Twitter shouldnt become an instrument of foreign policy, the article continued, suggesting that Trump is wrong to believe that issuing hard-line comments and taking up sensitive issues over the platform will add to his chips for negotiating with other countries. Trump isnt wrong to suggest that China has helped prop up Kim Jong-uns regime. As Time notes, China is North Koreas only major ally and accounts for 90 percent of the rogue states trade. But this fact illustrates why maintaining friendly relations with Beijing is so important  to make Kim Jong-uns regime pay a higher price for its belligerence, Trump will need to secure the cooperation of its only major trading partner. And he will only be able to do that if he can establish a modicum of trust with the Chinese government. It seems unlikely that tweeting out sarcastic insults of the Chinese government is a sound means of achieving that end. More broadly, Trumps decision to use Twitter as his primary tool for both public and diplomatic relations is a security threat in its own right. As BuzzFeed News notes, a hacker who gained access to Trumps account would gain the power to manipulate the stock market or instigate a geopolitical crisis with the press of a button. Named a billionaire investor  with an enormous, personal financial interest in deregulating certain sectors of the economy  as his special adviser on regulatory reform. Carl Icahn is a billionaire financier with ungodly sums of money invested in energy, auto supplies, and mining. Now, he is also the man tasked with reforming the regulatory agencies that oversee his investments. In late December, Trump named Icahn his special adviser on regulatory reform  but unlike his predecessors in that position, Icahns gig will be informal, and he will not be classified as a government employee. This arrangement will allow Icahn to retain his investments in companies that are affected by his regulatory decisions. It will also allow him to avoid disclosing any tax returns or undergoing vetting by Congress. Icahn is already pressuring the Federal Trade Commission to ease clean fuel standards, and has played a role in selecting the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency. It is one more example of what King Trump is doing, circumventing the rules, Richard Painter, the former chief ethics counsel to President George W. Bush, said of Icahns hiring, in an interview with New York. This is an end-run around criminal statutes.Week 4 (December 9 through December 21) Declared the American intelligence community to be inherently untrustworthy, after it produced information that he did not like. A little over a week ago, the Washington Post revealed that many in the CIA believe Russia interfered in the 2016 election with the intention of aiding Donald Trumps candidacy. This information did not please Donald Trump. Which is understandable: No winning politician wants his or her victory to be attributed, even partially, to the actions of a hostile foreign government. Whats more, with liberals already eager to delegitimize his presidency on the basis of his popular-vote loss, Trump had some cause for defensiveness. Thus, one could hardly blame the president-elect if he released a statement that mixed expressions of concern about Kremlin interference with a vigorous defense of the elections legitimacy.Instead, he released a statement that said this: These three sentences are gobsmacking for reasons both small and large. For one thing, there is no evidence that the intelligence analysts who wrote up the CIAs findings on Russian interference were the same people who prepared the most inaccurate assessments of Saddam Husseins arsenal. And anyway, Trump reportedly intends to give one of the Iraq Wars most unrepentant architects a high-ranking position in his administration. For another, the president-elects claim about the size of his win is downright Orwellian  Trumps margin of victory in the Electoral College was among the lowest in our history. Most concerning, though, is the fact that Trump decided to publicly denigrate the authority of an entire intelligence agency, simply because it generated news he didnt like. (If the president-elect has some other reason for doubting the CIAs assessment, he has not provided it.) This is chilling, even if one isnt concerned by Trumps friendliness toward Russia. One can reasonably argue that easing tensions with the nation that holds the worlds second-largest nuclear stockpile will do more good than harm. But a president who responds to unpleasant information by shooting his mouth off at the messenger will almost certainly do more of the latter than the former. And Trumps decision to disbelieve the CIAs assessment  sight unseen  was not a momentary impulse. Three days after the Posts report, the president-elect suggested it wasnt even possible for the CIA to know who had hacked the Democratic National Committees email account. Said he would continue skipping daily intelligence briefings when he becomes president because hes smart enough to get by without them. In his time as president-elect, Trump has refused to solicit briefings from the State Department before contacting foreign leaders, or to sit through daily national-security updates from Americas intelligence agencies. And last week, Trump declared his intention to continue shirking the latter duty as commander-in-chief. You know, Im, like, a smart person. I dont have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years, Trump explained to Fox News Sunday. There might be times where it might change. I mean, there will be some very fluid situations. Ill be there not every day but more than that. Said he doesnt know why he should be bound by the One China Policy. Trump has spent much of the past month souring Americas diplomatic relationship with the second most powerful country in the world. First, he broke a decades-old taboo against speaking with the president of Taiwan. Then, he announced that he might not honor the One China Policy, which prohibits the U.S. from recognizing Taiwan as a sovereign country. Preventing Taiwan from achieving internationally recognized independence is a top priority of Chinese foreign policy  one that its military has prepared to go to war over. But Trump told Fox News that, unless China is willing to cut him some unspecified deal, he may repudiate the principle on which decades of friendly U.S.-Sino relations has been premised. I fully understand the one China policy, Trump told the network. But I dont know why we have to be bound by a one China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade. In response to Trumps provocations, China flew a nuclear-capable bomber over its disputed islands in the South China Sea. Then, a Chinese naval vessel abducted an underwater U.S. drone. It returned the drone to American custody days later, after determining that it was not being used for espionage. Trump used this minor dustup to further irritate Beijing. A spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry expressed indignation at Trumps tweet. We dont like the word steal. Thats totally inaccurate. The nations state-run newspaper later published an op-ed that promised if Trump treats China after assuming office in the same way as in his tweets, China will not exercise restraint. Invited his adult sons  who are slated to run the Trump Organization next year  to a policy meeting with the leading lights of Silicon Valley. Last Wednesday, Donald Trump was supposed to clarify how he intends to extricate himself from the myriad conflicts of interest his company presents. But he postponed that press conference until January. In its place, the president-elect tweeted his intention to cede managerial control of his company to his adult sons, Eric and Don Jr. Then, he invited both of those sons to a policy meeting with the leading lights of Silicon Valley. On the very day he had previously promised to detail his plans for evading corruption. Which, to be fair, was its own kind of clarifying. Picked a man who once tried to call for the abolition of the Energy Department  but couldnt remember the departments name  as secretary of Energy. At a Republican primary debate in 2011, Rick Perry announced that there were three federal agencies that he would abolish as president,  Commerce, Education and the  whats the third one there? Lets see.  Okay. So Commerce, Education, and the, the former governor of Texas continued. The third agency of government I would  I would do away with the Education, the  Commerce and  lets see  I cant. The third one, I cant. Sorry. Oops. Perry later revealed that the third one was the department of Energy. Last week, Trump named Perry as his designated pick for head of that department. Named his bankruptcy lawyer  who thinks liberal Jews are worse than Nazi collaborators  as his pick for ambassador to Israel. David Friedman is a bankruptcy lawyer who believes the two-state solution is an illusion, Barack Obama is anti-Semitic, Israel has a legal right to expand settlements in the occupied West Bank  or else to annex the territory in its entirety  and that liberal American Jews who disagree with him are far worse than kapos. And he will be Americas ambassador to Israel next year, if Donald Trump gets his way.Week 3 (November 30 through December 9)Provoked heightened diplomatic tensions with two nuclear-armed states. Before last Friday, the leaders of the United States and Taiwan had not spoken since 1979. This was because China does not recognize Taiwan as an independent state, but rather, a breakaway province. Preventing the island from achieving internationally recognized independence is one of the top priorities of Chinese foreign policy  one that its military has prepared to go to war over. Thus, Americas friendly diplomatic relationship with the worlds second greatest power is premised on our respect for the One China policy. Seven days ago, Donald Trump chose to disrespect that policy, when, unbeknownst to the Obama White House, the president-elect held a ten-minute phone conversation with Taiwans president  and leader of the nations pro-independence political party  Tsai Ing-wen. The call prompted an immediate diplomatic protest from China, followed by reassurances from the sitting president that no official change in policy had been intended. Initially, the call appeared to testify to the hazards posed by Trumps willful ignorance. The president-elect has reportedly refused to sit through daily intelligence briefings and neglected to consult the State Department before meeting with foreign leaders. And, after his precedent-shattering call was met with widespread criticism, he advertised his inability to comprehend the concept of diplomatic fictions. Alternatively, there was some speculation that Trump had chosen to roll the dice on 37 years of peaceful U.S.-Sino relations for the sake of developing a new hotel in Taipei. And then, the Washington Post revealed that the call to Taiwan was the result of a wholly different  but no less alarming  cause: Former Republican senator Bob Dole, along with other hawks in Trumps inner circle, had persuaded the president-elect to make the call as an intentional provocation of the Chinese government. Whatever comfort came with learning that Trump perhaps hadnt jeopardized our relationship with a nuclear superpower out of carelessness or greed, was erased by the knowledge that the alternative explanation was one of calculated belligerence. While Trump campaigned on a kind of neo-isolationism, the president-elect is surrounded by advisers who believe that the United States is at war with Islam and that China must be made to understand our strength. Trumps Taiwan call suggests that these crackpot adventurers may actually get to steer the ship of State. Which isnt to say that Trumps bumbling ignorance wont create its own set of diplomatic crises: Last week, the president-elect also appeared to wing a phone call with the prime minister of Pakistan, in which he offered to mediate its dispute with India over Kashmir while calling the Pakistanis one of the most intelligent people  sentiments that caused a fair amount of anxiety inside of India. Few conflicts in the world pose a greater risk of nuclear escalation than that between India and Pakistan over Kashmir. By all appearances, Trump chose to weigh in on that conflict without soliciting instruction from diplomatic authorities. Defended the propriety of mass murder as an anti-drug policy. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has likened his campaign to rid his nation of drug users to Adolph Hitlers attempt to rid the planet of Jews: Earlier this year, Duterte noted that the press had portrayed him as the cousin of Hitler, then explained that he took little offense at the analogy  after all, whatever else you might think of the Fhrer, the man was very good at exterminating the impure. There are 3 million drug addicts [in the Philippines]. Id be happy to slaughter them, Duterte said. Since taking office last summer, Duterte has presided over the extrajudicial killings  by police and vigilantes  of more than 3,000 alleged drug addicts. In doing so, he has (reportedly) won the admiration of Americas president-elect. He wishes me well, too, in my campaign, and he said that, well, we are doing it as a sovereign nation, the right way, Mr. Duterte said last week, adding that Trump had invited him to visit the White House next year. Of course, you cant believe everything an authoritarian mass murderer says. But Trump did not deny Dutertes account  and given the opportunity to condemn the Philippine presidents campaign of terror, in an interview with Time, the president-elect chose to defend it, instead: Handed the Environmental Protection Agency to a climate denialist. On Monday, those of us who would like to keep this whole human civilization thing going for a few more centuries were provided a ray of hope: President-elect Donald Trump met with inconvenient-truth-teller Al Gore. The meeting came days after Politico reported that Ivanka Trump planned to make climate change one of her signature issues. Thus, for a moment, it seemed like the president-elect might have decided that hed rather not do everything in his power to accelerate the onset of ecological catastrophe. But then, on Wednesday, Trump named Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt as his pick to head the Environmental Protection Agency (or, as it may soon be known, the Environmental Destruction Agency). Pruitt is one of the nations leading opponents of the current EPAs climate-change policies, helping to coordinate a 28-state lawsuit against new limitations on the amount of carbon that power plants can emit. But his opposition to environmental protection extends beyond climate denial: While most conservatives dismiss the significance of global warming, many still believe it makes sense for the government to keep poison out of the air and water. Not Pruitt. He has unsuccessfully sued the EPA over regulations on smog pollution, and over a rule that safeguards wetlands and streams that helps filter contamination from drinking water. The man is so in the pocket of the energy industry, he once took a letter decrying fracking regulations  sent to him by the oil company Devon Energy  copied the text of the letter onto Oklahoma government stationery, and mailed it off to the EPA. Now, he wont need to write letters or bring lawsuits to express his contempt for any policy that puts the public interest above the energys industry short-term profits  hell be able to undermine those policies directly. Whats more, in the wake of Pruitts appointment, Trumps meeting with Gore is recast in its own sinister light: The president-elects meeting the climate-change champion may have been a deliberate bid to sow confusion about the nature of his actual policy on the environment. And it may have worked. Attacked a local labor leader for calling attention to his lies. Last week, Donald Trump convinced Carrier to move only one of its Indiana plants to Mexico, in exchange for $7 million in tax breaks (and/or a tacit promise to make sure nothing unfortunate happens to its parent companys federal contracts). The president-elect then traveled to the factory hed ostensibly rescued and announced that over 1,100 workers would be keeping their jobs thanks to his tireless efforts. This was news to Chuck Jones, president of the union that represents those workers, United Steelworkers 1999. Trump had locked the union out of negotiations with Carrier, and so Jones had not been able to examine the terms of the agreement. Thus, he urged his workers to keep their optimism on the cautious side, but to no avail. As he would later write, Our members got their hopes up. They thought their jobs had been saved. In fact, when Jones finally met with the management of Carrier, he discovered that only 730 factory jobs had been saved. Jones told the Washington Post that hed hoped Trump would be upfront about the terms of the deal, but instead the president-elect had lied his ass off. He then reiterated that sentiment in an interview with CNN. Trump replied by attacking Jones by name, accusing the local labor leader  whose efforts on behalf of his union had turned their plight into a national news story  of being personally responsible for the offshoring of jobs. After a campaign spent lambasting the treachery of unpatriotic CEOs and globalist elites, Trump now blamed the decline of American manufacturing on the laziness of uppity workers. These tweets are scary not merely for what they portend about the Trump administrations labor policies (more on that in a minute) but also because they signal the president-elects enthusiasm for using his bully pulpit to stigmatize individual private citizens who dare to draw attention to his lies. In the wake of Trumps attack, Jones was inundated with implicit threats on his life and lives of his children. Meanwhile, Trumps promises about the Carrier deal have proven even less impressive than they initially appeared. To make its commitment to the Indiana factory concrete and verifiable, Carrier pledged to invest $16 million into the facility. But on Thursday, CNN Money learned that the company will spend the bulk of that money on automation, with the aim of radically reducing the size of its workforce in the short-term future. Handed the Labor Department to a serial violator of labor law. On Thursday, Donald Trump named Andy Puzder as his choice for Labor Secretary, a move roughly analogous to naming Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as head of counterterrorism. Puzder is the CEO of the fast-food company that owns the Carls Jr. and Hardees chains  restaurants that have been serial violators of the Fair Labor Standards Act. According to data compiled by Bloomberg BNA, 60 percent of all Labor Department investigations into Puzders signature eateries turned up instances of wage theft or other forms of worker mistreatment. While on the high side, that figure isnt that far out of step with industry standards: Nearly half of enforcement cases brought by the Labor Departments Wage and Hour division in 2015 targeted the restaurant industry. Companies like Puzders have tried to dodge responsibility for these abuses, by arguing that parent companies cant be held liable for the actions of franchisees. But in 2015, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that workers had a right to bargain with parent companies over working conditions. Puzder will now have discretion over how to enforce that ruling (or, at least, he will until Trump gets the opportunity to appoint new members of the NLRB, and the ruling gets reversed). Puzder has also been a vocal critic of large increases in the minimum wage and the Obama administrations decision to expand access to guaranteed overtime pay. He also likes to advertise his burgers via soft-core pornography. As Labor Secretary, Puzder will oversee the Womens Bureau, an agency tasked with representing the needs of working women. Requested security clearance for a conspiracy theorist who claims that the Clintons operate a Satanic child-sex ring out of a popular D.C. pizzeria. Michael Flynn is an Islamophobic retired general and intelligence expert, who occasionally promotes unhinged conspiracy theories. He will be the top national security adviser to our next president. Michael G. Flynn Jr. is the Islamophobic chief of staff of his fathers consulting firm, who constantly promotes unhinged conspiracy theories  including one about how the Democratic Establishment keeps child sex slaves imprisoned at a popular Washington pizzeria. This week, a delusional  albeit morally courageous  man showed up at that pizzeria with a firearm, prepared to liberate those poor children. Also this week, CNN learned that Trumps transition team had sought to supply Flynn Jr. with a security clearance. Flynn Jr. has since been removed from Trumps transition team. But his father, who (apparently) felt his son deserved access to state secrets, is still slated to become one of the most powerful men in the world next January. Baselessly accused a private company of ripping off the government, shortly after the CEO of that company criticized his trade policies. On Tuesday, the Chicago Tribune published an article that mentioned Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburgs recent criticism of Donald Trumps trade policies. Twenty minutes later, the president-elect baselessly accused Boeing of ripping off the government to the tune of $4 billion, and announced his intention to cancel one of its major federal contracts. Its unclear whether the first development informed the second one. But its difficult not to infer a connection, given Trumps penchant for attacking all who criticize him, and the fact that there is factual basis for his tweets claim. (The U.S. Government Accountability Office has estimated that the entire Air Force One program will cost $3.2 billion between 2010 and 2020. However, Boeing has not even been awarded a contract to assemble the planes, only multimillion-dollar deals to design certain aspects of the aircrafts. If costs are out of control, Boeing has little to do with it  and there is no $4 billion contract to be canceled). On Friday, Boeing pledged $1 million to president Trumps inauguration.Week 2 (November 19 through 28)Questioned the legitimacy of the election he just won. Trump spent much of his campaign sowing doubts about the legitimacy of American elections, going so far as to suggest that Hillary Clinton was conspiring with international bankers and undocumented immigrants to steal the presidency through large-scale voter fraud. One of the few ostensible benefits of Trumps surprise victory was that the leader of the Republican Party would, presumably, stop sowing doubts about the integrity of our democracy. But Trump shattered that half-full glass on Sunday. In response to the Clinton campaigns decision to cooperate with the Wisconsin recount effort spearheaded by Jill Stein, Trump tweeted: Here, the president-elect condemns his opponents for refusing to accept the results of Novembers election  by declaring his own refusal to accept the results of that election; and suggests that the vote totals dont need to be audited, by claiming that that the vote totals are off by more than two million. But the problem with these remarks is much larger than unintentional irony. If Trump cant acknowledge a (functionally irrelevant) popular-vote loss, how might he respond to an election result that actually challenged his grip on power? Or, more immediately, how might he and his party go about ensuring that illegal voting (a.k.a. nonwhite voting) has less of an impact in 2020? Trumps tweets could foreshadow a coming push for nationwide voter suppression  if it doesnt foreshadow something much scarier than that. Appointed Ben Carson secretary of Housing and Urban Development  despite the fact that Carson has no relevant experience and recently declared himself unqualified for any cabinet position. Ben Carson is a retired neurosurgeon who has more experience hawking cancer-curing vitamins than managing a bureaucracy. Carsons personal assistant alluded to this fact earlier this month, when he explained that Carson did not want a cabinet position because he believed that his lack of government expertise could cripple the presidency. And then Donald Trump named Ben Carson as his pick for HUD secretary. Beyond Carsons lack of managerial experience, he has absolutely no experience in housing or urban policy. He does, however, believe that efforts to enforce the Fair Housing Act  which both prohibits discrimination in the housing market and requires municipalities to actively combat such discrimination  are communist. He also believes that that there is a broad scientific consensus that aliens built the pyramids  but that this consensus is wrong, because the biblical Joseph built the pyramids with help from God, as a means of storing grain. Carsons appointment suggests that Trumps preference for empowering incompetent loyalists over qualified professionals knows no bounds. Although, if Trump sees HUD primarily as a tool for enriching well-connected real-estate developers, Carsons combination of loyalty and grifting experience may make him uniquely qualified for the position. Allowed his D.C. hotel to actively court the patronage of foreign diplomats. The president-elect owns a company with myriad overseas investments, creditors, and partnerships  and a lot of permit requests pending before foreign governments. The number of conflicts of interest this situation creates is uncountable. And Trump knows that if he continues to ignore these conflicts  and simply shapes American foreign policy around his own business interests  theres little we can do to hold him accountable. The laws totally on my side, the president cant have a conflict of interest, Trump explained last week in an interview with the New York Times. And hes correct, to a point: The president is exempt from federal conflict-of-interest laws. Some legal scholars believe that the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution prohibits Trump from profiting off the gifts or payments of foreign governments. But absent the cooperation of congressional Republicans, it will likely be difficult to press that issue. Meanwhile, Trump is already leveraging his claim on the White House for everything its worth. Earlier this month, the Trump International Hotel D.C. provided 100 foreign diplomats with Trump-brand champagne and a request for their patronage. Several diplomats told the Washington Post that they intended to make Trumps hotel their delegations home away from home, so as to build ties with the new administration. Invited the manager of his blind trust onto a phone call with the president of Argentina. During the campaign, Trump promised that he would distance himself from his business interests by placing his assets into what he refered to as a blind trust, but is actually an entity that would allow him perfect knowledge of the assets he holds  and that would be managed by his children, who are now members of his transition team. Since winning the White House, Trump has refused to accept the (wholly inadequate) constraints this vow would place on his actions. The president-elect has already invited his daughter Ivanka  the manager of his blind trust  to a closed-door meeting with the Japanese prime minister, and onto a phone call with the president of Argentina. The day after that phone call, the Trump Organization received the Argentine governments approval to move forward on its high-rise development in Buenos Aires. Met with Indian business partners who have publicly declared their intention to capitalize on his status as president-elect. Trump took time away from his transition to meet with the developers of Trump Towers Pune, a pair of 23-story buildings in the west of India. We will see a tremendous jump in valuation in terms of the second tower, one consultant who worked on the project told the New York Times. To say, I have a Trump flat or residence  its president-elect branded. Its that recall value. If they didnt know Trump before, they definitely know him now. Tried to coerce Britain into appointing a right-wing extremist as its ambassador to the United States. After filling his own administration with racist incompetents whose primary qualification for high office is their loyalty to Donald Trump, the president-elect publicly requested that U.K. prime minister Theresa May do the same. Nigel Farage is a member of UKIP and an arch-critic of Mays Tory government. (Imagine if May publicly announced that many people wanted to see Harry Reid as Americas ambassador to Britain.) But using Twitter to sour Americas relations with foreign governments appears to be a core part of Trumps approach to diplomacy. Berated the media at a closed-door meeting for publishing unflattering photos of his double chin. Trump spent much of his campaign demonizing journalists as biased liars and/or the paid propagandists of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim. The moguls attempts to delegitimize the Fourth Estate have not let up since Election Day. In addition to making himself less accessible to press scrutiny than any president-elect in recent memory, Trump has also declared Americas most-read newspaper to be a failing institution, and invited the nations leading journalists to an off-the-record meeting  so as to berate them in person. At that meeting, Trump complained about everything from the tenor of CNNs campaign coverage to NBCs habit of publishing photos in which the president-elect appears to have a double chin. Its hard to imagine a worse way for a political figure to dispel concerns about his authoritarian tendencies than to attempt to dictate which images of himself can be publicly disseminated. Criticized the cast of a Broadway musical for asking the vice-president to work on behalf of all Americans. Mike Pence went to a performance of Hamilton on Broadway. A lot of liberals  and LGBT individuals  go to Broadway shows. And Pence believes in gay-conversion therapy, but not in same-sex marriage. So he was booed. After the show, a cast member told Pence from the stage, We, sir  we  are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights  We truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us. Pence took this in stride. Trump was furious that his safe space had been violated. Settled a fraud case for $25 million. The president-elect decided that the case against his defunct university was strong enough for him to accept a $25 million settlement. Admitted that his charity was guilty of self-dealing. After months of accusing Hillary Clinton of philanthropic corruption, the Donald J. Trump Foundation informed the IRS that it had violated the prohibition on self-dealing, which bars the heads of nonprofits from using their charitys funds to aid themselves. Previous reporting by the Washington Posts David Fahrenthold revealed that the president-elect had used his foundations money to pay out legal settlements, acquire Tim Tebow memorabilia, and purchase large portraits of himself. Week 1 (November 9 through 18)Derided protestors as paid professionals whose acts of free speech are fundamentally unfair. American presidents generally try not to discredit their detractors via patently false right-wing conspiracy theories  a point that someone on Trumps staff apparently relayed to him, as the president-elects Twitter account declared its love of the protestors passion nine hours later. Invited the manager of his blind trust to a meeting with the prime minister of Japan. Even before his election, Trump had already made a mockery of good government norms, by refusing to extricate himself from the myriad conflicts of interest his company presents. Instead, the president-elect promised to place his assets into what he refers to as a blind trust, but is actually an entity that would allow him perfect knowledge of the assets he holds  and that would be managed by his children, who are also members of his transition team. This week, Trump revealed that those children will also, apparently, take part in diplomatic meetings with the leaders of foreign countries. Assembled a team of racists to lead his White House. First, Trump tapped the allegedly anti-Semitic mastermind of an alt-right website as his chief White House strategist. Then, the president-elect tapped a retired general who believes that fear of Muslims is rational as his national security adviser. Finally, he named a man that a Republican Senate deemed too racist to serve as a federal judge in 1986  one who thinks the Voting Rights Act is intrusive, and (allegedly) told an African-American federal prosecutor that he should be careful what you say around white folks  as the head of the Justice Department. Took credit for the fact that Ford will not be relocating a plant to Mexico (which they never had any intention of relocating to Mexico). In truth, Ford opted to keep the Lincoln SUV production line in Kentucky, after considering moving it to Mexico  but in either event, the plant would have remained open, and no jobs would have been lost.But fake news outlets  and some not-so-rigorous real ones  celebrated Trumps victory, anyway. Declared Americas leading newspaper a failing institution. Trump has made a years-long habit of denigrating any media institution that accurately reports information he doesnt like. But the stakes of this behavior are drastically higher now that he leads the worlds most powerful country. Abandoned his press pool. Presidents-elect typically feel compelled to allow a pool of reporters to travel with them to public events, as a gesture to the publics right to have a watchful eye on its leader. Trump feels no such compulsion. Floated the idea of hiring his son-in-law to a White House position, in possible defiance of laws against nepotism and norms against conflicts of interest. Public officials are barred from hiring family members to agencies that they have authority over. They also, generally, avoid hiring the significant others of the heads of their blind trusts. Took calls from foreign leaders on unsecured phone lines, without consulting the State Department. Trump spent the 2016 campaign savaging Hillary Clinton for her reckless violation of the State Departments protocols for transmitting information. He has spent the past week taking calls from foreign leaders  on the unprotected phone lines of Trump Tower  without first soliciting pertinent briefings, in defiance of longstanding practice.Referred to his White House transition as though it were the next season of The Apprentice."}, {"date": "2017/02/28", "title": "Mayor de Blasio to Propose 90 New Homeless Shelters", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/mayor-de-blasio-to-propose-90-new-homeless-shelters.html", "text": " The New York Times reports on a de Blasio administration plan to open 90 homeless shelters in the city, an increase of nearly a third. This is the mayors latest attempt to tackle a crisis that has dogged his tenure. The number of people sleeping in shelters topped a record 60,000 in 2016, and reports of street homelessness have also spiked in the past year. The mayor unveiled his new strategy Tuesday. In addition to creating 90 new shelters over the next five years, the city will increase capacity at 30 more shelters. The city would rely on this expanded shelter system to curb, and eventually end, the practice of putting families up in hotels  which now costs the city about $400,000 a day, according to the Times. It will also eliminate cluster- or scatter-site housing by 2023, where the city pays private landlords to temporarily accommodate homeless families. That policy has tended to place people in crumbling apartments, often with less-than-reputable landlords; it came under fire after two toddlers died in a radiator explosion at a Bronx cluster site in December, in a unit owned by a notorious slumlord. Right now, about 18,500 people bed down in hotels or cluster-site apartments. But de Blasios policy is modest when it comes to reducing the overall shelter population: 2,500 people over five years, which adds up to a 4 percent decrease. The proposal is not without controversy. Homeless and housing advocates, while applauding de Blasios decision to stop relying on dangerous cluster sites or dumpy motels, say more needs to be done to increase access to affordable housing to prevent homelessness, and to facilitate the permanent move out of shelters. Many communities will likely bristle at the construction of new shelters. Residents have fiercely fought plans to convert a Holiday Inn into a shelter in Maspeth, Queens, and Sunset Park, Brooklyn, residents have protested the increase of shelters in their neighborhood. According to the New York Post, de Blasio will include an equity plan for these new shelters, so that theyre distributed more evenly across neighborhoods in the five boroughs, a goal that follows on the heels of a report in the City Council that shows that residential services, including homeless shelters, but also foster-care and mental-health facilities, are overwhelmingly concentrated in a few community districts. This latest move comes more than a year after Mayor Bill de Blasio introduced a flurry of initiatives in 2015 to try to tamp down the rise in homelessness. He pledged $6 billion over four years to tackle the crisis. The Department of Homeless Services went through a public shake-up and reorganization, and the administration set aside $10 million to help people facing eviction, devoted $22 million for outreach and case managers to help the mentally ill, and dedicated nearly $3 billion to build 15,000 supportive-housing units. And though the blame doesnt fall squarely on the current mayor  the shelter population reached record highs under Bloombergs administration, under whose tenure the city and state withdrew funding for a program to help people transition out of shelters  hes the guy in charge now, and up for reelection in 2017."}, {"date": "2017/02/28", "title": "Betsy DeVos Cites Jim CrowEra College System As Model of School Choice", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/devos-champions-hbcus-as-pioneers-of-school-choice.html", "text": " American public schools remain separate and unequal: Nonwhite students in diverse areas tend to be concentrated into majority-minority schools that enjoy less funding than majority-white ones. Across the United States, schools with 90 percent white pupils spend $733 more per student than those with 90 percent nonwhite students, according to a 2012 report from the Center for American Progress. Betsy DeVos believes that the solution for such inequities isnt to increase federal funding to impoverished school districts  or to take aggressive action against residential segregation  but rather, to divert federal funds away from public schools and toward (largely unregulated) private ones. The Education secretarys critics argue that this is a recipe for accelerating the resegregation of the American school system. After all, demand for private schools has historically been driven, in no small part, by white parents fears of integration: In the 11 years after the signing of the Civil Rights Act, an estimated half-million white students exited public schools for private ones. But even if one concedes that some black students may benefit from access to better-funded private schools, DeVoss vision remains unsatisfying. To believe that the de facto segregation of modern American schools can be solved by providing a small minority of black children with access to private education is akin to thinking that historically black colleges and universities, or HBCU, were a sufficient response to the de jure segregation of past centuries. But dont take my word for it, take Betsy DeVoss: This is the statement Americas Education secretary released after a meeting with the leaders of historically black colleges and universities.Of course, HBCUs did not reflect a triumph of school choice  the vast majority of their initial students had no choice but to attend a segregated college. And they didnt show that more options help students flourish, so much as they established that black people benefit from not being completely excluded from all forms of higher education. In the Jim Crow era, HBCUs provided a minority of black students a chance to attain higher learning and social mobility  even as the broader inequities of the public-education system kept most black children locked out of educational opportunity. Betsy DeVos sees this as a model for modern-day education reform."}, {"date": "2017/02/28", "title": "Report: The President Has Kicked His Habit of Live-Tweeting Morning Joe", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-has-kicked-his-habit-of-live-tweeting-morning-joe.html", "text": " Few things in life bring Donald Trump more joy than live-tweeting cable news.

And the moguls eccentric pastime has served him well  you cant kite-surf your way to the Oval Office, but you can, apparently, tweet your way there. But with great power comes great responsibility. During his first month in the White House, Trump continued to pursue his passion, waking up to MSNBCs Morning Joe every day, and sharing his impressions of the program with the good people of Twitter.com. When Joe Scarborough suggested that White House chief strategist Steve Bannon might be calling the shots in the Trump administration earlier this month, the president offered a prompt reply.

That significantly underestimates the issues importance to the GOP base. In fact, passionate support for efforts to go after Planned Parenthood may in the end force Republicans to go forward with Obamacare repeal legislation before they have a health-care plan together they can all support. Obamacare repeal and Planned Parenthood defunding have been repeatedly linked by conservatives in the past, not so much because they both involve health-care policy, but because they represent the two priorities for which Republicans most consistently are willing to risk a government shutdown. Indeed, the last two times Congress narrowly avoided a shutdown (in September and then again in December of 2015), it was the Planned Parenthood issue that nearly screwed up everything, in part because a lot of conservatives had vowed never to vote for an appropriation measure that funded Planned Parenthood, even though its abortion services have not been eligible for federal funding in many decades. The summer 2015 brouhaha over misleading videos purporting to show Planned Parenthood officials planning to make a bundle by selling fetal tissue  or as right-to-lifers prefer to call it, baby parts  revved up conservative hostility to the organization to a high-pitched chattering whine. While the 2015 shutdown was averted, in part because everyone knew Barack Obama wasnt going to let Congress defund Planned Parenthood, Obamacare, or the Syrian refugee program that was the other big conservative target, there was zero question the same pressure would return with a vengeance if, as turned out to be the case, Republicans won the trifecta in 2016. And indeed, the trial run budget reconciliation bill Obama vetoed early in 2016 included both the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and an end to funding of Planned Parenthood. No one should have been surprised that after the 2016 election Paul Ryan and other Republican leaders reassured conservatives Planned Parenthood defunding would again be included in the first big legislative package of the new era. Its actually never been excluded, and is again in the draft House GOP bill everyone is calling an Obamacare repeal that was leaked last week. So even as observers wonder if the extremely limited GOP opposition to the Planned Parenthood measure  basically a handful of House members and Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, the last of the dying breed of pro-choice Republicans  will mess up the Obamacare repeal, the question we should probably be asking is whether Republican doubts and divisions over Obamacare will mess up what would otherwise be a narrow but very likely vote to defund Planned Parenthood. With a president ready to sign a Planned Parenthood ban, the right-to-life movement is not going to be pushed aside by Republicans this time. And so if the budget bill repealing and partially replacing Obamacare gets delayed beyond a certain point, efforts to defund Planned Parenthood will shift to the must-pass legislation to renew the current-year appropriations due to run out on April 28. A report from Bloomberg Politics pointed to that possibility: And so, the conventional wisdom may have it exactly backward: Instead of the Planned Parenthood defunding effort being an extraneous obstacle to the Obamacare repeal effort, it could force congressional Republicans to get a move on lest the crusade against Planned Parenthood cause a government shutdown (produced by a Democratic filibuster of the underlying appropriations bill in the Senate) that would inevitably be blamed on the GOP as masters of Washington. Indeed, given the current hunger of Democrats for any kind of win, this scenario would likely end in a GOP surrender that would make the whole thing a terrible fiasco that might even leave Planned Parenthood funding in place. Even as they wring their hands over the risks they are running in repealing Obamacare without assurances that the whole thing wont blow up on them, congressional Republicans will likely obey one of their most important constituency groups by leaping into the void on Obamacare in order to defund Planned Parenthood. That is if, of course, Donald Trump goes along with it, and as we know, he is struggling to get up to speed on all this complicated health-care policy stuff."}, {"date": "2017/02/28", "title": "George W.

And thanks to an unusual one-term limit on Virginia governors, Democrat Terry McAuliffe will not be able to run for reelection. Until last month, it was assumed the one credible Democrat running for McAuliffes job would be his lieutenant governor and designated successor Ralph Northam. But then former one-term (20092011) congressman and Obama administration foreign-policy appointee Tom Perriello jumped into the race. Perriello, from Charlottesville, was an unlikely congressman, who in 2008 won what was considered a solid GOP House district with a textbook populist campaign combining economic progressivism with a degree of cultural conservatism. In Congress, his voting record earned him a 2010 endorsement from the NRA, and he also voted for an amendment banning coverage of abortion services by insurers participating in Obamacare. Owing to later adjustments by Perriello to his issue positions on guns and abortion to align himself with progressives, his surprise candidacy for governor was greeted with barrage of questions about his ideological reliability. Now, however, the worm may be turning, after a New York Times article on the Virginia race noted the little-known fact that Ralph Northam has admitted he voted for George W. Bush for president twice. His defense is that he was an apolitical doctor at the time, and he regrets his votes. But the disclosure reminded observers of reports that Northam came close to switching parties and awarding control of the Virginia Senate to the GOP in 2009. At a minimum, it seems Northam will be precluded from throwing stones at Perriello for ideological heresies. The other issue the Northam-Perriello contest is raising is whether Virginia Democrats should openly try to make the gubernatorial race a referendum on national politics generally, and Donald Trumps administration specifically. So far Northam is reflecting the traditional self-regard of Virginians by making his campaign totally about state issues, while Perriello is openly barnstorming against Trump and linking his campaign to anti-Trump protests in Virginia and around the country. Theres a case to be made for both approaches. On the one hand, the actual job of the Virginia governor has relatively little to do with whats going on in Washington. On the other hand, the party controlling the White House has lost nine of the last ten gubernatorial contests in Virginia (McAuliffe actually broke a 40-year streak in 2013), so its hard to believe national politics do not have some effect on the Commonwealth  an effect that, if anything, has been increased by the demographic dominance of northern Virginia, which is especially pronounced among Democrats. Northam locked up a lot of support from Virginia Democrats before Perriello entered the race, but between now and the June 13 primary, it will be interesting to see how much of the contest is about the past as opposed to the future, and about developments in Richmond as opposed to Washington."}, {"date": "2017/02/28", "title": "Deadly Yemen Raid Produced No Significant Intelligence: Report", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/deadly-yemen-raid-produced-no-significant-intel-report.html", "text": " A day after the father of Chief Special Warfare Operator William Ryan Owens, the Navy SEAL who died in last months counterterrorism raid in Yemen, questioned the motivation for the operation, U.S. officials told NBC News that the raid produced no significant intelligence. Why at this time did there have to be this stupid mission when it wasnt even barely a week into his administration? Why? For two years prior, there were no boots on the ground in Yemen  everything was missiles and drones  because there was not a target worth one American life. Now, all of a sudden we had to make this grand display? Bill Owens told the Miami Herald. A senior congressional official briefed on the matter told NBC News that the Trump administration has yet to explain what prompted the operation. Echoing Senator John McCains remarks following a classified briefing earlier this month, the official said that the raid was intended to kill or capture certain Al Qaeda militants. NBC News previously reported that Qassim al-Rimi, the leader of Al Qaedas Yemen affiliate, was the intended target, but U.S. Central Command, the Pentagon, and the White House have denied that. Pentagon officials have said the raid yielded actionable intelligence, and earlier this month White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said, We gathered an unbelievable amount of intelligence that will prevent the potential deaths or attacks on American soil. Spicer also said that anyone who criticizes the raid does a disservice to the life of Chief Owens. In his remarks over the weekend, Bill Owens said, Dont hide behind my sons death to prevent an investigation. When asked to respond to Owenss remarks on Tuesday, Spicer reiterated that the operation produced valuable intelligence. I can tell him that on behalf of the president, his son died a hero and the information that he was able to help obtain through that raid, as I said before, is going to save American lives, he said. The mission was successful in helping prevent a future attack or attacks on this nation. Spicer also noted on Tuesday that the Department of Defense is already conducting a review of the matter, which is standard operating procedure when a U.S. service member is killed. Owens did not elaborate on what kind of investigation he wanted to see, but on Tuesday VoteVets, a progressive veterans group, said the militarys internal review cannot examine the decision-making process at the top, and called for a congressional investigation. If the Congress can find time to hold multiple and repetitive hearings into Benghazi, it can certainly find the time to hold a single hearing into the botched Yemen raid, ordered by Donald Trump, the group said in a statement."}, {"date": "2017/02/27", "title": "Kansas Suspect Said He Shot Two Iranian People, According to 911 Phone Call", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/911-call-kansas-suspect-said-he-shot-two-iranian-people.html", "text": " Hours after 51-year-old Adam Purinton allegedly fired on two Indian men in a Kansas bar, he went to an Applebees in Clinton, Missouri, and told the bartender he had shot two Iranian people, according to a 911 phone call.

On the 911 recording, the bartender tells the dispatcher about the confession, and that the man had asked for a place to hide out. She also warns that police should not come with sirens blaring or Purinton might freak out and something bads going to happen.

Purinton was escorted out by the bartender after that encounter, though he apparently returned and opened fire on the men.

No doubt America desperately needs to fix crumbling roads and bridges, but apparently the MTA, which runs the Queens-Midtown Tunnel, did not take kindly to being singled out, or to the accusations that pieces of ceiling are falling on drivers heads.

The note was 431-words long, but could be summarized in just three: This changes nothing. It is critical that everyone who comes into contact with the NYPD, regardless of their immigration status, be able to identify themselves or seek assistance without hesitation, anxiety or fear, ONeill reminded New Yorks finest. The NYPD does not conduct civil immigration enforcement For example, the NYPD does not arrest or detain individuals for immigration violations such as overstaying a lawfully issued visa. However, the NYPD does and will continue to honor federal immigration detainers when there is a risk to public safety. Since November 2014, the NYPD has refused to enforce administrative warrants from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, except in cases involving undocumented defendants accused of serious crimes. At the time that policy was enacted, it created relatively little friction with federal authorities  midway through its second term, the Obama administration narrowed ICEs deportation priorities to felons and recent arrivals. But the latest guidance from the Trump administration broadens ICEs priorities to include nearly every undocumented immigrant in the United States. The Department of Homeland Security has instructed immigration enforcement to prioritize the deportation of anyone who engages in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter  a description that fits any undocumented immigrant who has used a fake social security number to qualify for gainful employment. The NYPDs disinterest in helping the White House with this project is shared by many other big city police departments. But it may not be shared by most rank-and-file NYPD officers. On Sunday, the Sergeants Benevolent Association president Ed Mullins discussed the Big Apples sanctuary city status on Gristedes owner John Catsimatidiss AM-radio show. Heres how Mullins summarized his union members position on cooperating with ICE (per Gothamists transcription): Here, Mullins argues that it is wrong for police officers to pick and choose which laws to abide by  while also suggesting that cops have a moral obligation to aid immigration authorities in defiance of municipal law. When New York City decided to withhold resources from immigration enforcement, it did not nullify federal immigration law. Rather, it asserted its 10th Amendment right not to be commandeered by the federal government into enforcing such laws. Ed Mullins may object to the prevailing interpretation of federal powers on this matter, but when he substitutes his judgement for that of the Supreme Court, he is the one encouraging cops to flout the law. Whether Mullins truly speaks for the average cop on the beat is unclear. But Donald Trump did enjoy outsize support from law-enforcement groups across the country during his campaign. And the enthusiasm for the president  and his policies  among rank-and-file law enforcement agents has already led some to pick which Constitutional protections they wish to honor. As Thomas Ricks writes in the New York Times: As a wise union representative once said, If thats the case, then were waiving all the federal laws for law enforcement officials  I mean, thats total lunacy."}, {"date": "2017/02/27", "title": "Did Democrats Just Begin an Electoral Comeback by Winning in Delaware?", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/with-delaware-win-did-democrats-begin-electoral-comeback.html", "text": " The $64,000 question for Democrats seeking to fight back against Donald Trump and a Republican Congress between now and the 2020 elections is whether their recent problems in turning out their voters, especially in nonpresidential contests, can be changed by the energy of a burgeoning anti-Trump resistance. The first real answer to that question may have occurred this weekend in a special state-senate election in the First State, Delaware. And though it would be unwise to assume it to set a reliable pattern, in this one case Democrats passed the test. The contest was over a seat in a state-senate chamber that was otherwise tied 1010. It was vacated by Democrat Bethany Hall-Long, who was elected Lieutenant Governor of Delaware last November. Republicans ran as their candidate John Merino, who lost the district by just two points in 2014. Given the exceptionally low turnout typically drawn by special elections, the GOP had every reason to expect a win and thus control of the Delaware Senate for the first time since 1972. But instead Democrat Stephanie Hansen won the seat by a landslide 5842 margin. Not coincidentally, over a third of registered voters in the district turned out, which is very good for a special election in midwinter (the weather on Election Day was unseasonably mild, but also included an unseasonably disruptive thunderstorm). The Hansen campaign represented a good combination of national assistance and locally driven messaging. The Democrat raised over twice as much money as her GOP opponent, much of it from small contributors around the country, and also benefited from significant independent expenditures. Local volunteers also had a lot of out-of-state help. But local factors mattered too, as Paul Blumenthal noted: Democrats will try to replicate their Delaware success in upcoming special elections for congressional seats  especially on April 18 in Georgias 6th District, vacated by HHS Secretary Tom Price, where Democratic newcomer Jon Ossoff has already raised nearly $2 million to compete in a huge field dominated by warring Republicans  and in the regular off-year elections in New Jersey and Virginia. Winning obviously matters most to Democrats, but the thing to watch in terms of future trends is turnout. If turnout is up significantly over past nonpresidential elections, Democratic odds of winning back the House and a goodly number of governorships and state legislative chambers in 2018 will go up accordingly, particularly if Donald Trump continues to tread water  or even sink further  in popularity."}, {"date": "2017/02/27", "title": "Donald Trump Has an Explanation for That Oscars Gaffe", "url": "http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/02/donald-trump-has-an-explanation-for-that-oscars-gaffe.html", "text": " The 2017 Academy Awards were sprinkled with political moments, and nearly all of them had to do with the current president.

A former distinguished head of the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department, and a powerful voice for workers empowerment as secretary of Labor, Perez was often considered the most progressive member of Obamas cabinet. When his name briefly emerged as a possible running mate for Hillary Clinton last summer, one of his main selling points was his ideological affinity to Democrats unhappy with Clintons reputation as a Wall Streetfriendly centrist. But after his narrow second-ballot victory in the contest for the DNC chairmanship over the weekend, Perez now stands as an Establishment party leader anxious to placate a Bernie Sanders constituency that was passionately invested in Representative Keith Ellisons candidacy. For many of the People of the Bern, placing Ellison (a key and early Sanders supporter) at the head of the party would have been a sign of their retroactive vindication after the bitter 2016 presidential nomination defeat, and an appropriate gesture of humility for Obama and Clinton loyalists who led the party to a calamitous general-election loss. What made the outcome worse for them is that Ellison had been the early front-runner; his loss felt like yet another narrowly unsuccessful effort to change the party, rebuffed at the last minute by the shadowy and sinister forces of the Establishment. Perez, of course, moved immediately to placate Ellison supporters by naming (as part of a prearranged mutual unity plan) the Minnesotan deputy chair. There are varying assessments of how successful Perez will be in unifying the party; Donald Trump will obviously provide a common enemy of gargantuan proportions (and indeed, his facetious expressions of sympathy for Ellison as the victim of another Hillary Clintonengineered rigged election wont help Sanders bitter-enders). But to the extent that the forces behind both the Sanders and Ellison candidacies view themselves as a permanent movement with deep roots in various efforts to resist corporate/centrist influences on the party dating back many decades, there will be no easy or automatic turning of the page. Policy analyst and Twitter commentator Matt Bruenig probably spoke for many former Bernie-or-busters in decrying Perezs election as a sign the Establishment would never give up the party without a fight, and in calling on the left to concede nothing going forward: If this sort of talk sounds familiar, it is precisely the sort of hostile takeover rhetoric we heard from the tea-party movement on the right, particularly following the GOPs 2012 defeat. They, too, had big ambitions for defeating their partys Establishment via primaries. Perhaps the left insurgents imagine themselves pulling off something like Dave Brats stunning victory over House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in June of 2014. But I would argue the real story of the Republican primaries of 2014 was that again and again the Establishment defeated tea-party challengers by preempting their message and agreeing to their policy demands. It is entirely possible the Democratic Establishment will take a similar tack. Indeed, you could argue that by getting behind Perez as the DNC candidate, non-Sanders Democrats have already initiated a process of preempting the Bern. Dave Weigel notes how different the Establishment response was in the similar context of a previous presidential defeat: Perez is a very different kind of Establishment leader. Now obviously preempting the populist uprising is to a considerable extent a matter of common sense, and not necessarily some sort of insincere factional coup. Democrats are all feeling, and sharing, the grassroots pressure to abandon past centrist tactics like reaching out to Trump as many Democrats did to George W. Bush, or identifying some sort of agenda that appeals to Trump voters by repudiating progressive policies. The kind of high turnout Democrats need for a reversal of fortune in scattered elections this year and the 2018 midterms will not likely be generated by a move to the center. The Republican landslide of 2014 depended on a similar calculation that loud-and-proud base politics would work in the diminished electorate of a non-presidential contest against the party of a less-than-popular incumbent. You can contend, however, that the Republican decision to embrace the tea party while crushing the life out of it as a party faction had some unintended consequences: laying the groundwork for a non-Establishment presidential candidate who had no particular principles other than inchoate defiance of all Establishments. Again and again, Donald Trumps rivals were self-estopped by their own extremism from successfully challenging Trumps. Democrats today, left and center, are in a very different position from the Republicans of the recent past. Party divisions over policy are a lot less numerous, and Democrats are united in wanting to use government for positive purposes in a way Republicans havent exhibited in 40 years. But the age-old challenge remains for partisans of every variety: keeping eyes on the prize of general-election victories instead of the fools gold of dominating ones own party. Thats as true for the Democratic Establishment types who keep frustrating left insurgents as it is for the insurgents themselves."}, {"date": "2017/02/27", "title": "George W.

Bush had been.During the GOP primary, Trump repeatedly observed that the last Republican president had not, in fact, kept us safe. The mogul further noted that Bushs foreign policy had made the Middle East a less stable place  at a cost of trillions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of lives. The president reiterated this critique, albeit indirectly, in his remarks before the Conservative Political Action Conference last week. Weve spent trillions of dollars overseas, while allowing our own infrastructure to fall into total disrepair and decay, Trump told CPAC. And by the way, the Middle East is in  I mean, its not even close, its in much worse shape than it was 15 years ago. If our presidents would have gone to the beach for 15 years, we would be in much better shape than we are right now, that I can tell you. On Monday, George W. Bush offered some (similarly fair) criticism of Trumps first month in office, albeit in more measured terms. Asked about the presidents recent claim that the (fake news) media is the enemy of the American people, Bush told the Today shows Matt Lauer, I consider the media to be indispensable to democracy  We need an independent media to hold people like me to account. Power can be very addictive, and it can be corrosive. Bush noted that Trumps rhetoric undermines Americas capacity to censure authoritarian regimes overseas for their attacks on press freedom. Its kind of hard to tell others to have an independent free press if were not willing to have one ourselves, Bush said. The former president also expressed his disapproval of Trumps travel ban, saying, I am for an immigration policy that is welcoming and upholds the law and suggesting that the orders focus on Muslim-majority nations undermined the bedrock of our freedom  a bedrock of our freedom is the right to worship freely. Finally, Bush said we all need answers about the Trump campaigns connections to the Russian government, though he declined to call for a special prosecutor to look into the matter. Generally speaking, former presidents try to refrain from criticizing the current occupant of the Oval Office too harshly. It is especially unusual for a former president to criticize an active commander-in-chief who belongs to his own political party. So, Bushs decision to voice his reservations about Trumps attitude toward Islam and the Fourth Estate is significant  and, for those who wish to defend the norms of our liberal democracy, somewhat helpful. Of course, if Bush really wanted to be a help in that regard, he could go back in time and avoid spending eight years hyping the threat of jihadist terrorism; undermining basic civil liberties; waging a disastrous war that discredited Americas political Establishment; ignoring a housing bubble that, eventually, discredited Americas economic Establishment; and drastically increasing the powers of the Executive branch.

Providing access to medical care to the tens of millions of Americans who cant afford it on their own, because theyre too poor or too sick, is arithmetically futile if youre bound by a dogma that opposes redistribution from the rich and healthy to the poor and sick. House Republicans have decided to resolve the contradiction between party dogma and the promise not to harm the public in favor of the former. A study prepared by the National Governors Association, and which leaked to the media Saturday evening, finds that the House Republicans leaderships formative plan to replace Obamacare will deprive millions of people of their insurance. The Wall Street Journal reports that Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, lacking the votes for a plan that would create massive humanitarian and economic damage to the health-care sector and millions of voters who would lose their access to care, want to just push the bill ahead anyway. Their purported calculation is that they can force wavering Republicans to go along with the bill for fear of betraying the noble cause of Obamacare repeal that has animated the base for years. Youre a Republican, youve been running to repeal Obamacare, they put a repeal bill in front of you  Are you going to be the Republican senator who prevents Obamacare repeal from being sent to a Republican president who is willing to sign it? said Doug Badger, a longtime Republican leadership health-policy adviser, tells the Journal. Juliet Eilperin and Amy Goldstein report that many of the most orthodox members of Trumps administration, including Mike Pence, who is close to Paul Ryan, side with this strategy. On the other hand, they report, numerous Trump advisers are concerned about the political fallout of blowing up the health-care system. These advisers include Jared Kushner, NEC director Gary Cohn, senior policy adviser Stephen Miller and chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon. And the reason they fear that is that Trump did not just run on repeal. He ran for president making irreconcilable promises on health care. To win support from voters, he promised terrific insurance that would take care of everybody. But to remain acceptable to Republican elites, he avoided embracing any policies that would violate party dogma against tax increases. The actual details of his health-care plan were fuzzy and usually ignored, but to the extent they existed at all, they consisted mainly of warmed-over conservative platitudes that would mostly resemble the old, pre-Obamacare system and do little or nothing to cover the uninsurable. Trump held together the contradiction by simply pretending the solution would reveal itself over time and would be extremely easy. Quite likely Trump believed this himself  as a committed nonreader, and a narcissistic devotee of his own negotiating prowess, he surely believed that he could broker a deal that would satisfy both the moral objective of universal coverage and the specific ideological hang-ups that had prevented his party from ever supporting a plan that would accomplish it in the past. The only thing that held Trumps position together was a refusal to engage with the substance of the issue, and a magical belief that it could all be waved away. At best, he will keep either his promise to the Republican elite or his promise to the electorate. At worst he will keep neither. His offhand comment that the issue is hard is a window into the mind of a man who realizes the jig is almost up."}, {"date": "2017/02/27", "title": "New York Magazine Competition No. 83: Wrong-Envelope Theories", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/new-york-competition-no-83-wrong-envelope-theories.html", "text": " Welcome back to the New York Magazine Competition.

President Trump believes that America spends far too little on its military. Over the past 24 years, the United States has increased its spending on border security 14 times  enough to finance a 500 percent increase in immigration-enforcement agents and more than 600 miles of border fencing. Since 2007, the number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. has flatlined. President Trump believes that America spends far too little on border control. Federal income tax rates are near historic lows for this country, and are far lower than many of our peers in the developed world. President Trump believes America is the highest taxed nation in the world and that rates need to be slashed immediately. The president also believes that corporate tax rates are too high; infrastructure spending is too low; Social Security and Medicare funding is just right; and the federal budget should, eventually, be balanced. That last conviction is, of course, in tension with all the others. But Trump appears to have a four-step plan for resolving that tension: 1. Pretend that it doesnt exist.2. Assume that his other policies will produce much higher-than-expected rates of economic growth. 3. Decimate anti-poverty programs and the Environmental Protection Agency. 4. Repeat Step 1. Or so emerging reports on the White Houses budget proposal would suggest. Per the New York Times: There are a couple of problems with this proposal. For one, the Pentagon sees climate change as a major national-security threat  so, financing your defense buildup by gutting the main agency responsible for combating climate change is a bit curious (or, would be, in a rational political universe). More fundamentally, Trump wont be able to offset the cost of his opulent ambitions on taxes and the security state by taking an ax to (nondefense) discretionary spending. Big cuts to the EPA and federal anti-poverty programs could certainly hurt a lot of people, but they wouldnt make a significant dent in the long-term debt. (Lower tax rates and higher annual military spending, by contrast, would). Whats more, as Trump prepares his gift to the military-industrial complex, the congressional GOP seems to be souring on the one piece of its tax plan that generates new revenue. The border adjustment tax is expected to deliver about $1 trillion over the next decade. But it is also expected to increase the tax burden of Walmart and other major retailers  and multiple Republican senators say they wont stand for such a thing. So, the GOPs tax plan is poised to become even more expensive, just as Trump begins selling Congress on a larger military, 15,000 new immigration-enforcement officials, and a border wall with a price tag as high as $21.6 billion. Trump seems happy to pretend that he can pay for all this by cutting food stamps and water inspectors (and/or putting it on Mexicos tab). The House GOPs budget hawks, however, may lack the presidents imagination. The original version of this article incorrectly stated that the cost of the border wall could be as high as $21.6 million; it is $21.6 billion."}, {"date": "2017/02/27", "title": "Mayor de Blasio Has Big Interview With Feds Over Fundraising Inquiries", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/de-blasio-has-interview-with-feds-over-fundraising-probes.html", "text": " Federal prosecutors and investigators grilled Mayor Bill de Blasio for about four hours Friday. The interview, which took place in the law offices of the mayors attorney, came after a nearly yearlong probe into the mayors campaign activities. Assistant U.S. Attorneys, including the chief and deputy chief of the Public Corruption Unit, and FBI agents, reportedly questioned de Blasio on a bunch of issues related to his 2013 campaign and his now-defunct nonprofit Campaign for One New York. Feds are exploring if the mayor or any members of his team traded political favors for those donations. De Blasio, who participated in the interview voluntarily, has denied wrongdoing from the outset. We remain confident that at all times the mayor and his staff acted appropriately and well within the law, the mayors press secretary, Eric Phillips, said in a statement. We hope our continued cooperation will help bring a swift conclusion to the U.S. attorneys review. According to the New York Daily News, federal investigators are honing in the mayors relationship to Moishe Indig, a rabbi and landlord, who co-hosted a fundraiser for candidate de Blasio in 2013. Feds are trying to find out if Indig lobbied de Blasio or his aides to reopen a Hasidic school that the city ordered shut because of building-code violations. The mayors press secretary has called these allegations a fabrication, adding, The mayor never intervened in this issue. Period. De Blasios big interview also coincided with the termination of an city official who okayed the lifting of deed restrictions on Rivington House, a Lower East Side nursing home and AIDS-treatment facility, which allowed it to be sold to luxury-condo developers for a $72 million profit. The Rivington deal is allegedly also under investigation by federal authorities. (Previous investigations, including an August audit report on the sale by the NYC Comptroller Scott Stringers office found mismanagement and errors, but nothing illegal in City Halls conduct.) But attorneys for Ricardo Morales, the former deputy commissioner at the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, insinuated that the timing wasnt an accident, calling it suspicious to the Daily News. A spokeswoman for the Department of Administrative Services responded that the personnel changes have been in the works for some time and have nothing to do with the mayors or City Halls cooperation with the U.S. Attorney. These investigations swirling around de Blasio  hes also been interviewed by the Manhattan D.A. on a state-related inquiry  might make him seem vulnerable in 2017 mayoral race. But as the New York Times points out, no credible Democratic candidate has stepped up to challenge him. Names that have been floated, including, at the top of the list, Comptroller Scott Stringer, appear to be in wait-and-see mode on these federal investigations. The Republican mayoral candidate, Paul Massey, a real-estate executive, has gone after de Blasio publicly in recent days, but likely still faces long odds at City Hall."}, {"date": "2017/02/27", "title": "Father of Navy SEAL Killed in Yemen Wouldnt Meet Trump, Calls for Investigation", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/father-seal-yemen-raid-meet-trump.html", "text": " Days after a U.S. counterterrorism raid targeting al Qaeda in Yemen on January 29, President Trump and his daughter Ivanka Trump went to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to witness the return of the remains for Chief Special Warfare Operator William Ryan Owens, the 36-year-old Navy SEAL who died during the raid. It was reported that the Trumps met with Owenss family, but over the weekend Owenss father, Bill, revealed that he refused to meet with the president. Owens told the Miami Herald that the family only found out the Trumps were coming a short time before the ceremony. I told them I didnt want to make a scene about it, but my conscience wouldnt let me talk to him, he said. Owens and his wife sat in another room as other family members met with the president. Owens, who is a veteran, told the paper that he didnt vote for Trump and was disturbed by his feud with a Gold Star family during the campaign. Now he has concerns about how the raid that killed his son was carried out, and hes calling for an investigation. Why at this time did there have to be this stupid mission when it wasnt even barely a week into his administration? Why? For two years prior, there were no boots on the ground in Yemen  everything was missiles and drones  because there was not a target worth one American life. Now, all of a sudden we had to make this grand display? Owens said. According to multiple reports, just about everything went wrong during the raid. While the mission had been planned by the Obama administration, Trump was given final approval. The White House said the president was briefed on the mission during a dinner with thenNational Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Vice-President Mike Pence, Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, son-in-law Jared Kushner, and other top aides. Owens was the only U.S. service member killed, but five other U.S. military personnel were injured. A number of civilians, including children, were also killed. Despite reports that the mission failed its primary objective  to capture or kill Qassim al-Rimi, the head of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula  White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer insisted that it was a huge success, and said anyone who suggested otherwise was disrespecting Ryan Owens. President Trump also mentioned Owens in a series of tweets attacking Senator John McCain for questioning the mission. Dont hide behind my sons death to prevent an investigation, said Bill Owens. I want an investigation, he added. The government owes my son an investigation, he said. When asked about Bill Owenss remarks Sunday on ABCs This Week, Deputy White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, I know that the mission has a lot of different critics, but it did yield a substantial amount of very important intel and resources that helped save American lives and other lives. When asked if the president would support an investigation into the Yemen raid, she said, I would imagine that he would be supportive of that. The military is already conducting an investigation, which happens anytime there is an American casualty. As the Washington Post notes, Owens appears to be calling for a formal inquiry into the decision-making process for the raid, which probably means it would fall on Congress to open an investigation. He did not respond to requests for clarification. In an interview with New York Chuck Hagel, who served as secretary of Defense under President Obama in 2013 and 2014, said he did not want to second-guess what happened during the Yemen raid, since he does not have all the facts and such missions are always dangerous. But he did weigh in on reports that the operation was reviewed by the president over dinner:"}, {"date": "2017/02/27", "title": "GOP Leaders Bet Wavering Republicans Lack the Guts to Stop Obamacare Repeal", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/gop-leaders-bet-republicans-lack-the-guts-to-stop-aca-repeal.html", "text": " For seven years, Republicans campaigned and won on the message that Obamacare must be repealed and replaced as soon as possible. One month after unexpectedly finding themselves with a Republican in the White House and a majority in both chambers of Congress, its become apparent that Republicans arent going to quickly coalesce around a plan to overhaul the U.S. health-care system. The conservative House Freedom Caucus has vowed to oppose any repeal measure thats less extreme than the one passed in 2015, while other Republican lawmakers have expressed concerns about forging ahead with a repeal plan that could leave millions with no coverage  especially after enduring raucous town hall events during last weeks recess. Facing one of those angry left-leaning crowds in Iowa last week, Republican Representative David Young admitted that even with their majorities, the party cant completely trash the law. The Affordable Care Act is not going to be repealed outright, Young said, because theres not the votes and theres not the support. But according to The Wall Street Journal, GOP leaders now have a plan to get around that: set repeal legislation in motion and bet that rank-and-file Republicans wont have the guts to vote against killing the Affordable Care Act. GOP leaders hope to embark on this road as early as this week. The first step is passing legislation currently being crafted in the House that does away with key elements of Obamacare. As the Journal explains, the initial bill would contain some elements of a GOP replacement plan, but much of the new system would be worked out after the Affordable Care Act is no more. Republican leaders hope to pass the initial legislation via the reconciliation process, which only requires a simple majority  but its still a risky move. If the measure loses more than two votes in the Senate and 22 in the House, it will fail. The House Freedom Caucus has roughly 40 members and at least half a dozen Republican senators have expressed reservations about repealing Obamacare without a coherent replacement plan. Their calculation is that after years of promising to repeal Obamacare, Republican lawmakers wont be willing to vote no on a bill that could actually kill the law, even if it doesnt meet their criteria for reforming the health-care system. Plus, theyll be facing pressure from a party leader with a megaphone like no other. The presidents going to be very pivotal in this, Representative Dennis Ross, a member of the House GOP whip team, told the Journal. Hes got to go into these districts and give air cover to these members who are weak-kneed on some of these issues. That may be the most obvious flaw in this plan. President Trump certainly has the ability to make wavering Republican lawmakers lives miserable, whether by holding a rally in their districts or merely firing off a few tweets. But getting the president onboard with the GOP leaderships Obamacare repeal strategy, and maintaining his focus, may be an issue. According to the Washington Post, President Trumps views on health care were still shifting just a few days ago, thanks to a visit from an old rival: Trump reportedly instructed Price and his chief of staff Reince Preibus to meet with Kasich, and the president was still discussing the topic during his lunch with governors Scott Walker and Rick Scott on Saturday. So if Walker, Scott, or some other White House visitor shared an interesting Obamacare replacement plan with the president, the GOP leaderships perilous plan may be DOA."}, {"date": "2017/02/27", "title": "WATCH: The Oscars Got Political", "url": "http://www.vulture.com/2017/02/a-supercut-of-all-of-the-oscars-political-references.html", "text": "  Dont worry.

After an extensive review process, Bilden said, I have determined that I will not be able to satisfy the Office of Government Ethics requirements without undue disruption and materially adverse divestment of my familys private financial interests. In a separate statement, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis added, This was a personal decision driven by privacy concerns and significant challenges he faced in separating himself from his business interests. Mattis said he would recommend a new candidate to the White House in the coming days. Bilden served as an intelligence officer in the Army Reserve from 1986 to 1996, then moved to Hong Kong to launch an Asian presence for HarbourVest Partners LLC, which the White House described as a global private equity investment management firm with institutional assets under management currently in excess of $42 billion. Bilden had recently retired from the company. Last week, Major Garrett of CBS News reported that Bilden was likely to withdraw, but the Pentagon issued a statement from Mattis saying Bilden had assured him he was committed to serving if confirmed. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer also shot down the story on Twitter: Bilden is the second of Trumps nominees for service secretary to step down owing to business conflicts. Earlier this month, billionaire investment banker Vincent Viola withdrew as Army secretary. His team explained that the challenges of separating Mr. Viola from the organizations that he has built over the last thirty-five years have proven insurmountable. Earlier this month, Trumps pick to replace National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, retired Vice-Admiral Robert Harward, and his nominee for Labor Secretary, Andrew Puzder, also withdrew their names from consideration."}, {"date": "2017/02/27", "title": "Former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on How Mattis Can Stand Up to Trump", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/ex-pentagon-chief-hagel-on-how-mattis-can-stand-up-to-trump.html", "text": " Chuck Hagel was Barack Obamas Secretary of Defense in 2013 and 2014: a period spanning several international conflicts, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the apex of Syrias civil war. Before that, he was a centrist Republican senator who was often maligned by the right flank of his own party. Few others know so intimately the challenges Trumps DoD pick, General James Mattis, will face in his new job. Ditto the travails of centrist GOP senators, balancing party loyalty and patriotic duty. Now a senior adviser at Gallup and a distinguished executive-in-residence at Georgetown University, Hagel spoke to Daily Intelligencer by phone last week on everything from the real reason we need our NATO allies and the right way to fend off government leaks to why trade is actually a national-security issue. Trump has promised a lot of foreign-policy measures that would obviously be disastrous. A lot of us have wondered, So when do the brakes get put on? Who stops him from doing these things? Do you think Mattis is a promising candidate?First of all, I know General Mattis very well. I worked with him. I knew him when I was in the Senate, when I would often get to Iraq and Afghanistan and deal with Central Command commanders. As Secretary of Defense, I presided over Mattiss swearing-in and his retirement. Hes a very accomplished, bright military leader. He has tremendous capability and experience with so much, and he does bring to that job a perspective that the president and vice-president and their closest advisers do not have. And it appears that the president has great confidence and trust in General Mattis. Thats key. On the other hand, General Mattis has never been outside of the military culture. Hes been a Marine with a uniform on for 40 years. That isolates him. It doesnt mean he hasnt had exposure in NATO and other commands hes had, but look at the experience base of past secretaries of Defense: Carter, Hagel, Panetta, Gates, Cohen, Aspin, Perry, Brown. Its been a group of individuals with varied experience bases, wider than just our military. A secretary of Defense has to deal with more than just military issues. Hes got to deal with the politics of that job every day: the politics of being in the White House, which are some of the roughest. Certainly the politics of Capitol Hill, behind closed doors and before committees and so on. The politics of the media. Others have expressed concerns that Mattiss appointment could erode civilian control of the military. Do you share that concern?I do share the concern that we do not want to in any way erode that principle, which I think is vital. There hasnt been an appointment like this, as you know, since General Marshall was secretary of Defense right after World War II. He was also Secretary of State. Ive always thought General Marshall was one of the greatest Americans of the 20th century. He did a tremendous job. So it doesnt mean that Mattis cant do a good job with this, but I think people will be watching to make sure that that premise still holds and stays strong. How did your civilian experience benefit you?My experience in starting jobs, working with people, knowing how to find quality people helped me every day in trying to pick talented people at the Pentagon. My 12 years in the Senate and active politics helped me navigate the political landscape. Being chief of staff to a congressman gave me some perspective on what it takes for the staff to do their jobs. Do you have any opinions about Steve Bannons appointment to the National Security Council? Does it seem to threaten the non-political nature of the job?As far as I know, theres never been a president who has actually formally appointed his chief political adviser to the principals committee like this. This goes back to how each president runs the show the way he wants to run it and how he feels most comfortable. But I dont think you want political people in those meetings. I just dont think its smart to do it, and I dont think it adds anything. It could well inhibit conversation, because it implies that the President may be making national-security decisions based on political optics or political reasons. That should not be. What do you make of the accounts of Trump being at war with the deep state  with the entrenched bureaucracy in intelligence and security agencies?I actually only know what I read in the papers. Im not in any kind of a loop anymore. I think this president has to be very careful on this issue, especially in publicly second-guessing, or even diminishing or dismissing, intelligence professionals. There are two reasons. One is that people who are in that business, like in any business of government, who are essentially public servants, do it mainly because they have a high purpose and they believe in things. When the leader of the country starts to diminish or question that, it is really dangerous, because it damages the internal culture. And No. 2, it rattles the confidence and trust of the American people in the very institutions that are charged with carrying out vital intelligence work. It sends a bad signal all the way around. Ive been disturbed by some of the things that the president has said. I know that has caused some deep concern within these agencies. That needs to get turned around. Do you see any place for leaks? Any situations where theyre in the public interest?There are always going to be leaks. I have watched, over the years, president after president come into office and say, No more leaks. Were going to stop the leaks. Thats complete folly. You will never do that. The way I always conducted everything  when I was in the Senate, when I was secretary of Defense, any of these jobs I had  was to tell my staff, Remember, there are no secrets in Washington. You may get away, or somebody may get away with something for a while, but it will come out, because the tentacles are wrapped around agencies and individuals and government and everywhere so tightly and deeply that you will never stop the leaks. That doesnt mean that you just take a laissez-faire attitude and say, Well, if theyre going to happen, theyre going to happen. Absolutely not. Youve got to maintain as much discipline as you can. Leaks are not good for the country, in the sense that they further destabilize our government and destroy the confidence and trust of the American people. But you have try to minimize it at the source. Why do people leak? Lets talk about that. One motive is stature within the media  getting a nice mention in the New York Times or some paper. But I have also found that the leaks come as a result of people believing that theyre being shut up or shut off in institutions, and that things are happening too secretly, and may be wrong. They feel obligated, morally or patriotically, to alert the media. But theres a better way to handle it. If a public official believes somethings going wrong, and the administration or whoever is covering it up, that individual has other options than just quietly giving it to the New York Times or The Wall Street Journal. They can go to their congressman or their senator quietly. We cant have just a free-for-all. It seems as though NATO might be one area where your views harmonize with Trumps  yes? Youve both said that other member countries need to be paying their fair share.I dont agree with how he did it, almost threatening them. Im going to tell you what I think he does not understand. Weve gotten as much out of NATO as any country in NATO has. Yes, weve paid the bill, but can you imagine if we would not have had NATO, and a unification Europe, in particular Turkey, because they were right there on the border of those Soviet socialist republics for all those years, connected into the Middle East, connected right into the Soviet Union. That alliance has been hugely important for us. Weve gotten so much out of it. If we would not have had that, and the adjunct of having the French and the British and the Italians and the Germans and their submarines and their ships and their intelligence adding to ours, we would have had to pay for that. All of it. NATO did as much as anything else to stabilize the world, and much of that was predicated on trade. Yes, contributing 2 percent of GDP is there in the founding charter of NATO, and its something that every nation should aspire to, but heres the other piece of that: You take those front-line countries, the Baltics all the way down to Poland and Romania and Bulgaria and Turkey, and what they add in value by virtue of their geography should give them some credit. Should other member countries be doing better? Yes, Germany being a good example. Theyre coming up. The British have been coming up. Its fair, as [former Defense Secretary Robert] Gates has talked about, as Bush has talked about, as Obama has talked about, to continue to push for 2 percent, but I dont agree with going beyond that. So you think Trumps calculation of the value is skewed.Thats exactly right. Its the same with TPP: He doesnt understand the value of moving all these countries over there into our orbit, not to Chinas. TPP is not just a trade deal. Its bigger than that. Its winning friends and influencing people and hearts and minds. He discounts the value of that completely, and I think its very dangerous. It just pushes people closer to China. When youre trading with people, youre getting to know them. There are student exchanges. It means agriculture. It means technology. It means so many things where youre back and forth with each other. Youre getting along. What do you see on the horizon for Syria, and what do you think the Trump administration should do there?I started going to Syria back in the late 90s when I first started meeting with Hafezs side, as I met with his son Bashar Assad. Syria is endemic to whats going on in the Middle East. Those religious, cultural, ethnic differences are historic and are not going to be solved by the military  by anybodys military. Its going to take some platform of stability being established, and I think thats where the Russians and the Iranians and the Turks were trying to go, where Kerry was trying to go, I think, too, to at least get some workable cease-fire. If you can do that with some common interest, you can start taking this to the next level. The mistake the United States has made is starting with the principle that Assad must go. You cant start with that issue because youll never go anywhere with it. The Russians and the Iranians have been clear. Second, I think eventually youre going to have to have some pan-Arabic military coalition with the governments to bring some stability, almost like a NATO or U.N. force. These are down the road. There are a lot of different opinions for the future. Should you break off parts of Syria and give it to the Kurds? The Turks will never agree with that. Youve got all these different interests in play. How about the situation in Yemen? What did you think of the recent raid?I dont know the facts on it. I was involved in a number of those when I was secretary of Defense, to get hostages and to different things. I can tell you theyre always complicated, theyre always dangerous, and theyre always risky. Im not going to second-guess it. The decision was reportedly made over dinner I heard that, yeah. I dont know if its the case, but Ill tell you, you cant sit down around a dinner table with the president, and say, Okay, lets go do it. When I was secretary of Defense with President Obama, these decisions were made by a full-blown National Security Council. You had the FBI director, the CIA director, the National Director of Intelligence there. The Attorney General was there. You had everybody in there. This needs to really, really be worked through. Timing is always huge, because theres always a certain amount of nature that plays into this. Youve got to do these usually when theres not a full moon, or you look for rain or dust storms, and then youve got to have good enough intelligence. Its not just sitting down at a dinner table saying, Well, were ready to go. Obama took hours going through this, and consulted everybody, examined every piece, and still everything was risky. If Trump does try to fulfill his more outlandish campaign promises  like welcoming a nuclear-arms race, killing the families of terrorists, starting a trade war  what role do you see for principled, moderate Republicans? If you would call them that. I mean people like McCain and Lindsey Graham.Im not sure you can categorize people the same way you could 20 years ago. Theres only one person I would consider a genuine, real, moderate Republican: Susan Collins. But I just dont think those labels fit anymore. I think its better to talk about the role of the more center-right Republicans who take a more international approach to issues. The ones who are very pro-trade, very pro-engagement, are not hawks necessarily. The Republican Party today is probably made up of four different variations of Republicans. Youve got your domestic-focused Republicans, youve got your economic-focused Republicans, your internationalist Republicans, and your hawk Republicans. The Democrats are more cohesive in their philosophy. But I dont think you can really define Republicans and Democrats as all these different general labels that we used to, because you have a political world today thats bifurcated in so many different ways. When I ran for Senate 20 years ago, everybody was connected to a party. That was a big deal, to get the party nomination and the primary and so on. Now its more about the individual: the individual brand of John McCain or Elizabeth Warren, or whomever it is. Fine, but whatever category you put them in, people like McCain and Graham and Susan Collins risk being alienated by their parties if they resist the presidents agenda.McCain, to answer your question, is a category unto himself. There is nobody like John McCain in the Senate. The POW status, a former presidential candidate, been around a long time. Whether you like him or dislike him, whether you respect him or not, he is an institution himself. Graham has made his bones by being McCains Sancho Panza. Lindsey doesnt have the same stature that John does. There are others, but yes, people like McCain can make a difference, and I think will be a check in many ways on Trump going too far."}, {"date": "2017/02/26", "title": "As Many As 100 Headstones Vandalized at Jewish Cemetery in Philadelphia", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/nearly-100-headstones-toppled-at-jewish-cemetery-in-philly.html", "text": " As many as 100 headstones were knocked over at a Jewish cemetery in Philadelphia overnight Saturday in what may have been an anti-Semitic hate crime. The Philadelphia Inquirer reports that some 75-100 headstones were found lying on the ground at the Mount Carmel Cemetery in the citys Wissinoming area on Sunday morning, and that there is no evidence of similar damage at the three apparently Christian cemeteries which are adjacent to Mount Carmel. This is beyond vandalism, one police captain told the Inquirer after surveying the damage. No arrests have been made, and police do not appear to have identified any suspects. A GoFundMe account has been launched to solicit donations to help repair the damage, and that effort was already underway on Sunday: The Anti-Defamation League and the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect have spoken out against the crime, which they link to an escalating series of anti-Semitic incidents throughout the country over the past few months. Just last week, 154 headstones were found knocked over at a Jewish cemetery in a suburb of St. Louis, Missouri. Police say they havent found any evidence to suggest that vandalism was a hate crime, but they havent ruled it out either. Vice-President Mike Pence visited the Missouri cemetery last Wednesday to condemn the crime and anti-Semitism more broadly, and that followed President Trump breaking his much-criticized silence on the issue the day before."}, {"date": "2017/02/26", "title": "Migrants Faced More Than 3,500 Attacks in Germany Last Year: Report", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/more-than-3-500-attacks-on-refugees-in-germany-last-year.html", "text": " There were 3,533 attacks on migrants and shelters for asylum-seekers in Germany last year, according to a preliminary report from the countrys Interior Ministry. Those attacks, more than 2,500 of which struck individual migrants when they were out in public, left 560 people injured, including 43 children. Nine-hundred-and-eighty-eight attacks targeted housing, and some 217 refugee organizations and volunteers were attacked as well. All told, that means that migrants and their advocates faced an average of ten attacks per day in 2016. Those numbers mark what is likely a dramatic increase in violence against refugees in the country. Amnesty International reported last June that there were 1,013 crimes committed against refugee shelters and nearly 1,300 violent crimes committed against racial, ethnic, and religious minorities in Germany in 2015. Amnesty also concluded that German authorities had largely failed in their efforts to address the growing violence. People who have fled their home country and seek protection in Germany have the right to expect safe shelter, the Interior Ministry said in a statement accompanying the 2016 data, which was released in response to a parliamentary question. As the BBC points out, 280,000 asylum seekers arrived in Germany in 2016, down from more than 600,000 in 2015. The migrant crisis, and German chancellor Angela Merkels once open-armed policy toward admitting asylum seekers from Syria and other countries has become a major political issue in Germany, and has also greatly influenced the political debate around immigration in other European countries. Merkel and her political coalition face what is expected to be a tough general-election fight in September, largely due to logistical and cultural concerns within Germany about the integration of the migrant newcomers, as well as fears that the influx has increased the threat of terrorism. Some of the terrorist attacks that have struck Europe over the past few years  like the one which killed 12 people at a Christmas market in Berlin in December  were perpetrated by asylum seekers, and that connection has been emphasized by anti-immigrant groups on the far right, including in Germany. There have also been some false news stories stoking Islamophobia in the country, and opposition to Merkel, as well. As a result of the concerns over migrants, Merkel and her allies have worked to slow the pace of admission for additional migrants, as well as accelerate the removal of refugees whose requests for asylum have already been denied. However, as Deutsche Welle notes, the asylum decision process in Germany continues to take a very long time. At the end of 2016, some 59,000 asylum seekers had been waiting for more than a year-and-a-half for a decision, up 13,000 from the same time period in the previous year. In addition, while the number of migrants being allowed into Germany has dropped significantly, the number of applications for asylum there has gone up, and at present, more than 400,000 applications remain unprocessed."}, {"date": "2017/02/26", "title": "White House Staffers Leak News of Spicers Phone Check Targeting Leaks", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/spicers-staff-leaks-news-of-phone-check-targeting-leaks.html", "text": " Last week, White House press secretary Sean Spicer conducted a surprise phone check on his staff in an effort to stamp out leaks, according to a new Politico report. Spicer, upset that information had leaked out of a previous meeting he had held with roughly a dozen members of his staff, ordered another meeting and had staff surrender their phones and other electronic devices when they arrived. The search  which applied to both personal and government-issued phones  was overseen by White House lawyers, and Spicer then warned staffers against using privacy-focused messaging apps like Signal and Confide, noting that doing so violates the Federal Records Act. He also, per Politicos sources, warned the group of more problems if news of the phone checks and the meeting about leaks was leaked to the media, which it promptly was. President Trump and his administration have been repeatedly complaining about the many leaks that have come out about their governing efforts, and Spicers is not the first attempt to get a handle on the problem. The State Department recently sent a legal memo to its staff outlining the dangers of leaking, which we know about because the memo was itself leaked. Then on Friday, President Trump criticized the FBI and called for an investigation after sources at the agency leaked that FBI officials had refused White House requests for them to leak information to the press in order to dispute leaked accounts of contact between Trump officials and the Russian government. Then again, while Trump has called for going after leakers, he has simultaneously accused news organizations of inventing the sources of the leaks, as well as insisted that the leaks are real, but the news based on the leaks is fake. Furthermore, a New York Times report out on Saturday makes the point that Trump used to be the leaker-in-chief when it came to publicizing himself to New York tabloids back when he was just a fame-craving real-estate mogul and not the president.

McMaster, has reportedly spoken out against the use of the term radical Islamic terrorism  a notable break with the president and many others on the right when it comes to talking about the war on terror. Radical Islamic terrorism has become a kind of catchphrase for Republicans and other conservatives in recent years as they have sought to claim, at least in theory, greater political credibility with regards to the threat of terrorism. To that end, Trump has repeatedly emphasized the phrase and regularly ridiculed anyone who tries to label terrorism differently, while others in Trumps inner circle like chief strategist Steven Bannon have embraced the idea that the struggle against terrorism is in fact the beginning of a full-on religious war. According to the New York Times, The Guardian, and CNN, McMaster told members of the National Security Council during his first all-staff meeting on Thursday that he felt that radical Islamic terrorism was an unhelpful way to describe terrorism, particularly since becoming a terrorist is actually un-Islamic in the first place. People at the Thursday meeting say that McMaster also indicated he was not on board with using the term, as he also doesnt like how it seems to dismiss an entire religion. If the reports about McMasters comments are accurate, that would mean that the Iraq War veteran has already differentiated himself from his ousted predecessor, Michael Flynn, in a significant way. Flynn had made a series of Islamophobic remarks during Trumps presidential campaign, at one point tweeting his opinion that Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL, and additionally claiming that political correctness toward Muslims was putting the U.S. in danger. Islam is not a real religion, Flynn said over the summer, but a political ideology masked behind a religion. It would seem that McMaster does not hold the same views. Looking at previous administrations, Presidents Obama and George W. Bush sought to keep terrorism and Islam separate in their rhetoric. Their assumption, which reflects the thinking of most counterterrorism experts, was that allowing the War on Terror to become confused with a war on Islam would hamper U.S. counterterrorism, both because such rhetoric would echo and aid the propaganda and recruitment efforts of jihadist groups and because U.S. counterterrorism efforts so often rely on alliances with Muslims and Muslim-led governments around the world. On the other side, Republicans have argued that disconnecting terrorism and Islam signals an unwillingness to recognize the real threat of terrorism, though its never been totally clear how the alternative rhetoric would actually improve counterterrorism efforts. President Trump, meanwhile, seems likely to continue using the term. In a speech on Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference, the president promised attendees that we are going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. The Guardian reports that some White House staffers who still favor the term, like Trump, exchanged some awkward looks during McMasters comments on Thursday, but so far there hasnt been any indication of official pushback from the White House regarding the issue. There is also, however, no way of knowing if McMasters more moderate views regarding the religious affiliations of terrorists will have any real impact on Trump administration policy."}, {"date": "2017/02/26", "title": "Trump Will Not Attend White House Correspondents Dinner", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-will-not-attend-white-house-correspondents-dinner.html", "text": " President Donald Trump tweeted on Saturday that he will not be attending this years White House Correspondents Dinner in April. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening! he added to the announcement. While it certainly breaks with tradition, Trumps decision not to break bread with the media is not a huge surprise considering how wholeheartedly he and the White House have embraced open combat with anyone who publishes journalism that is critical of him or his administration. On Friday, the White House barred four news organizations, the New York Times, CNN, Politico, and the Los Angeles Times, from attending the daily press briefing. Two other news organizations, the Associated Press and TIME, then boycotted the briefing as a result. In addition, several news organizations had also already decided to skip, or scale back their involvement in, this years White House Correspondents Dinner in protest of Trumps ever-escalating war on the media. The White House Correspondents Association has announced that they will still hold the event whether Trump attends or not. The event has been and will continue to be a celebration of the First Amendment and the important role played by an independent news media in a healthy republic, WHCA president Jeff Mason told the Washington Post. We look forward to shining a spotlight at the dinner on some of the best political journalism of the past year and recognizing the promising students who represent the next generation of our profession. The somewhat-odd, increasingly celebrity-laden event is usually attended and headlined by the sitting president, as well as a comedian who is brought in to roast the president and press corps. Many had already surmised that it was unlikely that the typically thin-skinned Trump would elect to sit through such a experience this year.

But in the end, former Labor Secretary Tom Perez defeated Rep. Keith Ellison and an assortment of dark horses with 18 votes more than he needed to become chair of the Democratic National Committee at the partys winter meeting in Atlanta. There was some drama, as one dark horse, South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg, dropped out just before balloting began. He did not endorse either of the front-runners, but one of his most visible backers, Howard Dean, switched his support to Ellison. There was also grumbling from the Ellison camp when Acting Chair Donna Brazile announced the electronic-voting system set up for the election would not be used out of fears of external interference. After the first ballot, Perez was just one vote short of the 218 needed, but Ellison was in striking distance with 200 votes. In the end, Perez, who had a progressive reputation but had become the favorite of party centrists and loyalists to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, had just enough broad support to edge Ellison 235-200. The Minnesota congressmember was very much the candidate of the Bernie Sanders camp and of other Democrats who thought retaining and mobilizing the energy of Sanders supporters was critical to the immediate future of a party fighting Donald Trump. When Brazile announced Perezs win, there were scattered chants of Not big money, party for the people. But there was mostly silence in opposition to the motion to make the election unanimous. Now the unity gestures will begin, though you can be sure media, Democrat-friendly and -unfriendly, will be on the lookout for angry veterans of the Bern who are unreconciled to another victory for the Democratic Establishment. One source of disgruntlement may be a vote taken just before the balloting for chair in which a resolution restoring a ban on corporate donations to the DNC was tabled. But Perez moved quickly to close the ranks, asking and receiving unanimous consent to name Ellison deputy chair of the DNC, an appointed position. Ellison promptly provided Perez with a brief unity pitch, calling further factional conflict a waste of time and energy. The DNC is now going through the time-consuming process of electing its lower-level officers.

Forty-four-year-old Muhammad Ali Jr., a native-born American citizen, claims he was detained and questioned after arriving at Fort LauderdaleHollywood Airport on February 7, according to a family friend and lawyer who reported the incident to the Louisville Courier-Journal and Miami New Times. Ali Jr. was apparently held up for nearly two hours, during which time he was asked, Where did you get your name from? and Are you a Muslim? by officials. His mother Khalilah Camacho-Ali, the famous boxers second wife, was also briefly detained but then released after producing a photo of her and her former husband. The mother and son were returning to the U.S. from Jamaica, where they had attended a Black History Month event in Montego Bay. Its not clear why their experience was not made public until now. According to Chris Mancini, the family friend and former federal prosecutor who passed along the incident, Ali Jr. did not have a photo of himself with his father and was separated from his mother at the airport and then twice asked about his religion by officials. A spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection told the New Times that she could not confirm or discuss the individual case due to privacy laws, but noted that all international travelers arriving in the U.S. are subject to CBP inspection. Mancini believes that Ali Jr.s experience was an example of federal officials seeking to enforce President Trumps January 27 travel ban  which targeted the foreign nationals of seven predominantly Muslim nations  even after the ban was blocked by federal courts. What right does the United States have to inquire about somebodys religion when they enter the country? he remarked to the New Times, further claiming that the government is still trying to find grounds to keep Muslims out.

But not just any boat. Specifically, the Spirit of Mount Vernon, a three-story monstrosity of casino-style carpeting and damp furniture floating in the Potomac River, just a few yards from the Gaylord International Hotel in National Harbor, Maryland. They were onboard Friday evening for the Breitbart luau, held in celebration of the annual Conservative Political Action Conference which, in 2017, is 44 years old. Hawaiian attire optional but encouraged, the invitation, decorated with an illustration of a dead pig branded with the Breitbart logo, read. Mahalo! The boat had been set to depart at 8 p.m. sharp but, due to an overwhelming number of invitees who expressed worry about being trapped on a boat for an extended period of time with the people who invented Milo Yiannopoulos, the plan changed. The boat would stay docked from 7:30 p.m. to 11 p.m., and all who entered would be given a lei of fuchsia flowers and be encouraged to purchase a tropical beverage made with blue curaao from the cash bar. CPAC is the most famous conservative confab in America. Ronald Reagan, its attendees are eager to inform, spoke here 13 times. And in recent years, its been the place where fringe right-wing figures were laundered into the mainstream: Its where Donald Trump gave his first major political speech, as well as a frequent stop for Ted Cruz, Sarah Palin, Ben Carson, Michele Bachmann, Mike Huckabee, Rand and Ron Paul, and virtually every other modern conservative politician youve ever heard of (hell, even the ones you havent heard of: Jim Gilmore was next to me at the bar here earlier). In the years leading up to a presidential election, CPAC is where the Republican primary field takes shape; its difficult to run without developing a name for yourself among the thousands of conservatives who spend between $150 and $5,000 to be here, and the strategists, pundits, and journalists who come to watch. But the speeches and panels about guns, abortion, and the stealth start of World War III (a real panel that took place this week, in two parts over two days; the conceit being that the war has begun but few people have noticed) are not the main event. The parties are, ranging from your standard D.C. cocktail fare to the utterly deranged. In previous years, there was former Texas congressman Steve Stockmans hot-tub party, or any number of parties at the Breitbart Embassy (the name for Steve Bannons townhouse) featuring live music and Louie Gohmert and countless frat-style hotel parties involving elaborate ice luges. The Breitbart party had always been the hottest ticket in town, with politicians, strategists, pundits, and reporters all vying to get an invite, or figure out how best to sneak in  these guys did seem to be having the most fun, after all. But this year, the year that Breitbart achieved its ultimate electoral triumph, something was off. Although word around CPAC was that security would be tight, the crowd in the Spirit of Mount Vernon was so patchy that party crashers seemed a welcome presence. CPAC in 2017 was in some ways defined by Breitbart. It was Breitbart, not establishment conservatives, who supported Trump throughout the Republican primary, long before it seemed possible he could be president. In the main hallway, the website had a sedan-sized booth where its well-known writers, like the spherical Matthew Boyle, lingered and shook hands with readers. And Bannon, who departed the website to join the Trump administration as the presidents chief strategist, spoke on a panel with White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, an event moderated and granted legitimacy by Matt Schlapp, the president of the American Conservative Union, CPACs host. This was a departure from years past, when Breitbart was the scrappy outsider and it wasnt yet evident that the fringe right had any real power. In 2013 and 2014, Breitbart hosted off-site events called The Uninvited for those not welcome on the premises, like Ann Coulter, who was, it seems unbelievable now, deemed too controversial. I didnt like The Uninvited, Schlapp said, while introducing Bannon and Priebus onstage. Everybodys part of our conservative family. But like a family, not everyone gets along. With a controversial Republican in the White House, conservatism finds itself in the midst of an identity crisis. Establishment figures like Schlapp have been rendered irrelevant while Breitbart, with its newfound influence and staffers joining the administration, is attempting to mainstream itself by poaching from places like The Wall Street Journal. And the new fringe? Well, the big debate this week was whether its poster boy, Yiannopoulos, had in fact advocated for pederasty. The various CPAC parties on Friday night, then, were like a boozy tour through this perilous terrain. God has his hand on America, the land of plenty, Dog the Bounty Hunter told me, and nobody is getting in American leadership right now that Gods not allowing. He was standing in the back of the boat, leaning on an intricate wooden cane, his sunburned chest bursting through a shirt he barely attempted to button. His wife, Beth Chapman, a Hillary Clinton donor turned Trump supporter with a shockingly beautiful face, held court nearby. While Dog dispensed compliments to passersby (he told me I have bright eyes and ran his hands through Jezebel reporter Prachi Guptas hair), Beth attempted to convince a young woman working for Project Veritas, James OKeefes undercover video outfit, to investigate something. Earlier in the evening, the couple had hosted a cocktail hour in the Gaylords Chesapeake suite in honor of Milwaukee sheriff David Clarke, a Trump booster who some are attempting to draft for the Senate in 2018. Not far away, Nigel Farage, the British populist politician who campaigned for Brexit, was dutifully posing for selfies and smoking a cigarette. OKeefe, meanwhile, sipped his blue cocktail and walked around the boat with his camera crew for what he said was a documentary. At one point, he agreed to pose for a photo wearing a lei and holding a pineapple. Was this the party everybody had been trying to crash all those years? Guests began to stream out early in search of the next fun thing. A number of members of what was described to me as the new right congregated in Shellys Back Room, a cigar bar on F Street back in D.C. There was the host, Mike Cernovich, a social-media personality who was instrumental in spreading rumors about Clintons failing health during the election, and Michael Flynn Jr., the conspiracy-minded son of recently departed National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Before long, OKeefe was at this party, too, sans herbaceous perennial. The scene here, Cernovich correctly assessed, was lit. Cernovich once proudly identified with the alt-right, but he said those days were over. The movement had been ruined, he complained, by neo-Nazis like Richard Spencer, who was kicked out of CPAC on Thursday. Richard and the alt-right can have their little sandbox, he said. Im new right  its different. He sees himself in this group, he said, with Alex Jones, the conspiracy-theorist radio host and founder of Infowars; Paul Joseph Watson, the Infowars editor; Tucker Carlson, the Fox News host, a choice that might surprise some; and Yiannopoulos, whom he continues to believe in despite his recent controversy. He was almost in the majors, he said of Yiannopoulos, but hell be back in a year. These were not, he was careful to clarify, members of the alt-right. That group, he complained, only had his initial support due to a misunderstanding. I didnt realize it was, like, a white, ethno-nationalist thing, he said. They lost it with the Nazi salute. Asked if he would punch Spencer in the face, as some had taken to doing upon seeing him in public, Cernovich said no. Hes a cake boy, he explained. What did that mean?

It is, functionally, a State of the Union Address, though by custom (and the wording of the constitutional mandate for this big speech) presidents dont give SOTUs immediately after taking office. So its a big deal, which all major and many minor media will cover live. Aside from its value to Trump and to the Republicans who will cheer him, the event offers Democrats an opportunity to show a unified and vigorous response. Who, then, will the donkey party, newly energized by a consensus favoring maximum opposition to the new GOP trifecta regime and its frightening leader, offer up to rally the troops? Elizabeth Warren? Bernie Sanders? Al Franken? Maybe a gubernatorial symbol of resistance like Jerry Brown? And if not a well-known political veteran perhaps a rising star like Kirsten Gillibrand or Cory Booker? How about even a baptism by fire for whomever wins the DNC chairmanship this weekend? Nope. The Democratic response will be given by former Kentucky governor Steve Beshear. Hes been out of office for over a year, and is a 72-year-old politician who first won public office during the Nixon administration. And far from having a reputation as a masterful stem-winding speaker, he once delivered an address in the middle of a reelection campaign at a site where red meat is the only thing ever on the menu, and instead did one of those tribute to our troops speeches more suited for a VFW conference. Choosing Beshear invokes a questionable tradition. Remember the last official Democratic response to a GOP presidential address? Me either. I had to look it up: It was delivered in 2008 by another Democratic governor, Kathleen Sebelius, and was later rated one of the five worst State of the Union responses ever. I did remember Tim Kaines snoozer of a response to George W. Bush two years earlier, which is one reason I described him as boring when he was chosen as Hillary Clintons running-mate last year (though I thought, erroneously it seems, that excitement was not what the ticket needed for victory). Sandwiched between these two gubernatorial efforts was Jim Webbs passionate response to W. in 2007, which strikes me as a pretty good template for the tone Democrats want right now. Like fellow centrists Kaine and Sebelius, Beshear has some credibility issues with progressives. In his case, its a retrograde defense of Kentuckys same-sex marriage ban just three months before the Supreme Court made it irrelevant (Beshear did adjust quickly, unlike certain other Kentuckians). There is, of course, a logic to Beshears selection, as explained by Matt Yglesias: Obamacare is enjoying an upsurge of support right now, and no matter what the erratic Trump decides to talk about, touting the success of Obamacare in Kentucky  one of its brightest spots, even though the Bluegrass State is quite conservative and went easily for Trump  is something that is relevant in almost any event. By talking about what the people of his state gained by fully complying with Obamacare, and what they could lose if Trump and his party ever get their act together to repeal it, Beshear is well-equipped to put Republicans on the spot and cast some doubt on the triumphalist gloating that will surely characterize the presidents address no matter where he ultimately veers. It is worth remembering, additionally, that a lot of the passionate rhetoric of resistance to Trump, especially at congressional town hall meetings, is precisely about GOP efforts to throw people off of their health insurance. But still, unless hes very loud and proud, Beshear could disappoint Democrats expecting righteous anger, not just good health-care policy and some telling anecdotes. I dont know what sort of thing would really infuriate Steve Beshear and put him in an appropriate mood to take on Trump. Maybe his handlers could tell him the 45th president has called his Kentucky Wildcats (Beshear has two degrees from the university, and was once student body president) losers."}, {"date": "2017/02/24", "title": "Leaked House Obamacare Repeal Draft Shows Dangerous Work in Progress", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/house-obamacare-repeal-draft-dangerous-work-in-progress.html", "text": " It is not clear whether its a trial balloon, a diversionary gesture, or a sign of things to come, but Politico has gotten hold of a discussion draft of House provisions repealing (on a staggered timetable) and partially replacing Obamacare, a chore Congress must take on sooner rather than later as part of a budget plan put into motion a week before Donald Trump took office. Heres Politicos own summary of its find: The leaked draft was dated February 10, so it may have already been superseded. But it is more detailed than previous publicly available material on what Republicans were up to. Much of what is in the draft reflects immediate changes in the Affordable Care Act that have long been expected: substitution of an incentive for continuous coverage for Obamacares purchasing mandate, and money for states to set up high-risk pools to help the otherwise uninsurable. As Sarah Cliff points out in her take on the draft, theres a lot more money for high-risk pools, and steeper penalties for letting coverage lapse, than in past GOP schemes. A ban on the use of federal funds by abortion providers like Planned Parenthood would apparently take effect immediately, too. Many of the other provisions would be phased in or delayed until the beginning of 2020. Those include the elimination of Obamacares minimum benefit package; cancellation of the higher federal dollar match offered in the ACA for expanding Medicaid; and replacement of Obamacares means-tested purchasing subsidies with new tax credits ranging in value strictly based on age, which is treated as an acceptable indicator of health needs. Also repealed is Obamacares limits on insurance company price discrimination against old folks. So when its all phased in, older people not yet eligible for Medicare could face sharply higher premiums, but receive some tax subsidies not limited by their own incomes. The Medicaid provisions are very complicated, but it looks like states that expanded Medicaid under ACA will have until 2020 to keep their higher federal-match payments  but then they are gone. And then all states will have to cope with a per capita cap on the total amount of dollars they receive from Washington for the Medicaid population. That big fiscal hit (bigger in the out years) will presumably be matched with flexibility for states to run Medicaid as they wish, with little or no guarantees of coverage for any specific individuals  in other words, it will no longer be an entitlement. Another big feature of the draft is that Obamacares various taxes are repealed and then replaced with the long-standing GOP idea of limiting the tax deductions businesses receive for providing employee health insurance. Like Obamacares highly controversial and congressionally delayed Cadillac tax, the new provision would expose high-cost employer-sponsored premiums to taxation. When GOP presidential nominee John McCain proposed that in 2008, Barack Obama very effectively accused him of favoring a tax increase. The inclusion of this potentially toxic provision may help explain some of the plans omissions, too, like money for that perennial conservative favorite, Health Savings Accounts to cover routine medical expenses. It could be this draft was really aimed at testing the revenue, spending, and health-coverage consequences the Congressional Budget Office will deduce when the actual bill is sent to CBO for scoring. HSAs could be held back temporarily to address (at least theoretically) some big hole in coverage. Or maybe this draft is already ancient history. We will know soon enough, but in the meantime, its interesting to see all the loose talk about Obamacare repeal and replacement reflected in legislative language."}, {"date": "2017/02/24", "title": "Leaked DHS Report Undermines Trumps Argument for His Travel Ban", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/leaked-dhs-report-undermines-trumps-argument-for-travel-ban.html", "text": " Citizenship in one of the seven Muslim-majority countries included in President Trumps travel ban is an unlikely indicator or terrorism ties, according to a report from the Department of Homeland Security published Friday by the Associated Press.

Further, it says, while Iraq, Yemen, and Syria have terror groups that may attack the U.S., the other four counties in the ban  Iran, Libya, Somalia, and Sudan  are regionally focused.

Paul Ryan is attached to the idea. Business is deeply split. Nobody knows what Donald Trump thinks, or even if thinks is the applicable term to describe his position on the matter. Several weeks ago, Trump came out against the tax. (Anytime I hear border adjustment, I dont love it.) Yesterday, he made favorable noises about it. (It could lead to a lot more jobs in the United States.) This morning, his chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, told reporters Trump does not favor the tax, and then this afternoon the White House disavowed Cohns comments. (There is no daylight between Gary Cohn and the President. His comment was taken out of context as it was part of a broader conversation about the proposals that are connected to border adjustability. At no point during this conversation did Gary make a statement of support or opposition to the House border adjustability plan.) The border adjustment tax is an incredibly complex idea that even well-informed economists have trouble wrapping their heads around, so the idea that Donald Trump has a position on it is a weird fiction that his fellow partisans are being forced to humor. In the meantime, even if the spinning wheel of Trumps position on the border adjustment tax lands on yes, the odds that such a plan can be passed into law are low. Republicans require near-unanimity to pass their tax plan, since they have only 52 Republican senators. A plan that deeply threatens certain businesses  like Walmart, among others  is either not going to pass or it will pass only if its filled with loopholes. If its filled with loopholes, its useless, since the reason Republicans like Ryan want it is to raise revenue that can be used to offset the lost revenue from cutting taxes for the rich. (I explain the dynamic here.) Ryans plan is to design a tax cut that can be scored as revenue-neutral after ten years, which would allow Republicans to make it permanent, rather than having it expire after a decade, like the Bush tax cuts did. But Ryans strategy is collapsing. It requires repealing Obamacare first  to lower the baseline of tax revenue, and create a lower target to hit  and then to include a border adjustment fee. Obamacare repeal is on life support, and the border adjustment fee is hardly in better shape. Stephen Moore and James Wallner from the Heritage Foundation propose an audacious strategy to get around this problem. They advise Republicans give up on the border tax and also give up on a revenue neutral plan. Revenue neutrality is a trap, they write. It requires that one mans tax cut be offset dollar-for-dollar by anothers tax increase. This is correct. Moore and Wallner then propose, fancifully, that Republicans get around the ten-year-sunset problem by enticing Democrats to support a gigantic tax cut for the rich. Our reading is that many Democrats understand the imperative of business tax cuts, they write. If the entire business community is unified behind this measure, this would be a very tough no vote for Senate Democrats, especially in Trump-carried states. In reality, the prospects of finding at least eight Senate Democrats to vote for a gigantic tax cut for the rich are essentially zero. Moore and Wallner concede that it might not work, in which case, Republicans could then just pass their big tax cut with 50 Senate votes and let it sunset after a decade. This is very likely where the party is going to land. In the meantime, theyre chewing up a lot of precious time and effort on a Plan A that stands little chance."}, {"date": "2017/02/24", "title": "A Bunch of Cities Are Sweating Through the Hottest February Day on Record", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/a-bunch-of-cities-are-having-the-hottest-feb-day-on-record.html", "text": " Unseasonably high temperatures continued to make February feel more like May on Friday, with new record highs seen across the Midwest and into the Northeast.

He then conceded that there might be bubble dynamics in some regions, but that the housing market was healthy, on the whole. I dont think a catastrophe is very likely, Hassett told the paper. On Friday, Politico reported that president Trump plans to name Hassett as the chairman of his White House Council of Economic Advisers. If nominated and confirmed, Hassett would lead the office tasked with projecting the future economic implications of the Trump administrations tax and budget plans. Trump has evinced little interest in the advice of academic economists. It is unusual for a president to complete his first month in the Oval Office without nominating a single economist to the CEA. And his administration has already announced that, unlike during Obamas tenure, the CEA chair will not be a cabinet-level position. The administration did, however, (reportedly) instruct the existing CEA staff to assume that economic growth will hover around 3 percent over the next decade when calculating the impact of tax cuts on the deficit. The CBO and Federal Reserve project annual economic growth to hover around 1.9 and 1.8 percent, respectively, for most of the coming decade.

But the precise terms of that accommodation were not clear until Trump himself addressed the conference today: Conservatives must give up their philosophical principles in exchange for policies they favor and the popular support they crave. Amazingly, Trump spoke for an extended period to an exclusively conservative audience and never used the terms liberty or limited government or free enterprise. He used the word freedom exactly twice. Once was in a reference to the TPP agreement being a threat to our economic freedom, a characterization that  until recently  few mainstream conservatives would support. The other was in boasting about his election win: That was also the speechs only clear reference, explicitly or implicitly, to the brand of conservative values that have dominated the discourse at CPAC for decades. Trump did offer a lot of crowd-pleasing lines, roughly divided equally between attacks on common enemies like the non-conservative elements of the news media, and promises to pursue specific policies most conservatives like, from defense spending increases to tax cuts to deregulation to aggressive exploitation of fossil fuels. But invariably Trump framed his policies not with the traditional memes of movement conservatism, but as expressions of his one clear guiding principle: nationalism. Or, as he put it: The core conviction of our movement is that we are a nation that will put its own citizens first. While patriotism, of course, is a common touchstone for American conservatives (and for liberals, though conservatives often have trouble acknowledging it), nationalism disassociated from the idea that America distinctively stands for universal values  e.g., freedom or liberty or limited government  is not a value Republicans have traditionally embraced. Presumably many of the same people who cheered Trump at CPAC also cheered George W. Bush when he used to talk about freedom and democracy being Americas gift to the world, a gift worth fighting to defend and extend  rhetoric Ronald Reagan also used throughout his career (otherwise his favorite rhetorical reference to America as a shining city on a hill is nonsensical). The idea that Trump isnt asking conservatives to change that much simply is not true. Hes asking them to acknowledge that discarding their most cherished positions in order to vanquish their foes and achieve their immediate goals is absolutely necessary, with his electoral victory after the defeat of more conventional leaders like McCain and Romney being the proof. And thus he represents the eternal temptation of right-bent political thinkers and actors everywhere and at every time to overcome their scruples and embrace populist demagogues. As Trump ended his speech and the room was filled with his odd campaign anthem, the Rolling Stones You Cant Always Get What You Want, for the first time I saw the song as entirely appropriate. Conservatives cannot elect a president who talks only or mostly of freedom and capitalism or of those Western values that transcend the nation-state. But they can win with Trump, so theyll get what they need, at the mere expense of their principles, if not their souls."}, {"date": "2017/02/24", "title": "Trumps Rollback on Transgender Bathroom Rule Is Just the Beginning", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trumps-nixing-of-transgender-bathrooms-just-the-beginning.html", "text": " Most weeks, New York Magazine writer-at-large Frank Rich speaks with contributor Alex Carp about the biggest stories in politics and culture. Today: Trumps rollback of the rights of transgender students, a feckless Rex Tillerson, and the CPAC conference. The Trump administrations rollback on the bathroom rules for transgender students this week was reportedly driven by Jeff Sessions, over the reservations of Betsy DeVos, with the final decision made in an Oval Office meeting. What do we learn by where Trumps support came down?Its not news that America now has a president who will roll back civil rights and endorse bigotry. This is a White House, let us not forget, that refused to either remember or condemn anti-Semitism when purporting to honor Holocaust Remembrance Day. But nonetheless we did learn a little bit more about both Trump and his administration from this chilling decree. We received confirmation (if there were any doubt) that Attorney General Sessions was lying when he made a big show of denying (or at least trying to cover up) his record as a foe of civil-rights enforcement during his Senate hearings. Discarding the rights of transgender students is clearly just a warm-up act for a Justice Department that will work hard to dismantle the rights of other minorities  including the voting rights of African-Americans and any others who might threaten GOP rule at the ballot box. So radical is Sessions that even a hard-right ideologue like DeVos can seem relatively moderate next to him  though only up to a point. Once the Sessions edict prevailed, she quickly fell in line behind it. We also learned that all this talk of members of Trumps family serving as moderating forces on his worst impulses is hooey. Melania Trump had claimed that her cause as First Lady would be bullying. That was a lost cause before her husband took office  his entire career in business and politics has been a cavalcade of bullying  but now that he has institutionalized bullying as president, shes an accessory to the crime. (No wonder she entered a witness protection program shortly after the inauguration.) Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, who supposedly intervened to get Daddy to back down from his contemplated reversal of President Obamas anti-discrimination protections for LGBT Americans, either stayed silent or had no influence this time. Trump wasnt even loyal to poor Jackie Evancho, the 16-year-old singer who risked ridicule by performing at his Inaugural and has a transgender sister: Evancho was reduced to begging through Twitter for the president to meet with her this week. Equally impotent is Caitlyn Jenner, who pimped for Trump during the campaign, and who could be found yesterday on Twitter releasing a jocular, tone-deaf video reassuring transgender kids they have nothing to fear and inviting the president to call her to discuss his betrayal of his pre-election stand that transgender people should have the right to use whatever bathroom they feel is appropriate. Her protest is too tame, too late, and too tainted by her previous Trump sycophancy to aid young transgender Americans who now may be more vulnerable than ever. Just as Trump unveiled his new immigration decree  pledging to deport undocumented immigrants to Mexico, whether they are Mexican or not  Rex Tillerson began his first official visit there. Is there room for the secretary of State in the conflict over the border?Sessions aside, its not clear that any cabinet officer has much sway in an administration run by a tight non-cabinet inner circle, most notably Steve Bannon and Kushner. Tillersons month at State has been one long humiliation. He has not been present at most of Trumps meetings with foreign leaders. He has not been available to the press. He has had no discernible effect on foreign policy (to the extent there is a final policy). His attempt to hire his own deputy, Elliot Abrams, ended in embarrassment when the White House blackballed Abrams on the grounds that he had been critical of Trump during the campaign. Tillersons visit to Mexico this week, accompanied by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, was nothing if not a public confirmation of his irrelevance. Even as he was saying all the appropriate things about the friendship between the United States and Mexico, his boss was back in Washington slurring Mexico once again as a conveyor belt for criminals, toying with the notion of cutting back American aid to Mexico to pay for the wall, and readying a new anti-immigrant edict that would be as toxic to Mexicans as to Muslims. Poor Kelly had to step to a microphone to specifically contradict Trump, promising that there would be no mass deportations of illegal immigrants and no use of military force against them  both of which the president had been touting. Well see how long this stab at independence lasts. Tillerson and Kelly  and quite possibly the widely admired new national security adviser H.R. McMaster  will soon have to put their balls into the same escrow account as Betsy DeVoss spine. Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus took the stage at this weeks CPAC conference, marking a rare public appearance for Bannon and offering the first direct glimpse of their working dynamic. What did you see?This dog-and-pony show was meant to show that these two rivals for White House turf were pacific colleagues, and that therefore all press reports saying otherwise are fake news. The rare glimpse of Bannon in action revealed two things about him: (1) He could roll over the milquetoast clerk Priebus anytime he wanted to; (2) He looks so unhealthy he may not be around long enough to be on hand for that showdown. The fawning questioner at this Bannon-Priebus propaganda event made no mention of Bannons role in making a star out of Milo Yiannopoulos, the transgressive provocateur who until his resignation this week was a senior editor at Bannons Breitbart News. Yiannopoulos had also been on the bill at the CPAC conference until the world suddenly rediscovered a taped appearance in which he spoke with genuine feeling about the virtues of pedophilia for underage boys. Presumably Bannon knew of his senior editors thoughts on that topic  that incriminating public video dated back to early 2016. So far Bannons own position on pedophilia remains unknown."}, {"date": "2017/02/24", "title": "Trump Praises First Amendment, Calls for Media Suppression and Fewer Protests", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-praises-first-amendment-calls-for-media-suppression.html", "text": " On Friday, president Trump said that the media shouldnt be allowed to cite anonymous sources  because Americas most respected newspapers routinely make up such sources, and publish stories of their own invention. He reiterated his contention that fake news outlets like the New York Times, NBC News, ABC News, CBS, and CNN are the enemy of the people, and suggested that Americans should not protest their government in between elections. The president also said, I love the First Amendment  nobody loves it more than me. Trump and his administration have been waging a war on objective reality  and those tasked with describing it  from the moment he was sworn in. In his first appearance as White House press secretary, Sean Spicer demanded that reporters believe the presidents estimate of the size of his inaugural crowd over their own lying eyes. As Trumps tumultuous (and not terribly productive) first month in office progressed, he grew ever more preoccupied with discrediting the Fourth Estate. On Thursday, at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Steve Bannon and Reince Preibus instructed the audience not to believe any negative news they read about the administration, over and over again. By the end of their conversation, the word media had been spoken 19 times, and the phrase opposition party, Bannons favorite synonym for the mainstream press, six times. It wasnt terribly surprising, then, that the president opened his remarks to CPAC with a long diatribe against the media. But Trumps speech did represent a significant escalation in his crusade against independent journalism. Previously, the president had criticized the press for printing illegal leaks from anonymous government officials and suggested that those officials have often shared false information. But hed never before claimed that major newspapers were fabricating sources out of whole cloth and presenting works of fictions as reportage. The leaks are real. Youre the one that wrote about them and reported them, I mean, the leaks are real, Trump told reporters at a press conference last Thursday. You know what they said, you saw it and the leaks are absolutely real. As of Friday morning, the president still maintained that the anonymous officials quoted in the media were genuine members of the government. But hours later Trump suggested that reporters cant find actual government officials to leak to them, and thus are forced to invent them. A few days ago I called the fake news the enemy of the people. And they are. They are the enemy of the people, Trump said. Because they have no sources, they just make em up when there are none  Im against the people that make up stories and make up sources. The people that make up stories ostensibly includes all of the major outlets listed in this recent tweet. Late Thursday night, the Trump administration admitted that it had encouraged the FBI to anonymously leak exculpating information about the presidents relationship with Russia. On Friday morning, Trump declared, They shouldnt be allowed to use sources unless they use somebodys name  They should put the name of the person. You will see stories dry up like youve never seen before. Then, after briefly praising the First Amendment, the president said that media doesnt represent the people, and were going to do something about it. Trumps only substantive argument for why his audience shouldnt trust the media was that most of these outlets pre-election polling suggested that he would not win. He then credited the Los Angeles Times poll for its singular accuracy. That poll predicted that Trump would win the popular vote, making it one of the least accurate national polls of the 2016 cycle. But in the presidents telling, fake news outlets and skewed pollsters arent the only ones who have been abusing their First Amendment rights  the other enemies of the American people are  the American people who didnt vote for Donald Trump. Referring to the town hall protests in support of Obamacare, Trump said, The people that youre watching, theyre not you. Theyre largely  many of them are the side that lost, you know they lost the election. Its like, how many elections do we have to have? The election is over. The worlds biggest fan of the First Amendment won.

Trump reading from the text is stilted and halting, often mispronouncing unfamiliar words (seq-wes-chure? he sputtered, trying to pronounce sequester), while the free-form Trump is the familiar authentic narcissist. What made his speech to CPAC especially entertaining was the fact that the tonal contrast between his written and extemporaneous remarks mirrored a substantive contrast. The formal text was designed to position the president as an outsider-populist. But Trump kept interrupting his own speech with anecdotes that destroyed his own premise. The GOP will be, from now on, the party also of the American worker, he vowed, articulating one of the speechs primary intended themes. We will not answer to donors or lobbyists or special interests. Trump interspersed this bold promise with stories about him answering to donors, lobbyists, and special interests. Here is Trump in this same speech boasting about his meeting with a bunch of large companies: Here is Trump, again in the same speech, boasting about meeting with an even larger group of executives, where they came to a lot of very good conclusions: And here is Trump recounting his meeting with a corporate executive who hired lobbyists to win pipeline approval. The point of Trumps story is that Trump gave the executive the exact policy outcome he had hired lobbyists to engineer: That is the way the system works. That sentence perfectly captures the authentic Trump view of the world  the view of the man who has donated to politicians of both parties, treated all policy as transactional, and disregarded any moral currency other than power or wealth. Trump can read populist denunciations of the system, but he doesnt actually believe them. Not only does he see nothing wrong with a system in which wealthy, powerful people meet with him and he delivers them policy favors, his central role in the process strikes him as evidence of his own power and success. He is boasting about it because he cannot imagine it would reflect anything other than his own greatness.

On a Wednesday morning Fox & Friends appearance, he presented false statistics about the recidivism rates of Guantnamo Bay prisoners released by the Obama administration  numbers that ran contrary to the governments own figures. That earned him a lengthy rebuke from factcheck.org and criticism from outlets like this one, as well as yet more opprobrium from a national security Establishment increasingly furious by his policy-making influence. It was downhill from there. Just hours after offering the bogus stat, Gorka used his personal cell phone to call Michael S. Smith II, a Republican counterterrorism expert who currently resides in South Carolina and who has been extremely critical of Gorka on Twitter. That was, in fact, the subject of the call: The deputy assistant to the president was calling to complain that a private American citizen was being mean on Twitter. Not only did Gorka express his personal displeasure , Smith heard a threat in the call. Gorka asserted my tweets about him merited examination by the White House legal counsel, Smith told Newsweek. In effect, he was threatening to entangle me in a legal battle for voicing my concerns on Twitter that he does not possess expertise sufficient to assist the president of the United States with formulating and guiding national security policies. Shortly after Gorka made that alleged threat, Smith began recording the call, and the audio clip, published by Newsweek yesterday, is frankly mind-blowing. Most of the call consists of Gorka and Smith arguing and Gorka insisting they set up a meeting at the White House (presumably so Gorka can convince Smith hes a credible expert). Over and over, Gorka yells at Smith about how out of line his tweets are  if you didnt know the context, you would think the debate was over some absolutely vital life-and-death policy matter rather than, well, tweets. A few highlights, among many: Gorka: Why is there such vitriol popping out of you constantly, every day now, its so strange. I look at your Twitter feed once or twice a day, and again, its half a dozen tweets about me, and Ive never met you. Smith: Wow, are you defeating Jihad by monitoring or trolling my Twitter feed? I mean, honestly, to begin  [arguing breaks out] Gorka, whose job is to keep Americans safe from a dizzying, ever-shifting galaxy of security threats and to guide the presidents counterterrorism policy, seems to be acknowledging that he spends a chunk of his workday monitoring the feeds of his Twitter critics. This is  unusual. Also: Smith: I would submit to you that a majority of terrorism experts who have experience working with policy makers  which you do not, until now  would agree that you are not an expert of a level sufficient to be working in the White House with the presidents inner circle. Gorka: But thats one mans opinion  a man who has a two-year-old TV clip in his Twitter feed, and having to point out that he has an op-ed piece in The Wall Street Journal as your [Twitter] header. I mean, thats your qualifications? You dont have a TV hit from more [sic] than two years ago? I mean, isnt that peculiar that youre questioning my credentials and your last TV hit was two years ago? This nicely captures the expert-nonexpert divide going on here. Gorka seems to be saying that Smith shouldnt be trusted as a counterterrorism expert since he hasnt been on TV lately, which isnt usually how a given academic community determines who has the most serious and worthwhile views. (That said, plenty of academics are media conscious  rather than ignore the jab, Smith responds that hes totally been on TV lately.) Finally: Smith: You have approached this conversation is a most childish and obnoxious manner. Gorka: Read your Twitter feeds. Read your Twitter feeds. Obnoxious? [super angry] Read. Your. Twitter feeds, okay? And dont lecture me about obnoxious. Smith: I stand by everything on my Twitter feeds and theres no way for you to change my opinion about that. To be completely frank about this, I find it most curious that a person of your manner, your demeanor, what you are exuding on this phone call, is deemed stable enough to hold a [security] clearance and work in the White House. Again, its simply striking how upset Gorka is over tweets. This isnt normal behavior for a top-level wonk. And the week wasnt even over yet. Perhaps the biggest blow to Gorka comes today in the form of a lengthy, well-reported article in The Forward by Lili Bayer. The article is headlined, Senior Trump Aide Forged Key Ties to Anti-Semitic Groups in Hungary, and Bayer goes on to lay out those ties in careful detail: Gorkas involvement with the far right includes co-founding a political party with former prominent members of Jobbik, a political party with a well-known history of anti-Semitism; repeatedly publishing articles in a newspaper known for its anti-Semitic and racist content; and attending events with some of Hungarys most notorious extreme-right figures. This didnt just happen once or twice; its a disturbing pattern. For example: In 2006, Gorka defended the use of the Arpad flag, which Hungarys murderous Arrow Cross Party used as their symbol, writes Bayer. The Hungarian Arrow Cross Party killed thousands of Jews during World War II, shooting many of them alongside the Danube River and throwing them into the water. Gorka told the news agency JTA at the time that if you say eight centuries of history can be eradicated by 18 months of fascist distortion of symbols, youre losing historic perspective. Under normal circumstances, either the recorded call or the Forward story would be enough to jeopardize the position of a top-tier White House adviser. Then again, under normal circumstances someone like Gorka would only have access to the White House if he signed up for a tour."}, {"date": "2017/02/24", "title": "Trump: U.S. Has Fallen Behind on Nukes, Vows to Return to Top of the Pack", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-u-s-has-fallen-behind-on-nukes.html", "text": " President Donald Trump recognizes the value of a world without nuclear weapons, he told Reuters in an interview published Thursday, but he also knows that we do not live in such a world. And since nations have nukes, hed very much prefer that the U.S. have the most. It would be wonderful, a dream would be that no country would have nukes, but if countries are going to have nukes, were going to be at the top of the pack, Trump told Reuters. He added that, when it comes to nukes, were never going to fall behind any country even if its a friendly country, were never going to fall behind on nuclear power. The U.S. currently has 6,800 nukes, according to the Ploughshares Fund, a group fighting the spread of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. Thats second only to Russias 7,000 nukes. Both countries have significantly fewer nuclear weapons deployed, but Russia still comes out ahead with 1,796 deployed nukes compared to the 1,367 in the U.S. This isnt the first time Trump has appeared to call for more nuclear weapons. In December, he tweeted a vague call to expand the U.S. nuclear capabilities. Aides said he meant exactly the opposite, claiming Trump was referring to the need to prevent nuclear proliferation. The top of the pack quote in the Reuters interview sure sounds like a call to pursue more nukes though, especially since Trump makes it clear that U.S. has fallen behind on nuclear weapon capacity. But Trump translator and White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer made it sound Thursday as if the U.S. is already top of the pack. What he was very clear on is that the United States will not yield its supremacy in this area to anybody. Thats what he made very clear in there, and that if other countries have nuclear capabilities, itll always be the United States that have the supreme  supremacy and commitment to this, Spicer said. So once again, the question now is who to believe: Spicer, who claims Trump was saying the U.S. will not yield its supremacy on nukes, or Trump, who says the U.S. has fallen behind but should be top of the pack?"}, {"date": "2017/02/24", "title": "Trump Condemns FBI Leakers for Leaking That He Asked Them to Leak", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-decries-leakers-for-leaking-that-he-asked-them-to-leak.html", "text": " Last week, anonymous U.S. officials told the New York Times that Trump campaign aides contacted Russian intelligence operatives, multiple times, during the 2016 race. The news came right after other anonymous officials chased Michael Flynn out of the White House  by revealing that he had lied to the vice-president about his own illicit contact with the Russian government. Days later, President Trump expressed far more concern about the candidness of these leakers than about the duplicity of his national security adviser. Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation, Trump said at press conference last Thursday. He didnt have to do that, because what he did wasnt wrong  what he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally. Thats the real problem. Disclosing classified information is such a grave misdeed, it renders a national security advisers (apparent) violation of the Logan Act and lies to the vice-president irrelevant by comparison. Just before the president made this argument, his administration tried to convince the FBI to disclose classified information. The day after the Times reported on the Trump campaigns Russia contacts, FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus had a conversation. Which one of these men brought up the Times story is unclear  according to the White House, McCabe told Priebus that the papers report was overblown. However the subject came up, Priebus eventually asked McCabe to tell the press that the Times story was baloney  or, at least, have that information leaked, anonymously. This request was problematic for at least two reasons. For one, Justice Department rules forbid the White House from discussing the details of ongoing investigations with the FBI  let alone investigations into the president himself  unless those details are vital to the presidents duties. For another, the FBI is not supposed to publicly comment on ongoing investigations. The FBI refused Priebuss request. And anonymous U.S. officials told CNN all about it. The White House objected to some of the word choices in CNNs story, but it did not deny the substance of the networks report. We didnt try to knock the story down, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told CNN late Thursday night. We asked them to tell the truth. Hours after his administration admitted that it had (seemingly illegally) asked the FBI to leak classified information, the president condemned the FBI for leaking information. Perhaps Priebuss request was actually a sting operation, designed to root out the least scrupulous members of the FBI. Or maybe the president is less outraged by leaks than by his inability to dictate exactly what information reaches the enemy of the American people."}, {"date": "2017/02/24", "title": "Trumps Health-Care Nightmare Is Only Just Beginning", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trumps-health-care-nightmare-is-only-just-beginning.html", "text": " Eleven days before Donald Trump took office, I wrote a column with the slightly hedged but still hyperbolic headline Obamacare Repeal Might Have Just Died Tonight. While the might was doing a lot of work, my argument was that the GOPs clearest and easiest path for repealing Obamacare had fallen short, which would force Republicans to attempt to forge a vastly more difficult path. That is what has happened since, and that is why the cause of repeal has been dying a slow and painful death. John Boehner  who repeatedly led his party to election victories on the promise that they would repeal Obamacare!  has now admitted repeal is not going to happen and most of the framework of the Affordable Care Act would remain in place. Lets back up and go through how this has happened. As soon as the immediate aftermath of the election, it could be seen that repeal and delay gave Republicans the easiest method for destroying Obamacare. The attraction of repeal and delay is that it did not require Republicans to cobble together majorities in both chambers to support any particular alternative plan, which  despite repeated promises and assurances of imminent success  they had failed to do since the legislative debate on health care began in 2009. Repeal and delay merely required finding 218 House Republicans and 50 senators to defund Obamacare on the premise that something, to be determined later, would be better. But several Republicans expressed reservations about repealing the law without having any clarity about its replacement, if any. By January 9, repeal-and-delay had enough opponents  Republicans could only afford to lose two votes in the Senate  that the partys leaders would have to scrap the plan, which they did. The Republicans new strategy is to stage a single vote that would repeal Obamacare and simultaneously put replacement measures in place. A group linked to Mitch McConnell is trying to whip up support for this by circulating polling showing that just 17 percent of the public supports repealing Obamacare without an immediate replacement plan. Whats important about this is not the polling result itself  independent pollsters found the same thing since well before the inauguration  but the fact that Republican leaders are now emphasizing it, rather than pretending its not true. Their professed hope is that the replacement plan will give Republican members of Congress something positive to offer in the wake of killing Obamacare. The trouble for them is that attaching a replacement bill to a repeal bill makes the vote much, much harder. Now that their best chance to repeal the law is gone, the remaining options are all fairly desperate. One well-known problem is that Republican members of Congress do not agree with each other on the parameters of a replacement. Conservatives have demanded a repeal of Obamacares Medicaid expansion, but several key senators  most recently Lisa Murkowski  have adamantly opposed such a move. Hard-core conservatives oppose the use of refundable tax credits to subsidize coverage as Obamacare lite, because they reward low-income moochers who do not deserve government help. Nor do they agree on whether the law should ban subsidies for any health-insurance plan that covers abortion. A second, much deeper problem is that the beliefs Republican members of Congress do agree on are not shared by their voters at all. The Kaiser Family Foundation extensively interviewed Trump voters who have Obamacare to ask what features they would like changed about the law. Most of the voters like Medicaid, and dislike the fact that exchange plans have high deductibles. A KFF poll finds that 84 percent of Americans, and 69 percent of Republicans, want to keep the laws Medicaid expansion. Meanwhile, the House Republican plan would slash funding for Medicaid and massively increase insurance deductibles. A belief in higher deductibles is the conservative movements central health-care policy conviction. Conservatives believe that forcing consumers to have skin in the game  giving them a financial incentive to use their bargaining power to hold down the costs of their own care  is the singular feature the health-care system most needs. Republicans were able to paper over this yawning chasm between what their base demands and what their elites are offering for the last eight years only because they have been able to avoid a specific alternative. Republicans attacked Obamacare for its high deductibles, and Trump promised a replacement that would give everybody better coverage for less money. But their proposals would do the opposite. Multiple sources report that the House Republican replacement plan was supposed to come out this week, but was delayed after an initial analysis by the Congressional Budget Office yielded a horrific score. Their plan would cut the average subsidy level for a person buying insurance on the exchanges from $6,314 to $3,643, according to a preliminary calculation by the liberal Center for American Progress. This is not like getting a bad SAT score, where you can come back later after some studying and a good nights sleep and maybe get a better score. Republicans oppose the taxes on the rich that help finance Obamacare, and are committed to their repeal. But this forces them to find a funding source that is not limited to the rich. The mechanism Republicans favor is scaling back the tax deduction for employer-sponsored insurance. It would affect far more people than the one percenters who have to finance Obamacare. Just how many people would face higher taxes depends on just where Republicans set the threshold of insurance plans to tax  they could tax only the most expensive plans, limiting the number of people theyd hit, but also limiting the amount of revenue they could yield to finance subsidies. Or they could get more revenue by taxing more peoples employer-sponsored insurance. The trade-offs are brutal either way: tax lots and lots of people, provide woefully insufficient insurance, or some of both. Altering the health-care system is extraordinarily difficult. Health-care reform failed under Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bill Clinton because the system is almost impervious to change  people who have access to medical care are terrified of losing it, and the people who sell them that care are loath to lose their livelihoods. Obamacare was not a perfectly designed law, but it did reflect a kind of political genius. It found a way to pay for access for the uninsured with minimal disruption to the status quo. Obamacare did create some losers: The very rich pay much higher taxes, and young, healthy people have to pay higher premiums on the individual market. (The latter could one day become winners under Obamacare should they grow unhealthy or un-young.) They made a lot of noise  remember the media freak-out over the tiny number of people who lost their plans in the individual market?  but they were vastly outnumbered by the winners: millions of people who could now have access to insurance who once could not afford it. The Republican plan, based on its skeletal outlines, has just the opposite effect. It would create very few winners and an enormous number of losers. One percenters would enjoy lower taxes, and healthy people could turn their Health Savings Accounts into lucrative tax shelters that dont force them to cross-subsidize sicker people. On the flip side, though, millions of people who get insurance through work would be taxed to finance the GOP plan. Hospitals, doctors, and pharmaceutical makers would all lose business because millions of their customers would suddenly be unable to afford medications and treatments, having been forced onto skimpy, catastrophic plans. Republicans may not have even realized until recently how deeply their ability to make political hay on Obamacare depended on not having power. They could posture against every inconvenient aspect of an industry nobody has ever liked, and promise all things to all people, with no responsibility to fulfill their grandiose promises. Now the dynamic has reversed. Loss aversion has inspired massive, energetic protests to speak up for a law Democrats could hardly be roused to defend before, while the energy has drained away from the opposition. Amazingly, polling for Obamacare, which has been unpopular since the outset, has sharply reversed. The last ten polls all show net positive approval for the Affordable Care Act. If Republicans somehow muster the partisan discipline to tear down Obamacare, as opposed to settling for minor changes, they will have to be willing to endure searing political pain. And this is all happening before Republicans have published a detailed plan. That is the most amazing aspect of all. Obamacare repeal faces dire peril, and the most painful steps have yet to come."}, {"date": "2017/02/24", "title": "Andrew Sullivan: Moonlight  and Other Light  in Trumps Darkness", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/moonlight-and-other-light-in-trumps-darkness.html", "text": " Of all the movies up for an Oscar for Best Picture this weekend, Moonlight is the only one Ive seen twice. Im not going to sing its praises again here  there are many others who have done it justice. But what I truly loved about the movie was the way in which it managed to transcend identity politics almost effortlessly. It never seemed to be straining to say that it was a groundbreaking movie about being gay and black in America; it simply told a story of being human in America. Part of that may be a function of how our society has shifted so that movies about the gay experience can now shrug off their otherness; but part too, surely, is because the director, Barry Jenkins, is straight. By all accounts he worked closely with Tarell Alvin McCraney, the gay man who created the story. But, like Ang Lee in Brokeback Mountain, he didnt shy from what some now call cultural appropriation. He seized it. And so we got to see an authentically gay story through a straight mans eyes  and the view was beautiful. Sometimes, its precisely the tension in cultural appropriation that creates the greatest art  because a work of translation is, at its best, also one of empathy. Attempting to shut this cross-pollination down may come from good intentions; but its a fatal political constriction on what art can really achieve. In art, the only identity that ultimately matters is that of the artist. The whole point is to leave the rest behind. And then, as if to cheer me up some more, I came across this truly uplifting nugget: According to a new study, we saw a 7 percent drop in suicides among gay teens in states that allowed marriage equality between 1999 and 2015, relative to rates in states where gay marriage was still banned. Theres no causal relationship proven here  just a strong correlation  so a degree of skepticism is merited. (You can and should check out the detailed study.) But it makes intuitive sense to me. Adolescence can be brutal for anyone  but its particularly isolating for gay or trans teens, as Moonlight captured so exquisitely. In the old days, as soon as you realized you might be gay, you understood immediately that youd never be worthy of the marriage your parents or siblings had. That knowledge often pierced the young psyche with shame and stigma  and wounded your self-esteem for life. More distressing: Almost by definition, many of these most troubled kids dont and wont acknowledge their feelings, and so are resistant to counseling. But with legalizing marriage equality, there is another way to reach them  by the law itself telling this invisible and silent group that their state sees them as equal to their peers. Its an anti-suicide measure all by itself  requiring no counselors, carried in the general atmosphere, removing or decreasing stigma. In that sense, you could call marriage equality a public health initiative. A staggering 28.5 percent of high school students who are sexual minorities attempt suicide each year. If marriage equality helps keep one of them from killing herself, or the trauma of trying, that would be a blessing beyond measure. That it might correlate with a decline in attempted suicides among all gay kids  the study assesses 134,000 fewer incidents a year  is a dream come true. Which is why marriage equality was never in the end about choosing politics. It was always, at its core, about choosing life. I dont know about you, but the abject terror and anxiety of the last few months have abated somewhat. This is not, I hasten to add, because we have learned much that should reassure us about this unhinged authoritarian in the Oval Office. The rhetoric has not exactly mellowed. Not long after he called the press the enemy of the American people, he called his deportation revamp a military operation, for Petes sake. Its just a matter of human endurance. You have to breathe at some point, to pace yourself, to find more spaces in your life and your soul where Trump cannot invade. There are only so many truthful hyperboles or tweet storms a person can withstand. My bodys habitual response after a period of intense stress and worry is to shut down with some kind of bronchial or sinus infection  and lo and behold, it has. Ive been spending the last couple of afternoons in a feverish oblivion. At some point, though, well have to find a balance between self-preservation and vigilance. You cant call in sick for four years. My only active constructive suggestion  apart from constant grassroots pressure on congressmen and senators  is to find a single issue on which to marshal the forces of the opposition. Release of the tax returns has always seemed the clearest candidate. The advantage of this particular issue is that it unites Republicans and Democrats. A recent poll found that 74 percent of Americans want the returns released, including 53 percent of Republicans. It was a Trump promise, after all. And if pressure on him cant work, the Senate Intelligence Committee has the power to subpoena the returns in its investigation of the Kremlins hacking of the election. All we need is massive and sustained public pressure. So Im psyched to discover Im not the only one to like this idea. A former Colbert Report writer, Frank Lesser, tweeted it out the day after the Womens March. And its on  a whole host of groups are currently organizing a Tax March for Washington and many other cities on April 15. Bit by bit, we can keep the pressure on. Im encouraged, too, by the polling. By any measure, its not good for Trump. Quinnipiac just put his approval at 38 percent. Gallup has him struggling in the very low 40s. The RCP average has him at 4450. I dont think that bizarre presser or subsequent rally last week did him any good, either  except for with his base, which still gives him the Full Hannity. They wont budge, but if Trump slips toward the mid-30s, the congressional GOP may get colder feet  especially those in districts won by Hillary Clinton. The key, it seems to me, are those voters best described in Josh Barros lovely formulation, the Trump-curious. Gallup finds them much lower in support for early Trump than they were for late Obama. They dont like chaos or incompetence  and theyve seen their fair share of both; theyre not going to like seeing peoples health insurance taken away from them. Nor do they enjoy unnerving scenes of mass deportations. They voted for Trump in part because they couldnt bring themselves to vote for Clinton but also, one suspects, out of a gamble that Trump may be good for the economy. If the economy goes south  and remember, Trump inherited a low unemployment rate and a long stock-market boom  they could leave in droves. Its vital we dont push these people away from the opposition by too dogmatic or leftist a stance. Its crucial to keep a calm, moderate, and sane voice directed at exactly this 15 percent or so; and to simply hold Trump constantly accountable for the results of his policies, especially on health care and jobs. If we cant remove him, we can neuter him. And for that, the coalition of opposition has to be as broad as possible. Meanwhile, where are we in liberal democracys Trumpmageddon? One gets the impression that only people in the CIA know. Some of them have told the New York Times and CNN that there were constant communications between members of the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence during the 2016 campaign  and some others at the highest levels of the intelligence community appear to have told Reince Priebus that those reports are grossly overstated and inaccurate (which is not quite the same, Ill note, as completely untrue). This is what we call a standoff  hence the Senate Intelligence Committees letters sent this week to several agencies, asking them to preserve all records and information on the Russian attempt to hack the election. Heres hoping they didnt wait too long. The whole affair may well end up in John McCains hands  and investigative reporters. In ordinary times, Id agree with those concerned about the CIA operating to counteract its own president  even if only through leaks. But if theres a credible case that there was collusion between the Trump campaign and a hostile foreign power to hack our elections  well, the CIA knows their duty. They swore an oath to the Constitution, not this president. And potential treason is surely an exception that proves the rule. On the national security front, there is also some good news. The removal of Mike Flynn from the NSA is a huge relief to anyone worried about an impending World War III (most of us)  and it was achieved by the Washington Post. The elite press is not irrelevant! Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster now joins Mattis as the sane guardian of the countrys fraying alliances, and, more encouraging, has a record of plain speaking to superiors. Well see how that translates to running the unwieldy NSA and confronting Trump  but it sure is an improvement on Flynn. Then you have to note the tiny advances and momentary reliefs in the first month: mounting public support for Obamacare, and Republican disarray on repeal; Trumps capitulation on the One China policy; his acquiescence (so far) in the Iran nuclear deal; his exemption (so far) of the Dreamers from mass deportation; his keeping Obamas ruling for nondiscrimination against gay people in federal contracts; his deferral to the courts on the travel ban; and his selection of a sane, well-regarded judge to replace Scalia. For most presidents, these would be no-brainers. For Trump, theyre small mercies, shards of reality-based politics emerging among the chaos. At this point, we have to take what solace we can."}, {"date": "2017/02/24", "title": "Customs Agents Check Passengers IDs on Domestic Flight at JFK", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/customs-agents-check-passenger-ids-on-domestic-flight-at-jfk.html", "text": " In an unusual move, U.S. Customs and Border Protection checked the IDs of every passenger on a domestic flight before they were allowed to disembark at JFK airport on Wednesday night.

Exposure to even 10 milligrams of the nerve agent can be deadly, and its unclear how Kims attackers administered the poison without seriously harming anyone else. Malaysian investigators said two female suspects coated their hand with the liquid and rubbed it on Kims face at the Kuala Lumpur airport on February 13. The New York Times notes that its possible to prepare the poison as two separate compounds and mix them together at the last minute. Initial reports suggested the two women wiped a cloth across Kims face, but this week Malaysias police chief said they used their bare hands. A senior police official told the Journal that at least one of the women was actually wearing gloves. One of the women vomited after the attack, but no one else was sickened. Its a very toxic nerve agent. Very, very toxic, Dr. Bruce Goldberger, a toxicologist at the University of Florida, told the AP. Im intrigued that these two alleged assassins suffered no ill effect from exposure to VX. It is possible that both of these women were given the antidote. Kim sought medical attention at the airport, but he fell into convulsions and died at the hospital within two hours.

GOP lawmakers have dismissed the surge in activism on the left, falsely claiming that the protesters are paid by George Soros or taking issue with the fact that people are organizing for political change. Many members of Congress argue theres no point in engaging with a rowdy crowd, but a handful have offered a far more extreme excuse, claiming that town hall meetings are too dangerous. This week, Texas Representative Louie Gohmert cited the 2011 shooting of former representative Gabby Giffords in a letter to constituents explaining why he refuses to hold an in-person town hall. Unfortunately, at this time there are groups from the more violent strains of the leftist ideology, some even being paid, who are preying on public town halls to wreak havoc and threaten public safety. Threats are nothing new to me and I have gotten my share as a felony judge, Gohmert said. However, the House Sergeant at Arms advised us after former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords was shot at a public appearance, that civilian attendees at congressional public events stand the most chance of being harmed or killed  just as happened there, he added. Giffords responded on Thursday, saying her shooting by Jared Lee Loughner, who was mentally ill, is no reason to avoid the raucous but nonviolent town halls happening across the country. To the politicians who have abandoned their civic obligations, I say this: Have some courage, Giffords said in a statement. Face your constituents. Hold town halls. Giffords said she viewed meeting constituents as the most basic and core tenant of the job when she was in Congress, and her successor, Ron Barber, who was shot several times in the same shooting, held town halls as well. She noted that as a gun-control activist shes held more than 50 public events in the past year. Many of the members of Congress who are refusing to hold town halls and listen to their constituents concerns are the very same politicians that have opposed common-sense gun violence prevention policies and have allowed the Washington gun lobby to threaten the safety of law enforcement and everyday citizens in our schools, businesses, places of worship, airports, and movie theaters, she said. Giffords did not mention Gohmert by name, but she may be referring to his unsuccessful effort to allow members of Congress to carry guns on the floor of the House of Representatives in the wake of her shooting. Gohmert has yet to respond to Giffords. His letter said hell hold a public forum when the threat of violence at town hall meetings recedes. That threat is essentially made-up, so its unclear when that will be."}, {"date": "2017/02/23", "title": "Trump May Be the Only Hope for a Mexican Presidents Political Revival", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-may-be-the-only-hope-for-mexico-presidents-reelection.html", "text": " The election of Donald Trump has caused all sorts of grief and anxiety for the government of Mexico, which has to cope with the fallout from the new regimes policies on immigration, refugees, and border control; its demands for a more U.S.-favorable renegotiation of NAFTA; and its manifold insults to Mexican pride. But as Pedro Gerson of the Ibero-American University and the Mexico Autonomous Institute of Technology argues today in the Washington Post, one prominent member of the Mexican government could ultimately find in Trump an indispensable if inadvertent ally: President Enrique Pea Nieto. Pea Nieto, you see, is unpopular in a way that makes Trumps bad approval ratings look like a public-opinion paradise. His approval rating, at 12 percent, is the worst in Mexican history. And his situation seems to get worse with every page of the calendar: But, suggests Gerson, if Pea Nieto can just focus on exploiting the vast and fearful publicity Trump is securing in Mexico, and treat him as an all-purpose boogeyman, it could do wonders for his political standing going into next years presidential campaign. He is constitutionally barred from standing for reelection, but his party need not go down to what now looks like certain defeat. The bottom line is that by becoming the anti-Trump, Pea Nieto could make himself a national rallying point against the bully to the north. In particular, he could steal some thunder from his leftist rival Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador, at present the odds-on favorite to replace the incumbent next year. He might even, says Gerson, get his corruption-ridden, status-quo-oriented PRI party back in touch with its revolutionary roots as a populist and anti-gringo party. If Pea Nieto takes this advice and revives his and his partys prospects, then Americans might learn something from that development, too: Trump indeed does have coattails.

Iraqi forces reclaimed almost all of Mosuls airport from the control of the terror group, a key victory in the governments months-long offensive to retake Iraqs second-largest city. And over in Syria, Turkish-backed rebels seized control of the city of al-Bab, expelling ISIS from one of its last big strongholds there after a bloody, protracted battle that began just before fall. The gains in Mosul come after Iraqi troops began a renewed push into the western part of the city, which remains under ISIS control. (Iraqi troops liberated eastern Mosul in January.) A week ahead of the operation, the United States led air strikes against 33 targets, including some believed to be ISIS command centers, reports the New York Times. Iraqi police forces led the assault Thursday; ISIS fought back with IEDs, car bombs, and mines buried underground, eventually losing ground as Iraqi forces pushed onto the runway. The Joint Operations Command said many ISIS fighters had been killed. ISIS obliterated much of airports infrastructure, rendering the airport and its runways mostly useless. But bringing the area back under Iraqi control enhances the militarys strategic position for the more critical  and brutal  offensive into western Mosul. Parts of this city are older, more compact, densely populated, and residential; about 750,000 people live there. Mosul, which ISIS took control of in 2014, is the groups last remaining major stronghold in Iraq. Across the border in Syria, al-Bab  the site of Thursdays other major defeat  was one of ISISs significant westernmost outposts, close to the Turkish border. According to the Guardian, al-Bab also housed the ISIS operators in charge of planning for foreign terror plots. Syrian rebels, heavily supported by Turkey, said they had reached the citys center and wrested control from the terrorists, though the area is reportedly still littered with mines. We will be able to say that al-Bab is fully cleared of Daesh once the sweeping activity is concluded, Turkish Defense Minister Fikri Isik told the Turkish state-run media."}, {"date": "2017/02/23", "title": "WATCH: Congresspeople Are Getting Pummeled in Town Halls Nationwide", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/congresspeople-are-getting-pummeled-in-town-halls.html", "text": "  Dont worry.

Before Harrison bowed out, it was widely assumed that the DNC contest wouldnt be settled on the first ballot. A crowded field, led by Perez and Minnesota congressman Keith Ellison, was expected to split the DNCs 447 members such that no candidate would have the simple majority required for victory. Weaker candidates would then drop out, allowing the stronger ones to vie for their endorsements. Harrison and South Bend, Indianas mayor Pete Buttigieg  who had been nipping at Harrisons heels in unofficial vote counts  were both counting on a surge of support on the second ballot to claim victory. But on Wednesday, Howard Dean (who helped engineer the Democrats 2006 wave) endorsed Buttigieg, and Harrison appears to have concluded that his prospects were dim shortly thereafter. In a former job, I whipped votes for House Democrats. I know what a path to victory looks like, Harrison said in an email to DNC members. Despite strong performances at the debate and DNC regional forums, the votes are simply not there for me to secure victory on Saturday.

It then floated the idea of deporting Central Americans seeking asylum in the United States to Mexico  essentially, using our southern neighbor as an open-air detention center for migrants while their legal appeals are being processed. And, of course, the administration also ramped up its efforts to deport undocumented immigrants. So Thursdays meeting between Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Homeland Security chief John Kelly, and officials from the Mexican government was always going to be tense. And the president didnt ease those tensions when he described his deportation plan as a military operation in a meeting with manufacturing executives Thursday morning (weeks ago, Trump joked about sending the American military into Mexico to hunt down their bad hombres). Right now, Rex, who, as you know, hes in Mexico. I said, Thats gonna be a tough trip, because we have to be treated fairly by Mexico, Trump told the executives. Thats gonna be a tough trip. At their press conference with Mexicos Secretary of Foreign Affairs Luis Videgaray Thursday afternoon, Tillerson and Kelly tried to strike diplomatic notes. Both officials emphasized Americas responsibility to keep illegal firearms from crossing the border into Mexico. And the former Exxon CEO championed the many sources of mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries  particularly with regards to trade and energy. In a relationship filled with vibrant colors, two strong sovereign countries from time to time will have differences, Tillerson said. We listened closely and carefully to each other as we respectfully and patiently raised our respective concerns. Videgaray offered similar pablum about the two nations deep ties and shared values. But he also expressed frustration about Trumps myriad acts of geopolitical bullying. I want to say clearly and emphatically that the government of Mexico and the Mexican people do not have to accept provisions that one government unilaterally wants to impose on the other, Videgaray told reporters. We also have control of our borders and we will exercise it fully. Kelly, for his part, vehemently denied that the administrations plans to drastically increase the deportation of undocumented immigrants could be fairly described as mass deportation. This is something I would really like you all to pay attention to because it is frequently misrepresented or misreported, Kelly said. Let me be very, very clear: There will be no  repeat, no  mass deportations. Everything we do in DHS will be done legally and according to human rights and the legal justice system of the United States. Kelly further suggested that before being deported, immigrants would have the opportunity to contest their deportations through multiple appeals. That claim seems to contradict part of the administrations latest executive order. Per Voxs Dara Lind: Finally, Kelly said that there will be no use of military force in immigration. At least half of you try to get that right."}, {"date": "2017/02/23", "title": "Mitch McConnell Employs Turtle Strategy to Avoid Town Hall Turmoil", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/mitch-mcconnell-employs-turtle-strategy-to-avoid-town-halls.html", "text": " On Wednesday afternoon, Kentucky senator Mitch McConnell entered a Marriott in suburban Louisville through the backdoor, avoiding the hundreds of protesters outside with the Instagram-ready signs and pink pussy hats that have become the hallmark of the resistance in Trumps America. The Senate Majority Leader would spend around 90 minutes in the Marriott ballroom, eating lunch and deigning to answer a handful of questions from constituents who had had the foresight, and spare cash, to buy a ticket days in advance. Three questions in, the audience got a ten-minute warning. The senator would soon leave for another commitment. As he scurried off the stage, McConnell left more than a dozen questioners in line behind the microphone. One of them loudly asked McConnell if he would have a town hall meeting for all of those who would like an audience with their senator without having to buy a seat. The woman didnt get an answer, but she didnt need one. McConnell will be doing no such thing. As his colleagues open up auditoriums to throngs of outraged constituents, the most powerful senator in the country has taken a much more careful approach during this weeks recess. Hes holding events open only to small crowds, most requiring tickets or an RSVP. Hes addressing chambers of commerce, employees of a local utility company, student groups, and the local Republican Party, all while freezing out his most vocal detractors. Please dont call them town halls, Dawn Cooley says. A town hall is something that is open to the public. Its a place where constituents can access their elected officials. What McConnell is doing are pay-to-play events. A co-founder of the newly established Indivisible KY, which is dedicated to resistance to the Trump agenda, Cooley says members of her group have been in touch with McConnells office to request a true town hall but have been stonewalled. Senator McConnell has a tight schedule of constituent visits throughout state work periods, McConnell spokesperson Stephanie Penn wrote me in an email. Asked why McConnell hasnt held any events completely open to the public, Penn encouraged voters to contact McConnell online and follow him on social media. Meanwhile, McConnell is going out of his way to avoid hostile crowds and appear in front of friendly ones, like Wednesdays, which greeted him with a standing ovation when he took the stage. Hes more interested in hearing from business owners who will fund his future campaign than he is in speaking with voters, Cooley says. Of course, his plan isnt foolproof, a point proven by the now-viral video of a Kentuckian berating him at a Tuesday luncheon. Though the occasional rabble-rouser may sneak through, McConnell prefers podiums in front of calm crowds full of people who can afford to spend two hours in the middle of a Wednesday eating a $35 lunch. There, he can not only ignore the enraged, but he can analyze their anger. Theyre sorry they lost the election, he said of his fan club. Their protests are simply an expression of frustration. Hes not wrong. The frustration of protesters was spelled out in plain terms on posterboard a few hundreds yards away from him. They were frustrated about the impending death of the Affordable Care Act (Hear Us! Keep the ACA), President Trumps sexism (Make America Grope Again), the GOPs reluctance to investigate Trumps connection to Putin (Do your Job Mitch. Investigate Russian ties.), and McConnells treatment of Elizabeth Warren on the Senate floor earlier this month (Nevertheless she persisted.). But it was McConnells refusal to poke his head out of his shell that appeared to draw most of the ire, evident by signs that read: Coward dont hide, we be waiting outside!! You cant hide from karma, Talk to us Mitch, and Face your people Mitch. Several declared a refusal to go home, a reference to a line he delivered Tuesday. On Friday, McConnell will be the keynote speaker at the Jefferson County GOPs Lincoln Day dinner. The cheapest ticket to the event is $60 and McConnells fan club is planning to be there, outside of the hotel ballroom where it will be held, holding a protest dubbed the Hunt for Mitch. He may be doing everything he can to stay away from his constituents, but, Cooley says, We are not letting him avoid us."}, {"date": "2017/02/23", "title": "Ted Cruz Tastelessly Predicts Summer SCOTUS Opening", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/ted-cruz-tastelessly-predicts-summer-scotus-opening.html", "text": " The strangest moment during the early hours of this years CPAC conference did not come from anyone closely associated with Donald J. Trump. No: It was from the man who won last years CPAC straw poll for the GOP presidential nomination, Senator Ted Cruz. The Washington Posts Aaron Blake had a report on the incident: Blake goes on to offer various theories about why Cruz said that, only one of which involves some actual (and extremely unlikely) exclusive knowledge by the Texan. As Blake notes, the three oldest Justices are not among the hard-core conservatives on the Court, so it would seem Cruz is speculating that the right will soon have an opportunity to pick up a second SCOTUS seat, assuming Gorsuch is confirmed. Whatever he was trying to do, Cruz should cut it out. It is in extremely poor taste for anyone to publicly kick around the possibility that a Supreme Court Justice could die or become incapacitated  the most likely reasons for a sudden retirement  in the very immediate future. And even if Cruz doesnt care about taste and decorum, he should understand he is playing with some very powerful emotions by going there. One of the most important aspects of contemporary SCOTUS politics is that those who get up every morning longing for the criminalization of abortion  a group heavily represented at CPAC, no doubt  are acutely aware they are two SCOTUS Justices short of the majority needed to reverse Roe v. Wade and fulfill the dream of a returning women to the golden age of the early 1970s. One of their great fears is that Trump will get tossed out of power in favor of a Democrat before there is an opportunity to appoint a second sure-to-be-anti-Roe Justice. So in suggesting to a CPAC audience that the great gettin-up morning could arrive in 2017 was roughly equivalent to telling a class of kindergarten children that that will be given ice-cream cones every hour for the rest of their lives. If nothing else, it is a cruel hoax to the extent Cruz has not been vouchsafed secret knowledge of future events."}, {"date": "2017/02/23", "title": "Richard Spencer Gets Booted From CPAC in Apparent Conservative Housecleaning", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/richard-spencer-too-much-for-conservative-cpac-gets-booted.html", "text": " Amid the sea of drab suits and Alex P. Keaton comb-overs outside the main ballroom of the Gaylord International Hotel, the site of the Conservative Political Action Conference, on Thursday morning, Richard Spencers partially shaved head and tweed vest were unmistakable. The 38-year-old president of the white-supremacist National Policy Institute was dressed like a neo-Nazis idea of an intellectual, and he was holding court at the center of a swarm of reporters who were at turns fascinated and repulsed by what he had to say. Daryle Lamont Jenkins, founder of the One Peoples Project, a group that monitors racist speech, held his iPhone close to Spencers head recording his every word. A handful of young men in blue T-shirts pushed their way to the front of the crowd to ask Spencer if he was a fan of rock music, by way of explaining that without black people, our culture would lack such fundamental joys as the Rolling Stones. Spencer wouldnt bite. Depeche Mode is the official band of the alt-right, he said, smiling. (In the time it took to write this article, the band actually responded: Thats pretty ridiculous, they wrote Esquire. Depeche Mode has no ties to Richard Spencer or the alt right and does not support the alt right movement.) But it wasnt just anti-hate-speech activists who didnt want him here. For the first time in nine years, CPAC is being held while conservatives are in power. But that doesnt mean the conference, in its first day, feels in any way unified. In place of the Obama-era chants about taking our country back is no sense of conservative triumph. Instead, the conference has been a display case of sorts for a fractured political party struggling to define its identity in the era of an administration that many of its own members didnt want. Not helping matters is the fact that there was a suicide across the street this morning, and the Gaylords perimeter is decorated by police tape. Usually, electoral victory binds a party; but the CPAC lineup this year reflects all the fault lines of the Republican primary. Last year, Donald Trump canceled his appearance after rumors circulated that a walkout was to be staged during his speech. This year, although he is scheduled to speak, the guest list also includes people his diehard fans regard as Never Trump-ers, like Katie Pavlich, Dana Loesch, Mark Levin, and Michael Reagan. CPAC had attempted to bridge the divide between Establishment conservatives and the alt-right by extending a speaking invitation to alt-right poster boy Milo Yiannopoulos, but it backfired spectacularly as it was revealed that the media personality had defended sex between underage boys and older men. In his absence, Spencer  who condemned Yiannopoulos for those comments  purchased a ticket for $150, he told me, much to the ire of conservatives at the conference who believe he reflects poorly on them. The only reason journalists are obsessed with covering Richard Spencer, David Harsanyi, of the Federalist, tweeted, is to smear conservatives. Back in the scrum, Spencer was reviewing Trumps first few weeks in office, which he noted had been defined by problems with implementation. In some ways, he analysis was sound. He said the government and the deep state were opposed to the president, which he called something like a civil war. Still, he said, Trump had been high energy and trying his best to follow through on his promises on the existential issues rather than things the alt-right doesnt care about, like school vouchers. Theres a lot of reason for hope, he said. And then, suddenly, Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me! A large security guard cut in. Youre not welcome on the property, he told Spencer. Spencer looked shocked. Im not  welcome on the property? he asked, incredulous. They want you off the property, the guard said. They want you to cease. They want you off the property. Uh, Spencer said. Can they  Enough of debate, the guard said. This is private property and CPAC wants you off the property. Are you gonna escort me out? Spencer asked. Thats correct, the guard said. Lets go. Spencer seemed upset at first, uttering wow as he moved down the hallway toward the exit. Another security guard approached, asking him to surrender his credential from around his neck. You have to surrender them, wow, Spencer said. They can do whatever they want, he added. If they want to throw me out they can  Its kind of pathetic. But as the crowd of media surrounding Spencer grew to include a cable news camera, his frustration seemed to give way to pride. Free Spencer, he said, hashtag."}, {"date": "2017/02/23", "title": "At $25 Million, Trumps NYC Security Bill Is Cheaper Than First Estimated", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-security-in-nyc-will-end-up-costing-usd25-million.html", "text": " Turns out New York City slightly overestimated the cost of protecting thenPresident-Elect Donald Trump and Trump Tower from Election Day to Inauguration Day. The final figure comes out to $25.7 million  $24 million for NYPD operations, and $1.7 million for FDNY expenses. Mayor Bill de Blasio had estimated, and initially sought, $35 million from the federal government, which comes out to about $500,000 per day for those two-and-a-half-months worth of security costs. NYPD Commissioner James P. ONeill reported Tuesday on the savings in a letter to lawmakers, whom hes requesting help to get federal-government reimbursement. ONeill cited analysis of payrolls, overtime sheets, and more than 25,000 patrol log entries for the revised number, which still comes out to about $308,000 day. Congress set aside $7 million as reimbursement to the city, still well below the final price tag. Plus, Trumps bill isnt exactly settled. The NYPD estimates that it will continue to cost between an average of $127,ooo to $146,000 per day to guard Trump Tower as long as First Lady Melania Trump and their son, Barron, live there. Those expenses go up significantly if President Trump stops by for a visit, or begins hanging out in New York on weekends. ONeill cant give exact numbers, but if (more likely when) Trump returns as POTUS, those security costs will likely exceed $308,000 per day. And, as ONeill points out, whether or not Donald returns often, Trump Tower itself is a terror target by dint of its association with the commander-in-chief, which further strains our [the NYPDs] limited counterterrorism resources."}, {"date": "2017/02/23", "title": "Mitt Romney and Son Reportedly Trying to Buy Small Chunk of the Yankees", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/romney-and-son-reportedly-trying-to-buy-piece-of-the-yankees.html", "text": " Mitt and Tagg Romney, whose only obvious qualifications for owning a baseball team are their vast personal wealth and weird baseball-term names, are reportedly trying to buy a chunk of the New York Yankees.

Angry constituents packed venues to capacity. They shouted, cheered, brought signs. They even dressed up. President Donald Trump claimed that the protests were planned out by liberal activists, and while groups such as Indivisible are helping to rally people to attend these meetings, the crowds who turned out asked serious questions about the Affordable Care Act, immigration, and whether anyone in Congress was going to investigate Trump. Here are some highlights from Wednesday night: A crowd of about 2,000 filled the high-school auditorium in Springdale, Arkansas, for Senator Tom Cottons town hall. Cotton, an immigration hard-liner, got an earful from the crowd, who chanted Do your job and Tax return. Questions about the Affordable Care Act headlined the event. One woman, a 25-year-old constituent, challenged Tom Cotton on whether coverage for preexisting conditions would be available under a new health-care law. Cotton tried to deflect the question, but the woman  who said she relied on Obamacare for coverage, as she suffered from a rare disorder  refused to let the senator off the hook: Cotton improved a bit in an exchange with another attendee, Mary Story, who drew large cheers when she stood up and announced that she was not a paid protester. I dont care if anybody here is paid or not. Youre all Arkansans, Cotton said. Thank you for everyone coming out. Immigration, Trumps taxes, and the border wall also came up. A 7-year-old protested PBS cuts. The barrage of questions forced Cotton to extend the town hall about a half-hour. Louisiana senator Bill Cassidy inadvertently warmed up the crowd by showing up late to his town hall meeting at a library in Metairie, outside of New Orleans. It took a little more than 20 minutes, but Cassidy finally showed up. Protesters, unable to fit inside, marched as he began his presentation, which stayed contentious throughout. Cassidy had hosted a town hall Tuesday, but it focused on recovery from Baton Rouges devastating floods this summer. Here, the Affordable Care Act dominated, with one man getting ejected for trying to shout over the senator. Cassidy hosted another town hall Thursday, which appeared to be a bit calmer than lasts night forum. Nearly 1,000 lined up for Republican representative Tom Emmers town hall in Sartell, Minnesota  but only 150 fit inside the small venue. It likely beat the attendance record of all of the congressmans other town halls combined, and even with the largely anti-Trump turnout, was a mostly civil affair. Or as the Star Tribune put it: Minnesota Nice. (The congressmans staff had also warned ahead of time that he would leave if things got too out of hand.) The most heated exchanges came over the Affordable Care Act, which Emmer lambasted as a disaster. All the Minnesotans I know, they dont look at it as being Republican or Democrat, Emmer said about health-care repeal. They want to make sure that you survive, that you thrive, just like everybody else. Do your job! a crowd of about 900 jeered at New Jersey representative Leonard Lance Wednesday night at Raritan Community College in Branchburg. Hundreds more packed an overflow room. Hundreds more protested outside the venue. So did some llamas: According to the Washington Post, Russia questions dominated this town hall, an issue on which Lance is pretty hawkish. My views are that Russia is not a friend of the United States, and that Vladimir Putin has been a bad actor on the world stage, Lance assured the audience. But Lance skirted the question about Trumps tax returns, saying he urges the president to do so, but didnt feel Congress should overreach in investigating the returns of a private individual. The crowd did not like that one: Constituents whose congressional reps are conspicuously not holding town hall meetings are planning their own empty chair forums, posting missing flyers (or billboards) and, in the case of one California district, pasting a representatives face on milk cartons:"}, {"date": "2017/02/23", "title": "Here Comes the GOP Attack on Legal Immigration", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/here-comes-the-gop-attack-on-legal-immigration.html", "text": " Whatever you think of the politics of restrictions on undocumented immigrants, it is easy to appreciate its simple salience. People who enter the country without official permission or who overstay visas are breaking the law. For a certain kind of mentality, thats enough to justify any manner of punitive action, up to and including forcible deportation, which reverses the lawbreaking and thus heals the wound to the majesty of the law. That the offending parties are not American citizens is grounds for denying them either legal recourse or any sympathy. But legal immigrants are a different matter. They are the people who played by the rules, got in line and waited their turn, and in general did all the things the undocumented failed to do. That is one reason politicians who rail against the undocumented often praise legal immigrants, and make them the proper subject of traditional American appreciation for the huddled masses yearning to breathe free and the idea of the U.S. as a melting pot. Beneath the complaints over the many millions of undocumented immigrants there is an older, darker form of nativism focused on restricting legal immigration, especially from the swarthy ranks of non-European (or at one point, Southern European) peoples who were thought to threaten the cultural hegemony of the WASP (or, later, white folks generally). Until Donald Trump came along, Senator Jeff Sessions, your new attorney general, was the leading exponent of major cutbacks in legal immigration. Now Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue, Republicans of Arkansas and Georgia, respectively, are bidding fair to replace him in Congress, with legislation aimed at roughly halving levels of legal immigrants and refugees to be allowed into the country. A separate feature of the Cotton-Perdue plan is to move the system for legal immigration away from its current basis on family unification toward what is described as a merit system. This would appear to ameliorate fears among business-oriented Republicans that corporate needs for skilled immigrant labor would be rejected. But both business lobbyists and market-oriented economists believe unskilled immigrant labor is important, too, as a report from Politico notes: While that is true generally, support for current levels (if not higher) of legal immigration at all ends of the skills spectrum is especially intense in urban areas that rely on such labor, reports Ron Brownstein. Cotton and Perdue, of course, do not represent such areas. And that realization leads to the ugly underlying motive for restrictions on immigration, past, present, and future: Its about stopping demographic change on behalf of people who see the mythological America of their youth slipping away. Theres a political underside to the nativist case as well, articulated by none other than the 45th president of the United States during the presidential campaign: While Trump was mainly talking about illegal immigration, the political logic extends to those who are already legalized when they enter the country. Now, Cotton and Perdue and like-minded proponents of a general restriction on all kinds of immigrants and refugees will be careful to avoid that kind of argument (publicly, at least). And youll have to follow the alt-right to unearth the subterranean desire for a return to the openly racist policies of the early-to-mid 20th century. Instead, latter-day nativists will echo Trumps national-security rationale for limiting refugees. And with respect to legal immigrants, they will talk endlessly about the alleged damage immigrants do to (white) working-class wages. This is not an imaginary concern, which is why limitations on both legal and illegal immigration used to have significant support on the left, particularly in the labor movement. But at some point, it will defy the laugh test to believe that todays Republicans, with their plenary contempt for anything else that will boost low-end wages or living standards, from minimum wages to overtime pay to collective bargaining to progressive taxation to universal health coverage, really favor restrictions on immigration out of deep compassion for the working class. Yes, Cotton and Perdue and their allies may shed crocodile tears on that subject, but its more likely the case for reactionary immigration policies will depend, as they always have, on reactionary racial and cultural attitudes."}, {"date": "2017/02/23", "title": "Can Democrats Move Left  and to the Suburbs?", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/can-democrats-move-left-and-to-the-suburbs.html", "text": " On November 8, Donald Trump kicked the legs out from under blue America. Liberals barely took the time to writhe on the floor, before arguing about how to get back on their feet. Many of these arguments concerned the relative merits of identity politics and economic populism. Such debates were often incoherent. After all, there is no inherent tension between the aims of reducing identity-based disadvantage, and promoting economic equality. To expand access to abortion  or prevent police violence  is to aid the economic liberation of working people. To redistribute income and wealth from rich to poor, is to redistribute power from dominant identity groups to marginalized ones. In a perfectly woke world, the values of racial and gender equality and economic justice would be bound together, inextricably. But in the fallen realm of American politics, they arent  and not without reason. You are wrong to look at these crowds and think that means everyone wants $15 an hour, the Hillary Clinton campaigns former communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, said of the anti-Trump protest movement earlier this month. Its all about identity on our side now  They want to show, He does not support me. I support you, refugee. I support you, immigrant in my neighborhood. I want to defend you. Women who are rejecting Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus are saying  theyre saying this is power for them. Donald Trump doesnt take me seriously? Well, Im showing you my value and my power. And I think its like our own version of identity politics on the left thats more empowering. Palmieris remarks were met with derision in progressive circles. And it isnt hard to see why: By minimizing the demands of a (profoundly successful) workers movement  while celebrating the empowerment one can find in boycotting Neiman Marcus  Palmieri served up a parody of the corporate liberalism Sandernistas long to reject. But while the left can comfortably mock Palmieris prescription (fight Trump, one Nordstrom purchase at a time), it cant so easily dismiss her description of the anti-Trump movement. Without question, there is an energized, left-wing faction in the Democratic Party. But you dont have to be a democratic socialist (or even a social democrat) to despise the immigrant-bashing, pussy-grabbing maniac in the Oval Office.You could, for example, be one of a growing number of upper-middle-class Democrats who like the parts of the progressive agenda that dont cost them money (legal abortion, gay marriage, humane immigration policy, etc.) but have no great appetite for issues of labor or redistribution. As the New York Times Thomas Edsall wrote in 2015: As the Democratic Party gained these upper-middle-class votes, they bled white-working-class ones, particularly in midwestern labor strongholds, where the collapse of the union movement loosened many voters attachment to Team Blue (or to voting, at all). The Trump-Clinton race both reflected and accelerated these trends. The GOP nominee ran a campaign aimed squarely at white, Rust Belt angst. The Democrat put forward a progressive economic agenda, but focused her paid messaging on the virtues of multicultural tolerance and professional expertise  themes affluent meritocrats could comfortably endorse. These messages hit their targets. While the heart of the Trump GOPs coalition was still the upper middle class and rich, the mogul lost voters making under $30,000 by 16 fewer points than Romney did; and those making between $30,000 and $50,000 by six points fewer. Meanwhile, among voters who made between $100,000 and $200,000 a year, Hillary Clinton did nine points better last November than Barack Obama had in 2012. Among those who made more than $200,000, she equaled his unusually high (for a Democrat) 2012 share of the vote.Considering how well-represented the upper middle class and rich are in the Democratic tent  and the general (though, not absolute) tendency of those demographics to favor moderate economic policies  Palmieri is likely right that not everyone who took to the streets on January 21 is passionate about a $15 minimum wage; and that many are more likely to express their politics by boycotting fashion lines, than by supporting picket ones. And that description applies even more broadly to the voters Democrats will need to win in November 2018. During last years campaign, some Democrats welcomed the shifting class composition of their partys base. As Chuck Schumer infamously reasoned, For every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia, and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin. This notion wasnt baseless  just fatally overstated. Schumers ratio was off, but Clinton did make significant gains in Romney country. From 1936 to 2012, Orange County, California, gave the majority of its votes to Republican presidential candidates. Then, it backed Hillary Clinton by a nine-point margin. In 2012, Texass 7th congressional district  which encompasses much of Houstons affluent suburbs  backed Mitt Romney by more than 20 points. Last November, it was with her by a margin of 1.4. In fact, Clinton beat Trump in 23 House districts that are currently represented by Republicans, while narrowly trailing him in ten others. And, as Bloombergs Conor Sen notes, what we know about those districts that swung toward Clinton is that theyre full of rich people. Trumps first month in office has only exacerbated the class divide among white voters. The latest Pew poll finds that 61 percent of college-educated whites disapprove of the president; among whites without college diplomas, 57 percent approve of Trump. These demographic trends  combined with Republican gerrymandering in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin  have left Democrats with only one plausible path to a House majority in 2018. And it doesnt run through the lands that Bernie would have won. As the New York Times Nate Cohn writes, only two of the 24 most competitive districts went for Bernie Sanders in a primary contest. Many broke for Mrs. Clinton by landslide margins. This math goes some way toward explaining why a Democratic communications operative doesnt wish to paint the anti-Trump movement in populist terms  and, perhaps, why Republicans plan to run against Elizabeth Warren in 2018. So: There is a considerable, short-term incentive for the Democratic Party to resist calls for a leftward turn  particularly on issues of redistribution. Perhaps, Clinton would have been better served in the Electoral College had she broadcast a louder, more populist economic message. But the themes she ran on played just fine in the Sun Belt suburbs where the most vulnerable House Republicans live. Whether its in the Democratic Partys long-term interest to court Romney voters is less clear. Hillary Clintons communications director might not be keen on centering economic populism, but one of her top super-PACs is. In January, Priorities USA commissioned an extensive survey of two key voting groups  Obama-Trump swing voters and traditional Democrats (largely African-American and millennial) who stayed at home on Election Day. In an op-ed for USA Today, the super-PACs chairman, Guy Cecil, summarized its findings: Steve Phillips of the Center for American Progress argues, more explicitly, that the party should move further left to recapture the liberal voters that Clinton lost to Jill Stein, Gary Johnson, or apathy: To mobilize their base  and recover some of the white working-class votes that once built them a blue wall  Democrats may need a sharp, class-conscious message about economic opportunity. But centering the partys commitment to the parts of progressivism that dont cost rich people money (which include many issues associated with identity politics) may give it a better chance of taking back the House, and retaining the loyalty of the upscale voters who helped provide Clinton a popular vote majority. Democrats may be able to balance these imperatives. After all, its not impossible to run different messages in different races  in the year of Trump, Republicans managed to win Vermonts governors mansion. Plus, Trumps tenure may prove disastrous enough to render the Democrats internal class tensions irrelevant. But for the American left, the Democratic Partys growing reliance on rich voters is a more fundamental challenge. On the stump, Bernie Sanders often suggested that the only things standing between the American people and social democracy were the campaign contributions of millionaires and billionaires. But his partys dependence on the votes of the upper middle-class may be as significant an obstacle. This dependence is not merely the product of white workers shifting rightward; it is also the result of the declining democratic participation of middle- and working-class voters of all races. As Edsall notes, in 1992, lower- and middle-income Americans accounted for 74 percent of the electorate. They made up just 52 percent of the electorate two decades later. Edsall offers a pithy summary of this shifts implications: Absent an uptick in working-class-voter participation  and the concentration of such voters into a single political party  it will be difficult to move economic policy dramatically leftward. Considering that the policies of the Obama era failed to avert the growth of income inequality, an explosion of the racial wealth gap  and the triumph of right-wing populism  its understandable that many on the left find the partys status quo agenda inadequate. And this desire for more sweeping economic change likely informs many lefties belief that a populist, class-conscious message would bring working people  of all colors  off the sidelines and into the Democratic tent. From this vantage, there is little tension between the Democratic lefts policy goals and political expediency: The rage of the dispossessed (and the biases of the Electoral College) demand Sandersism or barbarism. Its also understandable that some progressives might look at Trumps deep unpopularity with college-educated whites, and conclude that an alliance with fiscally moderate suburbanites  and, thus, a tempering of the lefts economic ambitions  is the surest way out of our Trumpist emergency. If there is a genuine tension among Democrats between those who wish to emphasize identity politics over economic populism  or vice versa  it may be rooted in which of these analyses each side prefers to understand."}, {"date": "2017/02/23", "title": "Report: Manafort Faced Blackmail Over Russia Connections During Trump Campaign", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/report-manafort-faced-blackmail-over-russia-connections.html", "text": " Donald Trumps former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was the target of a blackmail scheme orchestrated by a member of the Ukrainian parliament who threatened to reveal politically damaging information about Manafort and Trump to the media and the FBI, Politico reports. The attempt to blackmail Manafort was revealed after a phone belonging to his daughter was hacked and the contents were published on a darknet website run by a hacktivist collective. Among the texts found in the hack was one that looks to be from Ukrainian parliamentarian Serhiy Leshchenko asking to get in touch with Manafort. Attached to that text is a note (shown below) that says the sender is in possession of damaging information linking Manafort to Viktor Yanukovych, the former president of Ukraine whos in exile in Russia and wanted for treason at home. It also mentions information about a 2012 meeting between Trump and Serhiy Tulub, an ally of Yanukovychs. I think you and Mr Trump will work out a way to solve this problem of yours, the note reads, before threatening to deliver the information to the feds. Leshchenko told Politico he did not write the text and called them obviously fake in a Facebook post. Manafort did confirm that the message was sent to his daughter and the hacked text did come from her phone. He received similar messages, he said, before she did and passed them to his lawyer. He also denied setting up a meeting between Trump and Tulub in 2012.

Simultaneously proposing a defense spending buildup, a huge tax cut, a potentially expensive Obamacare replacement, and a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan, while reducing the deficit and leaving the big retirement entitlements more or less alone, was never going to be possible, even in the land of alternative facts and rosy economic scenarios that square many circles. And so, according to a report from Axios, the Trump infrastructure plan is being quietly put on hold until next year. Its being spun in advance as a matter of logistics, not money: Yeah, Im sure Congress just couldnt find the time to spend a trillion smackers on projects in their own states and districts. Truth is, nothing like a real infrastructure investment plan has yet been developed by the administration, and big fights with congressional Republicans could still emerge on issues ranging from use of tax credits rather than direct spending on public programs, Buy America provisions that would boost the cost of materials, and of course, where and when the dollars would flow. It has often been conjectured that this is one area where Trump could get cooperation from congressional Democrats (the Axios report suggests a belief that waiting until the midterm election year of 2018 will increase pressure on Democrats to go along). But cutting the opposition party in on the deal will make designing a package that much harder, as became clear when Senate Democrats released their own plan last month: So theres really no bipartisan consensus on infrastructure, and given inevitable conservative resistance to spending a lot more money on any domestic priority, it would take a lot of loud lobbying from the administration to move this up the priority list for Trumps first term. Perhaps we will hear that in Trumps speech to Congress next week, but it would be wise to pay attention to what the president does and does not say about timing. He will not come right out and say the dozers and cranes wont get cranking until maana. But until the administration gets its own act together and develops something like a credible budget and a feasible agenda, its hard to imagine this element of Making America Great Again becoming more than a rhetorical gesture."}, {"date": "2017/02/23", "title": "Sebastian Gorka Disagrees With His Own Governments Terrorism Statistics", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/sebastian-gorka-disagrees-with-official-terrorism-statistics.html", "text": " Until recently, Sebastian Gorka, a deputy assistant to President Trump and a self-proclaimed expert on radical Islam, wasnt a well-known or respected figure in the national-security community. In fact, every profile of him  and there have been a bunch lately  quotes national-security wonks either saying they hadnt heard of Gorka until he was appointed by Trump, or casting aspersions on his scholarship. When I first encountered his name during the transition, I did a triple-take, Daniel Benjamin, counterterrorism coordinator for Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of State, told Politico. Ive been in counterterrorism since 1998, and I thought I knew everyone. But Id never heard his name and couldnt recall anything hed written or said. Cindy Storer, a former CIA analyst and radicalization expert, was more straightforward: He thinks the government and intelligence agencies dont know anything about radicalization, but the government knows a lot and thinks hes nuts, she told the Washington Post. As these and other articles have pointed out, Gorka, who has a Ph.D. in political science from his native Hungary (correction: his parents are from there, but Gorka was born in Britain), is a relative newcomer to counterterrorism, and simply hasnt built up an impressive academic track record on the subject. (The fact that, per Politico, [s]everal passages of [Gorkas] 2007 dissertation appear to be lifted verbatim from a Human Events article written by his wife, who works in the same field, doesnt help matters.) But Gorka, who prior to Trumps inauguration crowed to Fox News that the alpha males are back in charge, isnt in the White House because of his CV; rather, the available evidence suggests hes there because of his hard-line beliefs. He is an ardent proponent of the counter-jihad ideology that permeates the Trump administration, and which is centered on Steve Bannon and Trump himself  the belief that America is locked in a global war with radical Islam that most people dont take nearly seriously enough, and that both the EU and the U.S. are seriously threatened by the possible imposition of Sharia law by hordes of innocent-seeming Muslims. (Before he was ousted, former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn was an enthusiastic proponent as well.) Gorka has helped spread these sorts of ideas both in his recently released book, Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War, and in his role as a Breitbarts former national security editor and a TV talking head. Like Gorka himself, this counter-jihad movement is not taken seriously by the mainstream national-security establishment. Members of that establishment acknowledge that radical Islamic terrorism is a problem, of course, but simply dont see the epochal, black-and-white civilizational struggle folks like Gorka, or the counter-jihad movements de facto leader Frank Gaffney (who has advised Trump in the past), do. Nor do they fall in for some of the feverish conspiracy theorizing that persistently dogs the movement  Gaffney, for example, frequently spread the falsehood that former president Obama himself was a radical Muslim trying to help terror groups from within the White House. Rather, members of the national-security establishment understand that different Muslim-affiliated terror groups have different motivations  not all of them religious  and dont see it as their role to overhype the reach and strategic strength of groups like ISIS or Al Qaeda, when those groups happen to be in decline. (While the mainstream natsec community is decidedly more reality-based than the counter-jihadists, that doesnt mean it hasnt also screwed up in spectacular ways over the years, of course.) This gap between the excesses of counter-jihad and the more deliberate and rational approach taken by the mainstream natsec community is inevitably going to cause tensions within the Trump White House, simply because the two camps see the world so differently. Trump appointees like Jim Mattis and Flynns replacement, H.R. McMaster, do not believe we are locked in an existential struggle against a giant Muslim conspiracy; Gorka, Bannon, and Trump do. The divide manifested itself in an interesting way yesterday morning on Fox & Friends. During the broadcast, Gorka, in the course of discussing a former Guantanamo Bay detainee who recently blew himself up in Iraq  and making the case for the expand-Guantanamo-dont-close-it toughness that characterized Trumps terror-talk during the campaign  offered some scary statistics about what might happen if more Gitmo detainees are released. We know theres at least 30 if not more than 40 percent recidivism rate from the people released at Gitmo, Gorka said. President Obama released lots and lots of people that were there for very good reason, and what happened? Almost half the time they returned to the battlefield. But according to the governments own statistics  that is, statistics prepared by the sorts of wonks who tend to say mean things about Gorka  thats just not true. Federal law requires the director of National Intelligence to release a public report at least every six months that tracks what has happened to released Gitmo detainees. Heres a handy chart from the most recent one, published in July of last year: The main thing that stands out is that the Obama years saw a much lower recidivism rate among former Gitmo prisoners than the Bush years. Since Obama was sworn in, the recidivism rate for released Gitmo inmates has been just 5.6 percent, or 12.4 percent if you count each and every suspected case of recidivism as a confirmed one as well. During the Bush years, those rates were 21.2 percent and 35.3 percent, respectively. According to Human Rights First, an advocacy group, this change is mostly attributable to the fact that the Obama administration instituted a more thorough vetting process than the George W. Bush administration had in place (though there could be other contributing factors as well, such as the reduced direct-combat role of the U.S. in Iraq and Afghanistan). So it simply doesnt make any sense for Gorka, in the course of criticizing the Obama administration, to claim the recidivism rate is between 30 and 40 percent  let alone almost half. During the Obama years, the recidivism rate was a fraction of that. John Horgan, a psychology professor at Georgia State who is a leading researcher in the field of countering violent extremism, said that he viewed Gorkas claims as emblematic of his broader disdain for mainstream national-security and CVE work. The reality is he is someone who uses the credibility associated with having a PhD and associated with being an academic, he told Intelligencer, but at the same time wants to stand outside that and doesnt want to be held to facts and figures and evidence, and you simply cant have it both ways. (Horgan, who doesnt have an affiliation with Human Rights First, also said he thought the organizations account about the difference between the Bush and Obama administrations Guantanamo Bay policies was accurate.) And the broader problem, Horgan said, is that the counter-jihad framing itself simply doesnt lend itself well to the careful, rational and cost-benefit-analysis-laden work that is supposed to define this sort of policy making. Bannon and Gorka and their colleagues have framed this as an existential threat that cant be qualified, cant be measured, cant be thought about in terms of facts and figures and evidence, he said. And if we buy into that narrative then we have lost perspective. Of course, if Gorkas ultimate goal is to promote the idea of an apocalyptic struggle between Islam and the West, it makes perfect sense that he would overstate the probability of recidivism among Guantanamo detainees. But this is just a Fox & Friends segment, relatively harmless in the grand scheme of things. What happens when it comes time to carefully evaluate a complicated pile of evidence and make a big decision about national-security policy or counterterrorism? Who will win, the Trump-Bannon-Gorka crowd, or Mattis, McMaster, and their allies in the traditional national-security establishment?"}, {"date": "2017/02/23", "title": "This Obscure Story That Should Be Huge Shows How Trump Gets Away With It", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/this-obscure-news-story-shows-how-trump-gets-away-with-it.html", "text": " One of the flaws in the design of the federal government is that, while the founders envisioned competing branches of government, unified party control of government can turn those branches into partners who do not check each others abuses. A second flaw is that Congress has a diffuse and often-confusing decision-making process that can make public accountability extremely difficult. Both problems come together in a new story that ought to be huge news but will instead be relegated to legislative arcana. Here is the story. The House of Representatives has refused to investigate either one of the two massive ongoing legal and ethical violations involving the Trump administration: President Trumps opaque ties (financial and otherwise) to Russia, and his ongoing self-enrichment in office and violations of the Constitutions Emoluments Clause. If the House wont investigate, what happens next? Well, the next-best course of action would be some form of public debate on the matter. This is not nearly as good as a real investigation, since the absence of subpoena power means Republicans can simply deny Trump has done anything wrong while blocking any efforts to acquire the evidence that would prove the case. But at least its something. Thats why House Democrats introduced a resolution of inquiry that would force House action on these issues. Today, Politico reports the Houses response: It will divert the resolution to the House Judiciary Committee, which will (almost certainly) vote on Tuesday along party lines to kill the inquiry. It will be a minor story that probably receives scant or nonexistent coverage from television news, and then it will be quickly over. To be sure, coverage of Trumps scandals will surely continue. But coverage of the House role in permitting Trumps behavior will be extremely minimal. The problem  which is a long-standing one and has protected both parties over the decades  is that the chain of responsibility is too long and obscure to have any bearing on the average voter. The average House Republican votes for the party leadership, which then allocates decisions like this to individual committees, which can be stacked with partisan loyalists from safe districts. (Of course, the overwhelming majority of House members come from safe districts that insulate them from accountability  another longstanding flaw in the system.) If you are a voter in the district of one of the House Republicans who might be vulnerable in a potential Democratic wave election, who do you blame? Well, in January, your representative voted for the leadership that decided to shunt the resolution of inquiry to the Judiciary Committee, that will vote  but you can already see the problem. Your districts representative had no direct involvement in the decision. There wont be any dramatic coverage of his floor vote, as would be the case for a major law. At best, an effective pressure campaign at home might persuade your representative to endorse an investigation, but that endorsement would be toothless anyway, since Paul Ryan is calling the shots. None of this is to say accountability mechanisms do not exist. The mechanism would be for the public to connect the majority party to the perceived failings of the president and vote to throw them out as a whole in the next elections. It is, however, a very blunt mechanism. It requires a lot of generally partisan Republicans to vote against more familiar and long-standing beliefs about guns, abortion, race, and so on to punish their elected representatives for a procedural matter. And that is why Trump has decided he can continue to demolish norms and laws, and why his fellow Republicans have decided they can safely go along."}, {"date": "2017/02/23", "title": "Trump Administration Revokes Guidelines Aimed at Protecting Transgender Students", "url": "http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/02/trump-admin-revokes-guidelines-on-transgender-students.html", "text": " Under the Obama administration, public schools had federal guidelines specifying that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathrooms and lockers of their choice. Those memos stated that not allowing students to use the facilities corresponding with their gender identity was a violation of Title IX, which bars discrimination based on sex. On Wednesday, however, those protections were wiped clean when the Trump administration revoked the previous federal guidelines. Officials with the Education and Justice departments notified the Supreme Court, which is set to hear a case related to the matter next month, that the administration is ordering schools to disregard the previous memos, according to the Washington Post. The new two-page memo to schools states that the Trump administration will not rely on the previously established guidelines regarding transgender rights and that more legal analysis is necessary before deciding on the matter. The previous guidelines, the memo states, were written without due regard for the primary role of the states and local school districts in establishing educational policy. While the new memo doesnt give any clarity as to how schools should operate with regard to the facilities transgender students use, the letter does state, Schools must ensure that all students, including LGBT students, are able to learn and thrive in a safe environment. That statement is likely a compromise on behalf of Education Secretary Besty DeVos, who was hesitant to sign on to the language in the new memo, according to the New York Times. The new attorney general, Jeff Sessions, however, was reportedly decisive in wanting to revoke the previous guidelines because of the current court cases litigating the matter. Reports surfaced earlier in the day that DeVos and Sessions were in disagreement over the issue of transgender rights. DeVos has had a softer, albeit quieter, stance toward LGBT rights. Conversely, Sessions has voted against protections for the LGBT community. Between the two, Sessions viewpoint eventually won President Donald Trump over and as a result, DeVos eventually signed on to the memo. However, her statements signal how cautious she remains. On one hand, she declared that states and local districts should decide school policies. Yet she also ordered the Education Departments Office for Civil Rights to investigate any claims against those who are most vulnerable in our schools, according to the Times. Supporters of the transgender community see the issue of bathroom access in public schools as a fight over civil rights.

Inevitably, after the departure of a two-term Democratic president, the shocking defeat of his intended successor, and the loss of both congressional chambers, a leadership vacuum has opened up among Democrats that has given this contest an importance it may not merit (Theodore White once called party chairmanships the fools gold of American politics, and that is true more often than not). Inevitably as well, the close contest between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination has guaranteed that the DNC race would be interpreted by activists and media alike as a continuation of that battle, and of ideological conflict between progressives and centrists that dates back for more than a quarter-century. So its not surprising that the two leading candidates for the DNC gig going into Atlanta are constantly described as representing the Clinton/Obama and Sanders camps, and/or the ideological tendencies they are thought to represent. The Establishment candidate, former Secretary of Labor (and before that, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights) Tom Perez was a progressive favorite during the Obama administration. But he backed Clinton for president, and so hes being cast as a centrist. His marquee supporters are Obama administration stalwarts Joe Biden and Eric Holder. U.S. Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota fits the stereotype hes been assigned much better: He was an early and enthusiastic Sanders supporter who now has Bernies early and enthusiastic backing (along with that of Sanders populist sidekick Elizabeth Warren and  less predictably Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer). What the two men  and for that matter, the other DNC candidates  say they will do with the partys nuts-and-bolts operations is hard to distinguish. Everybody agrees the donkey needs an infrastructure upgrade focused particularly on purple and red states where the organized Democratic presence is atrophied. Everyone favors the resistance to Trump and the surrounding protest movements as a good foundation for party revival, and everyone denies any interest in spurning or favoring either loyal Democratic voters or the lost voters whose return might restore the national majority that looked so secure just eight years ago. With the candidates singing mostly from the same hymnal, its symbolism that separates them, which is why an Ellison win will be widely interpreted as an insurgent overturning of the tables and/or a move to the left, while a Perez win will cause much angst about the possible estrangement of the People of the Bern. All that symbolic freight, and the apparent tightness of the Ellison/Perez contest, have spurred interest in a possible dark-horse unity candidate. There are several candidates auditioning for that role, including South Carolina party chairman Jaime Harrison, Idaho party executive director Sally Boynton Brown, and former Fox News commentator Jehmu Greene. But at present the dark horse moving up in the pack clearly seems to be South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg. Buttigieg has the backing of four former DNC chairs: Joe Andrews (a fellow Hoosier), Steve Grossman, Ed Rendell, and most recently and perhaps most importantly, Howard Dean, the last successful DNC chair and someone with lingering progressive street cred despite his support for Hillary Clinton in the nomination fight last year. Buttigieg supported Hillary as well, but was not prominent enough or abrasive enough in his advocacy for HRC to permanently alienate Sanders supporters. More important, a Buttigieg win might replace the Clinton-Sanders meme about the DNC contest with his own more positive symbolism: Hes a young (35) elected official from precisely the kind of economically suffering Rust Belt environment that so conspicuously helped Donald Trump win the presidency in 2016. But at the same time, he has all the elite credentials in the world: He went to Harvard, was a Rhodes Scholar, and worked for McKinsey & Company. To cap it all off, hes a veteran of Afghanistan, and is openly gay  this last data point helping him straddle the divide between identity politics groups and economic populists. In many respects Buttigieg is a left-of-center version of Republican golden boy Tom Cotton, though well behind him on the career ladder. But he and the other dark horses only have a chance if the front-runners falter or reach a deadlock (the votes of a majority of DNC members  or 224 of them  are required for a victory, and the DNC keeps balloting until someone wins). Last week Perez claimed to have 180 votes, or just 44 short of a majority. Team Ellison mocked the claim, but didnt offer its own whip count. Just today The Hill released an independent count of 240 DNC members willing to publicly state a preference. It showed Ellison leading with 105 votes, Perez with 57, other candidates having less than a dozen votes, and 50 or so undecided. But then another count from unnamed independent Democratic strategists and reported by the Associated Press gave Perez 205 votes, with 153 for Ellison, 27 for Harrison, and the rest undecided or scattered among the others. Theres no telling where that leaves matters. The last real development in the contest occurred when one of the better-known dark horses, New Hampshire party chairman Ray Buckley, dropped out and endorsed Ellison. But Ellison is having to battle whispers that his election would alienate Jewish voters and donors; hes the first Muslim to be elected to Congress, and was associated in the distant past with Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam (he repudiated that association at least a decade ago). Tonight, all the candidates big and small will get to strut their stuff at a forum televised by CNN. They will likely struggle to sound different from each other, which, of course, will elevate the symbolic trappings of the contest. The DNC gig may be fools gold, but at this less than brilliant moment in the Democratic Partys history, its the most glittering trophy in sight."}, {"date": "2017/02/22", "title": "Trump Immigration Memo Angers Mexico; Spicer Says Relationship Is Phenomenal", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-immigration-memo-angers-mexico.html", "text": " Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly are headed to Mexico Wednesday.

Mexican officials say this issue will now dominate the talks especially since, based on the memo, such a policy change would likely require cooperation on Mexicos part. (It also doesnt seem as if the United States gave Mexico too much of a heads-up about this provision.) Another Mexican official told ProPublica: Its a non-starter.

In a normal organization  the kind where a leader can be left unaccompanied for a few hours without his subordinates fearing he will descend into a television-binge-fueled social-media meltdown  it could be assumed that the highest-ranking officials word would override that of his appointed department leader.

The latest dispatch from the child monarchy of Donald Trump comes via Politicos Tara Palmeri, who conveys the methods used by Trumps staffers to manipulate his delicate and damaged psyche. The thrust of the story revolves around the constant struggle to prevent Trump from tweeting out angry or false things that degrade his standing with the public by opening up a window into his mind. Palmeri, who spoke with six former Trump campaign officials, discovered that their method for controlling the president is based on a combination of his pathologies: 1. Media criticism makes Trump irrationally angry. The presidents habit of firing off replies to critical media outlets is well known, but Palmeri provides more details of his vulnerability to psychic distress when presented with criticism: 2. Trump does not control his own print-media diet. Other than a handful of legacy newspapers and magazines that he reads in print, the rest of the presidents news diet is spoon-fed to him by his staff: 3. Trump does control his own television-media diet. He surfs cable for hours, a habit that can feed into his self-destructive mental state: 4. Trumps staff manipulates him by presenting him with favorable news. Trump tweets his own message out of a belief that his allies are not defending him with sufficient vigor, so he can he dissuaded from doing so if he sees favorable coverage in the printed-out news collection handed to him: 5. If there was not enough favorable coverage available, Trumps aides would plant favorable stories in conservative media. Palmeri reports several such examples of planted stories in the right-wing media: Alternative media describes media that will report the Trump administrations alternative facts. The Washington Examiner and Fox News contain a mix of legitimate reporting with conservative propaganda. Infowars is a fever-swamp conspiracy site run by Alex Jones, who promotes hoaxes like Pizzagate, insists the Sandy Hook shooting was faked, is suspicious of fluoridated water, and so on. Jones is barking mad. Breitbart and the Daily Caller lie in the middle ground between normal, conservative, Fox Newscrazy, and Alex Jonescrazy. (Jim Rutenberg recently noted the overlap between Joness conspiratorial beliefs and Trumps, but the administration refused to tell him that Trump followed Joness claims. Now Palmeri has confirmed it.) And so Trumps staff essentially outsources the job of circulating pro-Trump alternative facts to the right-wing media in order to dissuade the president from doing it himself and thereby tarnishing his brand. The president is therefore not only the subject but also the object of his own staffs propaganda campaign. Palmeri also reports a fascinating detail about the efforts to confirm Neil Gorsuch. The nominees comments to Senator Richard Blumenthal expressing dismay with Trumps attacks on the judiciary were planned, out of the calculation that demonstrating Gorsuchs independence from Trump and willingness to oppose his attacks on the judiciary would ease his path to confirmation. White House officials anticipated that Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch would distance himself from Trumps attack and thought the planned comments would help the nominees bid, said a person with knowledge of the conversations, she reports. Alas, Trump was not privy to the plan and, filled with rage, fired off a series of tweets attacking Blumenthal:"}, {"date": "2017/02/22", "title": "The Trump Administration Cant Agree on Treatment of Transgender Students", "url": "http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/02/trump-appointees-are-fighting-over-rules-for-trans-students.html", "text": " On Tuesday, Sean Spicer suggested that President Trump would issue further guidance on President Obamas guidelines to public schools regarding transgender students. The guidelines, which took the form of a letter to every public-school district in the nation, were issued to protect trans students from discrimination by letting educators know what trans discrimination looks like and how to prevent it. According to Spicer, however, Trump believes the issue should be left to the states: This is not something that the federal government should be involved in, he said. This is a states-rights issue. But it seems not everyone in his administration feels the same. According to the New York Times, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos resisted signing an order to rescind Obamas guidelines and told Trump she was uncomfortable with it. Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, pressed her, and when Trump sided with Sessions, DeVos acquiesced. But she and Sessions are reportedly still going back and forth over the language of Trumps order, which is expected to be released this week. According to the Times, a draft of the order cites the many states that have sued over Obamas directives as a reason to scrap them. School administrators, parents, and students have expressed varying views on the legal issues arising in this setting, it reads. They have also struggled to understand and apply the statements of policy and guidance. DeVos reportedly asked that a line requiring schools to protect trans students from bullying be included: Schools must ensure that transgender students, like all students, are able to learn in a safe environment. When asked Wednesday why the Trump administration is making these guidelines a priority, Spicer cited the upcoming Supreme Court case in which a trans student  Gavin Grimm  sued his school board after they refused to let him use the boys restroom. That case is set to be heard next month, which means the Trump administration needs to decide where it stands, Spicer said. He added that DeVos is on board with Trumps new order 100 percent. Trump didnt bring up trans issues much during his campaign, except to say that North Carolinas bathroom bill was very strong and that trans people should use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate. But as the Times points out, hes beholden to the religious right  which means that, despite his personal beliefs, hell probably limit federal protections for LGBTQ people, preferring to leave such issues to the states."}, {"date": "2017/02/22", "title": "Is Trump Taking Over Conservatism, or Is Conservatism Absorbing Trump?", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/is-trump-taking-over-conservatism-or-the-other-way-around.html", "text": " For those who first learned of the venerable annual Beltway conference of the American Conservative Union, known as CPAC, during the Obama administration, the event is mainly an obligatory stop on the presidential campaign trail for Republicans and a sort of family reunion for the conservative movement. But the many dimensions of this well-attended event were nicely summarized by NPR this week: The chief celebrant will, of course, be the president of the United States, Donald Trump, who welcomes every chance to display his political success and bask in the adulation of people who very likely viewed him as a sideshow act during his previous appearances at CPAC in 2011, 2013, and 2015. This years CPAC caps the remarkable process whereby this heretic not only became acceptable to conservatives during the course of the 2016 campaign, but is rapidly placing his stamp on conservatism as we know it in the past a durable ideology that transcended constant arguments over strategy and tactics. It is safe to say that a lot, perhaps a majority, of those who will hear Trump speak Friday morning could not have imagined the scene just two years ago. So the question that will come up again and again at CPAC is whether Trump is adjusting himself to conservatism now that he leads Americas conservative party, or whether conservatism is fundamentally changing to accommodate his power and voter appeal. Luckily for Trump, CPAC is occurring before any major rifts have opened up between his nascent administration and the Republican leadership of Congress. So the mood is likely to be upbeat, with various factions on the right all seeing what they want to see in the road just ahead. Dont let the brouhaha over Milo Yiannopouloss scheduled and then canceled appearance fool you, though: The furor he aroused among conservatives was more about issues relating to his provocative treatment of his own gay sexuality (very recently CPAC was roiled by arguments as to whether pro-gay-rights conservative groups were even welcome as paying sponsors of the event) than about his role as a legitimizer of the seedier side of the alt-right. Yes, an ACU board member is scheduled to assail the alt-right in a speech Thursday morning. But that may be part of a process to limn the limits within which Trumpian nationalism will be fully embraced. And embraced it most definitely will be. The Washington Posts veteran conservative watchers Robert Costa and David Weigel: Murphy is the rare bitter-end #NeverTrump conservative who is still speaking out against the new regime. The vast majority of former Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich supporters who are going along with Trump, with or without private misgivings, are probably more likely to think CPAC is seducing Trump rather than succumbing to his sinister blandishments. But it is hard to deny the different tone of this particular CPAC. I count eight separate appearances by Brietbart writers on the agenda. The very first speaker when the full event begins tomorrow is Kellyanne Conway. Later that day Stephen Bannon and Reince Priebus will appear together. As Costa and Weigel explain, the symbolism of that appearance is not lost on anyone: The new crowd at CPAC will displace certain once-prominent members of the old crowd. From 2007 through 2015, the CPAC presidential straw poll was won four times by Mitt Romney, twice by Ron Paul, and three times by Rand Paul. Romney and the Pauls will be nowhere in sight at this CPAC. That may help answer the underlying question of (to borrow Aretha Franklins phrase) whos zooming who in the relationship between conservatism and Team Trump."}, {"date": "2017/02/22", "title": "Republicans Accuse Protesters of Organizing for Political Change", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/gop-accuses-protesters-of-organizing-for-political-change.html", "text": " Last night, congressional Republicans came home to rooms full of angry people. At town halls across the country, conservative lawmakers were protested, heckled, and shouted at. A few unfortunate souls were even asked to explain  in detail  the GOP plan for replacing the Affordable Care Act. But Republicans arent worried. Theyre onto liberals cute little game. Theyve realized that these so-called protests are, in truth, tactical demonstrations  planned, in advance  by people who want to bring about political change. At first blush, this tweet may seem like another eccentric outburst from our tweeter-in-chief. Why would anyone think that protests are illegitimate simply because theyre planned? The so-called March on Washington was actually, in numerous cases, planned out by civil-rights activists. And yet, this seems to be a genuine Republican talking point. Two days before Trumps tweet, Texas senator John Cornyn shared a New York Post article that also tries to discredit the protests by claiming that they are strategically organized. To be fair, the protests are planned is a considerably more honest line of attack than the paid protesters claim that preceded it. (Presumably, someone realized that if George Soros really were paying every anti-Trump protester, the liberal billionaire would be responsible for more job creation than the president). And if you squint real hard at Paul Sperrys Post column, you can see the makings of a point: So, liberal activists are conscious of optics and, when possible, try to engineer an impression of widespread opposition via such nefarious tactics as not all sitting together. Its legitimate for conservative commentators and politicians to highlight these tactics. And, for many Republican House members, its probably true that town hall protests give a false impression of the scale of dissent in their red districts. But theres still a certain comedy to these complaints. The training manual Sperry stumbled upon was drafted by Indivisible  an organization that is not formally affiliated with Barack Obama or OFA  and has been proudly shared by Democrats and liberal activists over social media for months. The central charge of Sperrys op-ed is that Organizing for Action is, in truth, an Obama-aligned front-group whose true purpose is  organizing for action. Of course, the audiences at these town halls arent perfect representations of district-wide public opinion. And of course, professional political organizers are trying to channel liberal outrage in productive directions. This is how politics is practiced on both sides of the aisle. Earlier this month, the tea-party-aligned outside group FreedomWorks announced that it will be organizing rallies and town hall counter-protests in support of Obamacare repeal. OFAs training manual isnt whats unusual here. Whats unusual is the number of people eager to study it. Activists do try to create an exaggerated impression of public support for their goals. But the more people they organize, the less hyperbolic that impression becomes."}, {"date": "2017/02/22", "title": "Fox News Congratulates Rand Paul For Being Loyal Trump Stooge [Updated]", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/rand-paul-has-become-trumps-most-loyal-toady.html", "text": " The Republican Party has largely decided to cover for Donald Trumps massive corruption, grotesque lies, and manifest unfitness for office. But few of them have gone quite so far, or quite so cravenly, as Rand Paul. The junior senator from Kentucky, and onetime hope of the extremely short-lived libertarian moment in American politics, has not only attached himself to Trump, but is actively snuffing out whatever faint stirrings of opposition his colleagues can muster. While the GOP Congress has ignored the presidents self-enrichment, refusal to disclose his tax returns, and clear violations of the Constitutions Emoluments Clause, some have expressed willingness to investigate his opaque ties to Russia. Paul is not one of them. And not only does he see no need for investigation on Russia, Paul has staked out a stance against any investigations, period, on the brutally frank grounds that it would impair the partys legislative agenda. I just dont think its useful to be doing investigation after investigation, particularly of your own party, he told Kilmeade and Friends. Well never even get started with doing the things we need to do, like repealing Obamacare, if were spending our whole time having Republicans investigate Republicans. Many Republicans have made piecemeal excuses not to exercise the oversight function. Only Paul has elevated the practice of looking away from the crimes of the Executive branch to an actual principle of governance. John McCain has staked out the most independent position, most recently likening Trumps description of the media as enemies of the people to the words of a dictator. Paul is having none of it. Last weekend, Paul appeared on CNN to deliver a defense of Trump so fulsome that Breitbart has published it in its entirety. After repeatedly swatting away concerns about the president, Paul explained that McCains criticism of Trumps authoritarian ravings were nothing but a cover for his ideological vendetta: Obviously Paul has longstanding disagreements with McCain on foreign policy. But the subject of this rant was not foreign policy; it was Trumps creepy, Stalinesque dismissal of the news media as a class enemy, which Paul is excusing by changing the subject to other issues. Every authoritarian requires spineless lackeys who will attack his dissidents. In Trumps Republican Party, the authoritarians best friend is the libertarian. Update: Paul appeared on Fox & Friends to respond to this. A smirking Steve Doocey asked, So, New York Magazine says youre Trumps most loyal stooge because, while other members of your party have some opposition to Mr. Trump, you seem to want to actually advance his agenda. Presented with a question purporting to dismiss the premise of this piece, but actually confirming it instead, Paul made two defenses: 1. The haters are gonna hate, what are you gonna do? This ignores the possibility that abandoning his blanket opposition to any investigation of Trumps scandals is a thing he could do. 2. Im probably one of the most independent Senators on the Hill I was the only Republican that voted against a budget that would have added $9 trillion in new debt. So Im hardly someone whos afraid to tout the party line. It is true that Paul cast a symbolic vote against the budget, whose passage was not in doubt. The degree to which this message vote balances out his opposition to conducting any oversight whatsoever on the Executive Branch is for the reader to decide. I will note that Im hardly someone whos afraid to tout the party line may be a case where Paul stated what he is thinking in his head rather than what he meant to say out loud."}, {"date": "2017/02/22", "title": "These Republicans Faced So-Called Angry Crowds at Tuesdays Town Halls", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/all-the-republicans-who-faced-town-hall-crowds-on-tuesday.html", "text": " As Republican lawmakers headed home for their first recess of the year, they faced a difficult choice: hide from their constituents or risk being called out by a little girl and having the video go viral? Scores of Republicans across the country have chosen the former option, holding telephone forums or simply canceling events to avoid meeting face-to-face with angry constituents. With new grassroots groups like Indivisible urging those who oppose President Trump to adopt the tactics of the tea party, events that were once sparsely attended have drawn standing-room-only crowds. People have even taken to holding empty chair town halls in districts where they cant get a meeting with their representative. On Tuesday, President Trump offered some encouragement to Republicans in Congress, suggesting angry crowds are only legitimate if theyre disorganized: Here are all the Republican members of Congress who chose to forge ahead with their public appearances on Tuesday, rather than avoiding or denigrating their newly energized constituents. Technically, the Senate majority leader did not hold a town hall on Tuesday, but he got a taste of the resistance facing Republicans both inside and outside his luncheon with local business leaders in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky, as McClatchy reports. Nearly 1,000 people gathered outside the Lawrenceburg American Legion, shouting, No ban, no wall, Mitch McConnell take our call, referring to his full voice-mail box at his offices. During his speech, McConnell said Americans are free to peacefully express their beliefs, and were proud of that. So Im proud of those folks out there. However, he made a jab at the demonstrators, saying they didnt like the results of the election, But in this country when you win the election you get to make policy. I always remind people, winners make policy and losers go home. Several people who bought tickets to the event challenged McConnell, but he brushed off their questions. One woman pressed him about the thousands of coal jobs that have disappeared from eastern Kentucky. If youll answer that, Ill sit down and shut up like Elizabeth Warren, she said. I hope you feel better now, McConnell replied. About 200 people showed up to a coffee with the congressman event held by Representative Womack, which usually draws only about 40 people. According to the Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette, the questions mostly focused on what Womack would do to hold President Trump accountable. About 200 people turned out for Congressman Rosss town hall event on Tuesday. The Orlando Sentinel reports that the crowd chanted, Lock him up! following a question about President Trump discussing national security during a dinner at Mar-a-Lago. Ross responded, When you have somebody whos not a typical politician, youre going to have mistakes. When asked if he supports President Trumps comments about Muslims and Latinos, Ross said, I dont condone those comments. I dont condone discrimination of any kind. I am not here to defend what the president is saying or what he is tweeting. Ross, who sits on the House Oversight Committee, expressed surprise when a constituent asked if he would look into the millions of dollars Trump has spent on his frequent trips to Mar-a-Lago as president. Ross said, Youre the first one to bring this to my attention, then ended the event early as the incredulous crowd chanted, Oversight, oversight. A sizable crowd showed up to see Congressman Webster on Tuesday afternoon, though his office said the event was an open house for a new district office, not a town hall. Webster briefly addressed the room, saying, Just know, were here to serve. We will be available, but he struggled to be heard over shouts from pro- and anti-Trump hecklers. He then exited without taking questions, drawing boos from the crowd. More than 300 people packed into Representative Carters town hall in Savannah on Tuesday, with dozens more chanting Let us in! outside. Carter answered a wide range of questions, but the Los Angeles Times reports that his answer on Obamacare provoked the most ire. After a small business owner said the Affordable Care Act saved him financially after major abdominal surgery, Carter said, Look, for every story like this there are 20 stories that are just the opposite. When Carter failed to explain the Republicans replacement plan, the crowd chanted, Answer! One constituent asked Carter about President Trumps refusal to release his tax returns. I am not here to tell you Donald Trump is perfect, Carter said. I am not going to tell you I agree with everything he has done. Those of you who have studied the Bible know that God has used imperfect people to do great things. Senator Grassley, who backed out of bipartisan talks over health-care reform after facing a crowd of angry tea partiers eight years ago, was confronted by Iowans in favor of the law at packed events in Iowa on Tuesday. He tried to reassure the crowd by saying three of the four Republican replacement plans circulating in D.C. would keep the most popular elements of Obamacare. I believe at this point, with any one of those three, [those] 20 million people wont lose because we made clear that those on the exchange, the [coverage] will continue, he said. Senator Ernst held a veterans roundtable at a venue that holds about 100 people in the tiny town of Maquoketa, Iowa. As CNN reports, when she showed up on Tuesday night the room was packed, with dozens more filling the adjacent hallways. Ernst ignored the protesters and mainly called on veterans. She ended the event after only 45 minutes. Representative Blackburn was frequently booed by the 130 people at her town hall in Fairview, Tennessee, on Tuesday. Blackburn, who served on Trumps transition team, repeatedly defended the president, according to The Tennessean. When one man asked about Stephen Bannon, a notorious white nationalist, having a place on the National Security Council, Blackburn said, My interactions with him have all been fine. Demonstrators complained that the venue wasnt big enough, and about 200 people held an alternative town hall outside. They stepped up to a microphone to share questions they would have asked Blackburn if they had been admitted to the town hall. Blackburn thanked them for coming and promised to watch the video of the alternative event, but she didnt take questions. Representative Brat, who previously complained, The women are in my grill no matter where I go, took questions from supporters and detractors at a crowded restaurant conference room in Blackstone, Virginia, on Tuesday. As Politico notes, he had people write their questions on index cards so he didnt have to field questions directly from constituents. Im having fun, Brat said afterward, though he received plenty of jeers from the crowd. I like having debates. There were more than 900 people at Representative Taylors town hall in Yorktown, Virginia, his second public forum this week. When asked about President Trumps derogatory comments about national intelligence agencies and his campaigns alleged ties to Russia, Taylor said, There are problems on both sides. I have said I dont agree with the president  I think its wrong. I have friends in the intelligence community. Though Taylor faced plenty of opposition from the crowd, he said the evening was calmer than his previous event, and the discourse was enjoyable. There are people who agree with me [and] people who didnt agree with me, but I think they all have the right to be respected and have a seat at the table, Taylor said. And, thats why were here."}, {"date": "2017/02/22", "title": "Timing of Trump Immigration Memos Undermines Cabinet Members Visit to Mexico", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/immigration-memos-undermine-cabinet-members-mexico-visit.html", "text": " The Trump administrations timing of its immigration directives is a sign of either the disorganization within the White House or a purposeful effort to provoke Mexican officials. Last month, Trump unveiled his executive orders on immigration and a border wall on the same day top Mexican officials met with Trump aides in Washington to lay the groundwork for Mexican president Enrique Pea Nietos visit to the White House the following week. After bickering with President Trump on Twitter, President Pea Nieto canceled the meeting. Now the Department of Homeland Securitys release of guidance memos elaborating on how the executive orders should be carried out has jeopardized another attempt to mend U.S.-Mexico relations. The memos were released on the eve of U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Homeland Security Secretary John Kellys visit to Mexico City, and Politico reports that Mexican officials were scrambling to collect more information from the U.S. government on Tuesday. The Department of Homeland Security denied that the release of the memos was timed to coincide with the visit. The release of the implementation guidance was not at all tied to the secretarys trip to Mexico, DHS spokesperson Gillian Christensen said. However, the secretary looks forward to a strong partnership with the Mexican government and to reaffirming that partnership this week. Whatever the aim, the memos likely made that mission more difficult. While Tillerson and Kelly have been far less combative than Trump in their stance toward Mexico, the Associated Press reports that Mexicans were already questioning the point of continuing discussions with an administration that keeps talking about deportations, taking jobs from Mexicans, and forcing Mexico to pay for a wall. Earlier this month, 20,000 people marched in Mexico City to protest Trumps policies. Ahead of this weeks visit, some have urged President Pea Nieto to take a tougher stance against the U.S. Writing in the newspaper Reforma, journalist Carmen Aristegui said Pea Nieto should set new ground rules before talks with the U.S. proceed. Instead of welcoming Tillerson and Kelly next week as if nothing had happened, the Pea administration should say that there is no basis to negotiate on any topic at all, until the executive order to build this absurd and offensive wall is withdrawn, and our countrymen are no longer criminalized or prosecuted, she wrote. An editorial from the newspaper La Jornada made a similar argument: The Mexican side has let too many gestures of hostility go by without, to this point, presenting a diplomatic note of protest, without suspending bilateral contacts or without having taken complaints to international tribunals. While much of the Trump administrations rhetoric suggests that Mexico will be forced to comply with new U.S. policies, key elements of the plan require Mexicos cooperation. In recent years, U.S. Border Patrol has been apprehending more non-Mexicans than Mexicans at the southern border, as people flee from the violence in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. As Foreign Policy notes: A provision unveiled on Tuesday involves deporting undocumented immigrants to the country where they crossed the border, rather than their country of origin, as their case is processed in the U.S. However, Mexico could not be forced to accept foreign migrants, and the country could exacerbate problems for the U.S. if it suspends its efforts to prevent Central Americans from heading north. Theres a misperception that because the U.S. is much bigger and in many ways more powerful, that Mexico lacks leverage, Chris Wilson, the deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, told Foreign Policy. Right now Mexico is deporting more Central Americans than the U.S., so many would say Mexico is doing some of the United Statess dirty work  all of that  and Mexico has basically stated as much  is on the line if the cooperative framework of the relationship is lost."}, {"date": "2017/02/21", "title": "Trumps Immigration Policies Have Already Taken a Toll on the U.S. Economy", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trumps-immigration-policies-have-already-taken-a-toll-on-the-u-s-economy.html", "text": " Making America safe again is expensive. To contain the (fictional) epidemics of immigration crime and refugee terrorism, the Trump administration hopes to hire 10,000 new immigration-enforcement agents and spend $12 to $21 billion on a border wall. But the full cost of Trumps immigration agenda is probably higher than any budget document would have you believe. Consider the price Americas tourism industry has paid for the presidents infamous travel ban: Since Trump signed his name to an executive order barring immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, overseas interest in visiting the United States has plummeted. Per the New York Times: The Times goes on to review data from a litany of other travel companies, all testifying to the same phenomenon. Even if this downturn proves temporary, the cost to the American economy could be significant. In 2015, tourism-related spending reached $1.56 trillion in the U.S.  enough to generate 7.6 million jobs. And theres reason to think that the trend will endure. The White House is already preparing a new, less-sweeping version of its travel ban, even as the anti-American sentiment generated by the first one lingers on. Theres now a perception that the U.S. is a place of instability, and that view will impact visitation to this country, Rummy Pandit, the executive director of the Lloyd D. Levenson Institute of Gaming, Hospitality and Tourism at Stockton University in New Jersey, told the Times. The research firm Oxford Economics has projected that this Trump backlash could cost Los Angeles County $736 million in tourism spending over the next three years. This is just one second-order consequence of a single item on Trumps immigration agenda. The presidents travel ban also threatens the availability of medical care in rural hospitals and productivity growth in Silicon Valley. Meanwhile, his plans to ramp up deportation risk throwing thousands of mixed-status families  specifically, families with citizen children and undocumented immigrant parents  into poverty. To be fair, Trumps immigration agenda could also, ostensibly, produce some positive economic ripple effects. Underemployed construction workers may end up pocketing some of those border-wall funds; its conceivable that native-born, high-school dropouts might see higher wages in the absence of competition from the undocumented. Still, when you look to the bigger picture, it is very hard to make the economic case for an America First agenda. The White Houses budget is premised on our country enjoying 3 percent annual economic growth for much of the next decade. With more baby-boomers retiring every day, that level of growth is all but impossible absent much higher levels of immigration: At present, net immigration is responsible for nearly all of the growth in Americas working-age population. The details of the administrations agenda on legal immigration remain unclear. But after one month in office, Trump has already made America a less desirable place to visit. Its hard to imagine hes made it a more desirable one to immigrate to."}, {"date": "2017/02/21", "title": "A Refugees Welcome Banner Was Hanging on the Statue of Liberty Today", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/protesters-hang-refugees-welcome-banner-from-lady-liberty.html", "text": " Refugees Welcome, the Statue of Liberty declared Tuesday afternoon, when a group unfurled a banner across the pedestal of the monument just before 1 p.m. We have no formal group, but are just private citizens who feel that the principles that make America great are under attack, the protesters, who used the name Alt Lady Liberty on Twitter, told Daily Intelligencer in an email. Some of us have never done anything like this before but felt the need to act now. Visitors to Lady Liberty documented the protest, which made it a few hours Tuesday afternoon until it was removed.

Refugees are welcome here, Muslims are welcome here, and immigrants are welcome here, the person behind the Alt Lady Liberty account said about the motivation for hanging the banner. We wanted to send a reminder about America when were at our best  the country thats a beacon of freedom to the world, built by immigrants.

That order was blocked by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, but the White House is working on a new order to try to avoid such legal challenges."}, {"date": "2017/02/21", "title": "Administration Rattles Sabers at Undocumented Immigrants", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/administration-rattles-sabers-at-undocumented-immigrants.html", "text": " Now that the Trump travel ban is at least temporarily out of the news headlines, attention is shifting to the broader issue of the new administrations overall immigration policies. And with todays guidance memos from Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, it is becoming clearer than ever that Team Trump is signaling a major new wave of deportations. The memos are meant to explain the earlier presidential executive order on immigration policy that was overshadowed by the brouhaha over the travel ban and the Trump-induced preoccupation with border-wall construction. The most important thing to understand about the initial shift in policy is that it is replacing the Obama administrations carefully calibrated deportation strategy with one that treats all undocumented immigrants with the perhaps-temporary exception of the dreamers given protection by Obama in the the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) executive order  as potential targets. Thus all that is missing for a massive new wave of deportations is the infrastructure. And Kellys memos are focused on building up the resources necessary to round em up and move em out. An earlier draft of Kellys guidance discussed the federalization of up to 100,000 National Guard personnel for deportation duty. That alarming idea did not make it into the actual memos. But heres what did: You will notice a lot of the guidance is prospective: The administration is beginning to do this or that. That could indicate an element of caution, or perhaps the need for more funding from Congress, not to mention pledges of cooperation from the local governments who would have to make their law-enforcement personnel available to become part-time ICE agents. But these signals also most likely have an ulterior motive: Fear in the immigrant community is itself a crucial tool for this administration given the signs that it would prefer that as many as possible of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country decide to self-deport. It is certainly less expensive and visible than running down huge numbers of people, holding them in detention facilities, and then shipping them out of the country. All the saber rattling, moreover, will thrill the nativists in Trumps electoral base nearly as much as actually deporting those pesky people who may be hard-working, taxpaying people doing jobs Americans dont want, but who broke the law, thus earning whatever ill treatment they receive. If the self-deportation strategy doesnt work substantively or politically, then we will find out whether Kelly and Trump have the stomach for the police-state tactics that would be necessary to deport many millions of people by force."}, {"date": "2017/02/21", "title": "Malaysia Cant Say for Sure If Kim Jong-uns Half-Brother Was Poisoned", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/malaysian-authorities-cant-say-for-sure-if-kim-jong-uns-half-brother-was-poisoned.html", "text": " The case surrounding the death of North Korean leader Kim Jong-uns older half-brother keeps getting weirder. The preliminary autopsy of Kim Jong-nam, who died after allegedly being attacked with an unknown substance at the airport in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is inconclusive, authorities say. South Korean intelligence officials believe Jong-nam had been poisoned as part of an assassination plot cooked up by his paranoid sibling, but so far, an examination hasnt shown any evidence of cardiac arrest or a puncture wound  which would indicate Jong-nams assailants had injected him with a deadly toxin, reports the Washington Post. The Malaysian director of General Health Noor Hisham Abdullah, didnt rule out death by poisoning, and are awaiting the findings of lab tests. Authorities didnt give a timeline for those results, but the director of Malaysias National Poison Centre said his lab had yet to receive specimens for testing. They were reportedly supposed to arrive two days ago. Two women  one wearing an LOL shirt, and the other who claimed she thought she was participating in a reality-TV stunt  ambushed Jong-nam in the airport and misted him with a mysterious liquid. But experts told the Associated Press that it is strange that both women appeared to walk away just fine from the incident, which left Jong-nam dead before he could make it to the hospital. In addition to the two women, four other men are suspected in connection to Jong-nams death. Meanwhile, North Korea is picking a fight with Malaysia over the countrys decision to perform an autopsy on the body, accusing it of mangling Jong-nams body  even though the country has not yet confirmed that the dead man is a member of the North Korean rulers family. Kang Chol, North Koreas ambassador to Malaysia, also blamed that country of working with South Korea to try to make Pyongyang look bad, saying in a statement that not releasing the body back to North Korea is the culmination of human rights abuse and shows once again how they are desperate to shift blame on us.

The president himself offered a succinct talking point on that subject near the beginning of his very non-succinct February 16 press conference. True to form, Trump cherry-picked the most favorable polling data available, and ignored the rest. But he could not do that  short of just, well, making stuff up, which is always an option for him  if it were not for an unusually wide range of findings in the polling universe about public attitudes toward the 45th presidents job performance so far. As Nate Silver notes, Trumps recent approval ratings vary from a high of 55 percent (with 45 percent disapproval) in the aforementioned Rasmussen poll to a low of 39 percent (with 56 percent disapproval) in a survey from Pew Research. The differences are most likely the result of a combination of sampling and survey techniques. Trump consistently does better with narrower samples. Rasmussen claims to be measuring likely voters, even though we are more than a year and a half away from the next national election. Pew is sampling all adults, a significantly larger universe than those who will ultimately vote in that next election. Rasmussen is also famously a robo-pollster, which means hes only reaching the half of the electorate that has land lines. Pew utilizes a traditional live-interview methodology, which is generally thought to be more accurate, but that some theorize can be misleading with respect to highly controversial politicians like Trump. (This is the shy Trump voter theory.) While polls like Rasmussens have a poor reputation and polls like Pews are considered closer to the gold standard (FiveThirtyEights pollster ratings give Raz a C+ and Pew a B+), we are in a period of great uncertainty about polling quality. And as it happens, the final 2016 national poll from Rasmussen pretty much nailed Clintons popular-vote margin over Trump, while the final Pew poll (conducted two weeks out, to be fair) showed Clinton up by six points. So with all this confusion, is Trump justified in just citing whichever polling results he wants? No, not really. Most observers who are interested in approximating the truth go with polling averages. At the moment, RealClearPolitics average of recent polls places Trumps job approval ratio at 45/51. Its also important to pay attention to trends. As it happens, since Trump bragged about his Rasmussen numbers, his approval ratio in that tracking poll has deteriorated from 55/45 to 50/50, the worst ratio of his brief administration. It is an entirely different question how much these numbers matter as a predictor of the next election. While the party of the president almost always loses House seats and more often than not loses Senate and gubernatorial seats in midterms, and less popular presidents usually lose more than popular presidents, variations in the landscape can make it very tricky to lay odds. The Senate landscape in 2018 is insanely pro-Republican. GOP control of the upper chamber could very well survive even a Democratic electoral tsunami. Since all House seats are up in 2018, GOP control there is significantly more vulnerable, but thanks to gerrymandering and superior efficiency in the distribution of voters, Democrats will have an uphill battle to win the net 24 seats necessary for a flip in control  and with it the ability to thwart the Trump/GOP agenda. Nate Cohn appears to think its too much of a reach even if Trumps approval ratings stay roughly where they are today. So while it is hard to deny that Trump is amazingly unpopular for a new president, unless his approval ratings trend farther down the way even those of popular presidents typically do, his party may not suffer the kind of humiliation Democrats experienced in 2010. For all the shock Trump has consistently inspired with his behavior as president, theres not much objective reason for Republican politicians to panic and begin abandoning him based on his current public standing. But in this as in so many other respects, we are talking about an unprecedented chief executive, so the collapse some in the media and the Democratic Party perceive as already underway could yet arrive."}, {"date": "2017/02/21", "title": "Trump to Tackle Deficit With Imaginary Growth, Elimination of Popular Programs", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-to-tackle-deficit-with-fake-growth-abolition-of-pbs.html", "text": " President Trump has promised to cut taxes on the rich; increase spending on the military; build a wall on the southern border; spend $1 trillion on infrastructure; leave Social Security and Medicare untouched; and balance the federal budget. Which is a bit like promising to add seven cronuts to your daily diet; stop exercising; drink nothing but Mountain Dew; and lose 30 pounds by months end. Since his election, Trump has made some concessions to fiscal reality. The president no longer demands a balanced budget in the immediate term. Instead, he merely wishes to cut taxes and increase spending, while reducing the deficit in the long term. The presidents plan for accomplishing this (impossible) goal, appears to be two-pronged: (1) Baselessly assume that economic growth will be a full percentage point higher than the Congressional Budget Office expects. (2) Eliminate a bevy of discretionary programs that, together, account for $2.5 billion of the governments annual $4 trillion budget. The notion that cutting taxes on the rich will rapidly accelerate growth because businessmen and entrepreneurs will have more incentive to invest in new companies has been a cornerstone of Republican economic thinking since Reagan. It is also demonstrably false. But what supply-side economics lacks in empirical validity it makes up for in political utility: If you assume tax cuts spur significantly higher economic growth, then you can claim that they actually pay for themselves  after all, higher growth means a larger tax base, and lower costs on stabilizing programs like unemployment insurance and food stamps. It would be surprising, then, if Trump didnt deploy dynamic scoring to paper over the contradictions in his agenda. But even by the standards of supply-siders past, Trumps growth estimates are intellectually bankrupt. The CBO and Federal Reserve project annual economic growth to hover around 1.9 and 1.8 percent, respectively, for most of the coming decade. Trump is assuming that figure will be between 3 and 3.5 percent. Heres how the president arrived at those numbers, per The Wall Street Journal: Typically, Republicans at least allow their (carefully selected, supply-side-crank) economists to derive a sunny growth projection for them. This White House has, apparently, just picked the number it wanted. The second half of Trumps emerging deficit plan is no less dubious. The initial White House budget will call for the elimination of several small, discretionary programs including the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the Legal Services Corporation, AmeriCorps, and the National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities, according to the New York Times. As already mentioned, these cuts would trim a mere $2.5 billion from our $4 trillion annual budget. Which is to say, cutting these programs would have no significant impact on the deficit  but would have a significant impact on the forgotten man and woman whom the president has vowed to help. Trump enjoyed overwhelming support in Appalachia and in rural counties besieged by the opioid epidemic. His initial budget (reportedly) eliminates the Appalachian Regional Commission, which promotes economic development in the poorest parts of America, along with the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which dispenses grants to rehabilitation and drug-abuse-prevention programs. Many of these programs have been perennial targets for Republican budget drafters. Ronald Reagan and Newt Gingrich both called for eliminating the NEA. Historically, the popularity  and minuscule cost  of such discretionary outlays has prevented their repeal. But by picking a fight over these small potatoes  even a losing one  Trump can project an image of fiscal probity. In most of the coming policy debates, the Democrats will be on the side of the deficit scolds. In the fight over Big Bird, Trump will get to play that role (Sesame Street is now funded by HBO, however, reruns still air on PBS). Its far from clear, however, that the symbolism of such a fight would flatter the White House. In addition to his publicly touted fiscal plans, Trump seems intent on increasing government spending on the First Familys security and travel by hundreds of millions over the next four years. The president has already spent over $10 million on his weekend trips to Mar-a-Lago. The monthly cost of funding the NEA is just under $15 million.If the president wants to pretend that multi-million-dollar discretionary outlays are busting the federal budget, Democrats will be happy to pretend the same."}, {"date": "2017/02/21", "title": "Donald Trump, Pseudoauthoritarian", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/donald-trump-pseudoauthoritarian.html", "text": " Donald Trump is an authoritarian by instinct. He displays the classic traits of an authoritarian personality  a man obsessed with domination and humiliation, and unable to tolerate cognitive dissonance. (Guidance for Trumps presidential daily brief directs that his memos not only be short but, Ashley Dejean reports, should only include facts that support their analyses.) For years he has lavished praise upon authoritarian regimes in China, Russia, North Korea, and Iraq for having the strength to crush their opponents. And the first month of his presidency has seen Trump metamorphose from a reality-television-populist-outsider candidate into an actual president who sounds  but, so far, at least, only sounds  like the strongman leaders he has always admired. The prospect that President Trump will degrade or destroy American democracy is the most important question of the new political era. It has received important scholarly attention from two basic sources, which have approached it in importantly different fashions. Scholars of authoritarian regimes (principally Russia) have used their knowledge of authoritarian history to paint a road map by which Trump could Putinize this country. Timothy Snyder, Masha Gessen, and other students of Putins methods have essentially treated Putinization as the likely future, and worked backward to the present. A second category of knowledge has come from scholars of democracy and authoritarianism, who have compared the strengths and weaknesses of the American system of government both to countries elsewhere that have succumbed to authoritarianism and those that have not. Their approach has, more appropriately, treated Trumps authoritarian designs as an open question. Trump might launch an assault on the foundations of the republic. On the other hand, he might not. What are the signs of impending authoritarianism? Trump has rhetorically hyped violence, real or imaginary, committed by enemy groups, while downplaying or ignoring violence or threats from friendlier sources. He said nothing about a white-supremacist terror attack in Canada that killed six people before denouncing a knife attack a few days later by an Islamist radical in France that killed nobody. He quickly directed a government program on countering violent extremism to focus exclusively on Muslim radicalism and stop work halting white-supremacist terrorism. Just as he urged his campaign crowds to rough up protesters, he treated news that pro-Trump bikers would patrol his inauguration not as a threat to create chaos but as a welcome paramilitary force. Thats like additional security with those guys, and theyre rough, he gleefully told reporters. Trumps rhetoric follows a pattern of politicizing violence, simultaneously justifying stringent government action against enemies he has designated while tacitly justifying vigilantism by extremists sympathetic to his cause. Since his election, Trump has obsessively fabricated a narrative in which he is the incarnate of the will of the people. According to his own concocted history, he won a historically large Electoral College victory, and would have also won the popular vote if not for millions of illegal votes. He has dismissed protesters against him as paid agents, denied the legitimacy of courts to overrule his actions, and, most recently, called mainstream media enemies of the people. This is an especially chilling phrase to hear from an American president. Totalitarian dictators like Stalin and Mao used designation of a political figure or a social class as an enemy of the people as a prelude to mass murder. At this point, just a month into Trumps presidency, this pattern of authoritarian discourse is only that  discourse. A threat as dire as the potential disintegration of American democracy hardly requires certainty before justifying a response. The question is, what response is necessary? It is worth noting that, so far, normal political countermobilization seems to be working quite well. The Resistance, as anti-Trump activists have come to be known, has already rattled the once-complacent Republican majorities in Congress, which Trump needs to quash investigations of his corruption and opaque ties to Russia. Whatever pressure Trump has tried to apply to the news media has backfired spectacularly. His sneering contempt has inspired a wave of subscriptions that have driven new revenue to national media, which have blanketed the administration with independent coverage. Popular culture outlets, rather than responding to Trumps election by tempering their mockery, have instead stepped it up, enraging the president. The most plausible (to me) mechanism by which Trump might ensconce himself in power was laid out by Matthew Yglesias three months ago. The scenario Yglesias described would be one in which Trump used the authority of the federal government to compel large firms to give him political support. Companies that opposed him, or who even refused to offer support, might be punished with selectively punitive regulation, while those that played ball might be rewarded with lax enforcement of labor, antitrust, or other regulation. So far there is no evidence such a scenario is playing out. To be sure, Trump is attempting, sporadically, to bully the private sector. But the effort has backfired. Firms whose leaders make favorable statements about the president have seen their stock get hammered. A long list of prominent CEOs has openly criticized Trump. The reason for this is obvious. Trumps supporters may have disproportionate power in the Electoral College, but his opponents have disproportionate power in the marketplace. Firms cater in their advertising to the young, who overwhelming oppose Trump, rather than to the old, who strongly support him. If Trump has a plan to crush his adversaries, he has not yet revealed it. His authoritarian rage thus far is mostly impotent, the president as angry Fox-News-watching grandfather screaming threats at his television that he never carries out. The danger to the republic may come later, or never. In the first month of Trumps presidency, the resistance has the upper hand."}, {"date": "2017/02/21", "title": "Trump Manages to Denounce Rise of Anti-Semitic Incidents Without Taking Offense", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-manages-to-denounce-rise-of-anti-semitic-incidents.html", "text": " It took a long time, but after a specific request from the Anti-Defamation League that the president acknowledge and denounce the recent rise in anti-Semitic incidents, President Trump did so in response to a press question today: The 45th president has often denied any sympathy for anti-Semitism.

Trump often couches comments on anti-Semitism in angry and defensive assaults on questioners, as he did when asked about the rise in disturbing incidents during last weeks marathon press conference: This time the president did not argue with the questioner or deny the premise. Maybe he was just busy, or maybe hes actually learning that not all questions are strictly about Donald J. Trump.

Dr. Natural is a holistic-health advocate in Brooklyn who has long dreadlocks and maintains a raw, vegan, alkaline diet. Diab was hoping Dr. Natural would speak at an event she was putting on with her boyfriend, a professional football player. I said, Cup-ernick? Dr. Natural said recently. Whos Cup-ernick? Diab clarified that her boyfriend was the San Francisco 49er who had knelt during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality in America, causing dozens of other athletes to join him in solidarity and then-candidate Trump to suggest he find another country. I didnt know his name, Dr. Natural said. I just knew him as the guy who took a knee. Early on the Saturday of Martin Luther King Jr. weekend, Colin Kaepernick, the guy who took a knee, walked onto a stage at the Audubon Ballroom, on West 165th Street, flanked by a floor-to-ceiling mural depicting Malcolm X. Kaepernick was hosting his second Know Your Rights Camp, and explained the venues significance to the 240 young people in attendance: In 1965, Malcolm X was assassinated here while delivering a speech of his own. Theres a lot of people out there that dont want to see you succeed, Kaepernick told the crowd. But the people in this room do. Kaepernick was joined by three of his 49ers teammates at the all-day event, which covered the intersectional bases of modern activism. In addition to Dr. Naturals presentation on the environmental importance of filtering your water and using a squatty potty, there were sessions on the history of policing, financial literacy, and college admissions. Carmen Perez, the executive director of Gathering for Justice, to which Kaepernick had recently given $25,000 as part of his pledge to donate a million dollars to social-justice organizations across the country, led a role-playing exercise for engaging with police. Dr. Natural didnt believe Diab when she said they could get more than 200 kids to show up on a Saturday morning, so he hadnt brought enough pamphlets on maintaining a positive mental attitude. Im sure some of the motivation was to meet Kaepernick himself, Dr. Natural said. But, hey, whatever works. Throughout the sessions, Kaepernick sat to the side, listening and taking notes, before returning to the stage to present the campers with several items to take home: swag from his endorsers (Nike backpack, Beats headphones), paperback copies of The Autobiography of Malcolm X, guides to eating vegan in New York  Kaepernick gave up meat and dairy a year ago  ancestry.com subscriptions to trace their roots, and T-shirts matching his own, which read IKNOW MY RIGHTS on the front and listed ten of them on the back, including YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE BRILLIANT. It had been five months since Kaepernick first sat during The Star Spangled Banner, and the Audubon was many literal and figurative miles from the 70,000-seat NFL stadium where he launched his protest and from the cover of Time magazine, where he ended up. But the aftershocks were everywhere. The NFL playoffs were then careering toward a Super Bowl in which the two teams came to personify Americas sociopolitical fissures  the winning Patriots, led by friends of Donald Trump, and the Falcons, from Atlanta, where more than half the citys population is black  and many of the commercials seemed to have been cooked up in a social-justice seminar rather than an ad agency. None of the players protested the anthem, but half a dozen Patriots, so far, have broken with the story line that their team equals Trump, and have said they wont attend the White House celebration of their victory because, as one of them put it, I dont feel welcome in that house. After decades of professional athletes largely choosing, as LeBron James put it, in 2008, to keep athletics and politics separate, Kaepernicks protest was a culmination of several years in which they had begun to do just the opposite. In some ways, the superstars were just waking up alongside their generation, particularly as Black Lives Matter ushered in what now looks like the countrys most significant protest era in decades. But athletes also have enormous cultural and economic influence, and have started to understand how to leverage that for something more than selling sneakers. Leagues, teams, and brands are trying desperately to keep up. Earlier this month, when Under Armours CEO called Donald Trump a real asset to the country, Stephen Curry, the Golden State Warriors star, whom Morgan Stanley has estimated to be worth as much as $14 billion to Under Armour, told the press he agreed with the assessment, if you remove the -et. After Curry spoke to Under Armours CEO, the company released a statement walking back its support. If I can say the leadership is not in line with my core values, Curry explained, then there is no amount of money, there is no platform I wouldnt jump off. A few days later, Nike released a 90-second ad called Equality, in which Serena Williams, Kevin Durant, and LeBron James appear in black and white as Michael B. Jordan asks, Is this the land history promised? Nine years after James spoke of a separation between sport and politics, he stood on a basketball court in Nike gear and made clear that times had changed. If we can be equals here, James said, at center court, we can be equals everywhere. When Kaepernicks protest first landed on the front page, in late August, and he suddenly became Americas most famous  and controversial  activist, he went looking for help. His path to activism had been a lengthy one, urged along by Harry Edwards, a UC Berkeley sociologist who consults with the 49ers on diversity issues and had been encouraging him to read James Baldwin and others as a way of educating himself. No one had noticed when Kaepernick spent much of the previous year posting Malcolm X quotes and social-justice memes on Instagram, or when he sat for the anthem during the 49ers first two preseason games. But after a reporter got a tip from a team official and asked Kaepernick about it  I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color  the quarterback found himself at the center of a firestorm. Kaepernick talked to Edwards, and Diab, who had long been outspoken on policing and other issues, put Kaepernick in touch with, DeRay Mckesson, of Black Lives Matter. Michael Skolnik, an activist in Brooklyn who often helps celebrities figure out how to become effective activists, talked to Kaepernick two days after his protest. The first thing I saw was that he knew his shit, Skolnik said. What he didnt know was that the movement has multiple layers of work, so the question is, where do you want to be involved? Kaepernick told Skolnik that, for starters, he wanted to donate a million dollars. I said, Okay, thats nice, Skolnik said. But dont think your million dollars is gonna stop cops from killing black people. Kaepernick also talked to the Knicks Carmelo Anthony, who has quietly become one of the sports worlds most socially conscious stars. After the 2015 death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore, where Anthony grew up, he went to Maryland and joined a protest in the streets. Well, youre courageous, Anthony says he told Kaepernick. But now is the hard part, because you have to keep it going. So, if that was just a onetime thing, then youre fucked. There is a rich and varied history of athlete activism, from Jackie Robinson, whom Martin Luther King Jr. credited with helping to launch the civil-rights movement by integrating baseball in 1947, to Tommie Smith and John Carlos, whose radical Black Power salutes at the 1968 Olympics became the most iconic sports-meets-politics moment of the 20th century  in part because activism soon faded in sports, as it did nationwide. After the 60s, athletes waged battles for higher pay and better treatment, but campaigns for off-the-field issues were rare. Athletes became brands, and brands didnt do politics. If I stand on a platform, Im gonna be speaking for O.J., said O.J. Simpson, the most famous black athlete of the 1970s, referencing Smith and Carloss Olympic protest. In 1990, Michael Jordan declined pleas from Arthur Ashe and others to endorse Harvey Gantt, a black candidate for Senate in Jordans home state of North Carolina, despite the fact that he was running against Jesse Helms, a notorious racist. Republicans buy sneakers, too, Jordan reportedly said. The superstar athlete as a neutral avatar of corporate America persisted well into the new century. In 2007, Ira Newble, a no-name reserve for the Cleveland Cavaliers, asked his teammates to sign a letter condemning Chinas involvement in the genocide in Darfur. All but three casually signed on to oppose the slaughter, but one of the abstainers was a 22-year-old LeBron James, already well on his way to becoming Americas most famous athlete. Its basically not having enough information, James explained, though Newble and others speculated it may have had something to do with Jamess Nike relationship and the companys ties to China. Which makes it all the more surprising that, five years later, James helped launch the modern athlete-as-activist movement. On February 26, 2012, Trayvon Martin was getting ready to watch James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh, the three best players from his favorite team, the Miami Heat, play in the NBA All-Star Game, when he put on a hoodie to go buy some Skittles. Martins killing took place just 20 miles from the game, but even as the story grew, reporters covering the team didnt consider bringing it up with James. We didnt ask him about the issues of the day, said Brian Windhorst, an ESPN reporter who has covered James throughout his career. A few weeks later, Gabrielle Union, the actress who is now married to Wade, made a call to Michael Skolnik, who was working with Martins family. Union was seeking advice on how to draw attention to the issue, and they began talking about getting James and Wade involved. (Many male athletes seem to have been coaxed down the road to wokeness by the women in their lives.) I was like, Whatever you can get them to do: Write his name on their shoes, take a selfie  although I dont think selfie was a term at the time  that would mean the world, Skolnik said. Union took the ideas to Wade, who talked with James about what to do. On a road trip in Detroit, James and Wade gathered their teammates and persuaded them to pose for a photo with their official Miami Heat hoodies up, as Martins had been. James posted the picture to Twitter, and suddenly Trayvon Martin wasnt just the top story on MSNBC but on ESPN, too: Windhorst, who was living in Florida, said he had never even heard Martins name before James posted the photo. That picture was John Carlos and Tommie Smith for our generation, Skolnik told me recently from his office in Brooklyn. (He now runs a branding agency that puts on social-impact campaigns, but his bona fides were burnished by seven years as political director for Russell Simmons.) In 2012, the Black Lives Matter movement had not yet formed, there was little recent precedent for athletes speaking out, and players had no idea how their teams, or the league, might respond. Smith and Carlos, for instance, had become pariahs after the Olympics. At the time, the only other controversial social issue with even limited traction in the sports world was marriage equality. Hudson Taylor, who runs Athlete Ally, which advocates for LGBTQ rights in sports, told me that just two years ago he was talking to a prominent NBA player who said he was in favor of marriage equality, but that he was Christian and worried about losing fans. Brendon Ayanbadejo, a Baltimore Raven, was one of three NFL players who spoke out in support of gay marriage, but his campaign received limited attention, positive or negative, until 2012, when a Maryland state senator wrote to the Ravens requesting that the team inhibit such expressions from your employee. The story caused an uproar, stoked by an article Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe wrote, for Deadspin, in which he memorably assured the senator that married gay couples wont magically turn you into a lustful cockmonster. Less than a year later, Jason Collins became the first openly gay player in any major American professional sport. But Trayvon Martins death was a particularly galvanizing moment for black athletes, and other NBA players followed the Miami Heats lead, posting similar photos or arriving at games wearing hoodies. Skolnik recalled bringing Sybrina Fulton, Martins mother, to the Knicks locker room at Carmelo Anthonys request. Anthony was initially speechless in front of Fulton and gave her a jersey that he had signed I AM TRAYVON. Fulton burst into tears. She said, Why do they care about me? Skolnik said. She just couldnt grasp the idea that these famous athletes were so touched by her. The years after Martins death found athletes speaking out with increasing regularity. In 2014, after TMZ posted audio of Donald Sterling, the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, making wildly racist remarks, James quickly declared, Theres no room for Donald Sterling in the NBA, and Clippers players wore their warm-up shirts inside out, hiding the team logo, before their next game. Two days later, the league banned Sterling for life. That November, five St. Louis Rams walked onto the field holding their hands in the air, to honor Michael Brown, who had been killed in Ferguson, and after Eric Garners death in Staten Island, a number of NBA players wore shirts that read I CANT BREATHE onto the court, including James and members of the Brooklyn Nets. The shirts should have drawn a fine for violating the leagues dress code, but NBA commissioner Adam Silver decided against levying penalties. Social media allowed players to share their concerns with the public instantly and easily. It also meant they were sitting in locker rooms together watching videos of young black men being killed, leading many to wonder, despite their personal success, how much better things had gotten for black people in America. The only reason Mike Brown, who was seen as a big hulking black man, was dead in the street, as opposed to LeBron James, who is a big hulking black man, was that LeBron James was not there, Edwards said. It also helped that a (relatively) young black sports obsessive was in the White House. President Obama saw athletes not only as friends but as potential allies, and when he took office, he revamped the Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs with liaisons to dozens of different constituencies, including the obvious ones  the LGBTQ community, Christians, Native Americans  but also to the sports world. The White House maintained a roster of players, like NBA stars Chris Paul and Grant Hill, who could be counted on to join various campaigns. (It closely correlated to who golfed with the president, one former staff member said.) NBA teams in town to play the Washington Wizards asked for White House tours, which the administration tried to turn into recruiting events: When the Detroit Pistons visited last year, for instance, the president met with them in the Roosevelt Room to solicit their support for his My Brothers Keeper mentoring initiative. Other athletes used their face time with the president to push their own causes, and when James and the Cavaliers celebrated their 2016 championship at the White House in November, they talked about police brutality with Obama behind closed doors. Some players even reached out on their own: Kobe Bryant regularly texted ideas for various campaigns to White House staff members. At first, the White House mobilized athletes primarily for uncontroversial causes, like the First Ladys Lets Move fitness campaign, but as players began to demonstrate an increasing outspokenness during Obamas second term, the administration started asking for support on more controversial topics. Health care was the first one where athletes actually said no, Kyle Lierman, who led outreach to the sports world for the White House from 2010 to 2014, said. It was initially like pulling teeth. As the White House desperately tried to hit its health-care enrollment goals, President Obama made a rare personal call to James, asking him to lend his voice to the campaign; a member of Jamess management team said that while James supported the ACA, Obamas personal request was the reason he agreed to help. Once LeBron came out for us, it created the space for other athletes to jump in, Lierman said. The following week, he sent an email to a number of prominent athletes, highlighting Jamess PSA, and dozens wrote back offering to help. Eventually, the administration began using sports stars as advocates who, unlike Hollywood celebrities, were mostly able to sidestep charges of elitism and more directly communicate with specific regions. In 2015, Milwaukee boosted its ACA enrollment more than any of the 19 other cities targeted by the White House, which the administration credited in large part to the fact that a number of players from the Bucks, the local NBA team, had been persuaded to support the initiative. Speaking out had now become almost an obligation. In 2015, after a grand jury declined to indict two Cleveland police officers involved in the death of Tamir Rice, activists launched a No Justice, No LeBron campaign, urging James to protest by refusing to play. But when James was asked about the campaign, he replied, To be honest, I havent really been on top of this issue, so its hard for me to comment. It was meant as a responsible reply to a complex situation, but some fans were disappointed, and the same reporters who hadnt thought to ask James about Trayvon Martins death were now surprised that he would be unaware of a political issue roiling his city. One of Jamess confidants says that, today, whenever James sees a piece of news that interests him, he notifies an assistant, who will respond with four or five articles for him to read on the topic. Other athletes who wanted to speak out, but were wary because they found themselves unprepared to do so, went looking for ways to become better informed. Last July, Wade Davis, a former NFL cornerback who has become a full-time activist  Im an intersectional feminist, he told me, citing bell hooks as an inspiration  was able to recruit 35 NFL, NBA, WNBA, and professional soccer players to attend a seminar in a Los Angeles apartment (several called in by Skype) led by two leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement, who explained how a variety of forces, from housing policies to gender to a lack of economic opportunity, were just as important to understand as police brutality. Every politically active athlete I spoke with told me the last thing they wanted was their lesser-informed teammates speaking up just because they thought they had something to say. To be quite honest with you, I know a lot of athletes who, Im glad theyre quiet, because they havent done their homework, Harry Edwards said. Aside from the Sterling incident, it had been hard to get athletes to act collectively. But last summer, after the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile within a day of each other, Carmelo Anthony decided it was time. Im calling for all my fellow ATHLETES to step up and take charge, Anthony said on Instagram, posting a photo of a press conference from 1967 at which Bill Russell, Jim Brown, and Lew Alcindor, who later changed his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, joined Muhammad Ali to express their support for Alis objection to being drafted during the Vietnam War. In 2014, William Rhoden, then a New York Times sportswriter, called that press conference the first  and last  time that so many African-American athletes at that level came together to support a controversial cause. Anthony has a regular group text with James, Wade, and Paul, and the quartet spent the following weekend coming up with a plan. They were scheduled to attend the Espys, ESPNs annual awards show, the following week, and a member of Jamess team told ESPN the players wanted to make a joint statement at the top of the broadcast. The four players spoke to an Espys writer who helped distill their group text into a forceful call to action, which they read together onstage. As athletes, its on us to challenge each other, Wade said. The conversation cannot stop as our schedules get busy again  It wont always be comfortable. But it is necessary. The impact was swift. Two days after the speech, Nikes CEO put out a statement explicitly supporting Black Lives Matter and citing the appearance by James, Anthony, and Paul as an instigating factor. (He left out Wade, who isnt a Nike athlete.) A week later, Michael Jordan announced that he would be donating $1 million to both the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the Institute for Community-Police Relations, a law-enforcement advocacy organization whose head was so surprised by the donation that he called to make sure it had come from that Michael Jordan. I know this country is better than that, Jordan said of the recent killings. I can no longer stay silent. But Kaepernicks statement, six weeks later, rang out louder than anything from the NBA, despite the fact that he was far from the first athlete to protest the national anthem. I cannot stand and sing the anthem, Jackie Robinson wrote, in 1972. I know that I am a black man in a white world. Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, a guard for the Denver Nuggets, was suspended by the NBA in 1996 for refusing to stand during the song, and David West, a forward for the Golden State Warriors, recently told the Undefeated, ESPNs new website covering the intersection of race and sports, that he has stood two feet behind his teammates during The Star Spangled Banner for so long that he has forgotten when he first started doing it. Kaepernick, however, was the first player to bring such a protest to the National Football League, Americas modern pastime. The NFL has long been conservative, with a fan base that is overwhelmingly white  African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asian-Americans all watch the NBA in higher percentages than whites  and has been far less receptive to its players involvement in activism. The NFL doesnt want you to talk about anything other than football, says Chris Kluwe, who has claimed that he lost his job in part for being outspoken about marriage equality. Where NBA teams have a dozen players, all of whom more or less know one anothers (often similar) political beliefs, an NFL locker room has more than 50 players from a variety of backgrounds. While some NFL owners were supportive, the majority are conservative  even Shahid Khan, the Muslim-immigrant owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars, voted for Trump  and at least one reportedly insisted that his players stand for the anthem. One anonymous front-office executive called Kaepernick a traitor. The NBA, meanwhile, has largely supported players protests, even on the court, and many coaches, most of whom are white, have recently been turning their press conferences into political lectures. A few days after the presidential election, Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs spoke for five minutes about his disappointment with the state of American politics, stopping a reporter who interrupted him to ask another question. Im not done, Popovich said. Im sick to my stomach thinking about it. Compare that to a press conference at which Bill Belichick, whose New England Patriots were preparing to play the Seattle Seahawks, briefly addressed the fact that Trump had recently read a laudatory letter from him at a rally, then deflected follow-ups: Reporter: Your teams always been good at keeping outside distractions on the outside, given the nature of this presidential race  Belichick: Seattle. Did you find it   Seattle. Kaepernicks disruption of Americas song, during Americas game, had opened him up to attacks. A Houston-area cigar lounge called the Man Cave started using his jersey as a doormat, and even Ruth Bader Ginsburg called Kaepernicks protest dumb and disrespectful, before later apologizing. Kaepernick found plenty of outside support, as his jersey became the NFLs top seller  he was fortunate to be in San Francisco rather than a more conservative NFL city  and several teammates joined his protest. (Kaepernick began taking a knee rather than sitting, as he had initially, on the advice of a retired football player and military veteran, who felt it seemed more respectful.) But only 50 or so of the leagues 1,700 players took knees or raised fists alongside him. Several teams made unified statements of solidarity, but no white NFL player joined Kaepernick, and Megan Rapinoe, of the U.S. womens soccer team, was the only white athlete from any major professional sport to take a knee. The rest of the NFL either disagreed with Kaepernicks message or with his methods, or feared the consequences. Brandon Marshall, of the Denver Broncos, lost several endorsements for kneeling, and other players admitted the stress was difficult to bear. I had a conversation with a player who knelt with Colin during week one, and he calls me and says, How many weeks do I have to kneel? Skolnik said. I was like, You gotta go the distance, buddy. Youre not gonna get up soon. But even with limited participation, Kaepernicks protest had opened the debate over policing and race relations to a wider audience. I was kind of dumbfounded, to be honest with you, Anquan Boldin, a veteran wide receiver for the Detroit Lions, told me about the outcry over Kaepernicks protest. Boldin had been speaking out on policing for nearly a year, ever since his cousin was shot and killed by a plainclothes officer, but he had struggled to find an audience. I cant believe it takes somebody like Kaepernick to kneel during the national anthem for people to talk about a problem that has been going on for years, Boldin said. Boldin didnt take a knee, but the example of Kaepernicks protest made room for athletes to get involved in a variety of ways. During the season, Boldin started a group text that grew to include more than 80 players, all of whom wanted to do something but had no idea what or how. I dont think guys know where to start, Boldin said. Its one thing to do work in your community, but its another thing to set up meetings with Capitol Hill. In 2013, Boldin went to Senegal with Oxfam, which had spent years lobbying Congress to hold a hearing on mining issues in West Africa with no success. He offered to visit D.C. to drum up support for a hearing, and within two weeks, it was on the schedule. It was a wake-up moment for me in terms of understanding the power we have, Boldin said. Boldin wanted to go back to Capitol Hill to talk about policing, so he turned to Andrew Blejwas, a political-communications specialist who had organized the Oxfam trip. Boldin recruited four other players, including Josh McCown, a white quarterback, and Malcolm Jenkins, of the Philadelphia Eagles, who had raised a fist with Kaepernick. Blejwas set up meetings in November with four different congressional offices, the Congressional Black Caucus, and, with the help of the NFL Players Association, the White House. The players were quick political studies. First off, these guys are brilliant  learning plays is not easy, Blejwas said. They synthesized the ideas that we were talking about much better than we did. Boldin and the others also knew why they had been granted an audience, and how to play the game, with long-term gains in mind. After one congressman spent most of their visit talking about a bipartisan softball game he coached, the players signed a softball and mailed it to him; when progressives criticized them online after they posed for a picture with Paul Ryan, who emerged for the photo op after leaving the actual meeting to his staff, the players brushed it off. Dont think these guys dont know whats going on, Blejwas said. They know they have to get that next meeting. Boldins group is currently planning a return trip to D.C. in March, with more players, in the hope of presenting testimony to the House Judiciary Committee on criminal-justice reform. (Lierman, the former White House liaison, as well as two former State Department officials, is launching a separate consultancy to accommodate the growing number of athletes who want to get more involved in the political process.) The most difficult thing, Blejwas had found, was getting people in D.C. to realize that Boldin and the others were capable of doing serious work. Before Boldins first appearance to give testimony in D.C., one person involved in setting up the hearing asked Blejwas, Do you know if Anquan  can he read? An NFL player can help achieve all these important objectives, and people will still be like, Why dont you just do a PSA? Blejwas told me. Its like, No, were trying to do work. Were not trying to get on TV. You can really move the needle if you just trust that this 32-year-old black man can read. Of course, professional athletes have only so much direct electoral power. An ESPN survey found they favored Hillary Clinton by nearly two to one. (Kaepernick didnt vote.) Persuading athletes to publicly get behind a candidate can sometimes be more difficult than getting them to back a cause: Michelle Kwan, the former figure skater, who did surrogate outreach for Clintons campaign, said a number of Olympians told her that they supported Clinton but that their endorsement deals, which they rely on more than basketball or football players, prevented them from saying so. She helped persuade Chris Paul to tweet that he was With Her, and LeBron James wrote an endorsement in an Ohio newspaper two days after his boss, the Cavs owner Dan Gilbert, hosted a Trump fund-raiser. James also stood next to Clinton at a rally in Cleveland during the campaigns final week. I was one of those kids and was around a community that was like, Our vote doesnt matter, James said, explaining his own political transformation. But it really does.  But even the most popular man in Ohio couldnt deliver his home state, and the sports world is unlikely to embrace the Trump White House as it did Obamas. If you think any NBA team will show up at the White House for a photo op with Trump, youre crazy, Edwards said. Trump has shown little interest in sports beyond his own golf courses and inviting the Patriots owner to dine with the Japanese prime minister at Mar-a-Lago. (As one indicator of how White House outreach might look different, a person briefed on the hiring process said the administration was considering Andrew Giuliani, Rudys son and a former minor-league professional golfer, as its sports liaison.) Shortly after Trumps victory, LeBron told his wife, I think were going to have to do more, according to Sports Illustrated. A number of people suggested to me that Trumps policies might, in fact, awaken even the sleepier parts of the sports world, like Major League Baseball, none of whose players joined Kaepernicks protest but nearly a third of whom are Hispanic and might be inspired to speak up if Trump continues to pursue a border wall or other aggressive immigration restrictions. (Adrian Gonzalez, a Mexican-American player for the Los Angeles Dodgers, refused to stay at a Trump-branded hotel last season.) The newly established sense that athletes can, and should, use their cultural cachet to promote political change seems to have emboldened others to speak out on subjects that hew less closely to their own identity politics. Days after Trumps inauguration, Kaepernick tweeted his support for protesters at Standing Rock and his opposition to abortion restrictions, and earlier this month, several NFL players backed out of a government-sponsored trip to Israel after pressure from activists who argued it was likely to present a skewed view of the Palestinian situation. Two members of the Detroit Lions showed up at the Womens March on Washington in January (while James gave the protest a shout-out on Twitter), and this past weekends NBA All-Star Game was moved from Charlotte to New Orleans in protest over the states discriminatory bathroom law, a switch supported by Stephen Curry and Chris Paul, both North Carolina natives. Some things are bigger than the game, Paul said. What has emerged is a generation not only willing to shine a light on injustice but prepared to make concrete demands. Carmelo and Steph are fantastic examples of guys who can really be a huge loss to a brand by walking away, said Sherrie Deans, an executive with the National Basketball Players Association. But even guys who cant do that are saying, If youre gonna be a brand partner of mine, I need you to acknowledge the totality of who I am. Brands seem to want to be on the right side of history, too, and social responsibility has become a central part of many athletes self-presentation: When James posed for a Sports Illustrated cover naming him the magazines 2016 Sportsman of the Year, he wore a safety pin as a signal of his allyship. But as athletes begin to recognize their control over the means of production, and to demonstrate a willingness to act collectively, the next phase of their activism may most closely resemble what happened in 2015 at the University of Missouri. After a series of racist events on campus, to which administrators had responded slowly, the football team declared it wouldnt play an upcoming game unless the university president resigned. I had been taking a sports-management class that semester, and I learned how much money we make the university, Ian Simon, one of the protests leaders, told me recently. Regular students had been protesting for weeks to no avail, but after the football team got involved, the president was gone within 48 hours. Kaepernick, for his part, was spending February announcing more donations, including one to a group in Brooklyn that helps homeless veterans, and tweeting out daily Black History Month lessons. The quarterback may become a free agent next month, and it remains to be seen which teams might be interested in signing him. He spent one of his rare off days last season taking the GRE. Even if Kaepernick never plays again, hes already done enough for the Smithsonians National Museum of African-American History and Culture to acquire his jersey and cleats. Kaepernick took the bullets, Wade Davis, the cornerback turned activist, told me. He is the Muhammad Ali of this era. He took some hits from a shotgun, so the next guy will take bullets from a .22, and the next guy gets hit with a sling. But even if he devotes himself to full-time activism, Kaepernicks reach will never be as great as it has been as an NFL quarterback. Simon, from the University of Missouri, went to last years Espys, where James, Wade, Anthony, and Paul spoke, but he was passed over in the NFL draft. He isnt sure how the protest affected his status, but he said that every team asked him about it, and when I talked to him earlier this month, he was settling into a new job at the front desk of a family medical practice in Texas. There were many issues Simon wanted to speak on, but it was harder to get an audience. I think about that a lot, Simon said. You can stand on the corner and preach all day. But if your message cant reach the right people, its just words in the wind. *This article appears in the February 20, 2017, issue of New York Magazine.

On Monday, bomb threats were called in to Jewish centers in 11 cities  Albuquerque; Birmingham, Alabama; Buffalo; Chicago; Cleveland; Houston; Milwaukee; Nashville; St. Paul; Tampa, Florida; and Tulsa, Oklahoma. It appears that all of the threats were hoaxes, but several centers were evacuated as a precaution. The FBI and the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division are investigating, according to NBC News. Similar threats were made on January 9, January 18, and January 31. Including Mondays threats, there have been 69 incidents at 54 JCCs in 27 states and one Canadian province in 2017, according to the JCC Association of North America. Last year, only one JCC reported a similar threat. Over the weekend, dozens of headstones were also knocked over at a Jewish cemetery in University City, Missouri. Police are investigating whether the vandalism was motivated by anti-Semitism. The ADL said in a statement that while no bombs have been found at any of the centers, Threats themselves are alarming, disruptive, and must always been taken seriously. ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt added, We look to our political leaders at all levels to speak out against such threats directed against Jewish institutions, to make it clear that such actions are unacceptable, and to pledge that they will work with law enforcement officials to ensure that those responsible will be apprehended and punished to the full extent of the law. On Twitter the ADL called out the Trump administration more directly: The White House did release a brief statement about the incidents on Monday. Hatred and hate-motivated violence of any kind have no place in a country founded on the promise of individual freedom, said Lindsay Walters, the White House deputy press secretary. The president has made it abundantly clear that these actions are unacceptable. But President Trump has not condemned the threats specifically. During his press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, Trump was asked about the sharp rise in anti-Semitic incidents across the United States since the campaign. Trump said, We are going to do everything within our power to stop long-simmering racism and every other thing thats going on, but his answer mainly focused on the size of his election win. He also noted that in addition to so many friends, his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, are Jewish. The next day, Trump lashed out at Jake Turx of the Jewish publication Ami Magazine for asking about the bomb threats, accusing him of posing a very insulting question. Though Turx noted that he wasnt suggesting the president or anyone on his staff is anti-Semitic, Trump declared that hes the least anti-Semitic person that youve ever seen in your entire life, and said nothing about the bomb threats. While Ivanka Trump has tried to steer clear of political controversy since her father took office, she tweeted out a call for religious tolerance on Monday with the hashtag #JCC. The New York Times reported that the comment was made over an issue her allies say she feels personally. The ACLs Jonathan Greenblatt said the First Daughters tweet was encouraging and reiterated the groups call for her father to do more about the threats."}, {"date": "2017/02/21", "title": "Eric Holder, Uber Employees to Conduct Independent Review of Sexism Claims", "url": "http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/02/eric-holder-uber-sexism-investigation.html", "text": " After bungling its response to last months #DeleteUber campaign, the ride-hailing company is moving swiftly in response to allegations of rampant sexual harassment at the company from a former employee.

In an email to company employees on Monday, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick announced that former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has been hired to oversee an independent review  with help from an Uber board member, the head of human resources, and an attorney who works for the company. It is my number one priority that we come through this a better organization, where we live our values and fight for and support those who experience injustice, said Kalanick. On Sunday, Kalanick said hed instructed Liane Hornsey, Ubers new chief of human resources, to probe the allegations. Arianna Huffington, who sits on Ubers board, announced she would work with Hornsey to conduct a full independent investigation. Now theyre joining the review conducted by Holders team, according to Kalanicks memo, along with Uber in-house attorney Angela Padilla. Several Uber critics questioned how a review involving several company employees could be considered independent. The Verge noted that Holder has also done business with Uber: Allegations of sexism are not new for Uber (or Silicon Valley). Several years ago, a top Uber executive suggested a smear campaign against a female journalist, and the company has been accused of not doing enough to ensure the safety of female passengers. Last spring, Uber rebuffed demands to release statistics on the gender and racial makeup of its workforce, but on Monday, Kalanick said the company would begin releasing diversity reports. He said 15.1 percent of the companys technical staff are women, compared to 17 percent at Facebook and 18 percent at Google.

Very serious preparatory work is going on in the Kremlin, including a paper  seven pages  describing a psychological portrait of Trump, especially based on this last two to three months, and the last weeks, Fedorov told NBC News. This type of profile on another foreign leader is uncommon, NBC News says, but Moscow knows whats at stake when Putin and Trump finally meet.

The secretary said his visit to Baghdad was to get current on the situation there, the political situation, the enemy situation and the friendly situation. But as with several of his recent stops in Europe, Mattis had to spend some of his time in the country smoothing over some of Trumps more controversial remarks. In addition to the denial of oil snatching, Mattis said Trumps revised executive order on immigration, expected to be issued this week, will no longer exclude Iraqis who partnered with U.S. troops from entering the U.S. I have not seen the new executive order, he said. But right now, Im assured that we will take steps to allow those who have fought alongside us to be allowed into the United States. The revised travel ban is still expected to place travel restrictions on other Iraqi citizens, though. Before trying to persuade Iraqis that Trumps statements should not always be taken seriously, Mattis did the same at a NATO meeting in Brussels, where he criticized Russia more than Trump ever has. The point about Russia is they have to live by international law just like we expect all mature nations on this planet to do, he said. He added that Russia must prove itself before its military can work alongside the U.S. Then in Munich, at a security conference, Mattis calmed the nerves of any NATO nations worried about Trumps warning last July that America would not defend its allies if they didnt fulfill their obligations to us.

The recent protests against Yiannopouloss Simon & Schuster book deal, the violent demonstration over his planned University of California, Berkeley, speech, and the controversy surrounding his appearance on Real Time With Bill Maher have reinforced Yiannopouloss dubious claims that hes dangerous and a martyr for free-speech. On Saturday, Yiannopoulos scored his biggest prize yet (aside from, perhaps, this Trump tweet): an invitation to speak at this years Conservative Political Action Conference. An epidemic of speech suppression has taken over college campuses, said CPAC chairman Matt Schlapp. Milo has exposed their liberal thuggery and we think free speech includes hearing Milos important perspective. Initial reports said Yiannopoulos would be the keynote speaker at the event, which will be held in Maryland later this week, but hes actually just one of more than 75 speakers, including Vice-President Mike Pence. Still, as Breitbart gleefully noted following the announcement, Both leftists and establishment conservatives have taken to Twitter to express their outrage. Washingtonian reported that even some board members of the American Conservative Union, which hosts CPAC, felt blindsided by the announcement. The ACU board was not consulted on this, nor was there a board vote, tweeted ACU board member Ned Ryun. Others pointed out that last week Yiannopoulos told Bill Maher, I dont know if Im conservative. By Sunday, that was the least of CPACs concerns. The Reagan Battalion, a conservative blog, tweeted out a video of Yiannopoulos making anti-Semitic remarks and railing against the arbitrary and oppressive idea of consent. First, he claims that when female teachers have sex with their male students, The boy is the predator in that situation. He continues: When a voice off-camera says that sounds like priest molestation, Yiannopoulos shoots back: And do you know what? Im grateful for Father Michael. I wouldnt give nearly such good head if it wasnt for him. Later, the Reagan Battalion posted a longer, unedited clip, and linked to the source: an episode of the Drunken Peasants podcast uploaded to YouTube on January 4, 2016. After one of the co-hosts defends age-of-consent laws, using 13-year-old boys as an example, Yiannopoulos responds: When hes accused of defending pedophilia, Yiannopoulos says the co-host doesnt understand what the term means: Hebephilia is the term for a sexual interest in pubescent children, roughly ages 11 to 14, and ephebophilia refers to an interest in older adolescents. The lowest and most common age of consent across the U.S. is 16. Yiannopouloss opinions on adults having sex with minors were no secret. He also discussed the topic on Joe Rogans podcast on September 30, 2015. In the clip below, which began circulating again on Sunday, Yiannopoulos makes the same quip about Father Michael and insists he did not molest him, saying, When I was 14, trust me, I was the predator. When Rogan references the sexual-abuse allegations against director Bryan Singer, Yiannopoulos describes going to Hollywood parties thrown by other people who I wont name of a similar stature in Hollywood, and seeing very young boys being abused by older men. He does not say anything about reporting this to the police. Yiannopoulos defended himself in a lengthy Facebook post, declaring, I do not support pedophilia. Period. It is a vile and disgusting crime, perhaps the very worst. He claims the entire controversy stems from Establishment Republicans using selectively edited videos to discredit him, though what appear to be the original recordings have been online for months. He describes the quip about Father Michael as an edgy way to deal with clerical sexual abuse committed against me when I was a teen. Yiannopoulos says he does regret his sloppy use of the word boys, which he says gay men often use when they refer to consenting adults. Its unclear which remarks hes referring to, but at times in the video he seems to be discussing children under the age of consent. He also said he was not talking about anything illegal and I was not referring to pre-pubescent boys, though its illegal for adults to have sex with minors regardless of whether theyve gone through puberty. Many said they were still disturbed by the video, including CNNs Jake Tapper, who wondered how CPAC could defend inviting Yiannopoulos: CPAC chairman Matt Schlapp was still standing by Yiannopoulos on Sunday night, though he did not address the videos directly.

Cohen, recently hand-delivered a sealed peace plan to the White House outlining a way to remove the U.S. sanctions on Russia, a plan that was conceived by a pro-Putin Ukrainian lawmaker connected to Cohen by a Trump business associate with links to the mafia. This is according to a new report published by the New York Times on Sunday. The plan was apparently delivered to the desk of former national security adviser Michael Flynn one week before he was forced to resign over having allegedly had, and lied about, a discussion about U.S. sanctions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. It is not clear if the plan was ever opened after being delivered to the White House, or if the plans proponents have discussed the plan with Trump or anyone else in the administration. The Times describes the group behind the plan as amateur diplomatic freelancers, and while this is obviously a lot more smoke in the already murky story regarding Team Trumps possible connections to Russia, the new report alleges no wrongdoing regarding the scheme. The Times explains that the wealthy Ukrainian lawmaker who came up with the plan, Andrii V. Artemenko, sees himself as a Trump-style leader of a future Ukraine and claims to have corruption evidence that can bring down current Ukrainian president Petro O. Poroshenko (in order to replace him with someone who is less hostile to Russia and thus amenable to Artemenkos peace plan). Artemenko also claims that top Putin aides have encouraged his plans, but the Ukrainian government is already disavowing Artemenkos efforts; they say that he was not authorized to present any such plan to a foreign government. Ukrainian political efforts to oppose Poroshenko were in part developed by former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who left the campaign after his varied connections to Russia-aligned leaders in Ukraine were exposed back in August. Manafort and Artemenko have apparently never met. Poroshenko has been fighting a war against Russia-backed separatists in Eastern Ukraine since replacing his ousted pro-Russia predecessor, Viktor Yanukovych, in 2014. (And Manafort used to work for Yanukovych.) The Times and Politico also report that Artemenko met with Trump campaign officials after he traveled to Cleveland for last summers Republican National Convention. The Times adds that Artemenko says that he saw in Mr. Trump an opportunity to advocate a plan for peace in Ukraine  and help advance his own political career. The other players in the story are: Trumps special counsel, Cohen, a top Trump Organization lieutenant with business and familial ties to Ukraine who is currently under investigation by the FBI over his possible connections to the Kremlin; and Felix Sater, a Russian-American businessman with a decade of experience working with the Trump Organization who once pled guilty in a mafia-linked stock-manipulation scheme and became a government informant. Sater, who has also done time for stabbing a man in the face with the stem of a margarita glass, has said in the past that he and Trump were close. Trump has denied that. A mutual friend apparently introduced Artemenko to Sater and they then involved Cohen. The three men allegedly worked on the deal at a Manhattan hotel in late January. Now, Artemenko is hoping the next national security adviser, whomever that is, will consider the plan after joining the Trump administration. A controversial and unverified dossier assembled by a former British intelligence agent alleged that Cohen had discussed Russias hacking of Democratic Party computer systems with a Russian official in Prague during Trumps campaign, but Cohen and the Russian official have both denied that allegation. Sater had apparently been working on a plan for a Trump Tower in Moscow that was halted on account of Trumps presidential campaign. Talking Points Memos Josh Marshall, for what its worth, thinks Saters inclusion in the report is a very big deal, since Sater was at the center of the Trump Soho development project in Manhattan, which Marshall notes was the Trump project with the most Russia-linked shadiness."}, {"date": "2017/02/19", "title": "Sweden Confused After Trump Cites Nonexistent Terrorist Incident", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/sweden-confused-after-trump-cites-nonexistent-incident.html", "text": " At his campaign-style rally in Florida on Saturday, President Trump referenced what he implied to have been some kind of terrorist incident in Sweden on Friday night. Making a larger argument about the alleged threat posed by admitting migrants from majority-Muslim countries, Trump ominously warned: There was, of course, no terrorist or refugee-related incident in Sweden on Friday, as Swedes have been helpfully pointing out since Trumps apparently unscripted remark. After mentioning the so-called incident, Trump went on to list a series of places in Europe where there have, in fact, been Islamist terrorist attacks over the last few years, but no such horrors have happened in Sweden. The Associated Press reports that the Swedish Foreign Ministry is unaware of any terror-linked major incidents, and that the countrys Security Police wont be raising the countrys terror-threat level. The Swedish Embassy in Washington also requested clarification on Trumps remark from the State Department on Sunday. On Sunday, President Trump eventually claimed that his remark was based on a news segment he had seen on Fridays Tucker Carlson Tonight. That segment featured a Swedish documentarians allegations that migrants are responsible for a crime wave in the Scandinavian country, and that the Swedish government was trying to cover it up. Indeed, since there was no terrorist incident in Sweden on Friday, the Fox News segment was already the only reasonable explanation for Trumps comment. As several reporters have been consistently tracking, the presidents tweets and public comments often directly correspond to things he has just watched on television, and the Sweden comment provides another prominent example of that phenomenon. It remains less clear, however, how Trump could carelessly conflate a Fox News segment with an actual incident or attack when ad-libbing on Saturday. The reaction in Sweden to Trumps remarks has ranged from annoyed to bemused. What has he been smoking? former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt, wondered on Twitter. Then came the Ikea, ABBA, and other Swedish-export-laden tweets via the hashtags #LastNightInSweden and #SwedenIncident. And The Muppets infamously mumbling Swedish Chef emerged as a prime suspect in the imaginary attack: In the Swedish media, the newspaper Aftonbladet made use of the situation by publishing, in English, a list which began, Mr President, here is what happened in Sweden Friday night, including such dramatic events as: Aftonbladet also highlighted a new report about a bull moose attempting to mate with a wooden counterpart he had discovered in a Swedes garden. The Independent, meanwhile, points out that Sweden did in fact suffer an underreported attack, only it was last month, and migrants were the target, not the perpetrators: Sweden, which admitted more refugees per capita in 2016 than any other country in Europe, has not suffered an Islamist-inspired terrorist attack since 2010, years before Europes migrant crisis began. All told, the country of 9.5 million has accepted more than 250,000 asylum seekers since 2014, including many from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq. There have certainly been problems resulting from the influx of refugees, but also some economic benefits. The alleged crime wave at the center of the Tucker Carlson segment, which has been frequently cited by right-wing news sites, seems greatly exaggerated at best, and a conspiracy theory at worst. Last May, the Globe and Mails Doug Sanders dug into the crime-wave claims, and discovered a much more complicated picture than any anti-immigrant Facebook posts would ever admit: The Guardian has more on the crime rate over the past three years: Swedish political scientist Henrik Selin additionally explained to the New York Times, with regards to the crime-wave cover-up allegations, how that kind of claim has been in the political debate for 15 years now. But nobody has been able to prove there is a cover-up. Selin also pointed out that other Islamophobic reports have falsely implied that Sharia law has been widely adopted across Sweden, or that the countrys police officers have refused to enter certain predominantly immigrant neighborhoods because they are too dangerous. On the contrary, Selim added, the fact is that crime rates are going down. This post has been updated to reflect additional Swedish crime stats, comments from the Swedish government, Swedens request for clarification from the U.S. State Department, and Trumps confirmation of the Fox News connection."}, {"date": "2017/02/19", "title": "McCain Keeps Criticizing Trump, Warns Against Attacks on Press", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/mccain-keeps-criticizing-trump-defends-press.html", "text": " Senator John McCain continued to offer veiled and not-so-veiled criticism of President Trump and his administration over the weekend. In a Meet the Press interview that aired on Sunday, the Arizona Republican indirectly rejected the premise of Trumps Friday tweet calling critical news organizations the enemy of the American people, warning that suppression of the press is how dictators get started. McCain ominously reminded host Chuck Todd that authoritarians looking to consolidate their power historically start with eliminating press freedoms. If you want to preserve democracy as we know it, you have to have a free and many times adversarial press, McCain insisted. Im not saying that President Trump is trying to be a dictator, he added, Im just saying we need to learn the lessons of history. In the same interview, McCain indicated that he was worried about Trumps national-security goals and principles. Asked about his confidence in the president, McCain gingerly explained that he was worried about Trumps understanding of some of these issues and his contradictory articulations regarding areas of U.S. foreign policy like Russia. The senator also called Trumps recent moral equivalency of Vladimir Putins Russia and the U.S. a contradiction of everything the United States has ever stood for in the 20th and 21st century and warned that achieving some of Trumps stated goals in Europe would upset the last 70 years of a new world order. Trump has previously stated that he thought NATO was obsolete and has routinely expressed his support for the dismantling of the European Union. In light of the ongoing scandal regarding the possible links between the Kremlin and Trump advisers, McCain also concluded that he had more hope than belief that Americans could count on the Republican-controlled Congress to investigate President Trump should that prove necessary. Just how much McCain may be able to move that needle, or get such an investigation started by himself, remains to be seen. The senators comments on NBC reflected remarks that he made on Friday at the Munich Security Conference in Germany. In that speech, McCain promoted a worldview that clearly contradicted Trumps, though McCain declined to reference the president by name. Raising the stakes about as high as they can go, McCain warned conference attendees that the West was now facing an existential threat, and he worried that Western leaders, including in the U.S., seemed ready to give up on it in its hour of greatest need. The former presidential candidate also spoke out against several tenets of Trumpism, including the romanticization of authoritarianism, the disinterest in hard truth, the turn away from universal values and toward old ties of blood and race and sectarianism, and the hardening resentment toward immigrants and minorities. All of these remarks also echo or complement the many insights in this weeks New York cover story about McCain by Gabriel Sherman. As Sherman highlights, the ambivalent maverick has regularly struggled with when and how to respond to Trump  a dynamic made all the more difficult by how unpredictable the president is and how isolating it can be to speak out against him. Regardless, though the legacy-minded McCain remains caught between president, party, and his occasionally shifting notions of principle, the senators pushback on Trump seems to be intensifying."}, {"date": "2017/02/19", "title": "Trump Attempts Reset With Recycled Campaign Stump Speech in Florida", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-attempts-reset-with-recycled-campaign-stump-speech.html", "text": " President Donald Trump capped off his tumultuous fourth week in office by essentially relaunching his presidential campaign in front of a crowd of cheering supporters on Saturday. The event, hosted in a Melbourne, Florida, airplane hangar, resembled a typical Trump campaign rally in almost every way  save the dramatic entrance of Air Force One (set to the theme music of Air Force One). In a scripted and greatly recycled stump speech, Trump repeatedly insisted that his administration was running so smoothly and already making incredible progress, and he angrily blamed the media for any suggestion otherwise. He also took the opportunity to complain about the federal judges who ruled against his botched travel ban, falsely claimed that there has been no way to vet refugees and other immigrants before they gain entry to the U.S., seemed to falsely imply that there was some kind of terrorist attack on Friday night in Sweden, and criticized Democratic lawmakers for not automatically confirming the very few appointees he has nominated for roles in the executive branch since taking office. I am here because I want to be among my friends and among the people, Trump declared at the outset of his appearance, following brief remarks by his wife, Melania. The White House had previously explained that the Saturday rally was meant to give Trump a way to reach his supporters without having to go through the media, though the White House seemed to offer no live coverage of the event, relying instead on television news channels to broadcast it. The rally was also supposedly put on by the Trump campaign, rather than the Trump administration, but its not clear what that distinction actually means to them. (A White House spokesperson called it a campaign rally for America rather than admit it was the first event of the 2020 election cycle.) Either way, Trump worked to list his brief administrations accomplishments throughout the speech, but much of that effort was comprised of slightly updated campaign promises about action yet to come  like noting that he has given executive orders, even though its not yet clear what impact many of those orders will actually have. The 9,000-person crowd  which was apparently smaller than the one for a near identical campaign event held in the same hangar in September  cheered and jeered on command just as they typically did during Trumps presidential run. There werent any lock-her-up chants this time around, but when Trump criticized the media, many supporters turned and booed the press pen, and the president clearly relished leading that attack. After a pugnacious 75-minute press conference on Thursday, and sending a tweet which called the media the enemy of the American people on Friday, Trumps attacks on the press took a similar tone on Saturday. He told the crowd, up front, that he wanted to speak to them without the filter of fake news, and claimed, without evidence, that journalists have made up most of the sources in the numerous negative stories about his administration. Theyve become a big part of the problem, they are a part of the corrupt system, Trump announced. He then tried to cite historical precedent for his repeated attacks, noting that Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, and Abraham Lincoln, and many of our greatest presidents fought with the media and called them out oftentimes on their lies. When the media lies to people, I will never, ever let them get away with it  I will do whatever I can that they dont get away with it, Trump claimed, prompting a surge of applause. They have their own agenda, and their agenda is not your agenda, he continued. Trump even offered up a quote to back up his assault: Jefferson said, nothing can be believed which is seen in a newspaper. Truth itself, he said, becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle. Trump then bragged that the quote was written on the same day as his birthday. Thats a real Jefferson line, by the way, as he did regularly complain about the press and even tried to censor them when he was president, but he was also a staunch supporter and protector of freedom of the press throughout his life. Jefferson never said about the press what Trump says about the press, historian and Jefferson biographer Joseph Ellis explained to the Washington Post in a post published on Saturday morning. (And regarding the citing of Abraham Lincolns relationship with the press  thats a complicated history as well.) President Trump is clearly trying to regain his campaign-era mojo after a mostly bungled first month in office. Its not yet clear if he will schedule more campaignlike events, or if these events are just an attempt to bolster his ego or highlight the still-fervent support of many of his voters, or, as the White House claims, give Trump more opportunities to speak directly to Americans  claiming and promising whatever he wants. Campaign-style events are not at all unprecedented for presidents, even early in their terms, but typically they are aimed at supporting a particular message or legislative goal. Trump claims he doesnt believe negative polls, but those polls indicate that his approval rating has done nothing but fall since he took office. In fact, right now, its already at the level of President Obamas all-time low. Considering that and the numerous other problems the Trump administration has created for itself since assuming power, the main goal of Saturdays rally was less about winning support than manufacturing an opportunity for Trump to deny that his presidency has failed to launch, both to his supporters and himself. Only the media, according to Trump, stands between Americans and his version of reality."}, {"date": "2017/02/18", "title": "Senior National Security Council Aide Fired After Criticizing Trump", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/senior-nsc-aide-fired-after-criticizing-trump.html", "text": " The White House has fired a senior National Security Council aide after he was found to have criticized President Trump and administration officials at a private think-tank event. Politico reports that Craig Deare, the NSCs senior director for Western Hemisphere Affairs, made the comments at an off-the-record roundtable discussion attended by a few dozen scholars at the Woodrow Wilson Center last week. Deare was dismissed after the White House found out about the remarks, in which he apparently criticized Trump, chief strategist Steve Bannon, and the general dysfunction plaguing the Trump administration, as well as the presidents daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law/senior adviser, Jared Kushner. It seems hard to believe that a member of the NSC would think they could do something like give a detailed and embarrassing readout of Trumps call with Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto and not expect the White House to find out and fire them, but Deare, a former dean of administration at the National Defense University, was not an Obama-holdover, but a political appointee who was added to the NSC after Trumps took office. Deare also reportedly criticized the power structure in the administration, specifically how senior national-security aides did not have access to Trump. Its the second departure from the NSC in a week, following the ouster of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn after it was revealed that he had lied to administration colleagues regarding a call he conducted with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak while a member of Trumps transition team. (Flynn also selected Deare.) Trumps first choice to be Flynns replacement, retired Vice Admiral Robert Harward, has declined the job offer, citing financial and family issues after reportedly being told that he could not hire and fire his own staff on the NSC. MSNBC then reported on Friday that Harward had actually turned down the position because the White House wouldnt meet certain conditions, which included making sure there was a clear chain of command, him having a direct line to the president, and the removal of political advisers like Steven Bannon from the NSC. According to the report, Harward was then asked to reconsider by the White House, and said he would, but opted to stick with his original decision after watching Trumps bonkers press conference on Thursday. Another allegedly top candidate for the national-security-adviser job, retired four-star general David Petraeus, did not advance to the interview phase because, according to The Wall Street Journal, the White House thought that his demands were unreasonable. Whoever it is that would agree to take that position certainly should do so with some very, very significant assurances that he or she would have authorities over the personnel of the organization, that there would be a commitment to a disciplined process and procedures, Mr. Petraeus said during an appearance at the Munich Security Conference on Friday. The remaining candidates for the position are former U.N. Ambassador (and Iraq War co-architect) John Bolton and a trio of retired lieutenant generals: Keith Kellogg, H.R. McMaster, and Robert Caslen. All four (and currently unknown other candidates) will reportedly meet with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago Resort in Florida this weekend."}, {"date": "2017/02/18", "title": "Trumps Presidency Enhances a $200,000 Mar-a-Lago Membership", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trumps-presidency-enhances-mar-a-lago-membership.html", "text": " The managing director of President Donald Trumps Mar-a-Lago club in Florida says that Trumps presidency enhances membership at the private Palm Beach club, and that people are now even more interested in joining as a result. The New York Times reports that the manager, Bernd Lembcke, also claimed that the club is very careful in vetting potential new members, who still need to be introduced by a current member to be considered. Mar-a-Lago  where the annual membership fee was recently doubled to $200,000 following Trumps election  is now the presidents Winter White House, and so far Trump seems intent on heading there every weekend (at significant taxpayer expense). The club has subsequently become a place where the rich and powerful can pay the presidents private company to have private access to the president, his family, and his advisors  though the White House denies thats what happening. The Times has also obtained lists of the clubs members, which unsurprisingly include many wealthy power players from the worlds of real estate, finance, and the energy industry, as well as people like New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick. Having some sense of who might be at the club is probably a good idea, since Trump decided to conduct an impromptu meeting about a North Korean missile launch with the prime minister of Japan last weekend in full view of club members and their dinner guests  a bizarre scenario, which drew the ire of many national-security experts. Even following the Times report, its still not clear how extreme the vetting of Mar-a-Lago members and their guests is  if there is any vetting beyond Secret Service checks  in relation to these peoples extraordinary level of access to the president. Though most of the clubs more than 500 members joined before Trump began his presidential campaign, that doesnt mean that they dont stand to benefit from their proximity to the new president. And while most American presidents have regularly hobnobbed with the rich and powerful, often in private, Trump is the first one that gets paid for the privilege, since he has refused to divest himself from his family business while running the country. Trump spokesperson Hope Hicks insists that Trump has not and will not be discussing policy with club members, but some members report that Trump has been doing exactly that. Real-estate developer Bruce Toll of Toll Brothers told the Times that Trump has indeed been talking shop with guests and soliciting their advice, and developer Richard LeFrak said that Trump casually asked him last weekend if he would consider taking the job of building the border wall Trump has promised to erect along the southern U.S. border. (LeFrak is apparently not interested.) Hicks also boasted that Mar-a-Lago was one of the most successful private clubs in the world and added that the president looks forward to hosting many world leaders at this remarkable property. The presidents son Eric, meanwhile, said that concerns about the Trump family profiting from presidential access were inappropriate since the club admits no more than 40 new members a year, and because wealthy executives already have plenty of other ways to engage with the federal government. The younger Trump also complained that the notion of pay-to-play access assumes the worst of us and everyone, and that is unfair. It seems that members additionally insisted that they were not initiating conversations about any business matters with Trump or his staff, but it sounds as though Trump is more than willing to bring up matters of government himself. Since the press is not allowed into the club under most circumstances, so far the only non-official reports of Trumps activities inside Mar-a-Lago have been via leaks or members social-media accounts. Looking further north, Politico passes along a leaked audio recording of an event Trump hosted at his private golf club in New Jersey less than two weeks after the election. On the November 18 recording, the then president-elect tells a gathering of Trump National Golf Club members that he consulted some of them on who should serve in his cabinet just after the election. Speaking of his ongoing meetings with possible cabinet nominees, Trump also told the crowd: Trump also told the assembled audience in New Jersey that they were the special people and were my real group, since the attendees had been members of the club for such a long time. One group of people who may be feeling decidedly less special following Trumps ascension to the White House, however, are Palm Beach residents who arent members of Mar-a-Lago. NPR reports that President Trumps regular trips to the coastal Florida enclave have shut down the the county airport for five consecutive weekends, and businesses dependent on the airport say they may end up losing millions of dollars in revenue this year as a result. Sales are also down in the towns shopping district, as the road through it gets periodically shut down by the Secret Service, and Palm Beach County police have racked up $1.5 million in overtime costs on account of Trumps visits. Some residents are also trying to block the newly approved plan to build a large helipad for the president at Mar-a-Lago, as they are worried the frequent comings and goings of the presidents massive Marine helicopters will not enhance the enjoyment of their homes."}, {"date": "2017/02/18", "title": "John McCain the Republican vs. John McCain the Patriot", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/john-mccain-takes-on-donald-trump.html", "text": " John McCain was hustling down the hallway in the Russell Senate Office Building with the purpose of an Aaron Sorkin character. It was not yet two weeks into Donald Trumps presidency, and McCain had already become the fiercest Republican critic of the new administration. While party leaders like Paul Ryan were contorting themselves to defend even Trumps most ill-conceived executive orders, McCain had been, for a member of the presidents party, on fire: He had criticized Trump for banning immigrants and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, for his failed first mission in Yemen, for his suggestion that he might lift sanctions against Russia; he even took diplomacy into his own hands, reaching out to Australia to assure the country of our continued friendship after Trump had bizarrely confronted its prime minister in their introductory phone call. By many measures, there is no one better positioned to challenge Trump from within his own party. The so-called maverick was just reelected to the Senate by a 13-point margin; at 80 years old, he has both significant stature and nothing to lose. Still, for McCain, opposing Trump is not a simple matter. For one thing, its tricky to challenge a vengeful president who has taken to Twitter to accuse McCain of emboldening the enemy and trying to start WWIII. For another, McCain is not a Republican in Name Only; he is a true believer, an elder of the tribe. He does not exactly relish being deemed the loyal opposition. What? What! McCain barked as he ran into a throng of reporters. Some people are saying youre Trumps No. 1 nemesis, a reporter said. Is that the role youre trying to stake out? McCain shook his head. Its very convenient for the media to say that, he grumbled. If interpreters who worked for us in Iraq are not allowed into the United States, then Im going to speak up. If that makes me a nemesis of the president of the United States, then you can label me as such. They want a scenario of, quote, confrontation, McCain told me as we stepped into the elevator. McCain was on his way to lunch in the Senate Dining Room with his friend Lindsey Graham, the other Republican Trump critic in the Senate whom many Democrats look to with hope. He found Graham at a corner table in the back. A group of em stopped me and said, Are you Trumps nemesis? McCain recounted. I said, Thats such a convenient thing. Its actually boring, Graham said. There are a lot of sins in life, but the one thats intolerable is being boring. I hate boring. McCain shook his head at the notion that just because he had the temerity to criticize the president, congressional Democrats thought they could recruit him to their cause. These are the same Democrats that shredded me in 2008, he said. I get along with the Democrats, but please, Im not their hero. Theyre trying to use us. We will work with them, but have no doubt, their agenda is not our agenda. Yes, lest anyone forget, McCain and Graham, like many of their Republican brethren, came into this administration almost giddy with the possibility of what could be enacted with both chambers of Congress and the White House under GOP control. McCain said he was enthusiastic about Trumps plans to slash regulations and increase military spending, and he is a fan of Defense Secretary James Mattis, with whom he said hed spoken nearly a dozen times that week. He is also gleeful about Trumps conservative Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, who stopped by the table with Kelly Ayotte, the former Republican senator (and Trump critic) from New Hampshire, who is helping Gorsuch through his confirmation process. Judge! How are ya? McCain said, bolting up to shake Gorsuchs hand. Graham called across the table: Anybody who wants to poison the water and adulterate the food is a good man for me! Gorsuch and Ayotte gave Graham panicked looks. Didnt you hear what Nancy Pelosi said? Graham asked, referring to the House minority leaders comment that Gorsuch should be considered a lousy pick by anyone who breathes air or drinks water. She said if you eat it or drink it, hes bad! Gorsuch forced a relieved smile, getting the joke. The Democrats are just off the reservation. Theyre crazy the way theyre behaving, McCain said to Gorsuch. As for hearings, Ive never seen anything like this. Just keep your flak jacket on. Steady as she goes. No one knew it at the time, but this congenial lunch was perhaps John McCains last sanguine moment about the Trump administration. In the two weeks since, he has watched as allegations about Russian involvement in the election  and possibly in American foreign policy  picked up steam, and as Michael Flynn was forced to resign as national-security adviser after revelations that he improperly discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador (and then lied to the vice-president about it). To McCain, these are red-line issues. No matter how much he likes the prospect of deregulation, the compromising of Americas sovereignty was pushing him closer to the barricades. The severity of this issue, the gravity of it, is so consequential because if you succeed in corrupting an election, then youve destroyed the foundation of democracy, he told me later. So I view it with the utmost seriousness. I view it more seriously than a physical attack. I view it more seriously than Orlando, or San Bernardino. As tragic as that was, the far-reaching consequences of an election hack are certainly far in excess of a single terrorist attack. Now McCain is renewing his calls for a bipartisan select committee to look into Trumps ties to Russia, which could ultimately put pressure on the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor  a probe that could get perilous for the president. While he is meeting with resistance from party leaders so far, McCain plans to use his role as chair of the Armed Services Committee and ex officio member of the Intelligence Committee to push for answers. The Trump administrations viability rests on the support of a Republican Congress, and what John McCain is doing, carefully but with growing fervor, could shake its foundations. The story of McCains captivity in Vietnam has been told so many times it can now be rendered in shorthand: 1967, a bombing raid over Hanoi, his plane shot down, both arms and a knee broken, capture, torture, the prospect of early release refused on principle, an ordeal that lasts for more than five years, much of it spent in solitary confinement, during a war that most of the country had already given up on. Its the story that made McCains political career, thats been trotted out in six Senate campaigns and two presidential bids. But it also undeniably shaped McCains view of the world and Americas place in it. I fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in someone elses, he said during his nomination acceptance speech at the 2008 Republican convention. I loved it for its decency, for its faith in the wisdom, justice, and goodness of its people. I loved it because it was not just a place but an idea, a cause worth fighting for. I was never the same again; I wasnt my own man anymore; I was my countrys. McCain believes in the idea of American exceptionalism, that the United States has a responsibility to be a force for good in the world and to confront repressive regimes. The Trump doctrine  to the extent that one exists  is quite different: American foreign policy should be dictated by nationalist self-interest at almost any cost. During the 2016 campaign, Trump advocated for reintroducing torture as a means of extracting information, killing terrorists families, and seizing Iraqs oil. He derided international institutions such as NATO and the U.N. and cheered when Britain voted to pull out of the European Union. He praised brutal strongmen from Saddam Hussein to Vladimir Putin, whom hes called a more impressive leader than Barack Obama. McCain has been arguing for years that Putins Russia is a global menace that must be confronted. Russias leaders, rich with oil wealth and corrupt with power, have rejected democratic ideals and the obligations of a responsible power, McCain said during his 2008 RNC speech. They invaded a small, democratic neighbor to gain more control over the worlds oil supply, intimidate other neighbors, and further their ambitions of reassembling the Russian empire. He sees Russia as a bully with designs on rolling back the spread of democracy in Eastern Europe and controlling the Middle East with Iran, fundamentally threatening Americas place in the world. Putin wont stop until the cost of going forward is too high, McCain told me. The senator has challenged presidents of both parties when their foreign-policy directives ran counter to his own. In his first term in Congress, he criticized Ronald Reagans decision to station peacekeeping Marines in Beirut with minimal defenses, which resulted in the deaths of 241 service personnel when a suicide bomber drove straight into the barracks. His battles with George W. Bush over tax cuts, torture, and U.S. strategy in Iraq became the stuff of Washington lore. And during the Obama years, McCain was one of the presidents fiercest foreign-policy critics, finding fault with his decision to pull troops from Iraq and his refusal to enforce his red line on Syria after Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons against his people. And yet it would be grossly inaccurate to characterize McCain as a man of pure principle. Hes too complicated for that. What makes him inspiring  and infuriating  to people on both sides of the aisle is that, more than most politicians, his political acts span a particularly wide distance between courage and expediency. He is capable of true heroism and conspicuous political cowardice. Over the years, hes flip-flopped on some of his signature issues, from unfunded tax cuts to immigration reform to upholding Roe v. Wade. Hes often on the phone, dialing up friends and advisers to gauge their opinions and weigh the risks and rewards of various courses of action. This is how it came to be that the same McCain who cares so deeply about Americas standing in the world also cynically named as his 08 running mate Sarah Palin, thus arguably ushering in the era of Trumpism that he now finds so troubling. He still defends the choice. The media went after her like Ive never seen, he told me. They said she said, Oh, I can see Russia from here. Well, Russia is not that far from Alaska! They destroyed her in a way I will never forgive them. In private, he has been more candid. I regret running a small campaign, he told a friend. Still, according to his advisers, McCains reaction to Trump is mostly from the point of view of his better angels. To an extent far greater than McCain himself will say, they describe McCain as finding Trump to be a true threat to the republic. McCain speechwriter Mark Salter said the Trump administration presents a challenge to the senators core values. McCain has always had empathy and compassion for oppressed people. It affects his views on torture and the way we should conduct ourselves in the world. Its anathema to the Trump-Bannon-Sessions worldview. Thats not really Realpolitik  its fanatical. Its bleak. Take their oil? Kill their families? Its like a cartoon villain and is against everything John McCain stands for. The antipathy between the two started during the campaign when McCain criticized Trump for calling Mexicans rapists, attacking an Indiana-born judge of Mexican descent, and denigrating the Muslim parents of a slain Iraq War soldier. Trump said McCain wasnt a war hero because hed been captured by the North Vietnamese and so couldnt fight (I like people that werent captured, said Trump). Trump adviser Steve Bannons media arm, Breitbart, has gone after McCain repeatedly, even claiming he created isis. Bannon, who I dont know, was clearly doing the stories, McCain told me. On top of that, Trumps financial backers, Robert and Rebekah Mercer, donated heavily to a PAC backing McCains pro-Trump primary challenger. Though many expected McCain to take a firm stand against Trump the candidate, he refused to join the Never Trump movement led by Mitt Romney. Romney was pissing on Trump in a way that almost made you feel bad for Trump, one McCain adviser told me. Some McCain associates said he was worried about reelection; others that it was party loyalty that kept him from publicly opposing Trump. Whatever the case, it wasnt until the Access Hollywood tape leaked in October that McCain announced he wasnt voting for Trump. Like most of the political Establishment, he thought Hillary Clinton was going to win. We had several discussions prior to the election about his hope he would be able to work well with Hillary Clinton, said McCains friend Grant Woods, an Arizona lawyer. When Trump won instead, McCain decided to give him the benefit of the doubt. Its hard to imagine, but McCain saw something of himself in the new outsider president, according to Woods. McCain had been reviled by the partys base much as Trump had been rejected by the GOP Establishment. Only eight years ago, John was the nominee of the GOP and wasnt the first choice of a lot of the party diehards, said Woods. He and his allies made the point that he won the nomination fair and square. Thats a complicating factor in his mind. McCain wanted to work with Trump. During the transition, Trump called McCain and asked for recommendations for Defense secretary. McCain suggested David Petraeus, Mattis, and Ayotte. (She didnt support me! Trump told McCain.) McCain has supported all of Trumps Cabinet picks  Rex Tillerson, Jeff Sessions, Betsy DeVos, Tom Price, and Scott Pruitt  save one, budget director Mick Mulvaney, whom he views as anti-military. Ive always given presidents the benefit of the doubt on their nominees, McCain told me. With Obama, there were a number of nominees I had concerns about that I voted for. I think elections have consequences. Beyond that, McCain recognizes the sway Trump has over a significant swath of the Republican electorate. There is frustration out there that to me is understandable. Theres a lot of friends of mine who are older white males that contact me all the time and say, Stick with Trump! Whats the matter with you, John? I said, Well, we have some disagreement about trade, and they say, You dont care about America! I try to be nice, but theyre fired up. McCain thinks an increasingly divided nation is a bigger worry than the possibility of the Trump administrations turning into an authoritarian regime. I just dont think its possible in our society. Theres too many checks and balances. The danger is not Trump perverting our Constitution or taking too much power; the danger is the polarization of America. Of course, the two dangers are not unconnected: The countrys polarization leads senators and congressmen to fear being primaried by more Trumpian candidates, and that in turn leads them to forget all about checks and balances. So far, Republicans in both houses have rallied around the new presidents appointments and policies. Even those who criticized Trump during the campaign, like Ted Cruz and Jeff Flake, are mostly falling into line. When I saw Cruz in the days after Flynns resignation, he stuck with the party line, saying how happy he was with Trumps conservative Cabinet picks. And Flake, though he issued a statement against the travel ban, has been generally supportive as well: In terms of regulations, repeal two for every one? Im excited about a lot, Flake told me. For his part, McCain has wrestled with when and how to respond to Trumps statements and policies. Recently, he told his former presidential-campaign strategist John Weaver: I cant be the car alarm that always goes off. If I am, Im not effective. Still, McCain is sounding the alarm more and more frequently. The senator issued a statement blasting Trumps decision to abandon the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal. I just think we made a terrible mistake, he told me. Weve consigned 60 percent of the worlds economy to China. And of course there was his critical statement about the Trump-authorized Navy seal raid in Yemen that resulted in a seals death, some 30 Yemeni casualties including women and children, the destruction of a $75 million aircraft, and the end of U.S. ground operations there. These are challenging times, and I have to go my own way, McCain said. Its not disloyalty to the party. Those acts of open criticism have put McCain in Trumps crosshairs. When McCain spoke out about the botched raid, Trump fired off a series of tweets: Sen. McCain should not be talking about the success or failure of a mission to the media. Only emboldens the enemy! Hes been losing so long he doesnt know how to win anymore. Although McCain has 2 million Twitter followers, he rarely uses the medium to respond to Trump directly. Instead, he relies on his social-media army of campaign volunteers, which he calls Troll Team Six. They attacked and responded to every attack, McCain said. To a large degree it neutered the campaigns against me. Even for someone who is always keenly aware of the political calculus, navigating the Trump administration is challenging. For one thing, you never know where the president is going to come down on anything. I dont know what hes going to do, said McCain. Look at his stance on torture. Or everything. Hes been on all sides. He said intelligence groups are like Nazis, but then he said theyre the greatest in the world. So I have to judge him on what he does. In the meantime, McCain is feeling pressure from all sides. He took heat from friends for defending Flynn in the weeks before he resigned because of revelations that he had lied about his conversations with the Russian ambassador about U.S. sanctions. What am I supposed to say? I cant be bad-mouthing everyone over there, McCain told an adviser. But when McCain does openly criticize Trump, he often finds himself on his own. Hes complained to friends that fellow Republicans arent backing him up. I keep looking behind me, and theres no one there, he recently told an adviser. When Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell nixed McCains initial request for a select committee on Russia, McCain groused to a friend that fucking Mitch aint gonna do it! (McCain denied saying this.) If McCain is a lone dissenter, his opposition could get less and less traction. His power rests in his ability to persuade his fellow Republicans, but remaining relevant is also personal for him. He has seen it happen before  life leaving soon after power did. The commanding wooden desk in McCains office belonged to his predecessor, Barry Goldwater, who barely won reelection during his final campaign. When he left Washington, he never came back, McCain said. Next to the desk, McCain displays a photograph of his grandfather on the deck of the USS Missouri when the Japanese surrendered during WWII. The day after returning home from the Pacific in 1945, he died. McCain is constantly weighing his legacy, torn between doing what it takes to stay effective inside his party and choosing the right moments to go his own way. He is a deeply ambivalent maverick. Still, McCains friends and advisers say this fight is the one he was made for. Whether McCain likes it or not, history has prepared him for this moment, Weaver told me. I talked to him just after Christmas. I said, I know, John, youve been through a lot in your life, but the countrys never needed you more than it does now. We live in dark times. And he said, Boy, you dont know how dark it is. Given the slumping poll numbers that accompanied Trumps erratic first weeks in office, some Republicans say its only a matter of time until skeptics like McCain can break with Trump without political consequences and even pull other members of the party with them. Based on my private conversations with Republicans, at first the feeling was, We want to make this work. But after the first week it was, Yikes, this isnt going to work, said Weekly Standard editor-at-large Bill Kristol. The calculus is: We dont want to be accused of doing him in, but we dont want to go down with the ship either. Trumps bizarre appearance at CIA headquarters the day after assuming office seemed to be a major inflection point. The inauguration speech was bad. People were rattled, Kristol said. But on Saturday morning, people were sort of saying, Well, maybe that was the last gasp of the campaign. Hes going to the CIA this afternoon, and hes going to make up with the intelligence community. But then he goes and spends 15 minutes screaming about crowd size and attacking reporters. For insiders in Washington, that CIA speech was very big. Not incidentally, that speech may have further alienated the intelligence community, which now seems to have little reluctance to leak information to the press. When I saw McCain two days after the CIA episode, it was one of the first things he brought up: I mean, most observers, whether theyre supporters or opponents, believe he should have gone and praised the CIA. Instead, he wandered off into areas that are just not appropriate. Like Kristol, McCain thinks it will be easier to oppose Trump as his poll numbers go down. One thing politicians look at are ratings, and his ratings are going to continue to decline, he said. That means members of Congress will be more likely to resist things they do not agree with rather than roll over. Already, a handful of other Republican senators  Graham, Roy Blunt, Bob Corker  are calling for Flynn to testify in Senate investigations on administration communications with Russia. (House Republicans remain much more circumspect.) Whether they persist in their pursuit of the truth, whatever it may be, and whether they can bring enough pressure to bear on congressional leadership to impanel an independent investigation, is undoubtedly the biggest test of the congressional check on executive power. Proving that a foreign government helped install Trump as president would be a history-making feat  not to mention possibly lead to impeachment proceedings. So it is by no means McCains stated goal. Were clearly not there yet, he told me. McCain is a savvy political operator, a former adviser said. He sees a critical mass building demanding investigations. He weighs in at the decisive moment to turn it to calls for a select committee, and ultimately hell be the person that tips it to calls for an independent-counsel investigation. If that happens, who knows what will be found? Suspicions are both dire and plausible. It was, after all, an independent counsel looking into Whitewater that led to the Monica Lewinsky scandal. If its found that there was collusion between senior officials in the Trump campaign and the Russian Federation, is that a criminal act? It puts us in uncharted waters, said the adviser. McCain has been tracking the Russia issue since shortly before Thanksgiving, when he ran into Sir Andrew Wood, a former British ambassador to Moscow, at the Halifax Security Forum, a foreign-policy conference. Wood tipped McCain off about the now-infamous dossier that claimed Putin had compiled embarrassing information on Trump that could be used for blackmail, as well as allegations that the Trump campaign coordinated with Kremlin officials. I didnt know what to make of it, said McCain, but everyone knows the Russians do use women and sex when people go to Russia. Its an old KGB honeypot. When McCain returned to Washington, he received a copy of the dossier. The next day, he delivered the documents to FBI director James Comey. I said, Its very important. Youre the person I want to give this to, McCain recalled. Comey gave McCain the impression hed already been looking into it. Since then, the drumbeat of news on the subject has gotten faster. On January 5, McCain held a widely attended hearing on Russian cyberoperations in which the then-director of national intelligence, James Clapper, testified that Russias pro-Trump strategy included hacking  classical propaganda, disinformation, fake news. On February 8, McCain attached his name to a bipartisan bill that would require Trump to get Congresss approval to lift Russian sanctions. On February 10, CNN reported that U.S. intelligence agencies had confirmed several pieces of information in the dossier. More damning, U.S. intelligence also found  and leaked  that Flynn had discussed sanctions with Russias ambassador and later lied about it to Pence. The cover-up led many to suspect Flynn had undermined the Obama administration by communicating to Russia that the soon-to-be-installed Trump administration would come to a more favorable decision on the sanctions. I liked Flynn, said McCain. But obviously this is an example of the dysfunction. Now, he said, there are questions that need to be answered: When did Flynn know about anything to do with Russian interference? Why was there a gap of X number of days between the president being told and no action taken? What is the extent of the relationship between Flynn and the Russians? I asked McCain why most of his fellow Republicans arent speaking up about Russias election interference and Trumps potential Russian ties. I frankly dont know, he said. Its not a chapter of Profiles in Courage. McCains call for an independent commission will only get louder. While there are numerous Senate investigations in motion or being called for, the only way to coordinate efforts and see the big picture is to impanel a select committee. McConnell fears a select committee would derail the GOP agenda. But McCain continues to push. After 9/11, Joe Lieberman and I proposed a select commission. It took more than a year before they finally appointed it, so Im not giving up, McCain said. Were going on offense on Russia, agreed Graham, who, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, is calling for oversight of the FBIs investigation into Trumps ties to Russia. In the meantime, the world keeps spinning, and McCain worries about Americas place in it. The national-security aspect isnt functioning, he said. Nobody knows whos making the decisions. The Iranians are testing. The Russians are testing. Theyre testing this administration. Who is making the decisions when we dont have a national-security adviser? On February 16, McCain traveled to Germany to shore up our European alliances that have been strained by Trumps close relationship with Putin. McCain compares Trump-Putin to Stalins nonaggression pact with Hitler, in which the two dictators tried to divvy up Europe between them  which worked until Hitler decided to launch an attack on Soviet positions anyway. Some have likened it to the Molotov-Ribbentrop spheres of influence, which said you have Eastern Europe and we have this. That doesnt work with dictators, said McCain. Putin is a KGB colonel who is bent on restoring the Russian empire. McCain takes Putins global bullying personally. He points at a picture of a Russian opposition politician he keeps next to his desk. This here is Boris Nemtsov, he said. The physicist turned liberal politician was one of Putins fiercest critics and had become McCains friend. They last saw each other two years ago. He sat on that seat there, and I said, Boris, I dont think you should go back because theyll try and kill you. And he said, I have to go back. I love my country. Upon his return, Nemtsov was shot four times from behind while crossing a bridge near Red Square. He was murdered in the shadow of the Kremlin, McCain said. Two days after Flynn resigned, I visited McCain again at his office. He said Flynns ouster had caused the momentum to shift somewhat in his direction, but he was still grouchy that more Republicans werent onboard. An hour before we met, McConnell had once again told McCain that he wouldnt approve a select committee. Since Congress remains reluctant to hold Trump accountable, McCain said its going to be journalists responsibility to investigate and put pressure on Congress. What will move the needle, he thinks, is whats in the press, McCain said. Theres just too many people out there who have this information. How did this Flynn thing happen? Of course, relying on the press also means relying on those who leak information to the press  a position that puts McCain once again at odds with the president, who has vowed to seek out and punish lowlife leakers. McCain acknowledged that leaks have the potential to do damage to national security. But he made a surprisingly impassioned case for them in an era when truth is hard to come by. In democracies, information should be provided to the American people, McCain said. How else are the American people going to be informed? *This article appears in the February 20, 2017, issue of New York Magazine."}, {"date": "2017/02/17", "title": "More White House Chaos Over Anti-Immigrant Policy Draft", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/more-white-house-chaos-over-anti-immigrant-order-draft.html", "text": " The following episode is brought to you by a White House hastily signing executive orders while waging a war on the press that results in widespread confusion. Friday morning, the Associated Press broke the news, in a tweet, that the Trump administration is considering mobilizing as many as 100,000 National Guard troops to round up unauthorized immigrants. A follow-up story detailed an 11-page draft memo that suggested targeting immigrants in Oregon, Louisiana, California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. During the 2016 campaign, Trump had promised to do something similar. Youre going to have a deportation force, he said in November 2015, during an interview on MSNBC. And youre going to do it humanely and youre going to bring the country  and, frankly, the people, because you have some excellent, wonderful people, some fantastic people that have been here for a long period of time. The AP asked the White House and the Department of Homeland Security for comment about the draft memo. They received none prior to publication, but the White House was quick to condemn the story once it hit Twitter with explosive force  a clever way to perpetuate its narrative that the mainstream media pushes fake news. In true Trump fashion, the White House pushback on the story was a dizzying mix of nonanswers, contradictory denials, and quickly exposed falsehoods. A senior White House official told me it wasnt true that they were considering deploying the National Guard as the AP described. Asked where the story came from, the official said, via text message, Check what we saidI think it was early draft in novemberI will double check. Asked if that meant the White House had included a provision, like the one the AP reported, in a November document, the official said, no, then directed me to DHS and became unresponsive. Meanwhile, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, was talking to the press pool on Marine One. That is 100 percent not true, it is false, it is irresponsible to be saying this, he said. There is no effort at all to round up, to utilize the National Guard to round up illegal immigrants. He added, I wish you guys had asked before you tweeted. (DHS told me they werent aware of having been asked for comment.) The pool report noted that Spicer couldnt categorically state that this was never a subject of discussion somewhere in the administration. He said, I dont know what could potentially be out there, but I know that there is no effort to do what is potentially suggested. He later tweeted, This is not true. DHS also confirms it is 100% false. But contrary to Spicers claim, DHS confirmed the existence of the memo  a version of which was circulated by Time and Vox. David Lapan, the departments spokesman, emailed me to say, the story is inaccurate, but he admitted the memo was very real. We do memos for all kinds of things, he said. The process is the staff would prepare a memo like this, the secretarys name is on it in the draft because ultimately he will approve and sign it when it gets to that pointsome are reporting that because his name is on the memo that he either drafted the memo, authored it or approved it, and none of thats true. Lapan claimed the memo was drafted by staff, but wouldnt specify how senior the staff. This particular draft was an early version that was going through the staff and was not the one that ultimately made it to the secretary, he said. He declined to disclose what iteration of the memo landed on DHS head John Kellys desk. Not yet, because were waiting for the approval, he said. Until he signs it its not done. When President Trump signed a border-security executive order on January 25, Lapan said, the department was tasked with figuring out how to implement it  something he said required a lot of brainstorming and back and forth, which is done through the drafting of memos. He said it wasnt as casual as spitballing, but it was a conversation that went, Okay, heres the presidents order. Heres what he wants us to do. How do we put that into action? What are the types of things that we can do to implement the presidents executive order? If people portray it in a way that makes it sound like the White House somehow drafted this, thats not accurate, Lapan said. But asked if he could say for certain that the memo wasnt written at the direction of, or with input from, the White House, he was at a loss. I dont know, he said. He could say for certain, however, that the White House and DHS communicated this morning as the story broke to figure out, What are you guys saying, what are we saying? He added that the conversation included a question from the White House: Is this true?"}, {"date": "2017/02/17", "title": "Senate Confirms Leading Opponent of Environmental Regulation As Head of the EPA", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/senate-confirms-prominent-opponent-of-epa-as-head-of-epa.html", "text": " Scott Pruitt has long questioned the reality of man-made climate change. As Oklahomas attorney general, he sued the Environmental Protection Agency over its efforts to limit carbon emissions, regulate smog pollution, and safeguard wetlands and streams  that filter into drinking water  against contamination. Pruitt is such a loyal friend to the fossil-fuel industry, he once took a letter decrying fracking regulations  sent to him by the oil company Devon Energy  copied the text of the letter onto Oklahoma government stationery, and mailed it off to the EPA. On Friday afternoon, 52 senators decided that this was a fitting rsum for Americas next head of environmental protection. Every Republican save Susan Collins (and John McCain, who did not vote on the measure) voted to confirm Pruitt, as did (coal-rich) West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin and (oil-rich) North Dakota Democrat Heidi Heitkamp. Democrats had hoped to delay the vote on Pruitts nomination until after next Tuesday, when the Oklahoma attorney generals office will be forced to release 3,000 emails related to Pruitts communications with the fossil-fuel industry. But Republicans were not willing to wait. In their defense, it is hard to imagine what in Pruitts private correspondence could be more disqualifying  or, from the GOPs perspective, more commendable  than the attorney generals long record of fighting to increase water pollution and accelerate climate change. President Trump has made it clear that he expects Pruitt to continue advancing these goals at the EPA. In the coming days, the White House plans to celebrate Pruitts swearing-in with one or more executive orders aimed at undoing Obama-era climate-change policies, the New York Times reports. Pruitts mission at the EPA will not be an effortless one. Already, the agencys civil service is mobilizing against their new boss. Legal constraints bar Pruitt from simply firing any EPA employee who is genuinely committed to environmental protection. Likewise, he will not be able to immediately eliminate all Obama-era regulations. But he will be able to reassign insubordinate civil servants to less desirable roles, and to use his legal expertise to defang existing regulations.

Lets hope Michel was too sick to watch a spectacle that might have confirmed the downward trend in civility  especially in his own party  so many identified as occurring when he was pushed aside just prior to the Republican Revolution of 1994. Michel spent 38 years in Congress representing a central Illinois district. His House career covered all but two years of the four-decade wilderness period when Republicans remained in the minority. While a consistent conservative, Michel learned how to exert influence without real power, in part by respecting ancient traditions of comity and compromise. But by the end of his career, the ideological conquest of the GOP by movement conservatives who viewed comity and compromise as craven terms of surrender had advanced just far enough to make Michels continuation as party leader impossible. And so he retired on the cusp of a House Republican majority  like Moses, given a glimpse of the promised land he could not enter. It was obvious at the time that Michels retirement represented a turning point for his party. Former colleague Mickey Edwards summarized it well even before Michel announced he was giving up his leadership post and his House seat: No, he wasnt, but Newt Gingrich was, and even though Gingrich himself was purged from the House leadership and Congress just a few years after engineering Michels political eclipse, the GOP remains in many respects Newts party, thanks to his relationship with the elephants new master, Donald Trump. Had Michel been younger and stayed around after 1994, he would have eventually gone along with the new extremist style or been purged as a RINO. By all accounts, he was temperamentally incapable of the kind of opposition-demonizing tactics that have long become normal in both parties, but especially in Michels party. There will be many pleasant words of praise for Michel today. House Speaker Paul Ryan paused from his intense efforts to engineer a right-wing agenda through Congress without a single Democratic vote to call the former leader a great and gracious man. While there is no reason to attribute insincerity to Ryan in this instance, he could have no more thrived in the atmosphere of Michels House GOP than Michel could have thrived in Ryans. And now its Ryan who must watch his own back in case the latest breed of angry Republicans decide he is too old-school to lead them."}, {"date": "2017/02/17", "title": "Woman Accused of Assassination Says She Thought It Was a Reality-TV Prank", "url": "http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/02/kim-jong-nam-assassination-suspect-thought-it-was-a-tv-prank.html", "text": " On Monday, Kim Jong-nam  the half-brother of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un  was killed in Malaysias Kuala Lumpur airport.

Basically the entire proceeds of their plan would go to the rich  once its fully phased in, the highest-earning one percent would get 99.6 percent of the benefit, according to the Tax Policy Centers analysis of the plan last fall. Republicans will surely tweak that plan, but it contains all the elements of the ideas they have been longing to enact: reducing the top tax rate, eliminating the tax on inheritances worth more than $10 million, reducing taxes on capital, and so on. The drive to cut these taxes reflects the partys deep beliefs that overtaxation of the rich is the most serious form of oppression in modern political life, and they are prepared to spend enormous political capital to rectify this evil. There is essentially no dissent within the Washington Republican Party  including both Congress or the White House  on this overarching goal. The difficulty lies in the practical implementation. Republicans are struggling because they want to avoid replicating what turned out to be the fatal weakness of the Bush tax cuts. Republicans know that they wont get Democratic support for a big tax cut for the rich, and since Democrats have 48 Senate votes, well more than the 41 needed to sustain a filibuster, Republicans need to pass their tax cuts in a bill that can evade a filibuster. The only kind of bill that can do this is a budget-reconciliation bill. But budget-reconciliation bills have certain restrictions on their design, called the Byrd Rule. One of those restrictions is that they cannot increase the budget deficit outside of the ten-year period after which they are passed. A reconciliation bill can increase deficits in the short run, but if it has any costs after a decade, it can be filibustered, and is therefore useless for Republican purposes. In 2001, Republicans dealt with this problem by simply ending their tax cuts after ten years. The Bush tax cuts had no budget costs after the ten-year window because the tax cuts disappeared. They hoped the tax cuts would attract enough political support that they would automatically be extended, but this never happened. The Bush tax cuts produced an anemic recovery, not the robust growth Republicans promised, and the Democratic Party coalesced around plans to eliminate the portion of the tax cuts that benefited only the highest earners (while keeping intact the tax cuts that also benefited the middle class). Since the tax cuts expired automatically, Democrats did not need to hold a vote to phase them out. Republicans hope to avoid such a fate for the Trump tax cuts. Their hope is to design tax cuts that technically do not lose any revenue, which would allow them to be permanent, and force Democrats to gain control of the House, Senate, and presidency in order to overturn them. How do you design a huge tax cut for rich people without losing a lot of revenue? Republicans are looking at three pots of money to offset the cost: Dynamic scoring, Obamacare taxes, and a border-adjustment tax. Dynamic scoring means taking into account the effect on economic growth caused by cutting taxes. If tax cuts encourage permanently higher growth, it would increase revenue collections, offsetting some of the losses. Republicans believe, as a matter of theology, that the effect is huge. This belief caused them to predict the Clinton tax hikes on the rich would fail to increase revenue, that the Bush tax cuts would lose very little revenue, and that expiring the Bush tax cuts on the rich would cause growth to slow down. That none of these things happened has not diminished the fervor of the Republican faith in the transformative economic power of cutting taxes on the rich. Mainstream economic models find that tax-cut plans like those proposed by Republicans do little or nothing to stimulate growth  the stimulative effects of lower rates are small, and canceled out over the long run by the offsetting depressive impact of higher deficits. Historically, dynamic scoring has always been a talking point: Republicans have insisted that official forecasts are wrong because they fail to use dynamic scoring. In 2015, the GOP Congress ordered the Joint Committee on Taxation, the federal agency that measures the impact of tax changes, to incorporate dynamic scoring. But it seems unlikely that JCT will assume the kinds of yuge dynamic effects that conservative ideologues prefer. The next source of money is repealing Obamacare. The connection between the two issues might seem obscure, but it matters technically. The Republican plan to repeal Obamacare would eliminate all the taxes that were raised to help pay for the benefits  about $1.2 trillion over the next decade. This would lower the baseline of tax revenue, meaning that Republicans would need to design a tax code that raises $1.2 trillion less in revenue in order to be revenue-neutral. That makes it crucial for them to repeal Obamacare before they cut taxes. Obamacare repeal was expected to be a rapid step, already wrapping up by now. Instead it is a quagmire with no end in sight. Of the many reasons the repeal crusade is failing, one of them is that the revenue trick is a little too clever. Some Republicans realize that if they repeal all of Obamacares taxes first, theyll have no way to pay for a replacement plan later. So, as Obamacare bogs down, it has also bogged down what was supposed to be a rapid-fire progression to tax reform. (Budget expert Stan Collender has pointed out that the Republicans have designed an intricate legislative sequence to enact their plans that might collapse altogether.) The third and final source of money was supposed to be a border-adjustment tax. This is a complicated idea that would essentially tax imported goods. The concept has a lot of support among tax experts, at least in theory. The idea has several attractions for the GOP. First, by increasing costs of imported goods and decreasing costs on exports, it would seem to fulfill Trumps promise of an America First trade policy. Second, if designed properly, it would raise another trillion dollars a decade or so. And, because it would function as a kind of sales tax, it would be paid mostly by the middle class and the poor. Essentially, it would free up another trillion dollars for lower taxes to be paid by the rich. This explains why Paul Ryan has evangelized so fervently on behalf of this idea of a border-adjustment tax. It holds the key to his dream of enacting a large, permanent tax cut for the rich. There are, alas, enormous barriers to making Ryans dream a reality. Among American businesses, the border-adjustment tax creates winners and losers. Among the latter are big-box retailers like Walmart. The divide among business lobbyists has produced a divide among Republicans, many of whom loathe the border-adjustment tax. (Leading the opposition is Senator Tom Cotton, who represents Walmarts home state of Arkansas.) Divisive policies often pass Congress. But in this case, Republicans need near-total unanimity, since theyre not going to attract any Democratic votes for a huge tax cut for the rich. Even if they can somehow corral their dissenters, its far from clear the border-adjustment tax would work as promised. Its very unclear that a concept as complex and novel can actually be written into law in the time frame Republicans want. Of course, from the GOPs perspective, the issue isnt whether the tax works but whether it is scored as having worked for the purposes of their budget. But two tax experts I spoke with expressed doubt that Congress can actually write a workable border-adjustment plan that raises the revenue they hope for, even if it wants to. So where does that leave them? Probably in the same place they were in 2001. They could scale back on the tax cuts for the rich, but that would run counter to every impulse within the Republican Party. You will pry the tax cuts for the rich from Paul Ryans cold, dead hands. If Ryans plan fails, the next best thing to passing enormous, permanent tax cuts to the rich is to pass enormous, temporary tax cuts for the rich. If Obamacare repeal and the border-adjustment tax flounder, Congress will probably just go back to what worked (or, if you prefer, worked) 16 years ago. Republicans have control of Congress, and even if nothing else comes out of it and everything else falls part, the richest one percent are going to get paid."}, {"date": "2017/02/17", "title": "Trumps Lavish Lifestyle Is a Drain on Taxpayers  and a Gift to Democrats", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trumps-lavish-lifestyle-is-a-perfect-issue-for-democrats.html", "text": " Americans voted for Donald Trump for a wide variety of terrible reasons. Some thought that the government should be run like a business. Others, that an outsider  any outsider  was more likely to improve their living conditions than an Establishment politician (and/or serial murderer) like Hillary Clinton. A few simply believed that no hardworking, god-fearing American should ever have to hear announcements repeated in Spanish. Among Trump voters most misguided  but, also, most understandable  rationales was that a billionaire would have little temptation to put his own interests above those of the American people. For many Trump backers, the second most beautiful phrase in the English language (after Lock her up) was He cant be bought. The idea that the wealthy are uniquely unsusceptible to bilking taxpayers is one as intuitive as it is baseless. And Trump took full advantage of this flawed folk wisdom: Throughout his campaign, the mogul reiterated the myth that his bid was self-financed  and, thus, that special interests would have no sway over his White House. Whats more, Trumps wealth wouldnt just spare taxpayers the waste, fraud, and abuse that monied interests gift our broken system  it would also save them the cost of employing a president. The first thing Im going to do is tell you that if Im elected president, Im accepting no salary, okay? Trump told a crowd in New Hampshire in 2015. Thats not a big deal for me. The week after his victory, the new president made good on that promise: In his first year in office, Trump will save taxpayers $400,000 by waiving the presidential salary. But while billionaires can afford to turn down a government paycheck, they can also afford to develop a lifestyle that involves flying from one luxury property to another on a whim. And for billionaire presidents, that habit is even more affordable  because American taxpayers foot the bill. Thus, in his first month in office, Trump has cost taxpayers over $15 million. Per the Washington Post: Meanwhile, Melania Trumps decision not to move into the White House with her husband is costing New York City $500,000 a day to guard Trump Tower  a total that could reach $183 million a year. And Palm Beach County is preparing to bill Washington tens of thousands for each day that the president decamps to Mar-a-Lago, as the local government is overwhelmed by the security and traffic-management demands of the presidents (near-weekly) visits. Then, theres the cost of providing round-the-clock security to Trumps adult sons, as they pursue their globe-spanning business interests: U.S. embassy staffers paid nearly $100,000 in hotel-room bills to support Eric Trumps recent trip to Uruguay. Adding insult to taxpayers injury, Trump isnt just enjoying the publics largesse  hes directly profiting from it. To protect Melania and little Barron, the Defense Department and Secret Service are looking to rent space in Trump Tower (where the president will be their landlord). The Obama familys travel expenses cost America an estimated $97 million over eight years  enough to provide Fox News hosts with hours of righteous indignation. The Trump family is on pace to exceed that sum in less than seven months. It is hard to imagine a better issue for Democrats to demagogue. Trump has no shortage of liabilities. But many of liberals favorites are shrouded in complexity: Complain about the presidents contempt for the Emoluments Clause and voters are likely to feel less outraged than confused. The Trump administrations Russia connections are well worth investigating, but the president retains plausible deniability against the most serious charges. And anyhow, its not clear that the whole imbroglio is salient to anyone who isnt already on Team Blue. Trump didnt campaign on his independence from Putin. But he did campaign on the idea that his wealth would save taxpayers money. And now its doing the opposite. This is a story thats as easy to understand as it is to get mad about. Voters are instinctually hostile to the idea that they have to finance the exorbitant costs of presidential vacations  a fact that Trump, himself, is perfectly aware of. Democrats want to paint Trump as a faux populist, who only really cares about himself and his cronies. Thus far, theyve pushed this narrative primarily by highlighting the plutocratic cast of his cabinet picks. This is a worthy endeavor. But it can be countered with the same myth that established Trumps populist bona fides in the first place: that the superrich cant be bought. By contrast, Trump has no easy way of reconciling his budget-busting lifestyle with his populism. There is no way to explain why you need to fly to your resort in Florida every weekend  thereby forcing Floridians to sit in traffic, Palm Beach police to work overtime, and the federal government to spend millions on security  without sounding like a spoiled brat. If Trump really needs a weekend getaway, hes free to take a short helicopter ride to Camp David  a vacation spot designed to accommodate presidential visits with minimum security cost and inconvenience to ordinary Americans. But Trump feels entitled to classier confines. To see how difficult this behavior is to justify, observe White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grishams best effort: He is not vacationing when he goes to Mar-a-Lago, Grisham told the Post. The president works nonstop every day of the week, no matter where he is. A spokesman for Republican senator John Barrasso  a leading critic of Obamas vacation expenses  offered a similar line: Former President Obama flew to Florida for the express purpose of a golf lesson and a round of golf with Tiger Woods. President Trump was in Florida with the prime minister of Japan. These arguments only accentuate the gratuitousness of Trumps travel habits: If hes just going to be working, why cant he just stay in the White House and spare everyone the trouble? It does not benefit the American people to have Trump handle nuclear crises in the Mar-a-Lago ballroom, rather than the Situation Room. It only benefits himself and the resort he profits from. For Democrats, Trumps insatiable appetite for luxury is political gold. They should start mining it."}, {"date": "2017/02/17", "title": "Trump to Name Republican Media Strategist As White House Communications Director", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-to-tap-gop-media-strategist-as-communications-director.html", "text": " Sean Spicer wont have to do two jobs anymore.

And it was, with the proceedings interrup ted by various and sundry protesters, Palestinians and Jews, who expressed unhappiness toward Friedmans famously vociferous views on Middle East affairs and those who disagree with them. Said views were also the focus of senatorial questioning of the bankruptcy lawyer turned would-be diplomat: And those were not even the worst of Friedmans slurs. The worst would probably be his description of American Jews who oppose his right-wing positions on Israeli-Palestinian affairs as worse than kapos  Jews who turned in their fellow Jews in the Nazi death camps. Now Friedman wants senators to disregard all those words because after all they were uttered in the heat of a presidential campaign: Actually, his extremist views predated the presidential campaign, and as the Israeli newspaper Haaretz pointed out, the attacks on liberal Jews continued well after the election. But it is interesting to note that this line of defense is becoming common for the Trump administration. Just yesterday, the Justice Department (in a brief filed with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals notifying judges the administration would release a new travel ban order next week) argued strenuously against judicial consideration of Trumps talk about banning Muslims on the campaign trail in interpreting his actions as president. Candidate Trump was just a private citizen who was exercising his First Amendment rights to express what sure sounded like religious bigotry. Presumably Friedmans profanation of the Holocaust and scurrilous attacks on Americans and Israelis alike would fall under the same exemption for campaign demagoguery. While Friedman had plenty of time to prepare his so sorry about the demagoguery defense, he had to be more nimble in dealing with the fallout from Trumps strange remarks during his press conference earlier this week with Bibi Netanyahu. As you may recall, Trump seemed to express shrugging indifference to the central question of pursuing a one-state or two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Friedman retracted his prior violent opposition to the two-state solution that has been the cornerstone of U.S. policy for decades, but wisely hedged his bets. Who knows what Trump really meant, or what he will say next on this topic? But even though Trump complicated his intended envoys confirmation hearing with his latest comments, he more than made up for it by completely diverting attention from the Friedman event with his own 80-minute press conference.

The decision to throw in the towel and try again was formalized by a Justice Department filing with the Ninth Circuit that reiterated the administrations arguments against an easier ruling by a three-judge panel refusing to reinstate the ban, but indicated the president intends in the near future to rescind the order and replace it with a new, substantially revised executive order to eliminate what the panel erroneously thought were constitutional concerns. That means Trumps legal beagles have decided against appealing the ruling to the full Ninth Circuit or to the U.S. Supreme Court. And in fact, a new version of the sloppily drafted original order could avoid some of the flaws the courts earlier identified. The most obvious revision will be to exclude people with permanent resident status from the ban, which the White House tried to do by a clarification that had no legally binding power. But the new order could also make special provisions for other categories of otherwise excluded noncitizens who might obtain standing to challenge it on due process grounds, such as students and faculty currently at U.S. colleges and universities (the primary basis for the state challenges to the ban that gave rise to the order District Court Judge James Robart issued freezing it). One problem the administration cannot, however, avoid with a do-over is the legal effect of the presidents (and his advisers) remarks during the 2016 campaign that they wanted to impose a ban on entry to the United States of Muslims, a pretty blatantly unconstitutional aspiration. The Ninth Circuit panel held that those remarks did in fact create legitimate doubts about the constitutionality of the order on grounds of religious discrimination, though it did not reach a conclusion on the subject. The Justice Departments latest filing argued adamantly against consideration of statements made when Trump was a private citizen. Couched in legalese, the Justice Department is basically saying that campaign promises cannot be used to interpret a presidents actions in a way that restricts his national security powers. Its unlikely the Ninth Circuit (which has suspended its review of the case pending the new order) would agree. But more than likely the administration is anticipating an ultimate Supreme Court review of this issue once the new order is released and litigation resumes. So there is plenty of legal maneuvering ahead, likely punctuated with more explosions of rage at the judiciary from Donald Trump."}, {"date": "2017/02/17", "title": "Donald Trump Thinks Hes Good at Being President", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/donald-trump-thinks-hes-good-at-being-president.html", "text": " Donald Trumps disorienting, surreal press conference contained one moment of pristine clarity, when the president predicted, Tomorrow, the headlines are going to be, Donald Trump rants and raves. This prediction, while quite correct, raises the question of why Trump thought it was a good idea to hold a media event whose principal effect would be to produce headlines depicting him as rambling and unhinged. Reports from the administration have supplied the answer, which is quite simple: His boasts spring from a place of utter, self-delusional conviction. Trump, reports Mike Allen, truly believes this had been the best start to a presidency in history, and no one around would ever disagree to his face. The New York Times has the same account, with more detail. For days, a frustrated and simmering president fumed inside the West Wing residence about what aides said he saw as his staffs inadequate defense and the ineffectiveness of his own tweets, it reports. Over the objections of some top advisers who wanted to steer him away from confrontation, Mr. Trump demanded to face the media, determined to reject the narrative that his administration is sinking into chaos, scandal and incompetence. Almost all of Trumps planned remarks expressed some version of this single belief. I dont think theres ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what weve done, he insisted. (This is not even close to true: Barack Obamas first month had vastly larger and more consequential policy changes.) Trump boasted, again, of the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan. (In fact, it was merely the biggest Electoral College win since  Obama in 2012.) He twice cited a Rasmussen poll, which just has me through the roof  Rasmussen being a conservative messaging firm that is not considered reliable by real pollsters. He glommed onto other factoids that had crossed into his view and confirmed his self-confidence. The stock market is up! Hes expecting a big crowd for his weekend rally! Trump is not a data person. He is an anecdote person. And these anecdotes all support his sense of dizzying triumph. He had assembled one of the great cabinets ever assembled in American history. You look at Rex Tillerson. Hes out there negotiating right now. One can easily see how, to a mind like Trumps, the report that the secretary of State he appointed is already out in the world negotiating would imply progress and fill him with satisfaction. It may be normal for a secretary of State to negotiate with other leaders, but it is not normal to Trump. It is new and exciting. It is the sort of development that would allow him to overlook details like the man he asked to serve as national security adviser  after he had to fire his last national security adviser for lying to his vice-president and the FBI  had turned him down in humiliating and public fashion. Or that six of his staffers had to be dismissed for failing background checks, or that Tillerson is conducting his negotiations from a sanitarium because nobody booked him a room in time with the other world leaders. Trump, as many have noted, is the worlds highest-profile case of the Dunning-Kruger effect, which is the phenomenon by which incompetent people are unable to gauge their own competence. Of course, Trump is not bereft of talent. He mastered the technique of using the media to raise his profile, flooding the news with arresting quotes and tidbits and scandal, turning the ordinary heir to a real-estate portfolio into Americas most famous rich person  a branding triumph that he leveraged into a lucrative licensing operation, some outright swindles, and, most crucially, a television show in which he played a brilliant executive. All the evidence suggests Trump truly believes he is the character he plays on television. And now that he is surrounded by courtiers and the trappings of power, and constantly flattered by powerful people who are secretly terrified of his incompetence, he is convinced of it more deeply than he ever has been before.

Why on Earth would any campaign for president be in constant, secret touch with the intelligence agents of a hostile foreign power? I cannot know. Maybe Flynn is a rogue loner. Its also possible, I guess, that the Trump campaign just wanted to keep in touch with the intelligence services of one of this countrys nemeses, if only to wish them Merry Christmas  five times in one day. Its also conceivable that Trumps former campaign chair Paul Manaforts deep ties to the Putin regime were utterly irrelevant to the sudden amendment, this past summer, to the GOP party platform that removed a call to send arms to Ukraine. Its also possible, I suppose, that deep down Im straight. But theres one explanation that chills me even more than a foreign powers potential blackmail over an American president. And it is that Trump and Putin are natural allies in their fight against the postwar, U.S.-led international order that has kept the peace for 70 years. Putin and Trump, after all, share a Bannonite foreign policy: a robust defense of nationalism; a view that NATO is obsolete; support for far-right parties throughout Europe; and the goal of smashing the European Union so that Russia can once again extend its tentacles into Eastern Europe, and the U.S. can play one European power off another. I have no idea if Putin has kompromat on the president, but Trumps actions need no such motivation. Trump and Putin want to form a pincer movement to destroy what we have known for a long time as the West. Their domestic politics also have disturbing parallels. Trump would love nothing more, it seems to me, than to be an American Putin, treating the country as he long treated his own corporate fiefdom. He once explained he admired the autocrat because Putin has great control over his country. Like Putin, Trump would love to control the media. Like Putin, he has developed a leadership cult, devoted to the masses. Like Putin, he believes in a government that has killers. Like Putin, he threatens his geographic neighbors. Like Putin, he has cultivated an alliance of convenience with reactionary religious conservatives, to shore up his power. Like Putin, he believes theres no moral difference between American democracy and Russias. Like Putin, he is enriching himself by public office. And, like Putin, he has targeted a minority as a scapegoat  Putin targeted the gays to gin up support while Trump targets the Muslims and Mexicans. And as Putin has RT as his conduit, so Trump has the Murdoch empire. I feel like I know Stephen Miller, the youthful Montgomery Burns who lectured the lgenpresse last Sunday morning in his charm-free Stakhanovite baritone. I feel like I know him because I used to be a little like him. Hes a classic type: a rather dour right-of-center kid whose conservatism was radicalized by lefties in the educational system. No, Im not blaming liberals for Millers grim fanaticism. I am noting merely that right-of-center students are often mocked, isolated, and anathematized on campus, and their response is often, sadly, a doubling down on whatever it is that progressives hate. Before too long, they start adopting brattish and obnoxious positions  just to tick off their SJW peers and teachers. After a while, youre not so much arguing for conservatism as against leftism, and eventually the issues fade and only the hate remains. Think of it in some way as reactionary camp. Think Ingraham and Coulter and Yiannopoulos. They are reactionaries in the classic sense: Their performance-art politics are almost entirely a reaction to the suffocating leftism that they had to endure as they rose through the American education system. As a young, lonely conservative in college, I now wince at recalling, I threw a Champagne party to welcome Reagans cruise missiles to Britain. Of course I knew better  and could have made a decent argument for deterrence instead of behaving like a brattish dick. But I didnt. I wanted to annoy and disrupt the smugness around me. If you never mature, this pose can soon become your actual personality  especially when you realize that it can also be extremely lucrative in the conservative-media industrial complex. I think of Ann Coulter, whom I met recently, backstage at Bill Mahers show. What struck me was her sincerity, searing intelligence, and grasp of the facts. In another universe, she could have become a reasoned defender of a sane conservatism. Instead she ended up writing In Trump We Trust. In exactly the same way, Miller really is a product of Santa Monica and Duke  their living, breathing, raving antibody. Steve Bannon, on the other hand, is quite something. Ive read and reread his 2014 speech at the Vatican to see if I can find any coherence in it, and I confess I failed. Its a hodgepodge of melodrama, hysteria, and a defense of some kind of enlightened capitalism along Judeo-Christian lines, in the face of an imminent Islamist takeover of the planet. Its the 1950s versus jihad, an attempt to convey the gist of the entire Drudge Report every day and turn it into a thesis. He argues that we are just at the very beginning stages of a global conflict that could eradicate 2,000 years of Western civilization. It reads like the apocalyptic, paranoid fantasies of someone who writes letters to the editor, single-spaced, in all caps. Now go check out this Vice journalists impression of Bannon in 2014. It does not reassure: Hes buzzing with intensity, with two pens clipped to his shirt collar. Over the next 90 minutes, he barely touched his food and never took off his coat. He just prattles endlessly and manically on. Among the gems that emerge from the conversation: Ebola requires a massive immigration crackdown or were all going to die; ISIS is plotting to assassinate the Pope; and then this calm overview: The world is in a meltdown right now. I mean, the world is on fire. And all of a sudden its going to dawn on people, this is not a problem for guys in the Middle East. This is a problem for you in Kansas City. You begin to realize that he called himself a Leninist for a reason. It took me a while to get into HBOs The Young Pope. I kept waiting for it to have a relationship with some believable version of reality  and then a kangaroo kept bouncing around the Vatican. At first I couldnt understand what was metaphor and what was plot, what was dream and what was supposed to be real, what was a miracle and what wasnt. In the first few episodes, the Trump analogy  of an unhinged novice accidentally finding himself in a position of supreme power  did the unforgivable thing of failing to distract me from the anxiety besieging Washington. But if you let the series just lull you into acceptance, its themes are powerful. The filmmakers understand how attractive the most rigid orthodoxy can be for the young. Abandoned by hippie parents as a boy, Jude Laws youthful Pius XIII insists that the Church needs to turn inward and embrace mystery and fear and obedience again. Hes Benedict XVI with charisma. His vestments twinkle and shimmer; the slippers remain ruby-red; and the full papal regalia is only slightly mitigated by the Holy Fathers inspired chain-smoking. He starts out as a vindictive, sadistic, and arrogant narcissist acting out his deeply buried childhood traumas (can we ever get away from Trump?). But he is also, the series slowly reveals, some kind of a saint. His prayer is like a controlled seizure of concentration. He performs quite astounding miracles. And in time, people of the modern secular world, at first repelled, find themselves drawn to him, smiles on their faces, relieved at last to be in the presence of divine authority, any authority that can make sense of their world. Ive often wondered if saints are actually like that: not holy in a conventional sense, and certainly not nice  but often unpleasant, antisocial misfits who are only subsequently seen for what they truly were. Do you remember the days when president Obama predicted that at some point in his presidency, the Republican fever would break? It never did of course. If anything, it kept getting worse  from birtherism to jeopardizing the U.S.s credit rating to Benghazi and then those fricking emails. But it occurs to me that the fever could only really break if the Republicans were no longer in opposition and were actually confronted with the difficult project of running the country. Yes, I know weve been hoping for this for years, chasing phantasms as the crazy gets crazier, but could the fever be finally breaking right now? The Republican bases talk-radio politics, their Breitbart alternative facts, their railing constantly about Obamas various alleged iniquities  none of that is enough to actually govern. But that is all they have known for so long. At some point, the Republicans are going to have to raise the debt limit; they are going to have to pay for the wall; theyll have to replace the ACA with, well, er, something quite fabulous. They have no excuses anymore, after all. And yet, lo and behold, they seem paralyzed. Legislatively, they are at a standstill, and the ACA endures and becomes more popular. There is no magic cure for bringing back blue-collar jobs. They will surely divide over tariffs. Even tax reform could be a liability if it isnt directed at those low-earning core Republican voters, rather than Trumps fellow plutocrats (and good luck with that). All the rabid rhetoric against Obamas essentially moderate policies, in other words, is beginning to dissipate into thin air. Yes, they can deregulate. Yes, they could borrow even more to goose the economy. But its going to be fumes before too long.

The latter issue was remedied on Thursday when Christie described his lunch at the White House this week, which involved President Trump informing him that he would have the meatloaf. Christie described the incident on the Boomer and Carton sports radio show, where hes a frequent guest. Christie explained that, when asked how to order food at the White House, Trump pointed everyone else to the menu, but gave him special instructions. This is what its like to be with Trump, Christie said. He says, Theres the menu, you guys order whatever you want. And then he says, Chris, you and I are going to have the meatloaf. He tells you what youre eating? co-host Craig Carton asked. Yeah, and I said, Were going to have the meatloaf? Christie answered. And he said, Im telling you, the meatloaf is fabulous. Carton said its emasculating to let another man tell you what youre eating, but the governor protested that its different when youre dining with the president of the United States. The guy eats there all the time, and the meatloaf was good, he said. Now my wife didnt go with the meatloaf but he didnt suggest the meatloaf to my wife, Christie noted.

Its unclear if Flynns sanctions talk violates an obscure law banning private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments, but lying about it to the FBI is definitely a felony offense. So why is CNN reporting that the FBI isnt expected to pursue charges against Flynn? It appears Flynn may avoid legal trouble thanks to his faulty memory, and misunderstanding of what sanctions means. According to CNN, during a January 24 interview with the FBI, Flynn backtracked when pressed on whether he discussed sanctions. Interviewers believe he was legitimately unsure of what he said: Flynn used the same tactic when responding to the February 9 Washington Post story that revealed he discussed sanctions during the calls. When asked if the topic came up, he initially said no twice. Then a spokesman walked that back saying Flynn indicated that while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he couldnt be certain that the topic never came up. The Post reported on Thursday that several officials said it would be difficult to bring a case against Flynn for misleading the FBI because he might parse the meaning of the word sanctions. In an interview with the Daily Caller hours before his resignation, Flynn insisted that he merely discussed reviewing the Obama administrations expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats, not sanctions. The expulsion of the alleged Russian intelligence operatives was part of the sanctions package imposed over Russias suspected meddling in the U.S. election. From the Daily Caller: Flynn said in his resignation letter that he inadvertently gave Vice-President-elect Mike Pence and others incomplete information about his calls with the Russian ambassador. But apparently Trump is less forgiving of Flynns memory troubles than the FBI  even though the White House has maintained that theres nothing wrong with Flynn talking sanctions with Russia before he was sworn in. At Thursdays press conference, President Trump said Flynn had to go because he either lied or misremembered the perfectly appropriate topics that were discussed with the Russian ambassador when he was briefing Pence. The White House has yet to clarify why President Trump only decided Flynn had to go when the story went public, since hed known that Flynn gave Pence an inaccurate account for two weeks before that. Vague as it is, Trumps defense of Flynn is the strongest indicator that the exnational security adviser wont face charges. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has the final say over prosecutions by the Justice Department, and it seems unlikely that hed charge Flynn over Trumps objections. Still, Flynns troubles might not be over. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes initially suggested he was only interested in probing the intelligence communitys leaks regarding Flynn, not their content. But on Thursday Nunes signaled that hes open to expanding the House Intelligence Committees ongoing probe of Russias election interference to include other allegations about the Trump teams contacts with Russia. Democratic senators Dianne Feinstein and Mark Warner, who are both on the Senate Intelligence Committee, praised Chairman Richard Buff for proceeding very aggressively with their corresponding probe. The House Oversight Committee is also looking into Flynns activities, with chairman Jason Chaffetz joining Representative Elijah Cummings, the committees ranking Democrat, in requesting more information on Flynns 2015 trip to Moscow. Cummings also revealed on Thursday that the first Republican, Representative, Walter Jones, has signed on to a bill backed by all Democrats to establish an independent commission to investigate all of the allegations surrounding Russias involvement in the U.S. election and ties to the Trump campaign. Hopefully this is going to open the door, and some Republicans will begin to join us on that, Cummings told MSNBC."}, {"date": "2017/02/17", "title": "Trumps Pick to Replace Flynn as National Security Adviser Turns Down the Job", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trumps-pick-to-replace-flynn-turns-down-job.html", "text": " In an unusual move for President Trump, his pick to replace ousted national security adviser Michael Flynn wasnt alarming. Retired Vice-Admiral Robert Harward is a former Navy SEAL who previously served as Defense Secretary James Mattiss deputy when he led U.S. Central Command. Under another administration, people might care that Harward is currently a senior executive at the defense contractor Lockheed Martin, but hed be replacing an official who espoused a number of Islamophobic beliefs and had possibly illegal chats with the Russian ambassador. Under Flynn, the National Security Council was reportedly understaffed and dysfunctional, but it looked like Harward might bring some stability. However, it seems Harward is also too stable to want any part of the Trump team. The administration had been wooing Harward even before Flynn resigned, but following two meetings at the White House, he announced on Thursday evening that hed turned down the offer. Since retiring, I have the opportunity to address financial and family issues that would have been challenging in this position, Harward said in a statement. Like all service members understand, and live, this job requires 24 hours a day, seven days a week focus and commitment to do it right. I currently could not make that commitment. My thoughts and prayers are with those that carry such heavy burdens and responsibility for taking care of our countrys national security concerns. God bless this great country of ours. Sources told the Washington Post that in addition to family and financial concerns, Harward was put off because the White House wouldnt guarantee that he could select his own staff. A person familiar with Harwards thinking told Politico that he was concerned by the unwillingness of White House political team to be deferential to the White House national security team and unwillingness of [the] White House political team to be malleable.

Ambulances were also in short supply, forcing people to find private cars to get to the hospital, reports NBC News. The attack, in Sehwan, northeast of Karachi, is one of Pakistans deadliest attacks in recent years, and the worst of 2017. ISIS took credit on Amag, its news service, for the blast. The terrorist group has targeted Sufis before, considering their sect of Islam heretical. This shrine bombing also comes after a bloody week in Pakistan, which saw smaller-scale attacks claimed by both ISIS and the Taliban, reports the BBC.

He then spent 76 minutes ranting about the medias dishonesty; touting his historically successful first month in office (and ever-increasing popularity); bragging about his singular lack of hatred for Jewish people; and, occasionally, answering a reporters question. Here are the ten most interesting things weve learned from President Trumps first solo press conference: 1. Trump did not instruct Michael Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador while Obama was still president  but he would have, if hed thought of it. This week, the president parted ways with his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn. The retired general had become enveloped in controversy due to his (arguably illegal) contacts with Russian officials. The most widely discussed of these contacts was a phone conversation Flynn had had with Russias ambassador to the United States on December 29  the day that the Obama administration had expelled Russian diplomats from America, as punishment for the Kremlins (alleged) meddling in the 2016 election. The day after Flynns phone call, Vladimir Putin announced that his government would not be taking retaliatory measures against American diplomats, despite previous reports to the contrary. Flynn later claimed that he had not spoken about sanctions with the Russian ambassador. Which makes sense: doing so would have almost certainly been a violation of federal law. Multiple members of the Trump administration, including Vice-President Mike Pence, backed up Flynns claim. Then, Americas intelligence agencies discovered that Flynn had lied. Weeks later, so did readers of the Washington Post. Days later, Flynn was gone  but not because the president saw anything wrong with Flynns phone call. Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries, and his counterparts, Trump said, when asked if he had directed Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador. I didnt direct him, but I would have directed him, because thats his job. Violations of the Logan Act are fine. Misleading Mike Pence is not. So goes the official White House spin on Flynns departure. 2. Trump isnt certain that no one on his campaign was in contact with Russian intelligence operatives. 3. The leaks about the Trump administration are real. But the news stories written about those leaks are fake. Trump has argued that intelligence agencies really are leaking sensitive information about his administration. But he has also maintained that reports based on those leaks are fake news. Asked to resolve this contradiction, Trump replied: 4. The president believes that committing an act of war against Russia would be a surefire way of increasing his political approval ratings. 5. Trump is unable to discern when he is ranting and raving. 6. You can trust President Trump  because when he says false things, hes merely reciting the information that he has been given. The president claimed that his Electoral College victory was the largest since Ronald Reagans. It is among the smallest. NBCs Peter Alexander pointed this out to Trump. He then asked why Americans should trust Trump, when the president says demonstrably false things. I was given that information, Trump replied. Ive seen that information around. 7. One of Trumps major takeaways from his intelligence briefings is that nuclear holocaust would be like no other.And I can tell you one thing about a briefing that were allowed to say, the president said, nuclear holocaust would be like no other. 8. President Trump is the least anti-Semitic person youve ever seen in your entire life. Also, he thinks that a lot of alleged acts of anti-Jewish intimidation are really just false-flag operations cooked up by his enemies. This declaration came after a Jewish reporter asked President Trump about recent threats made against 48 Jewish community centers across America. (The reporter specifically said that he did not intend to suggest that Trump was personally anti-Semitic). After assuring the reporter that he has less animus toward Jews than anyone else (including, ostensibly, all Jews), the president argued that no one has been committing anti-Semitic acts in his name  and that reports to the contrary are, in fact, false flags. Some of the signs youll see are not put up by the people that love or like Donald Trump, theyre put up by the other side and you think its like playing it straight? the president said. Theyll do signs and theyll do drawings that are inappropriate. It wont be my people. It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you. 9. President Trump is the least racist person. Also, he assumes that black reporters are probably friends with black members of Congress. Minutes after declaring himself the least racist person in existence, Trump took a question from American Urban Radio Networks D.C. bureau chief, April Ryan. Ryan asked if Trump planned to seek the advice of the CBC when crafting his urban agenda. The president was confused. Ryan explained that she was referring to the Congressional Black Caucus. Do you want to set up the meeting? Are they friends of yours? Trump asked the African-American journalist. No, Im just a reporter, Ryan said. Set up a meeting, the president interrupted. I would love to meet with the Congressional Black Caucus. 10. Trump misses Crooked Hillary.According to the New York Times transcript, the president said the word Hillary 12 times during his press conference. The 2016 campaign has been over for 99 days."}, {"date": "2017/02/16", "title": "The Wildest Moments From Donald Trumps Press Conference", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/the-wildest-moments-from-donald-trumps-press-conference.html", "text": "  Dont worry.

To journalists accustomed to the traditional presidential press conference, it was an interminable violation of all the rules  not just of presidential-media relations, but of grammar, logic, decorum, and even political common sense. Trump brought up, unbidden, his own past mistakes in order to fulminate about how they were covered months ago. He changed subjects constantly and unpredictably, beginning with the fact that the whole thing began as an announcement of his new Labor Secretary nominee, Alexander Acosta, but soon went far, far afield and never returned. He insulted members of the working press before, during, and after their questions; he suggested one African-American reporter set up a meeting for him with the Congressional Black Caucus because he assumed they were probably your friends. And just when one outrage concluded, another began, world without end. Here was Politicos take: What seems plain in retrospect is that Trump has no intention, at least at present, to use presidential press conferences the way his predecessors have employed them: to convey information to the American people via the media, sometimes despite the medias efforts to impose an uncongenial interpretation on the intended message. Presidents have varied in their skill at this game; some, most famously Richard Nixon, descended into an openly antagonistic relationship with journalists; virtually all the others have on occasion played favorites or punished disfavored reporters or outlets by denying access. But nobody until now has used a press conference to send one basic message over and over: With a few exceptions the people in this room are all lying scoundrels and you should not believe a word they say. Because that was Trumps message: Every grievance he could dredge up, dating back to the ups and downs of the campaign trail, found its way into his tongue-lashing of the media today. And that is why he by no means came across as the fearful Nixonian pol grudgingly giving his media enemies as little time as possible for questioning after his opening remarks, and then getting out of the room with as little damage as possible. As Trump said, he was enjoying the whole spectacle, and extended it again and again. And why not? If his goal was to convince his supporters that the media is their, as well as his, sworn enemy, then the longer he baited reporters and the longer they responded with obvious chagrin and efforts to pin him down, the more he succeeded. Had it gone on all day, it would have just reinforced the vast gap between his world and that of the people his senior counsel Stephen Bannon calls the opposition party. According to that faithful channeler of white working-class Trump fans, Salena Zito, it worked: Working journalists are, of course, left wondering how to deal with the role Trump has assigned them as cartoon villains who deploy facts and logic to try to trip up the man who is just too wily to play their malicious game. It is hard to change the behavior of a politician who craves media criticism the more the better  the way a wino craves cheap muscatel. The fact that he acts genuinely aggrieved at such criticism even as he courts it  and for all we know, his alleged pain may even be genuine  makes it all the harder to treat him normally. Perhaps the most important thing to happen at todays press conference is that respectable Republicans in Washington and elsewhere had to be at least disturbed a bit by the spectacle, which no one could imagine any prior Republican president since Nixon, and probably not even the Tricky One, producing. At some point they will have to ask themselves exactly how much damage to traditional politics and government they are willing to accept in exchange for cutting taxes, criminalizing abortion, or giving the people who own most of the country relief from regulations."}, {"date": "2017/02/16", "title": "Report: Border Officials Will Push Trump Away from Wall, Toward a Fence", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/report-officials-to-push-trump-away-from-wall-toward-fence.html", "text": " The big, beautiful wall that President Trump has promised to put on the border between the U.S. and Mexico will be more of a fence if officials from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) get their way.

The plan being most seriously considered at this point, CNN learned, is one that adds 177 miles of new fencing to the 654 miles that already exists, meaning 831 miles of the roughly 2,000-mile border would have a barrier. Importantly, that barrier would not be a wall. Im not calling it a wall, because we are talking about a fence that we can look through. Thats what we need, one Border Patrol official told CNN. Another official who prefers a fence to a wall said, you never want to have a barrier in place that will obstruct your vision, that prevents you from seeing the other side of the border. That may be a tough sell for Trump, who in January scolded a reporter for calling his border barrier a fence. Its not a fence, its a wall, he said.

In less than two weeks, Donald Trump is scheduled to address a joint session of Congress. Nobody expects him to have a formal budget by then (indeed, some have predicted he wont submit one this year at all). But Trump urgently does need to give Congress and the public some clear indications of his budgets broad outlines, and consequently what he will and will not accept in the way of an appropriations bill, a debt-limit extension, and most of all the two massive budget-reconciliation bills planned for this year, with the first one (repealing Obamacare) due imminently. This not the kind of information the president can convey by Twitter or the sort of vague, contradictory assertions of sound policies and responsible budgets he made during the campaign, the transition, or the early days of his administration. He needs hard revenue and spending estimates instantly. Thats Mulvaneys job. Unfortunately, the new OMB director will begin this insanely difficult task with a skeleton staff at the policy-making level, as Politico explains: But there are bigger problems Mulvaney cannot address by burning the midnight oil or even getting fully staffed up: the vast differences of opinion on basic fiscal matters between him and his new boss, which were by no means resolved in his confirmation hearings. Hes an old-school red-ink-hating deficit hawk; its not clear Trump even cares about deficits. Hes an entitlement reformer; Trump is not. He thinks the Pentagon should continue to exist under firm spending caps; Trump wants to boost defense spending right away no matter what. More basically, Mulvaney shows signs of believing in basic budgetary arithmetic, while the 45th president of the United States will very likely tell him to add 2 and 2 and get 8. These manifest and multiple differences are what led one leading budget expert, Stan Collender, to predict that Mulvaney will either repudiate his own views, change Trumps, or leave the job very early on. As he looks at the weeks just ahead, Mulvaney may even wish he had not been confirmed."}, {"date": "2017/02/16", "title": "Kremlin Tells State Media to Cut Back on Pro-Trump Propaganda", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/kremlin-tells-state-media-to-cut-the-pro-trump-propaganda.html", "text": " The United States just elected a president who campaigned on his antipathy for NATO and admiration for Vladimir Putin. His secretary of State is a longtime opponent of sanctions on Russian energy  and the 2012 recipient of Moscows Order of Friendship. High-ranking White House officials have evinced more hostility for the European Union than Russias expansion into Ukraine. And the Kremlin is starting to see the wisdom behind the phrase, be careful what you wish for. This week, Putin ordered state media networks to drastically scale back their fawning coverage of Trump, according to Kremlin insiders who spoke with Bloomberg. The move reportedly reflects a growing concern among senior Russian officials that the new U.S. administration will be less friendly than first thought. And theres good reason for such concern: Far from reducing anti-Putin sentiment in U.S. politics, Trumps rise  and suspicions of Russian involvement therein  has radically increased the salience of Americas geopolitical conflicts with Moscow on Capitol Hill. Now, the firing of Michael Flynn  amid suspicions that the national security adviser undermined the Obama administrations most recent sanctions against Russia  raises the specter that Trump might rebrand himself as an anti-Kremlin hawk. After all, the mogul has always been more of an opportunist than ideologue, and taking a hard line on Russia would give him distance from a growing scandal, while firming up his support among Senate Republicans. A recent presidential tweet on Putins seizure of Crimea did not mitigate such fears. Separately, Moscow may also be worried about Trumps impact on its own domestic politics. Trump is an unusually unpopular American president in America, but hes a uniquely beloved one in Russia. And much like their counterparts in our country, Russian news networks cant get enough of the reality-star-in-chief: Last month, Trump received more mentions in Russian media than Putin did. For the first time since returning to the Kremlin in 2012, the Russian president was only the second-most-talked-about man in his country. This development may threaten more than just Putins ego. For one thing, Trumps popularity makes it more difficult for the Russian regime to channel the frustration of its citizens into anti-Americanism. For another, Trumps nationalism and Euroskepticism may be useful to Putin  but his rhetoric about rigged systems and the need for change very much isnt. There are a number of globalist elites in Putins inner circle, as Foreign Policy notes. And some of Trumps most popular TV segments in Russia, according to Bloomberg, involve his calls to drain the swamp of such figures. Few authoritarian regimes go out of their way to amplify the rhetoric of anti-establishment demagogues. Its probably wise for Putins to stop being the exception."}, {"date": "2017/02/16", "title": "Trump Says Hes the Least Racist (and Anti-Semitic) Person Youve Ever Seen", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-im-the-least-racist-and-anti-semitic-person-ever.html", "text": " On Thursday, the president of the United States called himself the the least anti-Semitic person that youve ever seen in your entire life, and, also, the least racist person.

Acosta, the son of Cuban-American immigrants and a double Harvard grad who clerked for Samuel Alito when the future SCOTUS Justice was on the U.S. Court of Appeals, was chosen from a short list that included three figures who would have been far more controvesial: career union-basher and former South Carolina secretary of Labor Catherine Templeton; immigration critic and civil-rights contrarian Peter Kirsanow; and under-credentialed Trump adviser Joseph Guzman. Trumps choice would give his cabinet its first Latino member. But perhaps Acostas most important quality is that hes repeatedly been confirmed by the Senate for previous positions. What jumps out at you about Acostas rsum is that its mostly not focused on the labor-law responsibilities of the job he has been nominated to fill. But he did briefly serve on the National Labor Relations Board as a recess appointment of George W. Bush, who was also Acostas patron for his high-ranking Justice Department positions. Acosta mostly stayed out of trouble in the politically sensitive (especially in a Republican administration) civil-rights division job, though he was accused of silent complicity with overt politicization of hiring decisions at the Justice Department, and with intervening on behalf of Ohio Republicans who were seeking to challenge the qualification of minority voters. As U.S. Attorney for South Florida, Acostas public profile was raised significantly as he prosecuted famous scofflaws like Jack Abramoff and various drug-cartel members. What is unknown about Acosta is how he feels about the nexus of immigration and labor conditions for American workers, the issue that probably did more to torpedo Puzder (or certainly to undermine administration support for him) than any other. Theres already one eyebrow-raiser for the Bannon wing of the Trump movement in Acostas background: 2011 Senate testimony supporting protection of civil rights for American Muslims. I suspect all sorts of assurances will quietly be made to Trumps core supporters on such issues. All other things being equal, Cuban-Americans are held in less suspicion than other Latinos among conservatives because they are perceived as having little direct stake in immigration policy. For the time being, though, in a week when Trump has lost a national security adviser and a cabinet nominee, the key thing is that Acosta looks like a conventional conservative who, so far as we know, has never been accused of beating his spouse or hiring an undocumented immigrant or leering at supermodels that hes employed to eat burgers in a lascivious manner.

My decision to oppose this nomination is not about one person. It is not about one cabinet position. This is not personal. This is not political.

The #DayWithoutImmigrants was designed to underscore just how much the countrys economy is dependent on immigrant workers, and it coincides with a surge in immigration raids in several states. Dozens of restaurants and chains in the nations capital announced theyd be closed or operating with limited hours Thursday, and at least two D.C. schools will reportedly be closed. Other businesses in cities such as Philadelphia, New York, Houston, and Raleigh, North Carolina, will also close in solidarity with their employees, and activists are reportedly planning a march on the Capitol at noon. Who we work with is our family, and this is a cause that really speaks to a large part of our family, said Matt McQuilkin, director of operations at a D.C. pizza chain that closed three of its four locations to show solidarity with staff who chose not to work. We felt that this was the best way to support that cause. Andy Shallal, an Iraqi-American restauranteur, told ThinkProgress that he hopes the protests affect real change. We hope that the attention we draw to this issue will help us move forward on true immigration reform that isnt just about building a wall or hiring more security guards, he said. That it will really be about true reform that takes into account the human aspect of immigration. Last week, federal agents raided homes and workplaces in multiple states and arrested hundreds of undocumented immigrants, although authorities say the raids were planned before Trump started signing executive orders. Under President Obama, immigrants with criminal backgrounds were targeted for deportation, but last month Trump signed an executive order that prioritized anyone and everyone in the country illegally. So far at least two high-profile cases have highlighted the plight of immigrants in the Trump era: one in which a mother whod been in the country for 20 years was arrested and deported, and one in which a domestic violence victim was arrested at a courthouse in Texas."}, {"date": "2017/02/16", "title": "Tillerson Takes First Official Trip Abroad, Meets With Russian Counterpart", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/tillerson-goes-abroad-meets-with-russian-counterpart.html", "text": " Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is finally getting a taste of international diplomacy this week, in Bonn, Germany, as he makes his first official trip abroad to meet with various foreign ministers from the G20 countries.

But hey, that may be unfair. There is one area where theres a lot of excitement in the air about new construction and new jobs: in the private prison industry! And thats not just because the president appears generally to enjoy incarcerating people, or because he strongly rejected the plans of both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton to end the practice of warehousing criminals in for-profit facilities. No, theres a real-live boom under way for private prison companies thanks to Trumps early executive order calling for an expansion of detention centers for undocumented immigrants near the U.S.-Mexico border. Overshadowed by the chaotically implemented and soon-stalled travel ban, Trumps border-enforcement order is being implemented. And among other things, thats meant happy days are here again for private prisons, as explained by Jenny Jarvie of the Los Angeles Times, who went to South Texas and felt the excitement: Whether or not unemployed South Texas workers get their low-wage correctional jobs back, the companies that could be hiring them are already tasting sweet success: Already two-thirds of the people being detained by federal immigration officials are housed in facilities run by private for-profit contractors. If  as appears very likely  detentions swell along with deportations under Trump, well likely see a return and most probably an exacerbation of past incidents of poor conditions. At the Willacy County facility Jarvie visited, horror stories abounded even before inmates burned the place down: And now the very company that ran Willacy then is seeking to reopen it, even though they are being sued by the county government for damages associated with its abysmal management of the facility. Will negative publicity over such problems convince the Trump administration to slow down its drive to detain immigrants, or rely less on for-profit goals? Its possible. But to the extent this administration appears to be pursuing a strategy of encouraging mass self-deportation of undocumented immigrants, word-of-mouth reports of brutal conditions in detention centers could be exactly what it wants."}, {"date": "2017/02/16", "title": "How the White House Lies: What Jonathan Swift Has to Say About Kellyanne Conway", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/how-kellyanne-conway-and-sean-spicer-get-away-with-lying.html", "text": " Were putting conundrums on top of hypotheticals on top of conjecture here. We take it all very seriously, but I think were having the same conversation seven different ways, respectfully, and ignoring all the other things that the national security adviser, president, the vice-president, and this administration are doing together, Kellyanne Conway said on February 13 to MSNBCs Steve Kornacki. At issue was the phone chatter between Michael Flynn and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak and whether they talked about sanction relief in the late days of the Obama administration, but really Conway could have been talking about any of the things she goes on television to talk about because she was using her three favorite rhetorical tactics. First, she casts doubt on the verifiable reality of the question at hand, painting the attempt to get at the truth as a Sisyphean task; then paints herself as the polite and respectful one, implying that her interlocutor is the one violating codes of civility; and finally claiming that the reporter is ignoring the days real events of substance, in this case the presidents meetings with Shinzo Abe and Justin Trudeau as well as phone calls with heads of state from South Africa to Nigeria. In the end, the administration is always the victim along with the hardworking disenfranchised American families who are being denied heralding of its good works on their behalf. Except, by the end of the day, Flynn had resigned. It would be exciting to be able to trace a lineage for the language of the Trump administration from the modernists through deconstructions destabilizing of the text, but the truth is, Conway & Co. engage so much in the simple act of lying that there are simpler models at hand, like Jonathan Swifts The Art of Political Lying or Herman Melvilles The Confidence-Man. As the administration grinds into its second month, Trumps flacks have made increasing use of a variation of Bartlebys I would prefer not to: I cant speak to that. Or, as I like to translate it, I havent prepared any lies to respond to that question. The irony of Flynns termination is that he was fired for lying while working in a house full of liars. Among Swifts requirements of a good political liar are that he ought to have but a short memory, that he be ready and willing to swear to both sides of a contradiction, and that he never consider whether any proposition were true or false, but whether it were convenient for the present minute or company to affirm or deny it. The listener, faced with such a liar, is best served by abandoning any effort at verification or interpretation or sorting the true from the false: [T]he only remedy is to suppose that you have heard some inarticulate sounds, without any meaning at all. Unfortunately, that doesnt work on Twitter. Of course, some statements are plainly untrue without quite being lies. For these we have Princeton philosopher Harry Frankfurts 2005 treatise On Bullshit and its great forebear, Max Blacks The Prevalence of Humbug. This is how Black defined humbug: deceptive misrepresentation, short of lying, especially by pretentious word or deed, of somebodys own thoughts, feelings, or attitudes. The administration set an early standard for humbug with Press Secretary Sean Spicers first press conference, which took place two days after the Womans March, on January 21. This is what makes our country so beautiful is that on one day you can inaugurate a president, on the next day people can occupy the same space to protest something, Spicer said. But [the president] is also cognizant to the fact that a lot of these people were there to protest an issue of concern to them and not against anything. This is pure bullshit, in that by virtue of the fungibility of a lot it falls short of being a lie because its nonfalsifiable. Its simply in pure violation of common sense. Of course all the protesters were against something: the president. Perhaps there were a lot of other people there, too, T-shirt hawkers, Christian preachers who turn up wherever theres a crowd, or Nazis waiting to get punched  I mean, white nationalists waiting to get punched. (Whats the difference again?) Spicers pretentious initial patriotic avowal and the twisted syntax of cognizant to the fact are tells that he probably doesnt believe what hes saying: He hates the protesters and he knows there were hundreds of thousands of them and that he was at that instant becoming a national laughingstock. You get the sense with Spicer that his own awareness that hes bullshitting (not very convincingly) at his bosss behest is the reason for his hostility to the reporters in the room. (You have been part of the confusion! he told a reporter for NBC News during the ban is not a ban briefing mocked by Saturday Night Live.) Conway seems to take pleasure in her evasions, and their boss seems to believe many of the false things he says. It must have been hard for Spicer the day after the inauguration to perform the postmodern two-step of denying that the crowds could be quantified and then asserting that they were the biggest ever. Hes been a flack for two decades and must be used to having jobs that put him in closer proximity to the truth or required him to spread misinformation that was harder to expose. He also seems ill-adapted to the age of social media. When asked about the presidents tweets about Nordstroms dropping Ivanka Trumps clothing line and his contrasting Twitter silence about the attack on the Quebec City mosque, Spicer leaned on his own statements almost two weeks earlier, expressing sympathy on the presidents behalf, to suggest that his comment had put the matter of Trumps sympathies entirely to bed. Youre equating me addressing the nation here and a tweet? Thats the silliest thing Ive ever heard. This is what your therapist calls projection: @realdonaldtrump is the pure product, digitally mainlined to his base; Spicer, with his constant assertions that Trump isnt doing anything different than Thomas Jefferson or Barack Obama did before him, is a pawn placed between Glenn Thrush and the facts. Spicers predicament is absurd. Equating Trump and Obama isnt the sort of move that White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller would make. He eschews the evasions and projections of Conway and Spicer in favor of pure zealotry, in a style true to his roots as a high-school debater and teenage right-wing talk-radio pundit. [W]e have a president who has done more in three weeks than most presidents have done in an entire administration, Miller told George Stephanopoulos in deflecting a question about Nordstrom, Kmart, and Sears dumping Ivanka. This is an instance of bullshit that stops short of lying if for done more you substitute inspired more protests. Millers preferred rhetorical moves are absolutist:  Sean Spicer, as always, is 100 percent correct and that what he said is true and important. And I agree with it. George, it is a fact and you will not deny it  And Im prepared to go on any show, anywhere, anytime, and repeat it and say the president of the United States is correct 100 percent. Here, the speakers enthusiasm and willingness to repeat the assertion (of voter fraud in New Hampshire, but it could be anything) stand in for evidence, and Millers 100 percent catchphrase masquerades as a quantifiable truth claim. But Millers more dangerous rhetoric falls outside the realm of bullshit and instead takes the form of a false binary: This is an ideological disagreement between those who believe we should have borders and should have controls and those who believe there should be no borders and no controls. Miller is a passionate nativist, and here hes groping toward the sort of argument about structural injustice we usually hear from the left, whether from feminists, civil-rights activists, or anti-interventionists. In denying that between his proposed poles of intolerance and borderlessness theres a substantial constituency who would favor both a secure border and humane treatment of the undocumented, he lacks a convincing term for the pervasive, impersonal power of his opponents, along the lines of patriarchy, white supremacy, or the military industrial complex. When he and his colleagues come up with something better than globalist elites, those on the side of moderation will be faced with something harder to beat than bullshit. *This article appears in the February 20, 2017, issue of New York Magazine.

By the end of the day, the Washington Post had published a story that led to  or perhaps just expedited  the firing of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. And just as that news cycle was winding down on Tuesday, another story emerged alleging that members of the Trump campaign had extensive contact with Russia. A New York Times report on Wednesday night shed some light on why members of the intelligence community might want such information to be public (aside from their alarm over the possibility of the U.S. government being compromised by Russia, and the chaos within the Trump administration). Administration officials tell the paper that President Trump is planning to put Cerberus Capital Management co-founder Stephen Feinberg  a billionaire Trump ally with no experience in national security matters  in charge of a broad review of the intelligence agencies. This plan has been met with fierce resistance from the intelligence community, whose members are worried that this could curtail their independence and reduce the flow of information that contradicts the presidents worldview, according to the Times. Feinbergs job would be based in the White House, and he has close ties to two top Trump aides, Stephen Bannon and Jared Kushner. They reportedly considered Feinberg for director of national intelligence or chief of the Central Intelligence Agencys clandestine service  two roles that usually go to career intelligence officers  and some are worried that hes being groomed to eventually take over a top intelligence position. Reuters actually broke this news last Thursday, reporting that Feinberg was being considered to review the intelligence community and recommend ways to streamline the 17 agencies. The story drew little attention because it was published as the Post reported that nine current and former intelligence officials said intercepted communications showed Flynn discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador. Over the weekend, the controversy intensified as more details emerged about the calls and Flynns alleged mismanagement of the National Security Council. (The president transforming the Mar-a-Lago patio into an open-air situation room did not help matters.) On Monday evening, the Post reported that the Trump administration was warned that Flynn may be vulnerable to Russian blackmail, and a short time later the White House said hed resigned. Of course, President Trumps issues with the intelligence community began long before Reuters revealed that a review was in the works. During a speech at CIA headquarters on his first full day in office, Trump accused the dishonest media of making it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community. As fact checkers noted, hed actually spent months refusing to accept the intelligence communitys findings on Russian meddling in the U.S. election. When pressed on the matter, Trump suggested U.S. intelligence officials cant be trusted because they were wrong about Saddam Husseins weapons of mass destruction, he appeared to side with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange against them, and he compared their tactics to those used by the Nazis. Following Flynns firing, Trump lashed out at the intelligence community again, tweeting on Monday night, The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by intelligence like candy. Very un-American! The fears of leaking go both ways. The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that U.S. intelligence officials have withheld sensitive information from the president because they are worried that it could be compromised. (Both the White House and the Office of Director of National Intelligence denied this.) Sources told the Journal that no key information about security threats has been withheld, but Trump may not get the full picture: Its unclear if President Trump would want this information anyway. In keeping with his reported fondness for one-page memos with bullet points, the Journal says, Intelligence agencies have been told to dramatically pare down the presidents daily intelligence briefing, both the number of topics and how much information is described under each topic. And Ashley Dejean of Mother Jones obtained a classified memo explicitly instructing the staffers who prepare the daily briefing to do it in a very specific, straightforward way. The guidance states that analysts should only include facts that support their analyses, and it explains that topics presented in the PDB will not be covered from different perspectives in separate briefings, she writes. That means that dissenting or conflicting views might not be presented to Trump. This lack of trust, including the withholding of information from the president and politically motivated leaks, should be concerning to everyone. The Trump administration may be the target now, but obviously misleading disclosures didnt do Democrats any good before November 8. However, President Trump is trying to make his newfound concern about leaking  and not staggering allegations of Russian attempts to influence the U.S. election on his behalf  the sole takeaway from the Flynn debacle. Some congressional Republicans are following President Trumps lead. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte sent a letter to the Justice Departments inspector general on Wednesday demanding an immediate investigation into the leaks about Flynn, citing serious concerns about the potential inadequate protection of classified information. But other members of Congress vowed that Flynn and other alleged ties between Russia and the Trump campaign will get a thorough investigation  even if those efforts fall short of the independent commission some Democrats were pushing for. The House and Senate intelligence committees are already investigating Russias alleged election interference, and the Post reports Democrats have settled for demanding that those probes are thorough and wide-ranging. Democrats are also calling for the FBI to continue its investigation, and the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee have jointly requested a briefing on what led to Flynns resignation. Thanks to the renewed attention from leaks in recent days, if someone were to try to curtail the intelligence agencies probes into Russias involvement with the Trump campaign, plenty of people would notice.

The White House did not comment on Puzders withdrawal, and his statement offered no explanation. He said he was honored to have been considered, adding, While I wont be serving in the administration, I fully support the President and his highly qualified team. Puzder apparently pulled out because his confirmation was in serious jeopardy for multiple reasons. He was always one of the more vulnerable Trump nominees because he did not just offend left-of-center people who thought it was perverse to name a notorious labor-law scofflaw to serve as the alleged defender of American workers. You did not, after all, have to be especially liberal to be irritated by the highly porcine series of HardeesCarls Jr. ads featuring beautiful women eating burgers in bikinis, as the fast-food mogul lovingly put it. When it came out recently that Puzder once employed an undocumented immigrant as a housekeeper  a mistake that had sunk past cabinet nominees going back to the Clinton administration  his status grew even shakier. And then, just this week, senators were treated to clips of Puzders ex-wife alleging domestic abuse and threats of revenge on a 1990 Oprah Winfrey special (allegations she has since repudiated). Four Republican senators were not yet onboard with Puzders nomination yesterday; then two more  including leadership member John Thune  expressed reservations, while no Democrats were defecting to save him. Perhaps the coup de grace today came from a most unexpected direction. The editors of the venerable conservative magazine National Review came out against Puzders confirmation on grounds that his past support for comprehensive immigration reform makes him an inappropriate cabinet member for Trump. What makes that attack odd is that more vocally anti-immigration conservatives seems to have made their peace with Puzder. That wasnt the case initially. The very day Trump announced his appointment, breitbart.com published a piece denouncing him for views diametrically opposed to Trumps signature issues on trade and immigration  which won him the election. The author was  you guessed it  immigration obsessive Julia Hahn, who was soon to join former boss Stephen Bannon in the Trump White House. Soon, however, Breitbart fell strangely silent about Puzder. Then in late January, the publication suddenly went strongly anti-anti-Puzder, with two Lee Stranahan pieces about the desperate opposition to the nominee from unions and other godless lefties. Nestled between them was a puffy endorsement of Puzder as an alleged equal-opportunity champion by conservative warhorse Allen Webster. The most recent Stranahan article gloried in Puzders sexist rep, crediting him with a brilliant marketing campaign featuring racy ads that the joyless brats on the left are now savaging him for. Oink-oink. All in all, its been a bad week for the Breitbartians. Fresh from being openly scolded by former chairman Stephen Bannon for spreading rumors that Trump loyalists were ready to dump Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, now the fiery nativists have missed the boat entirely on an opportunity to purge an amnesty lover who was indeed on the road to Palookaville. As for Puzder, he can now go back to his private-sector preoccupations of selling burgers, hassling workers, and debasing women.

Despite its strong Republican history (it was represented in the 1990s by Newt Gingrich, and Price never won less than 60 percent there), the sixth is one of those districts Democrats think they can pick off because its packed with college-educated voters who hold Donald Trump in minimum high regard. Indeed, Trump only carried the sixth by one percent last November. But as a large field assembles for the special election (a jungle primary in which the top two finishers regardless of party will proceed to a runoff, except in the unlikely event someone wins a majority the first time around), the early front-runner is a Republican with a strong local and national profile: former Georgia secretary of state Karen Handel. Nationally, Handel is best known as the former Susan G. Komen For the Cure executive who engineered a ban on funding for Planned Parenthood in 2012. The action was reversed and Handel resigned, becoming an instant icon of the anti-abortion movement (she quickly produced a book on her martyrdom entitled Planned Bullyhood). Back home, Handel has been an intermittently successful pol, chairing the Fulton County Commission (one of the counties in the sixth) and being elected secretary of state in 2006, before narrowly losing a gubernatorial runoff to Nathan Deal in 2010 (ironically, hostility to her from anti-abortion hardliners was a factor) and then finishing a close third in the U.S. Senate primary in 2014. In all her races, north metro Atlanta was her electoral base. A very early poll of the sixth taken in December after Price was nominated by Trump showed Handel with far more support than any other named prospect, though over half the respondents were undecided. Handel has ten Republican rivals (qualifying ended today), though she dodged a bullet when the HHS secretarys wife, state representative Betty Price, decided against a run. Two formidable former state senators are in the race: Judson Hill, who will likely do well as a rare candidate from the Cobb County portion of the district, and Dan Moody, who is close to U.S. Senator David Perdue and his cousin, former governor (and Trump Agriculture secretary nominee) Sonny Perdue. Moody has personal wealth and at least an indirect claim to the support of Trump loyalists via the Perdues. But other candidates are signing up Trump activists quickly, and one, Bruce LeVell, is a bit of a Trump apprentice, having headed up the moguls diversity coalition during the 2016 campaign. For Democrats, everything depends on making the almost-certain runoff, and that means minimizing intraparty competition. The best known of five Democrats in the race is former state senator Ron Slotin, a longtime stalwart of Atlantas Jewish community whose last run for office was an unsuccessful effort to topple the fiery anti-Zionist congresswoman Cynthia McKinney back in 1996. But theres a newcomer who has quickly emerged as the most viable Democrat in the race: 29-year-old former congressional staffer and investigative filmmaker Jon Ossoff. Hes been phenomenally successful in online fundraising for the race, and has been endorsed by fifth-district representative John Lewis and fourth-district representative Hank Johnson. The best hope for Ossoff or any other Democrat is to make the runoff and hope that the eventual Republican survivor is bloodied by internecine warfare. The biggest problem is that Democratic turnout in Georgia special elections  and really any sort of runoff  has been abysmal. Thats likely why local political analysts do not seem remotely as bullish as their national counterparts on the donkeys odds of swiping the sixth. Having said that, if the Trump administrations next two months are anything like its first, the prospect of an early referendum on Trump to smite the 45th president could generate enough money and other resources to break the mold, and enough attention to get Democrats to the polls who would otherwise never show up. But for right now, its the GOPs race to lose."}, {"date": "2017/02/16", "title": "ICE Arrests Domestic-Violence Victim at Texas Courthouse", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/ice-arrests-domestic-violence-victim-at-texas-courthouse.html", "text": " Last week, an undocumented immigrant was arrested at the courthouse in El Paso, Texas, just after she was granted a protective order for domestic abuse. KVIA reports that the alleged abuser called U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to let them know his ex would be at the courthouse. A criminal complaint filed on February 9 says that the woman was arrested outside the courthouse, but El Paso County attorney Jo Anne Bernal says there were six ICE agents waiting for her inside the building. The complaint says that the woman has been deported six times since 2010, following arrests for crimes including false imprisonment, assault, domestic violence, and possession of stolen mail. She is currently held at the El Paso County Jail under a federal ICE detainer. Her alleged abuser is serving a prison sentence for forgery of a financial document. Bernal told the El Paso Times that her office cooperates with federal agents on serious criminal cases, but ICE should not be picking people up outside protective-order courts. She and other county officials are worried that news of the arrest will prevent other victims from coming forward. Our clients come to us at the lowest point in their lives, said Bernal, whose office represents domestic abuse victims seeking court protection from their abusers. Many of them are so frightened of coming to us because of possible immigration concerns. Undocumented immigrants fears are heightened following a nationwide surge in ICE raids that saw hundreds arrested last week. ICE said the targeted enforcement actions were planned before President Trump took office, but he just issued an executive order that expanded the definition of whos considered a priority for deportation to the point that it could cover any undocumented immigrant. Last weeks actions included the deportation of an Arizona mother of two American teenagers, who had been convicted of using a fake Social Security number at work, and the arrest of a 23-year-old in Washington state who had been granted protection from deportation under the Obama administrations Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. An ICE spokesperson claimed that hes a self-admitted gang member. On Wednesday, Jeanette Vizguerra, an undocumented immigrant whose three young children are American, said she is taking sanctuary in Denver, Colorados First Unitarian Church to avoid deportation. ICE has turned down her request for a stay of deportation, but under federal policy agents are supposed to avoid churches and other sensitive locations.

But in recent years, hes spoken more favorably of a state minus option  one that would provide Palestinians some limited form of autonomy while maintaining Israeli security control over the West Bank. Thus, Trumps unprecedented openness to a peace agreement that denied Palestinian aspirations for sovereignty was (almost certainly) welcome news to Israels prime minister. Israel has no better ally than the United States, and I want to assure you the United States has no better ally than Israel, Netanyahu said at the joint presser. Our alliance has been remarkably strong, but under your leadership, Im confident that well get even stronger. Still, not everything the president said was music to Bibis ears. After abrading the Obama administration for allowing the United Nations to condemn Israeli settlement expansion, Trump has grown markedly less enthusiastic about the settler project since taking office. Id like to see you pull back on settlements for a little bit, Trump told Netanyahu in front of reporters, just before they sat down for talks. Reuters writes that Netanyahu appeared startled at this request. The Israeli prime minister made no commitment to curb settlements, and explained that settlement expansion was not the core of the conflict. Rather, Netanyahu insisted that Palestinian hate was the central problem. Palestinian leaders werent thrilled by these sentiments, nor by Trumps refusal to insist on two states. If the Trump administration rejects this policy it would be destroying the chances for peace and undermining American interests, standing and credibility abroad, Hanan Ashrawi, a senior member of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said in a statement. Accommodating the most extreme and irresponsible elements in Israel and in the White House is no way to make responsible foreign policy. In the long run, its far from clear that the abandonment of the two-state solution would serve the interests of Zionist Israelis. Once the dream of two states for two peoples is forfeited, the choice will be between either a single state, where Jewish political control is secured via apartheid  or a single, democratic state, where Jews, in the long run, would be a minority. Trumps America may be comfortable abetting the first option. But tomorrows American electorate will be more multiracial, cosmopolitan, and  if current attitudes hold  sympathetic to the Palestinian cause than todays is. It is hard to imagine that the government they elect will be a reliable supporter of an undemocratic Greater Israel."}, {"date": "2017/02/15", "title": "What the Kremlin Thinks About Trump Campaign Ties to Russian Intelligence", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/kremlin-responds-to-trump-ties-to-russian-intelligence.html", "text": " Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov did not go so far as calling the New York Times report that members of Trumps campaign had repeated contact with Russian intelligence officials before the presidential election fake news, but he did say its a newspaper report which is not based on any facts.

Perhaps there is some information, who these people are, when it happened, Peskov also told reporters. Maybe the time will come and somebody will tell about it openly. Lets wait for this time. While waiting for that somebody, it should be noted that on Friday, Peskov denied that former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and the Russian ambassador to the United States discussed lifting sanctions during the phone call, according to Reuters. Russias Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov also mentioned back in November, after the election that the Russian embassy reached out to the Trump campaign as part of routine outreach. The Russias foreign ministry reiterated that message Wednesday. Russian representatives, Russian diplomats were doing the work that is prescribed to them not only by Moscow, said spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, but that is a normal practice for diplomats of all countries. She added: This information proves again that there is a large-scale political game inside the American politics.

This is because the latter are more likely to vote, and their votes are more likely to be influential. The Senate and Electoral College give disproportionate power to rural areas  while the tendency of millennials (and other left-leaning constituencies) to cluster in urban centers ends up wasting Democratic votes in deep blue congressional districts, thereby diluting their influence in the House. This goes a ways toward explaining why Congress is controlled by a party that only about 20 percent of 18-to-29-year-olds approve of, while the White House is occupied by a man that two-thirds of the demographic abhors. But the logic of consumer capitalism provides young urbanites with a consolation prize: While they have disproportionately weak influence over the policies of their government, they enjoy disproportionately strong influence over the messaging of their brands. This is because city-dwelling millennials are more likely to try new products than your average elderly person in rural America  and the formers brand loyalty is more coveted, since they are less likely to die soon. The fact that Americas most influential voters  and its most influential consumers  have diametrically opposed political inclinations has put corporate America in a bit of a bind. On the one hand, companies generally like to stay in the White Houses good graces, since federal policy can impact their bottom lines. And this objective seems especially compelling when the president is a loud-mouthed celebrity who uses his bully pulpit to abrade brands that displease him, and praise those that flatter his self-image. On the other hand, the best way to alienate the nations most desirable consumer demographic is to associate your brand with the embodiment of all that they long to #resist. In the immediate aftermath of Trumps election, liberal pundits fretted over the implications of the former incentive. And for good reason: Trump spent his first weeks as president-elect bullying a series of private companies into amplifying his message. After Trump castigated Boeing for giving the government a bad deal on the new Air Force One, the defense contractors CEO praised the moguls business head-set, and vowed to cut the planes production costs. Meanwhile, other companies scrambled to shield themselves from Trumps protectionist tirades by reframing months-old expansion plans as direct responses to his election. But in the weeks since Trumps inauguration, the presidents toxicity with urban millennials (a.k.a. cool America) has proven more salient to marketing departments than the threat of his Twitter tantrums. This fact was unmistakable on Super Bowl Sunday: When Americans tuned into the corporate-propaganda championships, the message they received was much closer to Stronger Together than America First. Whether companies were selling cola, tires, short-term lodging, or terrible beer, all seemed anxious to express their love of immigrants and a multi-ethnic conception of American identity. Some of these spots inspired talk of boycotts from red America. But, at least from Budweisers perspective, the benefits of flattering urban millenials political views outweighed the costs. Per Bloomberg: Days after the Super Bowl, the president established that, for certain brands, his public opprobrium functions as a coveted endorsement. After news broke that Nordstrom had dropped Ivanka Trumps fashion line, her father scolded the company on Twitter  and its stock promptly increased in value. Further, some companies that initially struck a friendly stance toward the administration have quickly found such a position untenable. The uproar kicked off by Trumps travel ban forced Ubers Travis Kalanick to ditch the presidents business advisory board. Meanwhile, Under Armour CEO Kevin Planks praise of Trump was promptly rebuked by consumers; and then by his companys own celebrity endorsers; and then by Wall Street. This week, an analyst with Susquehanna International Group cut his target stock price for Under Armour from $24 down to $14, explaining that when Plank described Trump as a great asset for America, he made it nearly impossible to effectively build a cool urban lifestyle brand in the foreseeable future. None of this is to suggest that much of corporate America doesnt smile behind closed doors on unified Republican rule. Nor, for that matter, do all brands feel comfortable counter-messaging Trumpism in public. On November 10, Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi landed her company on Trumpists boycott lists by saying of Election Night, Our employees were all crying and the questions that theyre asking, especially those who are not white, Are we safe? Women are asking, Are we safe? LGBT people are asking, Are we safe? Since then, Nooyi has refrained from publicly criticizing the president  while joining his Strategic and Policy Forum. Still, Trumps historic unpopularity among the young  particularly those with metropolitan addresses and college diplomas  limits the extent to which corporations can openly partner with his administration. So, while millennials cant count on enjoying student debt relief, more affordable health care, stronger workplace protections, or a sane climate policy any time soon, they can rest assured: Trump wont stop your favorite brands from staying woke."}, {"date": "2017/02/15", "title": "Trump to Celebrate Rough Week With Florida Rally on Saturday", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-to-celebrate-rough-week-with-florida-rally-on-saturday.html", "text": " An airplane hangar in Melbourne, Florida, will be the site of Donald Trumps first rally as president.

Beyond Harwards current association with a defense contractor (whose bottom line could, ostensibly, be impacted by his national-security advice) theres little cause for alarm on his rsum. Or, at least, his CV contains less conspicuous cause for alarm than Michael Fear of Muslims is rational Flynns once did. Harward has long-standing ties to Defense Secretary James Mattis, whos seen as a relative moderate on Trumps national security team. When Mattis led U.S. Central Command, Harward was his deputy. The Rhode Island native attended school in Tehran before the Iranian Revolution, and served on the National Security Council under George W. Bush.

We are getting ripped off by every country in NATO, where they pay virtually nothing, most of them. And were paying the majority of the costs, he said last March. But while Trump has called NATO obsolete, Mattis praised the alliance as a fundamental bedrock for the United States and for all the trans-Atlantic community. In further contrast with his boss, Mattis also called Russia out by name, chiding the nation for using force to alter the borders of one of its sovereign neighbors. The calls for NATO members to increase their defense spending are not new. President Obamas Defense Secretaries, Robert Gates, Chuck Hagel, and Ash Carter, all pushed for more spending to strengthen NATO.

The 2020 trial heat from Politicos polling partner Morning Consult is a two-trick pony: It matches Donald Trump against a generic (i.e., unnamed) Democrat, whom he trails 35/43, and against Senator Elizabeth Warren, whom he leads 42/36. The numbers lead Politicos Jake Sherman to the doubly dubious conclusion that Democrats could be in trouble  and Trump could triumph  if they continue their lurch to the left. This assumes Democrats are currently engaged in some sort of lurch to the left, a very Trumpian construction of events, and that Warren is perceived as some sort of crazy lefty. Truth is, Warren is not remotely as well known as is Trump; in a separate question in this poll, we learn that over a third of respondents have no opinion of Warren  16 percent have never even heard of her. The name-ID gap is almost certainly a better explanation of the preference gap between Trump and Warren than any ideological imputation. It is also not unusual for a generic candidate to do better than a named candidate in this sort of poll; it was a regular feature in polls matching named and unnamed Republicans against Hillary Clinton going into 2016. So theres a lot less than meets the eye in this survey, particularly since it did not offer any comparisons to the performance of Democrats that Jake Sherman thinks do not represent some lurch to the left. Its never good for a universally known incumbent to poll so far under 50 percent, but then again, Donald Trump will have a tolerably long time to improve or degrade his position. In some much less premature polling in the same survey, Morning Consult finds that Presidents Calvin Coolidge and Willam H. Taft have nearly identical approval/disapproval ratios. The taciturn Coolidge comes in at 32/15, and the rotund Taft is at 32/14. Like Elizabeth Warren, these former presidents suffer from a high percentage of people who have no opinion of them.

Not So Much.", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trumps-going-to-erase-obamas-legacy-overnight-yeah.html", "text": " A major theme of my book, perhaps the central one, is that a fixation on all sides with fleeting short-term events obscured the breadth and depth of the transformative change wrought by the Obama administration. Large and even revolutionary policy changes received little attention because they were not attached to whatever political drama had captured the attention of the political media, and those game-changing dramas, in turn, frequently had little or no ultimate importance. That same fixation with immediacy has continued to color our perception of Obama since he departed. Donald Trumps election is the most compelling and immediate story in American politics, and correctly so, but its drama has caused Obamas presidency to be refracted through the lens of Trump. What does Trump tell us about Obama? What does Obama tell us about Trump? The easy assumption since November has been that Trump would rapidly erase Obamas legacy. Obamas legacy is toast, gloated conservative commentators. That conclusion, reached immediately in the wake of the election, has continued to form the entirety of right-wing thought about Obama. Trump won, ergo, everything Obama did is gone, close the books. Ben Domenechs review of Audacity for National Review takes the premise that Obamas legacy is toast as so obviously correct it requires no substantiation. Domenech begins with some mockery about how the book arrive[d] just as its central thesis is dashed against the sharp rocks of reality, and that it has the unfortunate distinction of having gone on sale 72 hours before Donald J. Trump took the oath of office, rendering it utterly irrelevant as anything but a cultural artifact demonstrating the hubris of American liberalism. From there Domenech pays little attention to the books argument that Obama accomplished large-scale change, and none whatsoever to its case that most of that change will likely survive Trump. Domenechs review was available online less than two weeks after Trump took the oath of office. It appears in the print edition of National Review, which means  given the schedule of print magazines  it was almost certainly written mostly or entirely before Trump took office, allowing Domenechs argument to treat Trumps imminent vanquishing of the Obama legacy as a certainty. But the events of the last month have already suggested a very different outcome. Obamas measures to prevent a second Great Depression after the 2008 financial crisis  the stimulus, the stress tests of the banks, and auto bailout  are safe from Trump by definition. The Dodd-Frank financial reforms will be temporarily weakened through lax enforcement, just as labor, environmental, campaign, and other regulations conservatives disapprove of are typically weakened during Republican administrations. But Republicans do not have anywhere close to the 60 votes they need to wipe Dodd-Frank off the books. Obamas education reforms are likely safe as well. Republicans promised Trump would immediately pull out of the Paris climate agreement and destroy Obamas environmental strategy. But Trump hasnt pulled out yet, a delay that implies he is at least considering the domestic and international blowback such a move would provoke. He has certainly handed out a series of favors to the fossil-fuel industry, the latest enabling American oil companies to bribe foreign governments. Were bringing back jobs, big league, he announced. Were bringing them back at the plant level. Were bringing them back at the mine level. But, as I argued in the book, both the green-energy revolution that Obama helped set out, and the international diplomatic consensus in favor of limiting climate change he helped assemble have a life of their own. Rather than use Trumps election as an excuse to renege on their own commitments, world leaders insisted after the election their agreement was irreversible. Trump will slow down the pace of the green-energy transformation, but he has neither the inclination nor the ability to destroy the changes of the last eight years. Over the last few weeks, two of the largest coal-fired power plants have announced plans to shut down. The Republican indictment of Obamas energy policies revolved around the failure of Solyndra, a solar firm that received a $585 million loan as part of the $90 billion green-energy investment in the stimulus. Solyndra became a symbol of Obamas alleged failure not because anything untoward took place to allow it to receive a loan  it was once considered a cutting-edge firm and had been selected for a smaller-scale loan under the Bush administration  but because other solar firms that also got support from the stimulus quickly out-innovated it. The old conservative mental image of green energy as an unaffordable hippie daydream is hopelessly quaint, in a world where the cost of solar has plunged 85 percent, and wind 66 percent, since the stimulus, and these technologies now produce energy for less than coal. Since 2008, wind power has more than quadrupled, and solar-power capacity has increased 4,000 percent. Battery-storage technology is a crucial factor to the greening of both the electric power sector and the transportation sector. Affordable batteries are the key component to making electric cars cost-competitive with the gasoline-powered kind. And battery storage is an enormous factor in allowing renewable energy to completely displace fossil fuels. Solar and wind power can already generate electricity more cheaply than coal, but battery storage is necessary for those sources to replace the need for fossil-fuel power when the sun isnt shining and the wind isnt blowing. The price of advanced batteries has fallen by more than half in the last three years alone: And the Republican notion that subsidizing an infant industry violates the principles of a free economy, and amounts to crony capitalism, has been utterly abandoned in the face of an administration where the president uses his office for self-enrichment and White House employees literally use their office to gin up customers for his family business. And then there is Obamacare repeal, the Holy Grail of the quest to erase Obamas legacy. My book argues that Obamacare will be difficult to repeal  by bringing 20 million previously uninsured Americans into the system, Republicans can no longer ignore them. Events since its publication have borne out that analysis. Republicans have promised to replace the law with a plan that has lower deductibles and premiums and better choices. A plan like that would require spending more money than Obamacare, and Republicans are coming face-to-face with the reality that theres no mechanism to finance such a plan that their party could support. (Conservative intellectuals support cutting or eliminating the tax deduction for employer-sponsored insurance, which would work in theory, except its massively unpopular with voters, lobbyists, and members of Congress in both parties.) Financing the alternative plan is the largest obstacle facing Republicans, but hardly the only one. There are innumerable problems that must be resolved  whether to keep the Medicaid expansion, whether to defund Planned Parenthood, whether to repeal Obamacares taxes, and on and on. Republicans have to find near unanimity on every single one of them in order to pass a bill out of both chambers of Congress. They have resolved none of them so far. Republicans in Congress have made no more progress in developing a partywide alternative in the three and a half months since the election than they made in the seven years before that. Their only options are to keep the current system, or some version thereof, or inflict cruelty upon millions and massive disruption to an industry that accounts for a fifth of the economy. I would say its not that easy to repeal it, concedes Representative Peter King. The entire repeal is in mortal danger, admits Representative Trent Franks. Republican messaging heavily emphasized the notion that Obama governed largely through the issuing of executive orders, which supposedly left his agenda vulnerable to a quick reversal. Trump has illustrated how fallacious that notion was. The new president has issued a flurry of executive orders, but  with the exception of the immigration order, which was a fiasco  these orders have mostly been symbolic vehicles for communicating goals, rather than actual policy changes. The notion that Obamas presidency could and would be erased with a few strokes of the pen was a form of Republican propaganda that Republicans themselves came to believe. Conservatives took Trumps grandiose rhetoric about repealing Obamacare and replacing it with something terrific, or bringing back coal jobs, at face value because they wanted to believe it. (Many despondent liberals yielded to the same conclusion out of characteristic fatalism.) But one of the lessons gained from a close study of Obamas presidency, or any presidency, is that governing is hard. The reforms his domestic policies have wrought do not come easy. Even a highly competent Republican presidency would have difficulty unwinding them. And Trump has shown no signs so far of being even a minimally competent president. The expectation of a rapid erasure of Obamas presidency looks like  to pick a clich I read somewhere  hubris dashed against the sharp rocks of reality."}, {"date": "2017/02/15", "title": "After Flynn, Will Republicans Finally Stand Up to Trump?", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/after-flynn-will-republicans-finally-stand-up-to-trump.html", "text": " Most weeks, New York Magazine writer-at-large Frank Rich speaks with contributor Alex Carp about the biggest stories in politics and culture. Today: the saga of former NSA Michael Flynn, President Trump and the press, and SNLs surge. On Friday, asked about reports that now-former national security adviser Michael Flynn had discussed sanctions with Russian officials, Donald Trump said, I dont know about that Ill look into that. Since Flynns resignation Monday night, the White House line has been that Trump had been looking into it for weeks, and last night the New York Times and CNN revealed that Trump aides had spoken with Russian intelligence before the election, which the administration had also denied. With calls for a formal investigation only growing louder, how long until the official explanation of this scandal changes again?I suspect the official explanation will change four times even while I write the answer to your question. When you create a White House of Lies from the Oval Office, as Trump has, and grant a license to your entire administration to lie with impunity, it soon becomes impossible for all the players to keep their stories straight whether they are talking to the press, or to federal or congressional investigators, or to each other. God knows Richard Nixon tried his considerable best to keep the lid on the rampant culture of lying that he erected in the White House; he was able to prevent the dam from breaking for well over a year after the Watergate break-in. But Trump is no Nixon: He doesnt possess the brains, the discipline, the decades of experience of political and governmental combat, or the laser-focused Machiavellian cunning to sustain a Watergate-style cover-up. By the standards of our impeachment-worthy presidents, Trump is a rank amateur. Even the small-time grifter Warren Harding was able to keep the Teapot Dome scandals at bay for his entire presidency; the sordid news didnt emerge until after he died in office. By contrast, the web of lies surrounding Michael Flynn started to unravel less than a month after Inauguration Day. The lies, alternative facts, and incomplete information that Trump and his cadre have fed to the press and the public about Flynn are but the leading indicators of the depth of their mendacity. We now know that not only was Flynn lying to Mike Pence and the White House, but that Trump was also in essence lying to Pence by keeping him in the dark for weeks about what he knew about Flynn. Did Flynn lie to the FBI? Have others in the Trump orbit also lied to the feds to try to foil their investigation of Russian interference in our presidential election? Well get a sense of the scale of this cover-up before long, once all the presidents men are forced to lawyer up. Which in turn will lead to a further collapse of an underpopulated and overmatched Executive branch that already is essentially nonfunctional beyond its premature ejaculation of legally challenged presidential executive orders. Yet Trump seems incredibly clueless about the gravity of the situation. His attempt to change the subject yesterday  the real story of the Flynn resignation, he tweeted, is illegal leaks  is self-impeaching. The president sees no problem in his national security adviser having done backdoor dealings with Russia; the only crime in Trumps eyes is that Flynn got caught. It also doesnt seem to have occurred to Trump that his White House is itself birthing many, if not most, of the leakers now dogging him. Those leakers are highly motivated both by a desire to save their own skins and by their internal power struggles within the isolated Trump bunker. Other leakers can be found at the intelligence agencies Trump managed to turn into enemies by trashing them before he was even sworn in. Such is Trumps ego that he actually believed he was cleverer than they are; how quickly he is discovering that the reverse is true, by a landslide. It will be fascinating to see if GOP leaders finally revolt to save their own skins. The same politicians who wanted to lock Hillary Clinton up for her private email server and who turned the Benghazi investigation into a fruitless two-year sinkhole of government waste are so far doing little to counter a president who (a) may be a wholly owned mole of the nation his own Defense Secretary, Jim Mattis, declared the No. 1 foreign threat during his confirmation hearing; (b) ordered a botched raid in Yemen for which there has been no accountability; (c) invited fellow diners at Mar-a-Lago to eavesdrop on a confidential crisis meeting with a foreign leader; (d) fired the acting attorney general, Sally Yates, who had warned him about Flynns lies; and (e) hired Flynn in the first place. (I know that this national-security thread is merely a short list of the administrations indignities.) Flynn! This is a guy whose first acts after being named national security adviser included obtaining a security clearance for his son, a mad conspiracy theorist who used social media to promote, among other hoaxes, the scenario that Clinton was masterminding a child sex ring from a pizza parlor in Northwest Washington. Flynn was a security adviser so cavalier about his own security that it seems not to have occurred to him that his communications with a Russian ambassador would be intercepted by American intelligence services. How long will Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, and their peers continue to slow-walk or kill any investigations into this morass? Will it take an international crisis involving Russia, Iran, North Korea, ISIS, or who knows who else, as Americas enemies seize their opening to capitalize on the chaos in Washington? Given the GOP leaders collaboration with Trump over the past year, we already know they care about party more than country. But circumstances beyond Americas borders may soon force them either to take action or go down with Trumps ship. Meanwhile, it looks like Trump is structuring his official press appearances to filter out the toughest questions. Can members of the press oppose this strategy effectively?Unsurprisingly, Trump favors taking questions from right-wing outlets, most notably Rupert Murdochs New York Post and Wall Street Journal. (The latters editor had to hold a town hall meeting this week to address his own staffs unhappiness with the Trump-coddling reputation their paper has earned under his partisan leadership.) But I dont think Trumps preference for softball questioners should or will make any difference in terms of press coverage of Trump. The real story, as Trump might put it, is not what he or Sean Spicer or Kellyanne Conway or Stephen Miller or any of the others say in their mostly fictitious public utterances, whether in the White House press room or on Sunday-morning talk shows, but what happens behind closed doors. And there are many first-rate reporters working in real news, as opposed to the Murdoch-Breitbart state press, competing for those scoops. Lets not forget that Pence learned that Flynn lied to him not from any of his colleagues in the Trump White House but from a report in the Washington Post. This administration promises to be one long night of the long knives, as the various courtiers competing for their mercurial bosss favor sell out their rivals to anyone with a notebook. Trump could eliminate press conferences altogether, or have all the questions asked by the extras he hired for his campaigns initial Trump Tower coming-out party, and the major real-news organizations would still not lack for compelling stories of Trumpian calamity. After taking criticism for its role in Trumps run to the White House, Saturday Night Live spent the postelection period extracting its revenge, and is seeing its highest ratings since 2011. Alls well that ends well?This is truly a special moment for SNL. To be sure, there is if anything a surplus of smart anti-Trump comedy in late-night television right now. But Trump no doubt dismisses Samantha Bee, John Oliver, Seth Meyers, and Stephen Colbert  if they are even on his very limited radar screen  as niche TV. When hes not watching CNN or Fox News, Trump is mainly a consumer of mainstream broadcast entertainment television. SNL is at once a product of the network that made him a star, a fabled brand in its own right, and a show on which he has happily appeared. So he takes it seriously, much as he does the failing New York Times, no matter how often he derides it in 140 characters. SNL has the power to reach him and hit him where he lives. It must have infuriated Trump, who has been mocking Arnold Schwarzeneggers poor ratings on Celebrity Apprentice, when he learned that last Saturdays SNL, with Alec Baldwin as guest host, drew higher ratings than Trumps own SNL hosting gig during the presidential campaign. But as much as Trump may be affronted by the popularity of Baldwins devastating faux Trump, weve learned (from still more White House leakers) that he was even more enraged by Melissa McCarthys rollicking impersonation of Sean Spicer. Trump, as I dont need to remind anyone, has a contemptuous view of women, particularly women who dont resemble any of his wives. A brilliant female comedian playing his male press secretary is, for him, the ultimate emasculating indignity. So much so that when McCarthy revived her Spicer for a second appearance last weekend, Trumps Twitter feed fell silent. That he did not attack SNL despite that provocation is a sign that the show really is getting to him. We know damn well he is watching. We must hope that SNL keeps expanding its gender-flipping stunts. In McCarthys wake, Rosie ODonnell has informally lobbied to play Steve Bannon. How about Kristin Wiig as Jared Kushner, Leslie Jones as Ben Carson, and Meryl Streep going public with the Trump impersonation she performed to much acclaim at a gala in New York last year? Trump is driving many Americans mad. SNL has the power to inflict damage of its own on what may be the most fragile psyche to find its way into the presidency since a Scotch-lubricated Nixon could be found late at night talking to portraits on the White House walls."}, {"date": "2017/02/15", "title": "Duterte Wants to Expand His Deadly Drug War to 9-Year-Olds", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/duterte-wants-to-expand-his-deadly-drug-war-to-9-year-olds.html", "text": " When Rodrigo Duterte was elected president of the Philippines, in May, his victory came at the end of a campaign in which he had launched a series of violent threats at the countrys drug dealers and users, promising a bloody war on drugs if he were elected  Go ahead and kill them yourself as getting their parents to do it would be too painful, he said of drug users at one point. He has kept that campaign promise: Since his inauguration, an estimated 7,600 people have been killed as part of his administrations drug war. While the policy ostensibly targets drug dealers and traffickers, human-rights groups and journalists have shown convincingly that a wide swath of Filipinos, some with little or no connection to the drug trade at all, and many of them simply users, have been summarily executed by both the police and by vigilante groups working either in coordination with, or the tacit approval of, law enforcement. Duterte, a bombastic figure, has bragged about the deaths, positively comparing himself to Hitler along the way (though he later apologized for that remark). Now, Reuters reports that Duterte is looking to ramp things up further by lowering the age of criminal responsibility from 15 all the way down to 9. A bill that would do just that was actually introduced right around the time he was sworn in, and one of its co-authors says he expects it to be approved by the nations congress within the next six months. You can ask any policeman or anyone connected with the law enforcement: We produce a generation of criminals, Duterte said in December. Lowering the age, he insisted, would help teach Filipino youth to understand responsibility. Naturally, human-rights groups are opposed to the measure, pointing out that while there are other countries with low ages of criminal responsibility  its ten in England, Northern Ireland, and Switzerland, for example  these tend to be places with much more developed, smoothly functioning criminal-justice systems than the Philippines  and places where there hasnt been an epidemic of extrajudicial killings. Duterte faces some internal criticism of his plan as well: Among the opponents of the bill is a member of Dutertes cabinet, Judy Taguiwalo, secretary of the [Department of Social Welfare and Development], notes Reuters. The legislation runs counter to scientific knowledge about child development and would result not in lower crime rates but in more children being detained, Taguiwalo wrote in a letter to the House of Representatives in October. Still, Duterte and his allies insist that the action is necessary given the number of children involved in the drug trade, even as the numbers tell another story: From 2011 to 2016, according to the countrys own statistics, just 80 children under the age of 15 were rescued from drug-trade activity by Filipino authorities."}, {"date": "2017/02/15", "title": "A Deadly Rat Disease Has Killed One Person, Infected Two Others in the Bronx", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/a-deadly-rat-disease-has-killed-one-person-in-the-bronx.html", "text": " Oh God.

According to the Department of Health, all three infected individuals were hospitalized with severe symptoms, including kidney and liver failure. The illness proved fatal in one individual, who has not been identified. The other two survived, and have since been released from care. Leptospirosis is not totally unheard of in New York City  in the past decade, from 2006 to 2016, the city recorded 26 cases across five boroughs. But the clustering is unusual  and the last time a mini-outbreak occurred was in 2009, among city dogs. The bacteria that cause the disease are found in other animals, but this being a city of rodents, theyre the likely culprit behind these infections. The illness is very rarely passed between humans, and people often catch it when the infected rat pee gets into water or soil, where the bacteria can survive for up to months. The New York Times says officials are working now to reduce the rat population in the Bronx neighborhood, and to educate residents on the symptoms  which resemble those of every other disease such as vomit, diarrhea, fever, chills, and muscle aches. Leptospirosis is treatable with antibiotics, and the severity of the recent Bronx infections is also uncommon.

The president had an opportunity to reflect on this old credo Tuesday night, when the New York Times published a story about his campaign aides frequent contact with Russian intelligence agents during the 2016 campaign  a story built off leaked information from anonymous intelligence and law-enforcement officials. On Wednesday morning, Trump reiterated his long-established opposition to the FBIs interference in domestic politics. The president also noted one of the many potential harms of such interference: By divulging misleading, partial information about an ongoing inquiry into one politician, the FBI could distract attention away from the more significant failings of that politicians opponent(s). This is a point that the presidents critics should take seriously. Even if one thinks that the FBI served the public interest by leaking in this specific case, the principle that our unelected law-enforcement agencies should not publicize the details of ongoing investigations is one worth protecting. For now, the FBIs leaks are merely alerting the public to possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence agencies  and, thereby, making it more politically difficult for the president to quash existing inquiries into that matter. But how else might the FBI use its power to selectively reveal investigatory information in the future? It is not impossible to imagine the agency actually swinging an election over baseless insinuations, by disclosing bits of information in a misleading way. This may sound like a slippery-slope fallacy. But as recent political history has proven, the inconceivable sometimes happens. Which is why, Democrats would be better off emulating the president  and staunchly opposing the FBIs interference in our politics, no matter whom it may benefit. When the time comes for Democrats to call out the FBIs interference in our politics, they dont want to come off as having a casual and opportunistic relationship with the truth."}, {"date": "2017/02/15", "title": "FBI Interviewed Flynn About Russia Calls Days After He Took Office", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/fbi-interviewed-flynn-russia.html", "text": " When discussing Michael Flynns resignation on Tuesday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer was not clear on whether White House counsel needed 17 days to figure out if the national security advisers December calls with Russias ambassador were legal, or if he made that determination immediately. Regardless, it seems unlikely that Flynn will be prosecuted under the 218-year-old Logan Act, which bans private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments. However, Flynn may be in legal trouble if he lied to the FBI. The New York Times reported on Tuesday evening that FBI director James Comey sent FBI agents to interview Flynn on his calls with Sergey Kislyak during his first few days on the job. The FBI had briefed the Obama administration on the potential Logan Act violation after the calls were intercepted as part of routine U.S. surveillance. New concerns were raised when Spicer denied that Flynn had mentioned sanctions on the calls during his first full press briefing on January 23. Its not clear what Flynn said in the interview, whether his lawyer was present, or if the Trump administration knew about the interview beforehand. But if Flynn told the agents that he hadnt mentioned sanctions on the call, as hed been saying publicly, that would be a felony. On January 26, acting attorney general Sally Yates informed new White House counsel Don McGahn that there were discrepancies between the intercepted calls and what Flynn was claiming publicly. Spicer said President Trump was informed immediately, and directed McGahn to look into the matter. [Flynn] is at serious risk of being prosecuted if he told the FBI what he told the vice president, former Obama White House ethics lawyer Norm Eisen told Politico.

An embattled member of the political Establishment is fighting to overcome a nepotism scandal as a center-left party searches for a positive message. On the left, a socialist is proposing a radical agenda to fix inequality and protect the rights and interests of the working class. A talented woman who worked her way to the top of her party in spite of a loudmouth male relative is now vying for the title of first female president, but many feminists doubt that a win for her would be one for all women. In certain respects, France is actually having the race the U.S. wishes it could have, but never could, owing to the two-party system and the dominance of baby boomers in our politics, among other issues. If the U.S. election were a contest between mainstream conservatism (Jeb!), center-left liberalism (Clinton), right-wing nationalism (Trump), and democratic socialism (Sanders), Frances is much the same, except in the French version of the film the characters are younger, better looking, and more compelling. The election is shaking up the political Establishment, with fresh faces outperforming career politicians and traditional parties being forced to reckon with new political realities. Yes, far-right National Front candidate Marine Le Pen is currently leading in the polls, but its only with about 25 percent in a four-way race. And whereas our system enabled Trump to win on a technicality with a minority of the vote, the structure of the French election makes it harder (though by no means impossible) for a divisive candidate like Le Pen to take the presidency. To say that the characters in this story are more compelling is, first of all, to note that Marine Le Pen is much smarter than Donald Trump, and a genuine ideologue rather than a shouty manifestation of white, male boomer resentment. Like Trump, she has benefited from worker displacement, terrorism, and the backlash against political correctness; indeed, her populist crusade against globalization and Islamism is essentially Trumpism with a higher-than-seventh-grade reading level. Of course, her greater competence makes her that much more dangerous if she wins: Le Pen has pledged to pull France out of NATO and the E.U., to abolish the euro and reintroduce the franc, among other radical and potentially destabilizing ideas. She, too, is buddies with Russian President Vladimir Putin (naturally). A Le Pen victory in May could well precipitate the collapse of the European project. If Bill Clinton was a liability for Hillary last year, Jean-Marie Le Pen  Marines father and the founder of the National Front  is an even bigger albatross around his daughters neck. On Monday, the elder Le Pen was charged with inciting religious hatred over an alleged anti-Semitic pun  and it was far from his first offense. Coming just days after Marine Le Pen stoked outrage among French Jews by saying that she would force Franco-Israelis to give up one of their nationalities, the indictment may remind voters of the ugly antecedents of her reactionary nationalism. On the other side of the political spectrum, Frances Socialist Party has shifted leftward, just like Americas Democrats seem to be in the process of doing. Benot Hamon, who defeated former prime minister Manuel Valls in the second round of the partys primary, has been described as the Bernie Sanders of France, but the 49-year-olds platform is much more in tune with the newest, boldest, and most innovative ideas of the left: The guy wants to tax robots to fund a universal basic income, invest massive sums in renewable energy, legalize pot, and reduce the workweek to 35 hours even as mainstream politicians insist it must increase. Hamons candidacy got an infusion of star power on Saturday when the left-wing economist Thomas Piketty, author of Capital in the 21st Century and a leading critic of inequality, joined his campaign team. Unfortunately for the Socialists, Hamon still looks likely to come in fourth in the first round on April 23, meaning he probably wont be president  but he has ousted the neoliberals from the Socialist Party, reoriented its platform, and gets to preach basic income and radical green politics in a general election, which is a hell of a lot further than the American left got last year. Until recently Le Pens likeliest rival in the second round, which takes place on May 7, was Franois Fillon, the nominee of the center-right Republicans (a rebranding of former president Nicolas Sarkozys party). Fillon is a Mitt Romney type: A paternally handsome former prime minister who thinks gay marriage and abortion are unseemly but wont bother trying to re-outlaw them as president because hell be too busy cutting taxes on the wealthy, raising the retirement age, and firing civil servants. Polls show Fillon beating Le Pen in a head-to-head matchup roughly 60-40. Alas, Fillons future was thrown into doubt a few weeks ago when state financial prosecutors revealed that they were investigating him for possible misuse of public funds after a newspaper published claims that his wife, Penelope, was paid half a million euros of government money for a job she never did. Fillon has apologized for hiring his family members but he maintains that the job his wife was hired to do was real and has refused to drop out of the race. The new star of the film is 39-year-old Emmanuel Macron, an investment banker turned senior adviser and later economy minister under the incumbent Socialist president Franois Hollande. A political outsider who has never held elected office, Macron eschewed the Establishment parties and launched his own movement with a youthful and energetic brand (En Marche!, or Lets Go!). A defender of both market capitalism and the welfare state, Macron has narrowly eclipsed Fillon in the polls in recent weeks and is now looking like the most likely challenger to Le Pen in round two, where head-to-head polls show him beating her by a slightly wider margin than Fillon. He is the Obama-like character America didnt get this time around: the good-natured left-liberal wunderkind who believes good government is possible and is eager to roll up his sleeves and start solving problems. Though polls show Le Pen ultimately losing, they also suggested Brexit wouldnt pass and that Hillary Clinton would become the leader of the free world. Such a rapidly escalating series of implausible outcomes  first Brexit, then Trump  invites a narrative that suggests Le Pens inevitability. The polls could be wrong again. A successful attack by terrorists on Paris like the one authorities foiled just days ago could refocus the race on security and make Le Pens France first ideology more palatable to the electorate. The great and terrible thing about democracy, however, is that no outcome is inevitable: When Election Day comes, the French have a choice."}, {"date": "2017/02/15", "title": "Omarosa Produces Secret Recording of White House Dispute With Journalist", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/omarosa-produces-secret-recording-of-dispute-with-journalist.html", "text": " As top Trump administration officials are caught up in the drama surrounding National Security Adviser Michael Flynns resignation, White House communications official Omarosa Manigault is embroiled in a controversy true to her reality-TV roots.

We do it all the time, she said. When you come into [the press staffs offices], youre on the record. Several White House reporters told the Post that interviews are sometimes recorded, but never without the journalists knowledge. Washington, D.C., has a one-party consent law, so its legal to tape a conversation if at least one person knows theyre being recorded.

He said he didnt hear the word dossier, but parts of the recording were hard to make out. Ryan claims that Manigault selected pieces of their conversation.

The communications were scooped up during routine intelligence collection as U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies were investigating Russias alleged hacking of the Democratic National Committee. CNN reports that the communications during early summer raised a red flag owing to their frequency, and the aides proximity to Trump. According to the Times, the intelligence agencies tried to determine whether the Trump associates were colluding with the Russians on their efforts to influence the election, but so far officials have seen no evidence of that. The communications are being investigated as part of the FBIs ongoing probe into ties between Trump associates and the Russian government. CNN reported that thencampaign chairman Paul Manafort and then-adviser Michael Flynn were among the aides regularly communicating with the Russians. Manafort, who has business ties to Ukraine and Russia, denied the report, but also hinted at a possible defense, telling the Times its hard to know whos a Russian operative: The officials would not disclose how many Trump associates were in regular contact with the Russians, or what topics were discussed. However, CNN reports the Trump aides communications were considered serious enough that both President Obama and President Trump were briefed on the matter. President Trump and members of his administration have repeatedly denied that there was any contact between Russia and his campaign.

This is all a distraction, and its all part of a narrative to delegitimatize the election and to question the legitimacy of [Trumps] presidency.

Its wielded by breitbart.coms Matthew Boyle, or perhaps his close-to-POTUS sources, and its aimed right at White House chief of staff Reince Priebus. In Breitbart World, Priebus is identified with the GOP establishment forces inside President Donald Trumps White House [who] forced out National Security Adviser retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, so there could be an element of simple factional payback here. But Boyle goes on to blame Priebus for basically all the trouble the new administration is encountering in trying to impose its will on Washington and the country at large. You might think Priebus would be well below, say, Stephen Bannon and Stephen Miller and Donald McGahn on the list of people responsible for the chaos surrounding the abruptly released travel ban on January 27. But no: So McGahn, the Stephens, and ultimately Trump werent to blame for rushing out the travel ban before the legal infrastructure was in place to implement and defend it. Priebus was also somehow supposed to force immediate Senate confirmation of Sessions, presumably the moment Trump was inaugurated. Boyle applies the same strange reasoning to blame the chief of staff for the trouble Republicans at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue have encountered in figuring out how and when to repeal and replace Obamacare. Seriously. Apparently Priebus is responsible not only for failing to crack heads throughout Washington to make everyone snap to and implement the presidents imperial will instantly. He is also responsible for the stubborn resistance of objective reality, since the big problem with Obamacare repeal-and-replace isnt a bunch of Republicans sitting around while there is work to be done, but the simple fact that you cannot keep GOP promises (including Trumps) to replace Obamacare with something cheaper and better without costing a lot of people their health insurance. Thats the problem with tax reform, too, since even supply-side dynamic scoring fans are reluctant to claim you can slash corporate and individual taxes without the kind of domestic or defense spending cuts Trump has more or less ruled out. For what its worth, Bannon called the story absurd in an email to The Atlantics Rosie Gray. However, Voxs Andrew Prokop views Breitbarts take on the problems of the administration as an exercise in factional projection, with the Bannon Wing of the Trump White House attributing the chaos it has wrought to, well, someone else  namely the top figure in the inner circle who was not part of the original band of disrupters who made the long march through the primaries with Trump.

Officially, the president asked for Flynns resignation due to waning trust in the national security adviser: While Trump had no problem with Flynn chatting about sanctions with Russias ambassador to the United States (on the very day that president Obama ordered new sanctions against Putins regime), Trump did object to Flynn withholding that information from Vice-President Mike Pence. But is that really what got Flynn canned? After all, Trump (officially) knew about Flynns dissembling 17 days before he sent the man packing. And the White House has suggested that other questionable incidents factored into the presidents decision. What were these incidents? And would they have mattered absent press scrutiny? These arent idle questions. Discerning precisely what one has to do to be kicked out of the Trump White House (a place where a history of mendacity, corruption and/or conspiratorial theorizing is not necessarily disqualifying) would not only shed light on the administrations internal power struggles but also offer insight into another pressing question  who will be the next to hear the presidents favorite catchphrase? And so, five members of New York Magazines politics team  Jonathan Chait, Ed Kilgore, Olivia Nuzzi, Eric Levitz, and Margaret Hartmann  joined NYMag.com deputy editor Jebediah Reed Tuesday to try and discern just that. Jebediah Reed: Flynn is out after 24 days  the quickest firing of a cabinet-level official in American presidential history. There are a number of narratives circulating about what happened: It was a deep State hit. Or this was something Trump and Bannon wanted anyway. Or this was the White House caving to media pressure. What story of Flynns firing do you think is most convincing? Ed Kilgore: Flynn got caught lying to the 46th president of the United States. Jonathan Chait: I think media pressure has a clear effect on Trump, though whether it was decisive in this case is hard to know. Olivia Nuzzi: If you look at what the White House was saying last night and into this morning, amid the confusion of the news breaking, it was quite different than what Spicer was saying today during the briefing. A senior official told The New Yorker they couldnt withstand the drip, drip of information. And if you couple that with the fact that Trump knew about the questions surrounding Flynn for weeks, I think it confirms this was about a bad news cycle putting pressure on Trump and others more than it was about dishonesty  if it even ever was about dishonesty. We still have so many questions unanswered. Margaret Hartmann: Id like to think that the independent press still has some power to hold the Trump administration to account  even if its very sporadic so far. Nuzzi: I think this episode is sort of confirmation of that, Margaret. That journalism actually does matter to this administration. Although I wonder if its for a superficial reason  is it just that President Trump is upset the spotlight has been diverted onto someone else? Eric Levitz: Flynn had ambitions to reform and restructure the intelligence agencies in ways that many powerful people within them are not interested in. He seems to be a sloppy administrator, who failed to ensure that [CIA Director Mike] Pompeo saw Trumps executive orders before they were signed. A very high percentage of the people who have worked with Michael Flynn do not like him. And he has reportedly been possessive of his access to Trump and resentful of those crowding in on his territory. I think he may have survived the news cycle absent these liabilities. But a bad, ongoing story + many people within the administration who wanted him gone = resignation. Kilgore: Theres a fine line between havoc  which I think Trump, Bannon, and Miller savor  and chaos, and maybe somebody had to take the fall for the latter. Chait: Let me add in a smart point on this from our colleague, via Twitter: Hartmann: Yes! The news about the 3 a.m. phone call came out just one day before the Russia news cycle started. Nuzzi: I could absolutely see Trump interpreting that leak as an ultimate act of disloyalty from Flynn. That said, I havent heard anything from my sources about that being a consideration. Chait: Im guessing Flynn told others, who told the media. Nuzzi: Yeah, Jon, I agree. Levitz: Per the Times, the administration is considering surveilling itself to crack down on the leaks:  Mr. Trumps top advisers are considering an insider threat program that could result in monitoring cellphones and emails for leaks. Reed: By firing Flynn, has Trump stopped the bleeding for now on questions about Russian influence inside his administration? Or did this make the problem worse? Nuzzi: I think if an investigation is opened up on Flynn, this only worsens the Russia problem for the administration, because well be talking about it every day. Hartmann: I agree. Raises the question of whether Flynn brought up sanctions on his own or was directed to do so by Trump, or other top advisers. Chait: CNNs report, that elements of the famous dossier have been confirmed, came and went very quickly (like many huge stories have under Trump), but its pretty significant. Hartmann: And further legitimizes the idea that Russia is worth examining. It had a concrete effect beyond intel agencies announcing theyre looking into it. Levitz: If I understood [White House press secretary Sean] Spicer correctly, the Trump White Houses official line is that it was totally appropriate for Flynn to talk about the sanctions with his Russian counterpart. The only problem is that he wasnt forthright with [Vice-President Mike] Pence about it Nuzzi: Thats their official line at this moment. I wonder if it will change again. Reed: Which brings us to our headline question: Who gets shitcanned next in the Trump White House? Kilgore: Well, Breitbarts using Flynns departure as a lever to demand [White House chief-of-staff Reince] Priebus be dismissed for causing all the chaos. Nuzzi: Weird, considering [chief strategist Steve] Bannon and Priebus actually love each other. Hartmann: Sean Spicer is easier to get rid of  or rather, just shift him into the role of communications director. Since its insane hes supposed to be doing both jobs anyway. Nuzzi: I agree that Spicer seems likeliest. Levitz: I actually thought Spicer was kind of impressive today. I dont think hes done well previously, but considering the degree of difficulty  I thought he spun his heart out. Hartmann: Can you really come back from the disgrace of being portrayed by a woman on SNL? Chait: Priebus will be next. Trump mocked him months ago. He also does not look like a chief-of-staff (a key Trump requirement.) He was clearly forced on Trump. And hes the person putatively in charge of organizing an administration for which organization is the central problem. Kilgore: I find the Breitbart argument that Priebus is responsible for the whole outside world not cooperating with The Boss a good leading indicator. Hartmann: I actually think this helps Priebus. Two high-profile firings close together creates a bad image. I think this has extended his tenure by at least a few months. Nuzzi: I think its generally smart to assume that the real power in the White House lies with those who are not on television spinning for the president. The people out there performing on his behalf are also constantly being assessed by Trump in a way that I imagine Bannon, Priebus, [Stephen] Miller, and obviously [Jared] Kushner, arent. So I think Spicer and Kellyanne [Conway] are inherently more vulnerable. Also I would add that Kellyanne apparently accidentally RTd a white nationalist today. Levitz: Happens to the best of us (or, of them, anyway). Hartmann: Hasnt the president done that too though? Nuzzi: Who among us. Levitz: I think Spicer gets moved behind the curtain, before Kellyanne gets axed. Nuzzi: I agree with that. Also Kellyanne has the benefit of having helped shepherd Trump to victory in a way that Spicer cant really take credit for. Levitz: Yeah. Spicers hiring was just a favor to Reince, from what I understand. Kilgore: Priebus is getting blamed for Congress, the bureaucracy, the whole world not adjusting to what Trump wants. Nuzzi: I assume Priebus is being blamed for a lot of things that are probably not his fault, or not entirely his fault. From what I understand from my sources, Trump himself is ungovernable. So Priebus is in this impossible position of trying to create order in a place, with a leader, that much prefers chaos. Hartmann: Were talking about a guy who went through three campaign managers. Chait: Right. Hes the putative chief-of-staff in an administration that doesnt really have a chief- of-staff (a role that implies a certain structure). Levitz: Any chief-of-staff who isnt prepared to confiscate Trumps Android, delete his Twitter account, and crush sedatives into his food will fail to produce order. Nuzzi: Were all trying to figure out whos pulling the strings or whatever, but if theres something we know for sure about Trump it is that he likes to talk to and survey as many people as possible. Remember, he asked his Mar-a-Lago guests, over Thanksgiving, who he should pick for secretary of State. When he called Flynn at 3 a.m. to talk about monetary policy, that was also a form of this. He likes to bat ideas around with lots of people, and then he decides on his own opinion. Reed: Last question: going back to the joke that Ed made to start this  Pence as the 46th POTUS  does anyone buy the now-rampant speculation that Pences long game here is enabling a Trump impeachment? Nuzzi: I dont know that I believe anyone in the White House has a long game. Kilgore: I do not agree that Pence is planning on impeachment. Maybe Trump gets tired/bored after one term. Hartmann: Yeah, I think anyone looking at the chaos of the Trump administration and trying to impose a plan is very foolish. Pence would have to literally be Littlefinger. Chait: Boy, that would be a tough gig. If Trump is an embittered, impeached, and removed former president, then the party is split, in which case, how would Pence govern? Kilgore: I will point out Gerald Ford damn near got reelected in 1976. Chait: Ford did not get Nixon impeached, though. Hartmann: I think Pence certainly has his eye on the presidency, but taking over after Trumps impeahment probably isnt how he wants to do it. Nuzzi: All of my predictions about Trump have been wrong for 20 months. But having said that, I think its unlikely he quits or is impeached his first term. Kilgore: You are more honest than most of us, Olivia. Chait: Trump does seem physically and mentally unequal to the job, and I wouldnt be shocked if he cant make it all the way through. Levitz: It seems like Trump probably doesnt really like this job, and that (almost) everyone around him knows he really is not up to doing it. But I think its more likely that Trump slowly forfeits most of the non-figurehead portions of the job than formally leaves it."}, {"date": "2017/02/14", "title": "Trump Was Told Weeks Ago That Flynn Had Misled Pence", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-was-told-weeks-ago-that-flynn-had-misled-pence.html", "text": " On December 29, the Obama administration announced new sanctions against Russia, as retaliation for its meddling in the 2016 election. That same day, incoming National Security Adviser Michael Flynn spoke over the phone with Russias ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak. During that call, Flynn discussed the new sanctions with his counterpart. Less than 24 hours later, Vladimir Putin decided not to hit the U.S. with retaliatory sanctions  a move that the president-elect cheered. But Flynn was not forthright about his conversation with the ambassador, according to the Trump White House  even after that phone call became a subject of press scrutiny. The retired general led Vice-President Mike Pence to believe that the sanctions had not come up in his conversation with Kislyak. Pence then told CBSs Face the Nation that Flynn and Kislyak did not discuss anything having to do with the United States decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia. On January 26, acting attorney general Sally Yates told White House Counsel Donald McGahn that this wasnt true: The exchange had been intercepted by a routine wiretap of diplomats calls, and the transcript showed that sanctions had been discussed. A little over two weeks later, the Washington Post relayed that same information to the public. Hours after the Posts report went live, the president was asked about Flynns apparent dissembling. I dont know about that, Trump said. I havent seen it. What report is that? I havent seen that. Ill look into that. But on Tuesday, Sean Spicer said that Trump did, in fact, know about that. While the president was unaware of the specific report in question, he had known about Flynns apparent lie since January 26. Trump had no objection to the substance of Flynns action. His job is to discuss issues with his counterparts, Spicer said. Thats what hes supposed to be doing. But the president was disconcerted by Flynns apparent dishonesty with Pence (Flynn, for his part, claims that he unintentionally omitted any mention of the sanctions from his summary of the call). Trump was also uncertain whether Flynns action was illegal, so he asked the White House counsel to investigate the matter. This was part of why Trump did not immediately fire Flynn, Spicer explained: He wanted to give the investigation time to confirm or contradict Yatess claim. But also, the White House counsel immediately determined that Flynns action was perfectly legal, as Trump had always suspected. Anyhow, after 17 days of reflection, Trump asked for Flynns resignation late Monday night  a decision-making process that Spicer described as unbelievably decisive. Per Spicer, the fact that Flynn resigned hours after the Washington Post reported Yatess warning to the White House counsel was a total coincidence. Rather, the evolving and eroding level of trust as a result of this situation and a series of other questionable incidents just happened to reach a breaking point Monday night. Spicers strange tale was undermined by more than its own contradictions. On Tuesday morning, Kellyanne Conway told NBCs Today Show that Flynn had chosen to resign because he knew he had become a lightning rod. The night before, Conway had claimed that Trump had full confidence in Flynn. It isnt entirely unusual for a White House to avoid admitting that the timing of a personnel decision was determined by negative media attention. At this point, the precise cause of Flynns ouster remains uncertain. If Trump didnt object to the substance of Flynns action  if talking to the Russian ambassador about the sanctions was no big deal  its hard to see why Flynns failure to divulge this (ostensibly insignificant) detail to Pence would constitute a fireable offense. It seems more likely that Flynns other liabilities  deep unpopularity with the intelligence community, domineering personality, failure to set up a well-functioning National Security Council, and apparent blabbing about a 3 a.m. phone call he received from Trump  all eroded the presidents sense of loyalty to the retired general. So, when the Russia story raised the political costs of retaining Flynn, Trump had little interest in footing the bill. Alternatively, Trump may have decided to oust Flynn right after learning Yatess news, but wished to line up a replacement before letting him go. Those are just a couple plausible accounts of Flynns ouster, which is two more than Spicer offered on Tuesday."}, {"date": "2017/02/14", "title": "Conservatives Revolt Against Keeping the Parts of Obamacare Americans Like", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/right-revolts-against-keeping-parts-of-obamacare-people-like.html", "text": " The positive news for the GOP congressional leadership on the stalled Obamacare repeal-and-replace front is that they seem to be coalescing around a strategy sometimes called repeal-plus using the pending budget-reconciliation bill they authorized last month to repeal the non-regulatory portions of the Affordable Care Act and at the same time enact those elements of a replacement plan on which most Republicans can agree. But the strategy must somehow thread the needle between the desire of the public (reinforced by Donald Trumps promises) for maintaining Obamacare levels of health coverage, and conservative pressure to get rid of as much of the socialist abomination as is possible. This latter pressure point is gaining strength as House conservatives threaten to vote against anything thats not a straight repeal of Obamacare, while the venerable tea party group FreedomWorks plans to mobilize grassroots support for the least Obamacare-like alternative out there, Rand Pauls let-em-eat-markets approach. As Politico reports, as many as 50 House Republicans are prepared to demand a vote on the dry run Obamacare repeal legislation Congress sent to Barack Obama for a certain veto early last year. It was a straight repeal without replacement provisions, and, for dessert, also included defunding Planned Parenthood. This is the same bill, it should be remembered, that the Congressional Budget Office recently estimated would cost 18 million Americans their health coverage almost immediately (and 32 million within ten years), while boosting individual insurance-policy premiums by more than 20 percent. The odds of such legislation getting through the Senate are vanishingly small, even though (a) no Democratic votes would be necessary and (b) all non-freshman Senate Republicans voted for it last year, when of course they knew it would not become law. This latter factor means that Mitch McConnell would use all his leverage with Paul Ryan to avoid such a bill coming over from the House and showing up GOP senators as having something less than the courage of their alleged convictions. Everybody understands these dynamics, so its likely the real purpose of the House conservative gambit in pushing a politically disastrous repeal-without-replace plan  aside from signaling impatience about inaction  is to keep GOP leaders from going too far in the direction of continuing the very Obamacare policies the public (and presumably fearful Republican senators) would like them to continue. Provisions that might lead to a full-scale conservative revolt range from maintenance of the taxes that financed Obamacare coverage (and that would be supremely useful in paying for a GOP replacement), to too-generous subsidies for private insurance purchases, to excessive generosity to states that accepted the Obamacare Medicaid expansion, to inadequate freedom for insurers to discriminate against the old and the sick. That could leave Republicans with not much more in the way of replacement items as such hardy GOP perennials as subsidies for Health Savings Accounts, authorization of interstate insurance sales, and sharp reductions in mandatory benefits for those receiving subsidies. As Ron Brownstein pointed out recently, all these ancient conservative health-policy ideas would erode coverage for the older Americans who happen to be most likely to vote Republican, while boosting out-of-pocket costs for the white-working-class voters who think costs are too high under Obamacare. These cross-pressures to avoid anything that looks like Obamacare Lite but at the same time to avoid disruption of existing coverage are why Republicans are in such disarray on the subject to begin with. Just punting tough decisions down the road with a repeal-and-delay strategy that maintains Obamacare for years no longer seems like a viable option; conservatives hate it and it creates too much uncertainty in markets. But doing a mini-replacement (which is where repeal-plus seems headed) in the current budget-reconciliation vehicle means that any further replacement elements will require 60 Senate votes, meaning at least eight Democrats would have to go along. As budget expert Stan Collender notes, that brilliant GOP plan for a legislative blitzkrieg this year that would repeal and replace Obamacare, slash taxes, and reform the welfare state, all through budget vehicles that made Democrats irrelevant, is looking mighty iffy now. Congressional Republicans cannot put off decisions about Obamacare much longer without imperiling the timetable for everything else they need to do. And there is always the possibility they will be caught by some random Trump tweet and forced to change direction. You have to figure Republican discussions on the legislative agenda, which were supposed to be resolved at a GOP retreat nearly three weeks ago, are in danger of descending into sweaty white-knuckled madness."}, {"date": "2017/02/14", "title": "4 Days Later, Knicks Lift Charles Oakleys Lifetime Ban", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/4-days-later-knicks-lift-charles-oakleys-lifetime-ban.html", "text": " Charles Oakleys lifetime ban from Madison Square Garden lasted four days.

He is also accused of protecting other Venezuelan drug traffickers, working with the brutal Mexican cartel Los Zetas, and teaming up with Colombian drug lord Daniel Barrera Barrera, also known as El Loco. Prior to his appointment to the vice-presidency, El Aissami was the governor of the state of Aragua and before that he served as Venezuelas minister of interior and justice. In those roles, the Treasury Department says, he worked with drug lords to move product around the world. The 42-year-old is reportedly not well liked in Venezuela, a nation suffering so badly economically that people have resorted to eating flamingos. In fact, his unpopularity is why he was made veep, according to one report, which suggests that President Nicols Maduro is trying to dissuade opponents from recalling him by ensuring that hed be replaced by someone they hate even more.

If the damaged area of the dam were to collapse, it would release a 30-foot wall of water into the Feather River. The precariousness of the situation led authorities to evacuate nearly 200,000 people downstream. According to the Los Angeles Times, helicopters are depositing sacks of rocks into the hole created by the erosion, helped by dump trucks that are also patching up spots with rocks, and creating a slurry  a cementlike mixture  to plug everything in place. The urgent construction is a stopgap measure, one attempt to head off potential disaster in advance of another round of rainstorms expected Wednesday. The crisis peaked Sunday, when engineers found the pocket of erosion under the emergency spillway  a concrete wall built to permit overflow when Lake Oroville hits capacity. The dam  the nations tallest  was built in 1968; and until this year, operators have never once relied on the spillway. The emergency spillway came into use for the first time because of heavy rainstorms and snow, and the discovery of a large hole last week in the dams main spillway. But concerns about that problem have been set aside for the time being: The goal is to lower the lake by about 50 feet below the top of the 770-foot dam, as more rain is expected later this week  potentially up to four inches. The main spillway is holding, but the release of such high volumes of water has flooded parts of the area  though not even close to the catastrophic inundation that could happen if the emergency spillway collapsed.

The attack was carried out by two women who escaped the Kuala Lumpur airport by taxi after the attack, according to TV Chosun, a South Korean news channel. The deceased  felt like someone grabbed or held his face from behind, a police official told Reuters. He felt dizzy, so he asked for help. Kim Jong-nam died in an ambulance on his way to a hospital. The oldest son of Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-nam was seen as the heir apparent in North Korea throughout the 1990s. But that reportedly changed after he was caught with a forged Dominican passport in 2001 as he was trying to sneak his way into Japan to attend Tokyo Disneyland. The subsequent fallout from that incident led to Kim Jong-uns grooming to take over for the Dear Leader. Kim Jong-nam, meanwhile, moved to Macau and regularly traveled to China and Singapore, earning a reputation as a playboy. He spoke occasionally about the goings-on in his home country, and it was rarely positive. In a 2012 book, an author quoted an email exchange with Kim Jong-nam in which he said that his younger half-brothers regime will not last long. Without reforms, North Korea will collapse, and when such changes take place, the regime will collapse, he wrote, according to Japanese journalist Yoji Gomi. I think we will see valuable time lost as the regime sits idle fretting over whether it should pursue reforms or stick to the present political structure. On Tuesday, Kim Jong-un was already being blamed for his brothers death, with one South Korean politician saying the killing was a naked example of Kim Jong-uns reign of terror. If the North Korean dictator did indeed order Kim Jong-nams killing, it wouldnt be the first time he signed the death warrant for a family member.

Deciding whether its worse to have Steve Bannon on the National Security Council  or Jeff Sessions running the Justice Department  is like deciding whether its worse to have El Chapo as your NA sponsor or Joseph Kony as your babysitter. But before he was ousted for lying to the vice-president about his (potentially) illegal communications with a Russian ambassador, Michael Flynn had a strong case for being the worst of the worst. In a White House full of anti-Muslim conspiracy theorists, Flynn was quite likely the most paranoid; and almost certainly, the most powerful. As national security adviser, Flynn worked in closer proximity to the Oval Office than other top foreign policy aides  a key distinction in a White House led by a man (infamously) predisposed to agree with the last person who spoke with him. We cant know precisely what bad ideas Flynn whispered into the presidents ear. But heres a sampling of the ones he shouted into the public discourse: 1. Fear of Muslims is rational. 2. Democrats have imposed Sharia law in parts of Florida. 3. Barack Obama is a jihadi who laundered money for Muslim terrorists (to be fair, Flynn merely retweeted this sentiment). 4. The Mexican border is lined with Arabic-language signs that guide radical Islamists into the United States. 5. Islamic scholars who claim that violent jihadism is not an authentic expression of their religion are merely trying to confuse in order to control. 6. North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela, Iran, Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and the Islamic State have all formed an enemy alliance ready to wage global war on the United States. Flynn does not like having his intelligence assessments (and/or paranoid delusions) subjected to internal debate. Days after the 2012 attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, Flynn concluded that Iran was responsible  and informed his subordinates at the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) that their job was now to prove this hunch correct. One of Flynns underlings at the DIA claimed that this I conclude, you substantiate approach to intelligence gathering defined Flynns tenure at the agency. Mr. Flynn said that the first thing everyone needed to know was that he was always right, the anonymous official told the New York Times. His staff would know they were right, he said, when their views melded to his. To insulate his ideas from critical feedback, Flynn staffed his White House office with less-well-established Islamophobes. And the new national security adviser wasted little time before working to translate his bigoted intuitions into policy: According to Reuters, a Flynn-led faction within the White House had been pushing to add the Muslim Brotherhood to Americas list of foreign terrorist organizations. This would be a bizarre and radical departure for American foreign policy. Its true that some groups affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood commit political violence against civilians, like the Palestinian group Hamas. But the original Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt  and its offshoots in Turkey and Tunisia  had foresworn violence and sought to achieve Islamist rule through democratic means. Branding the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group would strain relations with Americas Islamist allies, including the current Turkish government; reframe the war on terrorism as a war against political Islam in all of its forms; and open any Muslim-American citizen who has donated to a so-called Muslim Brotherhood affiliate to the threat of prosecution. That last point is worth dwelling on  especially because CIA director Mike Pompeo and Attorney General Jeff Sessions both supported a bill that designated a Muslim civil-rights organization, the Council on Islamic-American Relations, as such an affiliate. For these reasons and others, analysts at the State Department and CIA have opposed the move. Now, the counter-jihadist wing of the Trump White House has lost its leading advocate. Whats more, early reports suggest that Flynns departure will allow the (comparatively) sane James Mattis to amplify his influence within the administration: A senior White House official has told the Daily Beast that a longtime Mattis colleague, retired Navy SEAL Vice Admiral Robert Harward, is the leading candidate to fill Flynns shoes. In the meantime, the disorder Flynns absence will produce at the National Security Council may create a vacuum that the (reassuringly Bannon-less) Pentagon can fill. Beyond removing one of the most deranged cooks from Trumps kitchen, Flynns departure is also an encouraging sign that the administration can put political expedience over loyalty or ideology. Following reports that Flynn had misled Vice-President Pence, Steve Bannon reportedly led the push for the formers ouster. That Bannon backed the firing of a fellow Islamophobic crank suggests that, for all his accelerationist bluster, the former Breitbart mastermind remains a political strategist  and, thus, a man who is willing to tell the president when he needs to bow to external pressure. Unless Bannon just hated Flynn, and wanted to increase his personal power by removing other longtime Trump loyalists from the presidents orbit. So, okay, its hard to sustain optimism about the Trump White House for any length of time. Even without Flynn, the presidents foreign-policy team is pretty darn dystopian. As Voxs Zach Beauchamp notes, a broad swath of Trumps inner circle  including Sessions, Pompeo, Steve Bannon, and Kellyanne Conway  is affiliated with a movement that views the American Muslim community as a fifth column. And the fact that Mattiss growing influence is worth celebrating is, itself, kind of terrifying: The retired general was kicked out of the Obama administration for being too hawkish on Iran  and, reportedly, pushed for the Navy to intercept an Iranian ship last week, so as to search for weapons that Tehran might be sending to Houthi rebels in Yemen. Which is to say: Mattis wanted to commit an act of war against Iran to protect Saudi Arabias sphere of influence. Nonetheless, Mattis does not believe that Judeo-Christian civilization is facing an epochal struggle against an Islamo-Fascist alliance composed of Iran, Al Qaeda, North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba, and maybe, just maybe, Barack Obama.Until last night, that was more than we could say about President Trumps national security adviser. If Flynn is, in fact, replaced with a Mattis lackey, his resignation will go down as the best news America has received since Trumps inauguration."}, {"date": "2017/02/14", "title": "3 Ways Republicans Are Dodging the Flynn Scandal", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/3-ways-republicans-are-dodging-the-flynn-scandal.html", "text": " Last December, Michael Flynn spoke with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak and discussed U.S. sanctions against that country in retaliation for its successful hacking of Democratic Party emails. While not illegal, the discussion was highly irregular, given that Flynns candidate was elected in part due to the hacking, and incoming administrations are not supposed to undermine the policies of the sitting president. The chronology of the events makes it appear as though Trump was aware of and even authorized Flynns discussion: Russia repeatedly threatened retaliatory action, and then quickly decided not to, after which Trump praised Russias decision and called Vladimir Putin smart. If Trump was not aware of the conversation, then Flynn would have been vulnerable to blackmail  a fact Trumps acting attorney general made clear to him last month. So which is it? Did Trump know about Flynns undermining of U.S. diplomacy, but tell the public he didnt? Or did he allow an official he knew to be vulnerable to Russian blackmail to have access to the highest levels of American intelligence? Republicans so far have expressed no interest in discovering the answer. The partys responses have fallen into three overlapping categories. 1. Move on. When asked about Flynn keeping his role despite being vulnerable to blackmail, Kellyanne Conway blandly replied, thats one characterization  were moving on, touting some of the exciting candidates who might replace Flynn. Representative Chris Collins repeated the phrase move on four times in a short CNN interview. 2. What about the leaks? The issue Republicans want to investigate isnt what we know, but why. Which intelligence officials are leaking the administrations lies? House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes told reporters he wants an investigation of  the FBI. Breitbart solemnly notes, the more serious question is whether our nations intelligence services were involved in what amounts to political espionage against the newly-elected government. 3. Leave Trump alooooone. Republicans insist they do not support any probe of Flynns actions or what Trump may have known. Its taking care of itself, insists House Oversight Committee chairman Jason Chaffetz. What about House Speaker Paul Ryan? Ryan is known for his fanatical belief in informational security. The Speaker once held such strong views on classified information that he demanded Hillary Clinton be denied access to classified briefings during the campaign because she had shown, by using a private email server, she could not be trusted with the nations secrets. The consequences for the safety of our nation are grave, he wrote solemnly. Clintons actions may have allowed our enemies to access intelligence vital to our national security. Ryan has learned from that episode to be far less judgmental. And now today, even the prospect that Trump allowed intelligence to be exposed to a staffer whom he knew to be potentially vulnerable to Russian blackmail strikes him as unworthy of investigation. Today, Ryan said, Im not going to prejudge the circumstances surrounding this. And since Ryan is not forcing an investigation, he wont post-judge, either. No prejudging, no post-judging, no judging of any kind, just moving on."}, {"date": "2017/02/14", "title": "Entourage Movie Producer Steve Mnuchin Confirmed As Treasury Secretary", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/steve-mnuchin-confirmed-as-treasury-secretary.html", "text": " Former Goldman Sachs partner, hedge-fund founder, and producer of the Entourage movie, Steve Mnuchin was confirmed by the Senate Monday night as the next United States secretary of the Treasury.

Journalists could not locate a recording of the episode, but on Monday Politico reported that the Oprah Winfrey Network provided the Senate with a copy. Ive arranged for senators on the committee to see that  I thought that was a reasonable request. No reason not to see it, said HELP Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander, who supports Puzders nomination. That happened 27 years ago. His former wife has said it was all not true. She has reiterated that in a heartfelt letter to members of the committee and has been willing to talk to members of the committee so I dont think thats an issue. Senator Patty Murray, the committees ranking Democrat, said shes also viewed the March 1990 episode titled High-Class Battered Women, and she was deeply troubled. Senator Collins said shes seen the tape, but didnt give her reaction. Im going to wait until the issues that have arisen are fully explored at his hearing, she told reporters. I am reviewing the other information that has come to light, and Im sure all of this will be explored thoroughly. A spokeswoman for Murkowski said she will be working to learn more about Mr. Puzder leading up to and during the upcoming hearing, as well as through additional one-on-one conversations with him. Isaksons staff said that, as with other nominees, he would not make a decision until after the hearing. I have not come out with a position, Scott said. Ive never said I was opposed to him, at all. According to CNN, Murkowski and Collins, who voted no on Education secretary Betsy DeVos, are the most opposed to Puzder of the four. Sources said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sees the nomination as a test of his leadership and is determined to get the votes needed to make Puzder Labor secretary."}, {"date": "2017/02/14", "title": "Journalist Claims Omarosa Threatened Her, Said White House Has Dossier on Her", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/journalist-says-omarosa-threatened-her-has-dossier-on-her.html", "text": " Somehow Gateway Pundit bloggers showing off their new White House press credentials in a tweet featuring a Pepe the Frog emoji was not the most troubling report about the White House press corps on Monday. A reporter claims that during an argument just outside the Oval Office last week, Omarosa Manigault, Apprentice star turned White House communications official, physically intimidated her. She said Manigault also told her that the Trump administration has collected dossiers of negative information on her and several other journalists. According to the Washington Post, the exchange between Manigualt and April Ryan, American Urban Radio Networks White House correspondent, took place outside White House Press Secretary Sean Spicers office. She stood right in my face like she was going to hit me, Ryan told the paper. I said, You better back up.  She thought I would be bullied. I wont be. Post reporter Abby Phillip was one of several people who witnessed the incident. Phillip said she didnt hear every word, but Ryan told her afterward that she felt Manigaults behavior was Secret Serviceable, meaning it warranted intervention by law enforcement. Ryan also said that during the encounter Manigault told her she was one of several African-American journalists whom the White House is keeping dossiers on. I said, Good for you, good for you, good for you, Ryan said. When asked to comment on the report, Manigault told the Post via email, My comment: Fake news! Ryan used to be so close with Manigault that the former reality star had asked her to be in her wedding party. However, their relationship soured last fall when Manigault sent her a link to a report from the Intercept and fretted, This story suggests that as a reporter, you are (or were) a paid Clinton surrogate, adding, I pray this is not true! This could be hurtful to your legacy and the integrity of your work. The story used hacked emails to show how the Clinton campaign tried to elicit favorable press coverage, but it did not say the Clinton team paid journalists. Manigaults alleged reference to dossiers on journalists is new, but during the campaign she said of Never Trump Republicans, Trump has a long memory and were keeping a list. Its been nearly a year since Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields accused Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski of physically assaulting her. Authorities decided not to pursue battery charges against Lewandowski, citing lack of evidence.

I inadvertently briefed the Vice-President-elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador, Flynn said in a resignation letter the White House emailed to journalists. I have sincerely apologized to the president and the vice-president, and they have accepted my apology. For weeks Flynn has insisted that he didnt discuss anything of substance in his conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, which occurred as the Obama administration was imposing sanctions on Russia over the countrys alleged election meddling. Its a breach of protocol for a member of the transition to discuss policy with a foreign government, and it may be illegal. Pence repeated Flynns denial on Face the Nation days before the inauguration, and in his first White House briefing Press Secretary Sean Spicer said sanctions never came up. However, the call was captured as part of a routine wiretap of Kislyaks communications, and last week nine current and former U.S. officials told the Washington Post that transcripts show Flynn made explicit references to election-related sanctions. Flynn walked back his previous denial and, by Monday afternoon, his future in the administration was uncertain  so much so that Kellyanne Conway said on MSNBC that Flynn had the full confidence of President Trump just before Spicer said the president was evaluating the situation. Then, around 9 p.m., there were two new bombshells. The Post reported that last month acting attorney general Sally Yates told the Trump White House that Flynn had misled them about the calls, and was potentially vulnerable to Russian blackmail. In the final days of the Obama administration Yates conferred with James Clapper, the director of National Intelligence at the time, and John Brennan, who was then CIA director, and they agreed that they should share their concerns about Flynn with the Trump administration. Yates informed White House counsel Donald McGahn, but its unclear what he did with the information. She was later fired for defying Trumps executive order on immigration. A source tells Politico her briefing on Flynn did not play a role in her dismissal. Meanwhile, the New York Times reported that the Army has been investigating whether Flynn received money from the Russian government during a trip to Moscow in 2015, which may violate the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution. As reported last month, U.S. intelligence agencies were already looking at Flynns communications as part of an investigation into Russias attempts to influence the U.S. election. While Flynn received a security briefing from the Defense Intelligence Agency before his trip to Russia, defense officials said he may not have filed the required paperwork. They were reportedly surprised when video surfaced of Flynn seated next to Russian president Vladimir Putin at a dinner honoring RT, the state-run Russian news organization. As TPM notes, Flynn has publicly admitted that he was paid to speak at the event. A senior White House official told the Post that Trump was planning to wait several days to make a decision on Flynn, but he chose to resign owing to the cumulative effect of negative news coverage. There obviously were a lot of issues, but the president was hanging in there, the official said. Buying some time was part of the plan, and I think Flynn just figured, if its imminent to the boss, then lets make it immediate. However, the Times reported that White House chief strategist Steve Bannon asked for Flynns resignation, which he has been pushing for since Friday. The White House said General Keith Kellogg, who most recently served as National Security Council chief of staff, will be the interim national security adviser. In addition to the drama surrounding Flynns calls to the Russian ambassador, the Times reported over the weekend that the National Security Council has been in disarray under his management. Prior to Flynns resignation, Politico reported that the White House was looking at potential replacements. Kellogg, Vice-Admiral Robert Harward, former deputy commander of the U.S. Central Command, and retired general David Petraeus are said to be under consideration. Petraeus, who was convicted in 2015 of passing classified information to his mistress, is scheduled to meet with Trump at the White House on Tuesday. While Democrats were pleased by news of Flynns resignation, they said many questions remain unanswered. Representative Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, noted that the committee is still investigating the Trump campaigns alleged ties to Russia. The Trump Administration has yet to be forthcoming about who was aware of Flynns conversations with the Ambassador and whether he was acting on the instructions of the president or any other officials, or with their knowledge, Schiff said. Democratic representatives John Conyers Jr. and Elijah Cummings called for a classified briefing by the Justice Department and FBI over the alarming new disclosures about Flynn. We need to know who else within the White House is a current and ongoing risk to our national security, they said. Republican representative Devin Nunes, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, did not seem interested in pursuing the matter. On Monday afternoon, he predicted Flynn would keep his job, saying, It just seems like theres a lot of nothing there. He continued defending Flynn, even after his resignation. Washington, D.C., can be a rough town for honorable people, and Flynn  who has always been a soldier, not a politician  deserves Americas gratitude and respect for dedicating so much of his life to strengthening our national security, Nunes said in a statement. I thank him for his many years of distinguished service.

Trudeau, who had a strong relationship with Barack Obama, has had some public differences with Trump, most notably on refugee policy. The two discussed trade and national security, and released a joint statement that touched on economic security and growing the middle class; border security; and military cooperation. The two also recommitted to empowering women in the workplace, after hosting an earlier roundtable that featured the presidents daughter Ivanka. At their joint press conference, Trudeau and Trump reaffirmed the special relationship between the United States and Canada, which, according to Trump, will become as good or better than ever before. Trudeau, who spoke in both English and French  which forced Trump to fumble with his earpiece  underscored those ties. No other neighbors in the entire world are as fundamentally linked as we are, Trudeau said. But the press conferences spotlighted some of the differences between the two leaders, in both tone and substance. None of the reporters brought up the rumors swirling around the fate of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, but the journalists asked pointed questions about immigration, trade, and Trumps travel ban. One Canadian journalist said to Trump, You seem to suggest that Syrian refugees are a Trojan horse for potential terrorism, while the prime minister hugs refugees. Trump responded by talking about the great job his team had done to get the very, very hardened criminals in some cases, with a tremendous track record of abuse and problems out of the country. Since Trudeau hadnt brought it up, and in case Canada hadnt heard, Trump reminded them: Im just doing what I said I would do when we won by a very, very large Electoral College vote. Another reporter directly asked about Trumps travel ban. We cannot let the wrong people come in, and I will not allow that to happen during this administration, Trump said, adding: Were getting such praise for our stance. Trudeau, who didnt quite go all Love Actually on Trump as the internet had hoped, managed a quiet rebuke of Trumps executive order on refugees. There have been times where we have differed in our approaches, and thats always been done firmly and respectfully, Trudeau said. The last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves. My role, our responsibility is to continue to govern in such a way that reflects Canadians approach and be a positive example in the world. If Trump got the subtle burn, he tried to make up for it by responding to a question about Nafta and potential changes to trade with Canada by talking about Mexico, and how companies are coming in with billions and billions of dollars and creating thousands of thousands of jobs in the United States. Were going to make it so that everybody is happy, Trump said. The press conference followed a long day, including that roundtable to kick off a new task force called the United States Canada Council for the Advancement of Women Business Leaders-Female Entrepreneurs. The participants ended the discussion by gathering around a man at a desk: But even before there were introductions, a point goes to Trudeau for skillfully deflecting Trumps bizarre hand-yank move. In the Oval Office, the two posed for pictures, and Trump tried for a do-over. I think they might want a handshake, he said to Trudeau. They?"}, {"date": "2017/02/13", "title": "Donald Trump Is a Managerial Genius, Explains Conservative Scholar", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/conservative-scholar-donald-trump-is-a-managerial-genius.html", "text": " Donald Trump is already publicly floating the first of what will probably be several waves of firings of his top staff, while the news is a daily procession of astonishing revelations that paint the president of the United States as a lazy, ignorant, temperamental man-child who flouts basic security requirements and signs major orders he has not bothered to read. Or so it might appear to the outside world. Christopher DeMuth, a distinguished fellow  that is his actual job title  at the conservative Hudson Institute detects a different pattern at work. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, the conservative scholar explains why President Trumps seemingly chaotic managerial style actually reflects a shrewd and even brilliant grasp of his power. President Trump may be rediscovering a venerable method of leadership that has been forgotten in our era of ideological messaging, argues DeMuth. Rather than viewing disagreement as a problem, he attracts highly accomplished, strong-minded advisers who engage in vigorous debate. So the daily stream of Trump aides anonymously blaming one another for the administrations failures is actually, to DeMuth, evidence of the presidents sound management. What are the specific practices that Trump has embraced to make his young presidency such a rousing success? DeMuth argues: Apparently a lesser president would never have thought to make simple and popular promises like preventing terrorism and creating good jobs. DeMuth does not bother with the question of whether Trump has any policies to accomplish those goals  he is sufficiently impressed that Trump would think to promise them. Trump also has the cleverness to say crazy stuff: Orthodox opinion believes that higher concentration of greenhouse gasses causes higher long-run temperatures, very few ineligible voters participate in presidential elections, and Trumps inaugural crowd had many fewer attendees than Barack Obamas first inaugural crowd. DeMuth does not quite endorse all of Trumps claims to the contrary, but sees his decision to provoke debates on such subjects as shrewd. Trump has found the very best officials for his administration: Carson and Perry are odd choices to support the claim that Trump has attracted elite talent. According to Trump himself, Carson is pathological and Perry is a moron. (He put on glasses so people think hes smart. People can see through the glasses.) To be sure, one might dismiss these insults on the grounds that Trump is a flamboyant liar who reflexively smears any critic who stands in his path, but aknowledging this would obviously complicate DeMuths argument, so he simply pretends that everybody recognizes that Carson and Perry (neither of whom had any experience in their new fields) are A-list cabinet picks. The president has a wide-ranging thirst for knowledge: Put differently, Trump reads no books, cannot digest any summary more than a single page, and instead watches endless television, and repeats wild, false viral rumors from fake internet sites. DeMuth finds more good news: It is perhaps true that, in the course of alarming close American allies like Germany, France, and even Australia, Trump has caused those countries to become more focused. DeMuth does not explain why this is beneficial. Trump has distracted his domestic opponents by embroiling himself constant and numerous scandals and repeating endless falsehoods. Here, again, DeMuth does not elaborate on why this is helpful. Having praised Trumps frequent, unpredictable and wide-ranging tweets, DeMuth praises him for his taciturn qualities: Trump did state that he had virtually finished a plan to repeal Obamacare, indicating the debate was over. But this comment reportedly confused his allies, who quickly discovered the plan Trump described was in fact entirely a figment of Trumps imagination. The debate has not even come close to ending. Trump, argues DeMuth positively but vaguely, is doing good things in the intelligence field: Trump attacked the Central Intelligence Agency, later visited the agency to deliver a rambling, self-aggrandizing speech about himself, appointed as director of National Intelligence Michael Flynn, a conspiracy theorist who pointedly rejects any data that fails to confirm his assumptions, and who Trump may well fire within his first month on the job. A good start! DeMuth does not explain what a bad start would look like."}, {"date": "2017/02/13", "title": "No, Hillary Clinton Is Not Plotting a 2020 Comeback", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/no-hillary-clinton-is-not-plotting-a-2020-comeback.html", "text": " Perhaps the final indignity for Hillary Rodham Clinton after her calamitous defeat last November is that talk is already circulating that she is plotting one more presidential campaign in 2020. Yes, its in the form of a piece appearing in Politico Magazine, where no horsy-racy speculation is too weird or premature. Yes, the author is a Republican  a former Bush speechwriter, no less  who disclaims any insider information. But still, the idea of one more Clinton Comeback Story being written at this moment is so annoying that Matt Latimers essay deserves a derisive response, or ten. It is possible the whole piece is an exercise in irony that I, a baby-boomer, do not get. If not, it is, to use a technical term, ludicrous. Clever boy that he is, Latimer hedges his bets despite the decisive headline (Clinton is running again) and teaser (Heres the proof). The qualifier  if she finds a path to do so  covers pretty much anything. But the evidence for his counterintuitive take is almost entirely circumstantial and mostly of the you cant prove she wont variety. Three of the signs Latimer sees for Clinton 2020 are actually things that did not happen: (1) the Clintons did not reverse a preelection promise to scale back the Clinton Global Initiative; (2) HRC did not rule out a political future for herself when she conceded defeat to Trump; and (3) she did not disappear, the way most defeated rivals do. They are most likely signs of absolutely nothing. The decision to wind down CGI may have been a painful one that the Clintons made too late to matter for 2016, but that by no means made it reversible or contingent on another campaign. Losing candidates do not always or even often make definitive statements about their careers on Election Night, which is why Latimer has to go all the way back to Nixon in 1962 for an example of what Clinton did not do. And Id say Hillary Clintons postelection visibility is significantly lower than the previous three defeated rivals, Mitt Romney, John McCain, and John Kerry. The only positive sign Latimer cites for Clintonian plotting is that HRC has signed a book deal. As he notes, this is her seventh book deal. Why is this one so remarkable? Are there reasons for politicians to sign book deals other than a future presidential run? Yes, there are, but the more pertinent question might be, has any politician ever turned down a book deal? So having proved nothing, Latimer is off to the races with speculation on how she might win the Democratic nomination. His main argument is that having lost twice as a front-runner, running as an underdog should do the trick because she did best in the past when she had none of the advantages she enjoyed in 2016. This is another non sequitur: Yes, underdogs sometimes win, but its not because they are underdogs. Wallis Simpson famously said you cannot be too rich or thin. Politicians cannot be too strong, unless it leads them to overconfidence and related mistakes, which are not great indicators for future success. Nobody, after all, is predicting a Jeb Bush presidency any more. Latimer must not have too much faith in either the underdog hypothesis or in his proofs Clinton is semi-openly plotting a comeback, because heres his ultimate scenario: It would be a surprise, all right, because it is so not happening. Please, scribblers, leave HRC to a dignified post-presidential-election career and then retirement. She will be forever renowned as the first woman to win a major-party presidential nomination. But she will be the Moses who could not enter the promised land of actually winning the White House, not the Joshua who finally broke the last glass ceiling. That could happen as soon as 2020. But it is time for the speculation to shift to the other women who might build on Hillary Clintons achievements."}, {"date": "2017/02/13", "title": "Justin Trudeau Is Now Part of Ivankas Plan to Address Womens Issues", "url": "http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/02/justin-trudeau-is-now-part-of-ivankas-plan-to-help-women.html", "text": " On Monday, human sunbeam Justin Trudeau met with Donald Trump at the White House to talk about women in the workforce.

And, because Trumps answer to any question about womens issues is Ivanka, the First Daughter was there, too. She was involved in recruiting participants and setting the agenda for the meeting, a White House official told the AP. And she doubtless had a hand in developing the portion of Trumps economic agenda the official said includes a focus on ensuring women enter and stay in the work force and addressing barriers facing female entrepreneurs. The meeting included such high-level female executives as General Electric Canada CEO Elyse Allan, TransAlta Corp. CEO Dawn Farrell, and Linamar Corp. CEO Linda Hasenfratz. Although Ivanka doesnt have a formal role in her dads administration, shes said she wants to fight for things like wage equality, child care, and really promoting more opportunities for women, which she says is very important to her. In the flurry of activity that followed his swearing in, Trump did relatively little to address women  unless you count reinstating the Global Gag Rule, which restricts abortion access for women around the world. His cabinet remains disproportionately white and male, and despite reports that Ivanka is calling lawmakers to discuss child-care legislation, no bill of that nature has materialized.

CNN was the first to report last night that Trump was joined at the dinner table by his embattled national security adviser, Mike Flynn, and chief strategist Stephen Bannon. As Mar-a-Lago members dining separately looked on, they reviewed classified documents with Bannon and Flynn using their cell-phone lights so Trump could see what he was reading. After that awkward exchange, Trump and Abe held a hastily assembled joint press conference where Trump made a statement that was shorter than his awkward handshake with Abe at the White House on Friday. What did Trump do after that? Bunker down with his National Security Council? Spend the evening on the phone with his Defense Secretary James Mattis? No. CNN reported that Trump dropped by a wedding that happened to be taking place at Mar-a-Lago, took the mic, and spoke to the guests.

About 20,000 marched in Mexico City. They packed the Paseo de la Reforma, waving Mexican flags and signs with slogans such as All Vs.

The United States and Mexico are natural friends and allies, but Trump is destroying this. Thousands of others joined protests in 18 other cities, including Tijuana and Puebla. Organizers dubbed the event Vibra Mexico; more than about 70 civic and social organizations signed on to the demonstration. Some people also spoke out against the Mexican government, and its president, Enrique Pea Nieto  while others sat out because they saw the protests as too supportive of the Mexican leader. Nieto suffers from abysmal approval ratings, but Mexicos feud with the Trump administration has served as a rallying cry for Mexican unity. Some of the presidents critics are wary that Trump is giving Nieto something of an out, and that the ire toward the American president  while justified  is distracting from Mexicos corruption problem and economic concerns, which have been issues since long before Trump moved into the White House. A rival march called Mexicanos Unidos was also organized, its participants calling on the country to band together behind Nieto. The two groups  though both anti-Trump  shouted insults back and forth when they encountered each other along the protest route.

At FiveThirtyEight Nathaniel Rakich puts the problem into historical context: Democrats lost 52 House seats in Clintons first midterm and 63 in Obamas. Republicans lost only 26 seats in Reagans first midterm, but thats larger than the loss of 24 that would flip the House to Democrats in 2018. What about the presidents who did a lot better in their first midterm? They had something in common, too: a national-security crisis. And from the Trump administrations point of view, W. offers not only the most recent model for a Republican president, but a best-case scenario in terms of approval ratings: In 2002, you may recall, Bushs party defied every modern precedent by gaining both House and Senate seats in a midterm while controlling the White House. His approval rating was at 67 percent going into those midterms, and there was one and only one reason for that lofty standing: 9/11. This is why Donald Trumps regular fanning of fears about terrorism and other national-security threats makes solid political sense whether or not it is justified by objective reality. Does he have a particular problem with women voters? W. did, too, until the security moms phenomenon of 2002 all but eliminated the gender gap. Now it is true that Democrats contributed to W.s unlikely ascent into an approval rating stratosphere by largely deferring to his national-security leadership after 9/11. It is hard to imagine them giving Trump the same political benefit, though it is also hard to know how they would behave in the wake of a major attack on the homeland. But there is no question Republicans from the White House on down will perceive it to be in their interest to keep Americans worried about their security up until and beyond the midterms.

The players may have been influenced by an open letter by Dave Zirin published in The Nation February 9 urging members of the delegation to pull out of it. The letter argued that the Israeli government was  aiming to use your fame to advance their own agenda: an agenda that comes at the expense of the Palestinian people. It was signed by a group of artists and human-rights activists, including Harry Belafonte, Angela Davis, and Danny Glover. Not long after the letter was published, Michael Bennett of the Seattle Seahawks announced he wouldnt be going, and soon he was joined by three other players: his younger brother Martellus of the New England Patriots (who has already said he wont be visiting the Donald Trump White House), Kenny Stills of the Miami Dolphins, and Justin Forsett of the Denver Broncos. In his thoughtful Twitter announcement, Michael Bennett referenced the Israeli governments own statements about the trips PR importance. I will not be used in such a manner, Bennett wrote. When I go to Israel  and I do plan to go  it will be to see not only Israel but also the West Bank and Gaza so I can see how the Palestinians, who have called this land home for thousands of years, live their lives. Stills and Forsett then quote-retweeted Bennett, announcing they too wouldnt be going, and Bennetts brother gave that indication as well. While the players decision was couched in general protest of Israels human-rights policies rather than in response to any specific act, its worth pointing out that this is all occurring shortly after Israel passed a highly controversial law that that would retroactively legalize Jewish settlements on privately owned Palestinian land, as the New York Times puts it, pressing ahead with a statement of right-wing assertiveness despite the likelihood that the countrys high court will nullify the legislation. The brazenness of that law might make for some tough optics for the remaining members of the delegation. On the other hand, despite the sustained international outcry over some Israeli policies, particularly settlement policy, Americans overwhelmingly say their sympathies lie more with the Israelis than with Palestinians. So from the NFL players perspectives, this is a bit of a damned if you do, damned if you dont situation."}, {"date": "2017/02/13", "title": "Yale to Rename Calhoun College for Computer Scientist Grace Hopper", "url": "http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/02/yale-to-rename-calhoun-college-for-grace-hopper.html", "text": " Yales Calhoun College  named after the nations seventh vice-president and prominent defender of slavery, John C.

On Saturday, the university announced that they would be dropping John C. Calhouns name from the college and naming it after a female computer-programming visionary, Grace Hopper. Back in April 2016, Yale president Peter Salovey said that they would not be renaming Calhoun College, which he explained by saying that erasing Calhouns name from a much-beloved residential college risks masking this past, downplaying the lasting effects of slavery, and substituting a false and misleading narrative, albeit one that might allow us to feel complacent or, even, self-congratulatory. Hes since appeared to have come around to the arguments against the name. John C. Calhouns principles, his legacy as an ardent supporter of slavery as a positive good, are at odds with this university, Salovey told reporters following news that the university would in fact be dropping Calhouns name. Rear Admiral Grace Hopper, the new namesake of the residential college, was a visionary computer programmer who earned her masters and Ph.D. at Yale. She served in the Navy during World War II and was a pioneer in automatic programming (and, unsurprisingly, faced resistance from the heavily male tech world at the time). In 2016, Hopper received the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously.

By late Sunday night, the situation had improved, but the evacuation order has yet to be lifted. The lake, which is about 150 miles northeast of San Francisco, is held back by the 770-foot-tall Oroville Dam, the tallest in the country. Record storms took Lake Oroville from 80 percent full to overflowing in less than a week, as the L.A. Times explains. While the dam itself is structurally sound, last week a hole caused by erosion was discovered on the main spillway. It spread across the concrete-lined channel, and on Saturday the emergency spillway was used for the first time since the dam was completed in 1968. Initially the system appeared to be working, but on Sunday engineers spotted a hole in the emergency spillway. At 4:20 p.m local time, an evacuation order was issued for everyone living downstream of Lake Orovilles dam. They have what they expect to be an imminent failure of the axillary spillway, said Mike Smith, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. What theyre expecting is as much as 30 vertical feet of the top of the spillway could fail and could fail within one to two hours. We dont know how much water that means, but we do know thats potentially 30 feet of depth of Lake Oroville. Residents of Butte, Sutter, and Yuba rushed out of the area, creating gridlock for miles. An evacuation shelter was set up in Chico, which is north of the lake, at the Silver Dollar fairgrounds. Belen Castaneda, 23, told the Times she was headed there with her family and an elderly neighbor who doesnt speak English. We just grabbed everything we could, she said. Everyone was freaking out. Late on Sunday night the threat decreased when water stopped flowing into the emergency spillway. Officials said they plan to use bags of rocks to plug the hole in the emergency spillway, but the situation is still precarious. Storms are forecast for later this week, and officials said they need to keep draining water from the lake for as long as possible. California governor Jerry Brown issued an emergency order on Sunday night. Ive been in close contact with emergency personnel managing the situation in Oroville throughout the weekend and its clear the circumstances are complex and rapidly changing, Brown said in a statement. The state is directing all necessary personnel and resources to deal with this very serious situation. Eight California National Guard helicopters will assist with the attempt to reconstruct the emergency spillway. All 23,000 soldiers in the California National Guard have been notified that they should be ready to deploy if needed. According to the AP, the entire California National Guard hasnt been put on alert since the 1992 L.A. riots."}, {"date": "2017/02/13", "title": "Trump Tackles North Korea Crisis in Crowded Mar-a-Lago Dining Room", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-tackles-north-korea-crisis-in-mar-a-lago-dining-room.html", "text": " National Security Adviser Michael Flynns future in the Trump administration looks increasingly uncertain, and now the New York Times reports that in addition to potentially breaking the law by discussing U.S. sanctions with with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in December, hes also doing a poor job of managing the National Security Council. Beyond the drama surrounding Flynn personally, the latest leaks  which come from more than two dozen current and former NSC staffers  paint a frightening picture of the Trump administrations approach to national security matters. Its so far a very dysfunctional NSC, Representative Adam Schiff, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told the paper. Unrest within the NSC is not unusual in the beginning of a presidents term, but this is different. Hundreds of career civil servants work for the NSC, and many left because they didnt want to work for the Trump administration. The Times reports that the remaining staffers see the job as apolitical, so theyve been troubled by their new bosses behavior, from bringing Trump mugs into meetings with foreign officials, to Deputy National Security Adviser K.T. McFarland telling them they need to make America great again, to White House senior adviser Stephen Miller acting as chairman during a meeting of the national security deputies. Many Trump appointees are former members of the military, and last week Defense Secretary James Mattis reportedly looked into whether the Navy could board an Iranian ship to look for weapons it may be transporting to Houthi fighters in Yemen. Some questioned whether it was legal or prudent to risk a possible clash with the Iranian military  particularly in light of the controversy surrounding the recent raid in Yemen  and the plan was scrapped once news of the possible operation leaked. In other instances, the Trump teams military experts werent as up on government procedure as one would think. Per the Times: Flynn is also said to be unclear on how to call up the National Guard in an emergency. And aides say hes (understandably) worried about a shadow council created Steve Bannon, Trumps chief strategist, who the paper notes sees the United States as headed toward an inevitable confrontation with two adversaries  China and Iran. Unsurprisingly, President Trump is reportedly generating plenty of chaos himself. As previously reported, the president prefers memos to be kept to a single page, with bullet points. Now the Times reports that the page is also supposed to include many graphics and maps. The president likes maps, explained one official. NSC staffers are also having difficulty making sense of the presidents wishes. Many do not know what is said during phone calls with foreign leaders, and the Times reports that council staff members get up in the morning, read President Trumps Twitter posts and struggle to make policy to fit them. Two officials said there was talk of composing suggested tweets for the president in an effort to keep him in line with their foreign-policy efforts. But dont take the NSC leakers word for it; theres also a disturbing new account from people dining at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday night. They say they got to watch Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe figure out how to respond to North Koreas latest provocation as the pair ate iceberg wedge salads on the terrace of the presidents Florida club. After spending the day golfing with the Japanese leader, President Trump answered a call about North Koreas ballistic missile test on a mobile phone, as the leaders were seated in the middle of the private clubs dining area with their wives. CNN reports: The article notes that many of Mar-a-Lagos paying members view dinner at the club as an opportunity for a few seconds of face time with the new president. Now people may join the club in the hopes of sitting in on high-level strategy meetings, as Chelsea Clinton pointed out: But whos reading the former first daughters Twitter late on Sunday night? Has anyone thought of plugging these new perks for Mar-a-Lago members from the White House briefing room?"}, {"date": "2017/02/13", "title": "Will Trump Stand by Michael Flynn?", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/will-trump-stand-by-michael-flynn.html", "text": " National security advisor Michael Flynns rough week didnt get any better over the weekend. Following the news that the former general reportedly discussed U.S. sanctions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in December, then apparently misled his transition-team colleagues about it, the White House is giving the issue the silent treatment, unnamed National Security Council staffers are leaking up a storm, Democratic lawmakers are asking for Flynns security clearance to be revoked, and tensions between him and the intelligence community appear to be worsening. On Sunday night, the Wall Street Journal additionally reported that a White House review, led by Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, is quietly underway on the question of whether or not to retain Flynn. On Thursday, the Washington Post and others reported that several U.S. officials with access to intercepted communications between Flynn and Kislyak had confirmed that Flynn had discussed the new election-related sanctions in December, possibly breaking the law. In that conversation, Flynn allegedly urged Russia to temper their response to the new sanctions, which were implemented by President Obama over Russias meddling in the U.S. presidential election. He also may have signaled that the Trump administration would amend the sanctions after they came into power, though there is no reported evidence that he explicitly promised as much, and if he did, it remains unclear if he did so independently. The investigation is ongoing, but heres how War in Contexts Paul Woodward unpacks the former concern: Flynn and White House officials repeatedly denied that he and Kislyak discussed sanctions during the call. (At one point, an official even insisted that Flynn had just been calling Kislyak to wish him a Merry Christmas, amidst other explanations.) Those denials started to unravel on Thursday, however, when Flynn, through his spokesperson, revised his stance, saying he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, but couldnt be certain that the topic never came up. Another denial regarding the sanctions discussion had come from Vice-President Pence during a television interview in mid-January, but the story out of the White House is that Pences denial was based on what Flynn had told him, indicating that Flynn likely misled the vice-president. On Saturday, an unnamed White House official told the Associated Press that Flynn still had Trumps full confidence in light of the report, but on Sunday, White House senior policy advisor Stephen Miller dodged questions as to how Trump and other top White House officials were feeling about Flynns actions. When Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked Miller if Trump still has confidence in Flynn, Miller passed the buck. Thats the question that I think you should ask the president, the question you should ask [Chief of Staff Reince Priebus,] Miller replied. He added that the White House did not give me anything to say on the sensitive matter. Miller made similar non-illuminating remarks on ABCs This Week. All told, it was obviously not a robust defense of Flynn by the White House. Also on Sunday, a New York Times report came out detailing the drama around Flynn and the extraordinary dysfunction within the National Security Council, according to dozens of current and former council staff members who requested anonymity. The dispirited staffers paint a picture of Flynn as an out-of-his-depth manager who is overly reliant on military-style thinking and insecure over whether or not his campaign-level open access to Trump is waning. Flynn is also apparently (and understandably) worried about the influence of a shadow council started by Steve Bannon, Trumps world-disruption-loving chief strategist. In one example from the report, the leakers explain that Flynn apparently did not realize that the White House needed Congress and the State Department to carry out the transfer of weapons and technology to allies like Saudi Arabia. In another, they note that Flynn was partially responsible for some of the confusion among top administration officials regarding Trumps executive orders. Flynns trusted deputy, K.T. McFarland, who at one point apparently told Council members that it was now their job to make America great again, does not come across as particularly competent either. On Friday at The Atlantic, David Graham wondered if Flynn would become the Trump administrations first sacrificial lamb: Doing so would also remove what is quickly becoming a major target for politicians across the aisle, as the criticism and calls for Flynns head from Democratic lawmakers continue to intensify. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi declared on Saturday that General Flynn should be suspended and have his intelligence clearance revoked until the facts are known about his secret contacts with the Russians. Pelosi also wants the FBI to deepen its ongoing investigation into the Trump campaigns ties to the Russian regime and called for an outside commission to be launched by Congress into the matter. Pelosis statement regarding Flynn echoes similar calls by top Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, Foreign Relations Committee, and Oversight Committee. If this new report is true, we need to ask not only whether General Flynn should be leading our national security efforts, but whether he should even hold a security clearance, Representative Elijah Cummings, the top Democratic on the Oversight Committee, said in a statement on Friday  and he went even further on Sunday. Theres also the question of whether or not Flynn broke the law, assuming he did in fact strategize with the Kremlin over how they should respond to Obamas new sanctions. The Weekly Standards Max Boot quashes that notion: Also on Friday, Politico reported that one of Flynns closest allies had been denied elite security clearance by the CIA, effectively firing Flynns ally, senior director for Africa Robin Townley, from the National Security Council. Townley will retain his top-secret clearance, but his request for Sensitive Compartmented Information was rejected. Politico frames the move, which was approved by Trumps CIA director Mike Pompeo, as a sign of escalating tension between Flynn and the intelligence community. Townley, like Flynn, has been a critic of current intelligence methods, and a source told Politico that Flynn and his allies believe this is a hit job from inside the CIA on Flynn and the people close to him. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, rejected that assertion, commenting that security clearance is always denied for a reason, and Flynn was probably just being paranoid. Regardless, its still not clear why Townley didnt make the cut. Politicos reporting also suggests that that a growing number of people in the White House are working to get rid of Flynn, and some blame him for Trumps ill-advised campaign against the intelligence community after intel officials reached the conclusion that Russia had interfered in the election in an effort to help get Trump elected. Flynn had been critical of those conclusions, which he and Trump suggested were politically biased. Responding to these reports at Hot Air, conservative blogger Allahpundit tries to make sense of all the knives that are now out for Flynn: In a Wall Street Journal report published Sunday, a Trump administration official said that Flynn has apologized to everyone, regarding the distracting controversy. They also pass along the claim that Bannon and Flynn had dinner over the weekend, but that Bannon both wants to keep Flynn around as well as be ready to let him go should that need arise. Its not clear where Vice President Pence or Jared Kushner, Trumps son-in-law and trusted advisor, stand on Flynn, but according to the Journal, some administration officials are hoping that Flynn will just resign on his own. Trump himself had nothing to say about the story when asked about it on Friday night, though he just claimed he was not yet familiar with the reports about Flynn, which seems unlikely considering the apparently disproportionate amount of time Trump spends consuming news coverage every day. Trump has not weighed in on the story on Twitter, either, which is also out of character considering how widely discussed the scandal has been in the media. Indeed, Trump aides told the Times that the president was, in fact, closely watching the reaction to the Flynn story, so his silence may be telling. The Journal reported on Sunday that Trump has also privately told people that he finds the controversy around Flynn unwelcome, but another source said that Trump also wants to keep moving forward with Flynn. Elsewhere, the Washington Posts Jennifer Rubin flags another reason why Flynn could find himself being boxed out of Trumps circle of trust: If it turns out that Flynn has been one of the bigger leakers in the very leak-prone White House, his exit could calm the Trump administration turmoil in more ways than one. The Atlantics David Frum offers another calculated possibility, should Trump be willing to get rid of his once-trusted adviser: Flynns quick demise could present the White House with an opportunity for some much-needed political jujitsu regarding the Russian connection. Then again, as David Atkins argues at the Washington Monthly, if Trump maintains an ongoing and irrational allegiance to Flynn, it could also be the mark of a more devious consideration from within the White House: Thats an interesting theory, and certainly one that would confirm the worst fears (and biases) of those opposed to Trump, but its also important to note that ordinary political considerations have rarely seemed important to Trump, and its just as likely that he would hold onto Flynn because Donald Trump doesnt like being forced to do something, doesnt want to prove anyone right, or maybe just likes hearing Flynns jokes. All the political analysis notwithstanding, the norm-destroying new president is not a politician. It may thus be foolish to presume that Trump will be motivated by any kind of traditional political calculus rather than more self-centered concerns like a sense of embarrassment or personal betrayal, strong pushback from his daughter or son-in-law, or, perhaps, the discomfort of seeing a male associate portrayed by a woman. Then again, presuming Trump will cave under the political pressure to fire Flynn is no more foolish than a certain former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency not realizing that his phone call with a Russian ambassador might have been tapped by U.S. intelligence. This post has been updated to incorporate new details contained in stories published by the New York Times and Wall Street Journal on Sunday night."}, {"date": "2017/02/13", "title": "Trump and the Right-Wing Populist Tradition of Judge-Bashing", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-and-the-right-wing-populist-tradition-of-judge-bashing.html", "text": " One of the questions immediately raised by Donald Trumps attacks on federal district judge James Robart and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals  who together have delivered a strong legal rebuke to his executive order pausing travel from seven countries  is whether theres any precedent for this sort of Constitution-threatening contempt for the supposedly independent judiciary. The short answer with respect to Trump himself is yes. His assault on the legitimacy of the Mexican judge supervising a suit against Trump University was one of the many scandals of the moguls presidential campaign. But without question, Trump was and is tapping into a tradition of right-wing populist contempt for the judiciary that is nearly as old as the republic  and as disreputable as the segregationists that were the most conspicuous recent judge bashers. Early advocates of both states rights and popular government instinctively mistrusted and often criticized a federal judiciary dominated by Federalist appointees of George Washington and John Adams. The emerging constitutional principle of judicial review was famously worked out through an extended battle between President Thomas Jefferson and Chief Justice John Marshall. Populist defiance of the courts spiked again during the presidency of Trumps self-styled model, Andrew Jackson, who struggled with Marshall on many issues related to states rights  most notably, state resistance to the Bank of the United States and state resistance to very limited efforts to protect Native Americans. Jackson was a staunch ally of the states on both of these issues. But as Jeffey Rosen points out, both he and before him Jefferson stopped short of total defiance of their black-robed adversaries. Indeed, when push came to shove and South Carolina asserted the right to nullify federal laws, Old Hickory sided with the federal government and its courts despite his hatred of what we might today call big government. The Jacksonian tradition, however, fed a persistent mistrust of unelected judges, often thought (with good reason) to represent propertied elites determined to use the judiciary to protect their economic privileges. Such mistrust led a majority of states to embrace popular election of judges for fixed terms at the state level (a habit that endures today in much of the country). While federal judges continued up to and beyond the Civil War to represent a potential if not actual threat to conservative states-rights principles connected with slavery, the left-wing populists of the late 19th century also rightly feared judges would halt enactment of their proposals to implement government protections against the power of the privileged. Left-of-center hostility to federal judges peaked during what is known as the Lochner era of Supreme Court jurisprudence, when courts routinely struck down progressive social legislation as violating the due process rights of economic aristocrats. A real constitutional crisis ended in 1937 as FDRs threats to pack the Supreme Court by expanding its membership were quietly shelved and SCOTUS stopped systematic obstruction of New Deal legislation. Thereafter populist anger at federal judges largely shifted to those on the right and stayed there. The populist judge-bashing with which Donald Trump would be most personally familiar  not being, by general assent, much of a reader of history or of anything else  would be the long, intense assault on the federal judiciarys promulgation and enforcement of desegregation and related rulings from the mid-1950s into the 1970s. Its there that Trumps lexicon of abuse for judges finds its most resonant and not-so-distant echoes. Throughout the civil-rights era, virtually no white southern political speech was complete without an assault on the Earl Warren Court and its effort to decimate the states rights doctrines so intimately associated with Jim Crow. (Indeed, a direct link between that era and ours is the right-wing John Birch Society, enthusiastic Trump supporters who in the 1950s launched and continued an Impeach Earl Warren campaign.) The idea that courts had the power to insist on desegregation was inseparable from the right-wing southern populism of the era. Historian Mark Grimsley writes: Exotic constitutional theories like interposition (the alleged power of the states to exercise their sovereignty to dispute federal judicial rulings) and the old South Carolina standby of nullification (too much, obviously, even for Andrew Jackson) were very much in the air in southern political circles. And in a perverse sort of interdependence, southern states often ceded control over whole areas of government  especially prisons and hospitals  to federal judges so that they could be blamed for controversial and expensive policies treating African-Americans as human beings. Nobody was more masterful at the game of judge-bashing than the last great right-wing populist of the civil-rights era, George C. Wallace, who from the beginning of his national political career rivaled Trump in attacking judges as usurping the power of the people and the pols they elected. From his Washington Post obituary: During his 1968 presidential run, Wallaces American Independent Party called for a constitutional amendment to require periodic popular confirmation of federal judges, including Supreme Court justices. By his next and most dangerously successful presidential bid, in 1972, Wallace spent a good part of his time attacking federal judges for insisting upon this asinine busing of little school children. At least Wallace, a former judge himself, knew how to articulate a legally coherent argument for reducing the power of the federal judiciary. Jackson was a licensed attorney as well, and he knew where populist rhetoric ended and the rule of law had to begin. Donald Trump appears to have adopted the invective associated with right-wing populist assaults on federal judges without the training necessary to know when to draw back. And if the incredulity he expressed at Neil Gorsuchs reported horror at his judge-bashing is any indication, Trump is not much going to tolerate anyone who tells him otherwise."}, {"date": "2017/02/12", "title": "North Korea Conducts First Ballistic Missile Test Under Trump", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/north-korea-tests-fires-first-ballistic-missile-under-trump.html", "text": " North Korea test-fired a ballistic missile on Sunday, marking Pyongyangs first such provocation during the presidency of Donald Trump. The medium- or intermediate-range ballistic missile landed in the Sea of Japan, but did not reach Japans territorial waters. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had recently warned that his regime was ready to test an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the U.S., but U.S. Strategic Command says Sundays missile posed no such threat, and reportedly traveled only 310 miles. Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, who is spending the weekend with President Trump at Trumps private Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida, appeared with Trump at an odd, hastily arranged press conference on Saturday night to denounce the test. Trump had been previously asked about the test during a photo opportunity with the media on Saturday night, but did not respond to the questions. Then, an hour later, the media was asked to reassemble for a two-minute press conference during which Abe said, through a translator, that North Koreas missile launch was absolutely intolerable and called on the rogue state to comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions banning the country from pursuing such weapons. Abe also explained that Trump had assured him that the U.S. would always be with Japan 100 percent and that Trump was appearing with him to demonstrate that commitment. Trump then added, without mentioning North Korea or the missile test, that I just want everybody to understand and fully know that the United States of America stands behind Japan, its great ally, 100 percent. The pair of leaders then left the press conference without taking questions from reporters. During the Obama administration, President Trump had ridiculed the government for not being able to prevent such tests: He also rejected Kim Jong Uns ICBM-readiness prediction back in early January (though the North Korean leader had only said they were ready to test an ICBM, not a nuclear ICBM): Looking at the presidents other comments on the region, Trump has repeatedly insisted that South Korea (and Japan) should have to pay the U.S. for protection against North Korea, or that the longtime U.S. ally should have to start protecting itself. He has also falsely stated that South Korea doesnt pay anything for the military bases that the U.S. operates in the country. Trump seemed to immediately reverse himself on these opinions following his election, but did not mention South Korea on Saturday night. Following the launch, acting South Korean president Hwang Kyo-ahn said that he and the international community are working together to take punitive actions appropriate for this launch. Trumps national-security advisor, Michael Flynn, apparently condemned the test when speaking with South Korean officials, and said that the U.S. would seek all possible options to prevent future launches, according to Kyo-ahn. North Korea has been trying to advance its long-range and nuclear weapon capabilities for some time and conducted two nuclear tests and numerous rocket launches last year. They have never successfully tested an ICBM."}, {"date": "2017/02/12", "title": "Chaffetz Claims, Without Evidence, That Town-Hall Protesters Were Paid Outsiders", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/chaffetz-claims-town-hall-protesters-were-paid-outsiders.html", "text": " Republican congressman Jason Chaffetz is now claiming that the crowd of participants who confronted him at a town hall in his Utah district on Thursday night included a large contingent of paid agitators from out of state.

Furthermore, Chaffetz wrote off the protesters as Democrats who couldnt come to terms with the election of President Trump and just wanted to lash out.

But Chaffetz, whose enthusiastic plan to spend four years investigating Hillary Clintons emails was spoiled by Trumps victory on Election Day, also seems chafed at the idea that constituents might want him to make sure the president isnt breaking any laws. People are asking me to use the power of Congress to do a full-on fishing expedition to investigate him personally on things that are not required by law, he told the Deseret News. I think my doing that would be an abuse of power. Chaffetz has repeatedly shrugged off calls to use his Oversight Committee to conduct oversight of the president.

Immigration lawyers, activists, and Democratic lawmakers say they are hearing reports that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have been setting up checkpoints, conducting random sweeps, and in at least one purported instance, going door to door in a Hispanic community in Atlanta and asking for peoples papers. These stories are mostly unconfirmed, and ICE officials strongly deny such claims, announcing in a statement that the rash of recent reports about purported ICE checkpoints and random sweeps are false, dangerous and irresponsible. (Its worth noting that over the past few weeks, there have also been at least some reports of anti-immigrant checkpoints that have turned out to be hoaxes.) ICE also says the raids had been planned before the Trump administration released its executive orders. The DHS has confirmed that raids  or targeted enforcement actions as ICE prefers to call them  have taken place in New York City, Atlanta, Chicago, and the Los Angeles metro area, as well as in North and South Carolina. Other reports from the media and from the immigration-activist community indicate that raids have also been conducted in Texas, Florida, Kansas, and Northern Virginia. In Texas, the Mexican consulate in Austin said on Friday that 44 people had been detained by federal authorities in the state over two days. The circumstances surrounding those detentions are not clear. In Los Angeles, ICE announced on Friday that 160 foreign nationals had been arrested over the five-day period and that 150 of them had criminal histories, five had final orders of removal or had been previously deported, and 37 had already been deported. An ICE official in Atlanta reported 200 arrests across Georgia and the Carolinas. The total national number of immigrants detained in the raids remains unknown, and the government wont report that total until Monday, but it does seem clear that the vast majority were adult men. Its not clear if or when ICE has conducted a coordinated, several-day, multi-state enforcement surge of this scale before, but there have been comparable single-state efforts targeting criminal aliens in the past, like a four-day operation in Los Angeles that led to the arrests of 112 foreign nationals back in July. For a larger context, ICE reported a total of 65,332 interior removals in the 2016 fiscal year, which is the number of foreign nationals apprehended by ICE officers someplace other than near the U.S. border. News of this weeks raids, which followed the controversial arrest and deportation to Mexico of a 35-year-old mother of two on Wednesday, has already led to organized protests on Thursday and Friday night in Los Angeles and on Friday night in New York: Meanwhile, immigration lawyers, activists, and other aligned organizations have been working to inform anxious immigrants of their rights should they encounter ICE agents. The Mexican government has also issued a blanket warning to all its citizens in the U.S. noting that they face a new reality and should take precautions including staying informed with the latest news and getting in touch with their nearest Mexican consulate, in the face of more severe application of migration controls by the U.S. Immigrants with high-level criminal backgrounds were already prioritized for deportation under the Obama administration, which deported dramatically higher numbers of immigrants than any previous president. Late last month, President Trump signed an executive order expanding the classifications for prioritized deportation to such a point that every undocumented immigrant in the country could be targeted. According to the American Immigration Lawyers Association, this weeks raids were allegedly targeting (via ICEs already-underway Operation Crosscheck program): They add that: Thus far, government officials have not acknowledged any connection between the surge of raids and Trumps executive order, but a DHS official has confirmed to the Post that, in accordance with Trumps order, agents were also capturing undocumented immigrants in the vicinity of those they had originally targeted. Speaking for himself, President Trump seemed to approvingly reference the raids Sunday morning on Twitter: Regardless, it seems clear that ICE is definitely expecting to go after the expanded categories of undocumented immigrants in the future, even if thats not what they were doing this past week, and one immigration official told the Post that big cities were going to target-rich environments because of their large populations of undocumented immigrants. Pew says that 61 percent of the estimated 11.1 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. reside across just 20 major metropolitan areas. Many of those cities have promised not to work with federal authorities to target, detain, and deport those residents, and Trump has signed an executive order going after those cities federal funding as well. Its also possible, as NBC News points out, that ICE could have helped tamp down the resulting hysteria within immigrant communities by being more transparent about their actions. Along those lines, leaders of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus have now sent a letter to the acting director of ICE, asking for a meeting and for clarification as to how ICE policy has or will change with respect to Trumps order. These raids have struck fear in the hearts of the immigrant community as many fear that President Trumps promised deportation force is now in full-swing, the letter warns. They also want more detail on exactly who was targeted and detained in the raids, asking for the location of the raids, the number of individuals detained and deported, the number of parents of minor children that were apprehended, the reason for the apprehension as well as the number of people apprehended with criminal convictions and the types of criminal convictions. Trump has repeatedly promised to deport the as many as 3 million undocumented immigrants with criminal backgrounds that he says are currently living in the U.S., but the actual actionable number could be as a low as 690,000. What happens to the other 9-million-plus undocumented immigrants under Trumps new policy, or measures he has yet to order, remains to be seen."}, {"date": "2017/02/10", "title": "White House Wont Appeal Travel-Ban Case to Supreme Court", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/white-house-wont-appeal-travel-ban-case-to-supreme-court.html", "text": " Shortly after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals declined to reinstate the Trump administrations ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations Thursday night, the president released a statement: It wasnt clear whom, precisely, Trump was vowing to see in court, but one thing was certain: The president was taking his case to the Supreme Court.

The defensive end, who publicly spoke out in favor of 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and his national-anthem protest earlier this year, wrote on Twitter that hes skipping the visit. His tweet came in response to a Daily News column calling on him to join his teammates after his Kaepernick comments made him stand out in a pathetic sea of NFL white silence. At least one other player has suggested he may join the six above. Running back James White said Tuesday that hes still making up his mind.

In their remarks, both leaders emphasized the importance of the relationship between Japan and the U.S., with Trump calling it the cornerstone of peace and stability in the Pacific region. Trump also revealed that he and Abe became total bros after their meeting at Trump Tower in November. On Friday, Trump said he didnt shake Abes hand when the prime minister arrived at the White House, he grabbed him and hugged him because thats the way we feel. Trump added: We have a very, very good bond. Very, very good chemistry. Ill let you know if it changes, but I dont think it will, Trump added. At one point Trump thanked Abe and the people of Japan for hosting our armed forces, a noticeable departure from the campaign trail when he complained that Japan did not pay the full cost of hosting U.S. military bases. As a candidate, Trump also blasted the treaty that calls on the U.S. to defend Japan but does not require the Japanese to come to the aide of the U.S. in case of attack. You know we have a treaty with Japan, where if Japan is attacked, we have to use the full force and might of the United States, he said in August. If were attacked, Japan doesnt have to do anything. They can sit home and watch Sony television. One of the two reporters Trump called on at the presser asked him about the Ninth Circuit Courts refusal to reinstate his travel ban. Well be doing something very rapidly having to do with additional security for our country, he said. Youll be seeing that sometime next week. In addition we will continue to go through the court process and ultimately I have no doubt that well win that particular case. Abes remarks included some sly stroking of Trumps ego as he congratulated the president for his election win and hyped his golf game. Asked twice by U.S. journalists to comment on Trumps cancellation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Abe would only say we are aware of President Trumps decision. The highlight of the afternoon came not at the presser but when Trump and Abe shook hands for a good 20 seconds in the Oval Office as photographers snapped their pictures.

Abramss apparent selection was not treated as a scandal. But in a less degenerate republic, it would have been: The last time Abrams worked at the State Department, he helped the Reagan White House covertly sell weapons to Iran  in defiance of an embargo  so as to fund reactionary rebels in Nicaragua, in defiance of a federal law that Congress had passed 411 to 0. After his crime against the rule of law was exposed, Abrams lied to Congress about what he had done. He eventually pled guilty for that last offense, but was promptly pardoned by our first President Bush. When Abrams wasnt undermining democratic rule at home, he promoted genocide abroad. As the Nations Eric Alterman writes: Nevertheless, Abrams persisted. A decade after George H.W. Bush pardoned his crime against Congress, Abrams was plotting coups against democratically elected South American governments  as an adviser to George W. Later, Abrams oversaw the National Security Council directorate responsible for promoting Democracy, Human Rights  which is a bit like having Hannibal Lecter oversee the directorate of Homicide Reduction and Veganism. During his campaign, Trump pledged not to surround himself with those who have perfect rsums but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war. We have to look to new people because many of the old people frankly dont know what theyre doing, the GOP nominee continued, even though they may look awfully good writing in the New York Times or being watched on television. This is a (generous) description of Elliott Abrams. But the president did not hold that against him. Rex Tillerson and Jared Kushner both lobbied the president on Abramss behalf. And, after a meeting with the war criminal, Trump was prepared to make the neoconservative his number-two diplomat. And then, Trump came upon a column Abrams had written in May 2016, titled When You Cant Stand Your Candidate. The party has nominated someone who cannot win and should not be president of the United States, Abrams wrote. Do not allow the Republican convention to be a coronation wherein Trump and Trumpism are unchallenged  The party needs to be reminded that there are deep divisions, and Trump needs to be reminded of how many in the party oppose and even fear his nomination.

The first phase is the easiest to complete and calls for $360 million to build 26 miles of wall near San Diego and El Paso.

His name adorns legislation that would repeal Medicaid expansion and shunt many with preexisting conditions into high-risk pools  two of the least popular ideas in the Obamacare-replacement debate. When he isnt drafting widely despised health-care proposals, Price likes to buy the stocks of medical companies that would benefit from his bills. In March 2016, Price bought $15,000 worth of stock in Zimmer Biomet, a medical device company. Two days later, the congressman introduced a bill that would have protected that company from a cut in its Medicare reimbursement rate. Zimmer Biomet then put money in his campaign coffers. Last summer, Price made a bulk purchase of discounted shares in Innate Immuno, an Australian biotechnology company. Shortly thereafter, he helped push through legislation that expedites the FDAs approval process  a reform that directly benefits Innate Immuno, which is working to get its wares onto the U.S. market. Price has already enjoyed a 400 percent paper gain on his investment in the company. At his confirmation hearings, Price was asked about how he managed to get that discount on Innate Immunos shares. The congressman replied that the discounted shares were available to every single individual that was an investor at the time. Weeks later, The Wall Street Journal found that the cabinet nominee was one of fewer than 20 U.S. investors who were invited last year to buy discounted shares of the company  an opportunity that, for Mr. Price, arose from an invitation from a company director and fellow congressmen. So, it at least looks like Price lied to Congress  which is a federal crime. None of this stopped the Senate from putting Price in charge of the Health Department: In a 52-to-47, party-line vote early Friday morning, the upper chamber confirmed the former doctor as head of Health and Human Services. You could paint this as a conservative triumph, a testament to Republican unity and Democratic impudence: Trump nominated a Health secretary with deeply unpopular ideas about health care and an apparent insider-trading scandal  who couldnt get through his confirmation hearings without (ostensibly) committing perjury  and the GOP still got the president his man. But read that sentence again and ask yourself: Who benefits from the new Republican Health Secretarys being an opponent of Medicare whos mired in allegations of corruption? As Voxs Matt Yglesias has noted, its not clear how its in the GOPs interest to rubber-stamp Trumps most unqualified and deeply compromised nominees. There are plenty of Republicans who support school vouchers and quasi-theocratic rule. Surely, some of them also know the basics of education policy, and can get through a confirmation hearing without saying the words potential grizzlies. Betsy DeVos is going to be the voice of the Trump administration on matters of education. And shes bad at public speaking. Beyond the fact that she paid top dollar for the gig, its hard to see why Republicans would want her to be Education Secretary. Likewise, its difficult to see why Trump would want Tom Price to be the face of Republican health care  and, thus, of Obamacare repeal. This week, Republican senator Mike Lee said that it would be harder for his party to repeal the health-care law if they load down the bill with what comes next  ostensibly because, once you get into the details of the GOPs replacement plans, repealing Obamacare becomes markedly less popular. But elevating Price makes it more difficult for Republicans to hide the ball. The Health Secretarys own replacement plan is the most detailed  and politically toxic  on Capitol Hill. Prices approach to health care makes Paul Ryans look like Bernie Sanderss: While Ryan merely wants to reduce federal funding for Medicaid expansion, Prices bill eliminates it entirely; and while Ryan wants to toss those with preexisting conditions into high-risk pools with an annual subsidy of $25 billion, Price thinks those pools can get by with $3 billion. For Democrats, the ideal narrative about Obamacare repeal goes something like this: The Republicans are coming for Medicaid recipients and cancer patients today  and then for Medicare enrollees tomorrow  all so that they can cut taxes on themselves and their filthy rich donors. By confirming Tom Price  an enemy of Medicare and Medicaid, who pushed health-care policies that would directly increase his own net worth  Republicans have given Democrats the perfect villain for their story."}, {"date": "2017/02/10", "title": "French Authorities Foil Imminent Terror Plot Against Paris", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/french-authorities-foil-imminent-terror-plot-against-paris.html", "text": " French police arrested four people, including a 16-year-old girl, who were allegedly plotting a terror attack in Paris.

Or does he want to use the frustration of his plans by the courts to score political points and enrage his followers? That question arises because it is becoming abundantly clear that the way Trump and his closest associates have handled and continue to handle the promulgation and implementation of the travel ban is undermining its legal validity under judicial scrutiny. Two particular straws in the wind captured in the Ninth Circuit decision are worthy of notice. First, the judges refused to put aside the abundant evidence of religious malice in the record surrounding the travel ban, suggesting such evidence might make an order that is otherwise a legitimate exercise of the presidents national-security powers run afoul of the establishment and equal protection clauses. And second, the judges mocked the ex post facto modification of the order by the White House counsel to exclude permanent U.S. residents as amateurish and legally insufficient. In retrospect, the sloppy legal work and counterproductive messaging surrounding the order are what is most obviously keeping judges from intervening to save the administrations bacon. And Trump himself keeps making it worse with tweets attacking the independence of the judiciary that cannot help his case. He seems unable to rein himself in. Last night, in the immediate wake of the Ninth Circuit ruling, he tweeted like an excited teenager: SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE! And this morning, having apparently seen a quote from a legal website about the Ninth Circuit decision, he rushed to share it: If he had actually read the Lawfare article in question (by Benjamin Wittes) in its entirety, he would have known that while it did chide the judges for not more thoroughly considering the presidents statutory authority over immigration, it also agreed with their decision to leave Judge Robarts restraining order in place, and concluded that the incompetent malevolence with which this order was promulgated is the main reason Trump might not prevail on the merits. He probably should not have drawn attention to it. Now the administration faces a decision as to whether it will pursue its demand for immediate reinstatement of the travel ban to the Supreme Court, where is is very unlikely to get its way, or instead let the case on the merits go forward in Judge Robarts court in Seattle. Under the latter scenario, arguments by the government that were insufficient to justify an emergency reinstatement of the travel ban would be a lot stronger in defending its constitutionality. And just as important, Trumps lawyers would have the time to do some repair work on the factual basis for the executive order that was ignored in the rush to shut down travel. But that gets us back to the original question: Does Trump care whether he wins in court? Or is he strictly playing to the galleries, consumed not with persuading judges he is right but with blaming them for any future terrorist attacks?

If youre a veteran reader of my former site, the Dish, you may find yourselves at times in an uncanny valley. So may I. The model Im trying to follow is more like the British magazine tradition of a weekly diary  on the news, but a little distant from it, personal as well as political, conversational more than formal. I want to start with Trumps lies. Its now a commonplace that Trump and his underlings tell whoppers. Fact-checkers have never had it so good. But all politicians lie. Bill Clinton could barely go a day without some shading or parsing of the truth. Richard Nixon was famously tricky. But all the traditional political fibbers nonetheless paid some deference to the truth  even as they were dodging it. They acknowledged a shared reality and bowed to it. They acknowledged the need for a common set of facts in order for a liberal democracy to function at all. Trumps lies are different. They are direct refutations of reality  and their propagation and repetition is about enforcing his power rather than wriggling out of a political conundrum. They are attacks on the very possibility of a reasoned discourse, the kind of bald-faced lies that authoritarians issue as a way to test loyalty and force their subjects into submission. That first press conference when Sean Spicer was sent out to lie and fulminate to the press about the inauguration crowd reminded me of some Soviet apparatchik having his loyalty tested to see if he could repeat in public what he knew to be false. It was comical, but also faintly chilling. What do I mean by denial of empirical reality? Take one of the most recent. On Wednesday, Senator Richard Blumenthal related the news that Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trumps nominee for the long-vacant Supreme Court seat, had told him that the presidents unprecedented, personal attacks on federal judges were disheartening and demoralizing. Within half an hour, this was confirmed by Gorsuchs White Houseappointed spokesman, who was present for the conversation. CNN also reported that Senator Ben Sasse had heard Gorsuch say exactly the same thing, with feeling, as did former senator Kelly Ayotte. The president nonetheless insisted twice yesterday that Blumenthal had misrepresented his conversation with Gorsuch  first in an early morning tweet and then, once again, yesterday afternoon, in front of the television cameras. To add to the insanity, he also tweeted that in a morning interview, Chris Cuomo had never challenged Blumenthal on his lies about his service in Vietnam  when the tape clearly shows it was the first thing Cuomo brought up. What are we supposed to do with this? How are we to respond to a president who in the same week declared that the murder rate in our country is the highest its been in 45 to 47 years, when, of course, despite some recent, troubling spikes in cities, its nationally near a low not seen since the late 1960s, and half what it was in 1980. What are we supposed to do when a president says that two people were shot dead in Chicago during President Obamas farewell address  when this is directly contradicted by the Chicago police? None of this, moreover, is ever corrected. No error is ever admitted. Any lie is usually doubled down by another lie  along with an ad hominem attack. Here is what we are supposed to do: rebut every single lie. Insist moreover that each lie is retracted  and journalists in press conferences should back up their colleagues with repeated follow-ups if Spicer tries to duck the plain truth. Do not allow them to move on to another question. Interviews with the president himself should not leave a lie alone; the interviewer should press and press and press until the lie is conceded. The press must not be afraid of even calling the president a liar to his face if he persists. This requires no particular courage. I think, in contrast, of those dissidents whose critical insistence on simple truth in plain language kept reality alive in the Kafkaesque world of totalitarianism. As the Polish dissident Adam Michnik once said: In the life of every honorable man comes a difficult moment  when the simple statement that this is black and that is white requires paying a high price. The price Michnik paid was years in prison. American journalists cannot risk a little access or a nasty tweet for the same essential civic duty? * Then there is the obvious question of the presidents mental and psychological health. I know were not supposed to bring this up  but it is staring us brutally in the face. I keep asking myself this simple question: If you came across someone in your everyday life who repeatedly said fantastically and demonstrably untrue things, what would you think of him? If you showed up at a neighbors, say, and your host showed you his newly painted living room, which was a deep blue, and then insisted repeatedly  manically  that it was a lovely shade of scarlet, what would your reaction be? If he then dragged out a member of his family and insisted she repeat this obvious untruth in front of you, how would you respond? If the next time you dropped by, he was still raving about his gorgeous new red walls, what would you think? Heres what Id think: This man is off his rocker. Hes deranged; hes bizarrely living in an alternative universe; hes delusional. If he kept this up, at some point youd excuse yourself and edge slowly out of the room and the house and never return. Youd warn your other neighbors. Youd keep your distance. If you saw him, youd be polite but keep your distance. I think this is a fundamental reason why so many of us have been so unsettled, anxious, and near panic these past few months. It is not so much this presidents agenda. That always changes from administration to administration. It is that when the linchpin of an entire country is literally delusional, clinically deceptive, and responds to any attempt to correct the record with rage and vengeance, everyone is always on edge. There is no anchor any more. At the core of the administration of the most powerful country on earth, there is, instead, madness. * With someone like this barging into your consciousness every hour of every day, you begin to get a glimpse of what it must be like to live in an autocracy of some kind. Every day in countries unfortunate enough to be ruled by a lone dictator, people are constantly subjected to the Supreme Leaders presence, in their homes, in their workplaces, as they walk down the street. Big Brother never leaves you alone. His face bears down on you on every flickering screen. He begins to permeate your psyche and soul; he dominates every news cycle and issues pronouncements  each one shocking and destabilizing  round the clock. He delights in constantly provoking and surprising you, so that his monstrous ego can be perennially fed. And because he is also mentally unstable, forever lashing out in manic spasms of pain and anger, you live each day with some measure of trepidation. What will he come out with next? Somehow, he is never in control of himself and yet he is always in control of you. One of the great achievements of free society in a stable democracy is that many people, for much of the time, need not think about politics at all. The president of a free country may dominate the news cycle many days  but he is not omnipresent  and because we live under the rule of law, we can afford to turn the news off at times. A free society means being free of those who rule over you  to do the things you care about, your passions, your pastimes, your loves  to exult in that blessed space where politics doesnt intervene. In that sense, it seems to me, we already live in a country with markedly less freedom than we did a month ago. Its less like living in a democracy than being a child trapped in a house where there is an abusive and unpredictable father, who will brook no reason, respect no counter-argument, admit no error, and always, always up the ante until catastrophe inevitably strikes. This is what I mean by the idea that we are living through an emergency. * Ive managed to see Scorseses Silence twice in the last couple of weeks. It literally silenced me. Its a surpassingly beautiful movie  but its genius lies in the complexity of its understanding of what faith really is. For some secular liberals, faith is some kind of easy, simple abdication of reason  a liberation from reality. For Scorsese, its a riddle wrapped in a mystery, and often inseparable from crippling, perpetual doubt. You see this in the main protagonists evolution: from a certain, absolutist arrogance to a long sacrifice of pride toward a deeper spiritual truth. Faith is a result, in the end, of living, of seeing your previous certainties crumble and be rebuilt, shakily, on new grounds. God is almost always silent, hidden, and sometimes most painfully so in the face of hideous injustice or suffering. A life of faith is therefore not real unless it is riddled with despair. There are moments  surpassingly rare but often indelible  when you do hear the voice of God and see the face of Jesus. You never forget them  and I count those few moments in my life when I have heard the voice and seen the face as mere intimations of what is to come. But the rest is indeed silence. And the conscience is something that cannot sometimes hear itself. Ive rarely seen the depth of this truth more beautifully unpacked. Which is why, perhaps, the movie has had such a tiny audience so far. Those without faith have no patience for a long meditation on it; those with faith in our time are filled too often with a passionate certainty to appreciate it. And this movies mysterious imagery can confound anyone. But its very complexity and subtlety gave me hope in this vulgar, extremist time. We cannot avoid this surreality all around us. But it may be possible occasionally to transcend it."}, {"date": "2017/02/10", "title": "Flynn Reportedly Talked Sanctions With Russia Before Trump Took Office", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/flynn-talked-sanctions-with-russia-pre-inauguration-report.html", "text": " Several current and former U.S. officials say National Security Adviser Michael Flynn discussed new sanctions imposed on Russia by the Obama administration during conversations with that countrys ambassador in December. That may be illegal, and to make matters worse, it contradicts denials made by senior members of the Trump administration, including Vice-President Mike Pence. The Washington Post reported on Thursday that nine current and former U.S. officials who had access to intercepted communications between Flynn and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak say that Flynn made explicit references to election-related sanctions. Two said Flynn even urged Russia not to overreact. Kislyak was left with the impression that the sanctions would be revisited at a later time, said one former official. When the Post asked Flynn on Wednesday if he ever discussed sanctions with Kislyak, he said no. Then, on Thursday, his spokesman walked that back, saying Flynn indicated that while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he couldnt be certain that the topic never came up. Flynn exchanged phone calls and texts with Kislyak a day before the Obama administration imposed new sanctions and expelled 35 Russian diplomats over the Kremlins alleged attempt to meddle in the U.S. election. The Logan Act, an obscure 1799 statute, makes it illegal for civilians to negotiate with foreign governments in disputes involving the U.S. government. Its unclear if someone could be successfully prosecuted under the act today, but regardless, it does not look good for Trumps top national security adviser to be discussing policy with Russia as the nation is being punished for its alleged efforts to swing the election in Trumps favor. As reports emerged that U.S. intelligence agencies were looking at Flynns intercepted communications with Kislyak as part of their wider investigation of Russias involvement with the election, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Flynn and Kislyak were merely trying to set up a call between Trump and Vladimir Putin for after the election. During a January 15 appearance on Face the Nation, Pence insisted that there was no discussion of sanctions with Russia, citing his conversation with Flynn: An administration source appeared to throw Flynn under the bus, suggesting to the Post that if what Pence said was incorrect, its Flynns fault: Putin announced a day after the sanctions were imposed that there would be no retaliation until Moscow could assess Trumps policies, which increased the officials concerns about Flynns conversations. Several emphasized that while Flynn might have suggested that the sanctions could be reviewed under the Trump administration, he did not explicitly promise that they would be reconsidered after the inauguration. Since Flynn is a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general and director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, he knows that such communications are monitored by the U.S. The New York Times reports that, in light of Flynns background, federal officials who saw the transcript were surprised he made the remarks, and even more surprised that the Trump administration publicly denied that sanctions were discussed."}, {"date": "2017/02/10", "title": "Trump Backs Down, Agrees to Uphold One China Policy", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-backs-down-agrees-to-uphold-one-china-policy.html", "text": " After angering China by accepting a congratulatory phone call from the leader of Taiwan, President-elect Trump suggested he would use the longstanding One China policy  which rules out recognizing Taiwans independence  as a bargaining chip in negotiations with China.

On Thursday, the two leaders finally had a lengthy conversation, and Trump agreed to honor the One China policy.

The two leaders discussed numerous topics and President Trump agreed, at the request of President Xi, to honor our One China policy, the White House said in a statement, adding that the discussion was extremely cordial and that the presidents extended invitations to meet in their respective countries. According to Chinas official state-news agency Xinhua, Trump said he admires the historic accomplishments of Chinas development, and expressed confidence that there could be a new high in relations between the two countries. The call came on the eve of a U.S. summit with one of Chinas key rivals.

On Thursday night, Utahns let Chaffetz know that they do not think continuing the investigation of Hillary Clintons emails and going after an ethics watchdog that criticized Trump is the best use of his time. More than 1,000 people showed up to Chaffetzs town hall in Cottonwood Heights, a Salt Lake City suburb, to question the congressman on his failure to investigate the president, his support for Trumps controversial executive orders, and his efforts to repeal the Obama order establishing Bears Ears National Monument in southern Utah. Like those of many politicians, Chaffetzs office has been swamped by calls in recent weeks, and several liberal groups, including Utah Indivisible and Our Utah, organized members to pack the town hall event. The Salt Lake County Republican Party urged the REAL majority of Utah voters to turn out in support of Chaffetz after the event had to be moved to a larger venue. Nevertheless, Chaffetz found himself being booed by a rowdy crowd that filled the 1,080-seat venue nearly to capacity, with many more protesting outside. Chaffetz drew applause when he noted that earlier on Thursday, the House Oversight Committee called on the Office of Government Ethics to recommend disciplinary action against White House aide Kellyanne Conway for promoting Ivanka Trump products. But the crowd was far less receptive when Chaffetz explained that President Trump isnt required to release his tax returns, and said he wanted to get rid of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos as well  by eliminating the entire department. Chaffetz ended the town hall 40 minutes early, and refused to take questions from the press. Outside, protesters promised Chaffetz hed see them again. Since Trumps inauguration, Republicans across the country have seen large crowds of left-leaning constituents turn up to events in their districts. More than 600 people turned out for a town hall with Representative Justin Amash in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Thursday. The meeting was only scheduled to last an hour, but Amash stayed late to continue answering questions. The crowds reaction to Amash was mixed. He was applauded for saying he believes President Trumps immigration order needs to be rewritten, but booed when he discussed repealing Obamacare. Meanwhile in Tennessee, Representative Diane Black and other Republicans were met by a group of 75 to 100 protesters at an event held by the Middle Tennessee State University College Republicans. Many complained that they werent allowed in the room: Inside, lawmakers mostly faced questions about the Affordable Care Act. As a Christian, my whole philosophy in life is to pull up the unfortunate, said one woman. The individual mandate: thats what it does. While some Republicans, like Amash, say theyre happy to see people getting more engaged, others are avoiding meetings with their constituents. Congressman Mo Brooks of Alabama called off a town hall with a tea party group after Democrats tried to show up. Congressman Lee Zeldin, who represents Long Island, has already canceled a town hall event scheduled for April because liberal protesters were planning to show up. Constituents requesting a meeting with Representative Jimmy Duncan Jr. of Tennessee have received a form letter informing them that he has no intention of holding town hall meetings. I am not going to hold town hall meetings in this atmosphere, because they would very quickly turn into shouting opportunities for extremists, kooks and radicals, the letter reads.

But it was a bit of a surprise that the three-court panel  including George W. Bush appointee Richard Clifton, who gave counsel for the states opposing the governments plea a hard time during oral arguments  ruled unanimously, and rejected so many of the governments arguments that it augers poorly for Team Trumps ability to revive the travel ban later on. In the key section of the ruling, the judges concluded: In its discussion of the states due process argument, the Ninth Circuit panel categorically rejected the governments claim that the presidents immigration and national security powers preclude intervention by the courts: Those are pretty strong words for a Per Curiam ruling on a procedural motion, and will probably get the attention of Donald J. Trump, who has already tweeted one of what could be many harsh comments in response: (Somebody should probably talk to the President about the inadvisability of SHOUTING WITH ALL CAPS.) The judges also rejected the Justice Departments claim that the travel ban should be immediately enforced with respect to non-resident aliens who cannot assert U.S. constitutional rights, holding that some resident aliens who can get into U.S. courts would be affected, and that citizens of the two states challenging the order could be affected indirectly as well. Finally, while the order did not entirely reject the governments claims that the order did not violate Establishment Clause and equal protection provisions prohibiting religious discrimination, it did not accept them either, deferring the issue until it is weighed by Judge Robart, who issued the order putting the ban on hold. He will now get to proceed with his own deliberations, unless higher powers intervene. It is likely the Justice Department will now petition the Supreme Court to grant the stay against Judge Robarts order that the Ninth Circuit just denied. It would take five justices to grant the stay, and in the present eight-justice SCOTUS, the four liberal members are not very likely to jump in at this point.

In fact, the only Trump-related item on the House Oversight Committees agenda is an investigation into Office of Government Ethics  ostensibly, for its alleged bias against the president. On Wednesday, President Trump publicly disparaged a private company for dropping his daughters product line amid lagging sales. White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the presidents statement  arguing that Trump had every right to respond, since refusing to sell Trump-branded products is tantamount to attacking the presidents policies. Theres a targeting of her brand and its her name, Spicer said. There are clearly efforts to undermine that name based on her fathers positions on particular policies that hes taken. This is a direct attack on his policies and her name. Chaffetz saw nothing untoward in all this. I think the president has the right to weigh in on his opinion on things, and especially as it relates to his children, Chaffetz told CNN. I tweet a lot about cheeseburgers  Ive never had people complain about that. If Chaffetz can suggest that cheeseburgers are preferable to grilled chicken sandwiches, why cant the president try to intimidate companies that drop his daughters fashion line? But while Chaffetz has little interest in policing Trumps ethical lapses, he is happy to play the independent overseer when one of the presidents surrogates takes sycophancy too far. On Thursday morning, counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway addressed the Nordstrom controversy on Fox & Friends. Its a wonderful line. I own some of it, Conway said. I fully  Im going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online. Federal employees are prohibited from using their public offices for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise. Giving a free commercial would seem to qualify as an endorsement. And, in this case, Chaffetz recognized a distinction between vouching for cheeseburgers and shilling for the First Daughters brand. The congressman called Conways remarks wrong, wrong, wrong, clearly over the line, unacceptable. It needs to be dealt with, Chaffetz told the Associated Press. Theres no ifs, ands or buts about it. So, why is Chaffetz more scandalized by Conways endorsement of Ivankas fashion, than by Trumps attack on Nordstroms business decisions? The most defensible answer is that the former appears to be illegal, while the other is not. As Trump loves to point out, the president is immune from federal conflict of interest laws. But the president is not immune from the Constitution. And Chaffetz has expressed little concern over Trumps apparent flouting of the Emoluments Clause. So, the most important factor here would seem to be the lack of political downside in holding Conway to account. Judging from the administrations endless leaks, taking Kellyanne down a peg may make Chaffetz more friends in the White House than enemies."}, {"date": "2017/02/09", "title": "Trumps Tiny Thumbs Were a Big Fundraising Asset in Campaign", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trumps-tiny-thumbs-were-a-big-fundraising-asset-in-campaign.html", "text": " Of all the things Republicans loved about Donald Trump in the lead-up to the 2016 election, from the brightly colored hats to the promotion of sexual assault, nothing proved quite as lucrative for the then-candidate as his thumbs.

Regardless of how it was used, the image of Trump giving two thumbs up in front of an American flag was the most effective choice for his website, the report says.

In leak after leak, anonymous administration officials paint the president as less teachers pet than class clown  one who refuses to do his homework, demands the Cliffs Notes for every reading assignment, and struggles to comprehend the most basic aspects of the curriculum. The latest SOS from the West Wing was intercepted by Reuters: New START is pretty fundamental to U.S.-Russian relations. At his confirmation hearing, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson expressed his support for the agreement. Trump, himself, was aware of the treatys significance  if not of its proper name  last year, when he complained that Russia outsmarted Obama on START Up. To avoid such lapses in memory, presidents typically request an in-depth briefing from the National Security Council before dialing up world leaders. But, according to Reuters sources, Trump received no such briefing before hopping on the horn with Putin. (Considering that Trump has often bragged about being too smart to read long things, it seems safe to take Reuters word on this one.) Under New START, the United States and Russia committed to reducing their respective supplies of strategic nuclear warheads to no more than 1,550 by February 2018. This would leave America with a big enough atomic stockpile to induce a civilization-destroying nuclear winter at least 15.5 times. But many Republicans think that isnt nearly enough. When the Senate ratified New START in December 2010, only 13 Republicans voted in favor. Granted, some of the naysayers may have been motivated less by opposition to deproliferation than by fear of Obamas radioactivity with the GOP base. The source of Trumps antipathy for New START is similarly unclear. On the one hand, the president has expressed enthusiasm for a new arms race. On the other, he has called nuclear weapons the single greatest threat we face  and has a habit of disparaging any deal that he did not, himself, negotiate. At any rate, it appears that Trumps tolerance for Putins transgressions has its limits: If Vladimir wants to kill his political enemies, who are we to judge?

So it was only moderately surprising to learn that Trump SCOTUS nominee Neil Gorsuch, himself a member of the Tenth Circuit, told Democratic U.S. senator Richard Blumenthal, of Connecticut, that he was disconcerted by the attacks. Trumps first response was to shoot the messenger by attacking Blumenthal and suggesting he was lying about the conversation with Gorsuch. But similar Gorsuch comments are being confirmed by a Republican senator, Ben Sasse of Nebraska. So a plan B for Team Trump may be in order. An editorial in the New York Sun may show where we are heading next: a criticism of Gorsuch for committing a gaffe when everybody knows Trump was absolutely right. Really? We are apparently to believe every single Trump voter said to every other Trump voter earlier this week: Hah! That damned liberal Ninth Circuit is behaving in a political fashion again! Actually the Sun doubles down on that bizarre assertion: Um, well, theres the problem that it is hard to discern mandates for a presidential candidate who won only 45.9 percent of the popular vote, and was not even approved of by a large slice of the voters he did win. More important, promising to do something on the campaign trail does not make that something constitutional. If that were somehow the rule, wed have candidates promising to lock up all the bad people by executive order and give all the good people their money. Constitutional limitations on the political branches of the federal government are not always popular, which is why the judiciary needs to be independent. But that reasoning seems to elude the Sun, which appears to think the courts have no mandate for what they do unless its popular: Hmmm. Wonder what could have happened between 1996 and 2006 that might have made the Court temporarily so unpopular? Was it an arrogant act of defiance of a Republican president who failed to win the popular vote? Not exactly.

Theres a reason people dont want the job, Politico says, and his name is Trump. The presidents chaotic management style makes the prospect of directing White House communications sound like a total nightmare. And his Twitter habit would surely undermine the work of whoever is unlucky enough to accept this job, which was supposed to go to former campaign spokesman Jason Miller until an alleged extramarital affair got in the way. Dreadful as this job sounds, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway says the Politico report is completely false. An adviser to the president who has picked up some of the communications slack herself, Conway said on Fox & Friends Thursday, I know people who are interested in the job, actually, as I stand here.

He has said that its a hell of a lot of fun to shoot members of the Taliban, and told Iraqi military leaders, If you fuck with me, Ill kill you all. The general was such a fervent opponent of the Iran nuclear agreement  and staunch proponent of covert confrontation with Tehran  President Obama relieved him of his duties in 2013. But in the retirement home for Islamophobic cranks that is the Trump White House, James Mattis is the closest thing to a coolheaded, diplomatic dove. The former general has already torpedoed Trumps torture plans, defended NATO against the presidents slings and arrows, and, reportedly, pushed for the president to add exemptions to his ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations. And, through it all, Mattis has been serving as a kind of equanimity translator for the president  adapting Trumps belligerent tweets into carefully worded diplomatic missives to calm our allies shaky nerves. Per the Washington Post: Steve Bannon, by contrast, predicted last year that a war between the United States and China over the latters disputed claims to the South China Sea is inevitable  as is another major shooting war in the Middle East. You have an expansionist Islam and you have an expansionist China. Right? the Brietbart mastermind turned chief White House strategist asked his radio audience in February 2016. They are motivated. Theyre arrogant. Theyre on the march. And they think the Judeo-Christian West is on the retreat. Theres reason to think this was more than mere talk-radio blather. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and White House press secretary Sean Spicer have both suggested that the United States will block China from accessing its disputed islands in the South China Sea  an action that would (almost certainly) prompt a military confrontation between the worlds two greatest powers. Other Trump aides have taken a similarly belligerent line toward Beijing, with top trade adviser Peter Navarro describing China as a despicable, parasitic, brutal, brass-knuckled, crass, callous, amoral, ruthless, and totally totalitarian imperialist power. Meanwhile, the administration has put Iran on notice; considered declaring the Iranian Revolutionary Guard a terrorist group; and, on one occasion, falsely claimed that Iran had attacked an American Navy vessel. As already established, Mattis is an unlikely candidate for wet blanket at the saber-rattling party. The defense secretarys antipathy for Iran is personal, tracing back to Tehrans 1983 bombing of the Marine barracks in Lebanon. But Mattiss firsthand knowledge of wars costs may be the reason he treads more carefully than his new colleagues. While Bannon did serve in the U.S. Navy decades ago, the far-right flamethrower has surveyed the war on terror from a spectators seat. A reactionary radio host has little incentive to question his intuition of a coming war between Judeo-Christian civilization and the Muslim hordes (and/or godless Chinese).The head of U.S. Central Command, by contrast, has plenty of motivation to resist such far-right fever dreams  not least, that maintaining friendly relations with Arab nations is a critical part of Americas counterterrorism strategy. With President Trump (reportedly) unable to read memos longer than one page  or to resist the temptation to tweet through his daily intelligence briefings  the details of American foreign policy will likely be left to whichever adviser wins the lions share of the commander-in-chiefs trust. Which is to say: The Mattis-Bannon race for shadow president may be the most important election of our lives. And it will be decided by a single vote."}, {"date": "2017/02/09", "title": "Watching Trump Try to Puzzle Out What Asset Forfeiture Means Is Discomfiting", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trumps-exchange-on-asset-forfeiture-is-quite-discomfiting.html", "text": " On Tuesday, in an incident picked up by NPR and a bunch of other outlets, Donald Trump joked to a group of sheriffs about destroying the career of a Texas state senator one of the sheriffs, Harold Eavenson of Rockwall County, Texas, was unhappy with. Eavenson is a fan of what is known as asset forfeiture, and the state senator had lobbied hard against a certain type of it. What is asset forfeiture? Traditionally, its been the practice of taking someones stuff after theyve been convicted of a crime  picture a DEA photo opp in front of a drug lords boats and jewelry and cars. But in many parts of the country, the practice has grown extremely loose, and there are numerous signs of widespread abuse. Law-enforcement officers can often take your stuff simply by, in effect, declaring that theres some connection between you and a hypothetical crime  they dont need to even arrest or charge you. Sarah Stillman of The New Yorker wrote what is probably the definitive journalistic account of this subject, and her piece contains truly astounding stuff. In the story that leads off the article, for example, Stillman relates an incident in which a couple passing through Tenaha, Texas, with a bunch of cash to buy a used car was pulled over, brought to the local police station, and given a choice: Either they could sign a document handing the cash over to Tenaha, or they could be charged  despite a lack of any substantive evidence  with money laundering and child endangerment, meaning they would immediately be sent to jail and their children, who had been riding in the backseat, taken from them. If they signed the document, there would be no charges at all, so that was what they did. The couple would later learn that this was something of a tradition in Tenaha; there had been a raft of complaints from out-of-town drivers who claimed that they had been stopped in Tenaha and stripped of cash, valuables, and, in at least one case, an infant child, without clear evidence of contraband. (They joined in a class-action lawsuit fighting the practice.) This sort of thing is disturbingly common, and some of the stories make the Tenaha incident look minor in comparison  as the subhead of Stillmans article notes, Americans who havent been charged with wrongdoing can be stripped of their cash, cars, and even homes. Thats why, in recent years, something of a left-right alliance of criminal-justice reformers has formed to try to rein in the worst excesses of asset forfeiture, with many critics of the practice pointing out that police often target poor and minority citizens who lack the legal resources to defend their property. Basically the only groups that aggressively defends these types of asset forfeitures, on the other hand, are law-enforcement organizations themselves (and the politicians who want to broadcast unwavering support for them). They often claim asset forfeiture is a vital tool in their fight against drug cartels, but the full story is a bit more complicated and less noble: Asset forfeiture has become a big business. Some police departments rake in hefty sums from pulling people over, taking their stuff, and letting them go without charging them with anything. At a time of widespread state budget cuts, regularly harvesting the money and cars and other assets of local residents and passers-through has become a convenient way for some small-town police departments to stay in the black. Elsewhere, its used for other purposes: A Washington Post investigative series published in 2014, for example, revealed that, Police agencies have used hundreds of millions of dollars taken from Americans under federal civil forfeiture law in recent years to buy guns, armored cars and electronic surveillance gear. They have also spent money on luxury vehicles, travel and a clown named Sparkles. So, back to Trump and the sheriff: Trump made his joke after Eavenson complained about a state senator in Texas who was talking about introducing legislation to require conviction before we can receive their forfeiture. Can you believe that? responded Trump, before joking about ruining his career. As the Dallas Morning News reported Tuesday, it isnt clear exactly which state senator Eavenson was referring to, but both Democrats and some Republicans there have pushed for laws to reform the states asset-forfeiture practices. And all they are asking is that someone be convicted of a crime before police take their stuff  they arent even questioning law enforcements authority to seize certain property. The whole debate was new to Trump. As the White Houses transcript of the session where he made his joke makes clear (hat tip to Reason), the president didnt appear to know what asset forfeiture was or what the debate over it entailed. This probably shouldnt come as a surprise given that Trump, by his own admission, isnt much of a reader, and has exhibited very little interest in questions of public policy. Whats interesting, though, is observing, through the transcript, the process of Trump puzzling through a new concept and trying to understand what it means and how it fits into his worldview. Interesting and deeply, deeply discomfiting: In reality, of course, none of the controversy over asset forfeiture centers around what authorities do when they find a huge stash of drugs  Team Let Them Keep Illegal Drugs has approximately zero members. So whats striking here is the manner in which, over the course of an exchange that lasts perhaps a couple minutes, Trump progresses from learning of the existence of a new (to him) concept, to misunderstanding completely what it is and why its controversial, to developing a strong opinion about it painted in a childlike understanding of the world and of morality (Who would want that pressure, other than, like, bad people, right?), to expressing outrage that anyone could have an opinion about it that diverges from his own. In this instance, we have full access to Trumps thought process, to his confused knee-jerk conclusions. Whats going on behind closed doors, when the stakes are higher and there are no White House transcripts available?"}, {"date": "2017/02/09", "title": "Trump Sends Belated New Years Greetings to Chinese Leader", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-sends-belated-new-years-greetings-to-chinese-leader.html", "text": " In unlikely diplomatic news, President Trump sent a letter to Chinese leader Xi Jinping expressing best wishes for the Chinese New Year and hopes for a constructive relationship. Trouble is, the Year of the Rooster began 11 days earlier, and Xi had reached out to Trump a week before that in a missive congratulating him on his inauguration. Maybe Trump should have asked someone to find one of those Belated Holiday Wishes cards. The gesture was actually quite a bit later than 11 days. Trump rattled hypothetical sabers at Beijing on both economic and security issues throughout the 2016 campaign. Yes, he had a brief conversation with Xi when the Chinese leader called him with congratulations a few days after the U.S. election. But that was more than wiped out when in one of his very first public foreign-policy steps Trump held a highly provocative conversation with Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen. Putting aside the decades-long protocols that chat broke, Trumps defiant attitude toward Chinese complaints about the call reinforced the realization that he was reaching out to what Beijing considers a rebellious province without reaching out to the mainland. And in the ensuing months, Trump has had direct contact with 18 world leaders  but not with Xi. The Chinese are taking it all in stride, but you have to wonder what price they will later demand in recompense for all the overt and indirect insults they have received from Trump since his unlikely emergence as a respectable political figure and then as president. Bluster and intimidation and keeping adversaries off balance are central to Trumps style in both domestic and international politics. But it is not yet clear this roosters year has dawned over a troubled Pacific. And from Trumps own daughter (who showed up unexpectedly at a Lunar New Year event at the Chinese embassy in Washington) to his various envoys, you can be sure Team Trump will have its hands full making sure the rhetorical missiles the Boss keeps lobbing toward China arent mistaken for the threat of the real thing."}, {"date": "2017/02/09", "title": "Big Luther Strange Will Replace Jeff Sessions in the U.S. Senate", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/luther-strange-will-replace-jeff-sessions-in-the-u-s-senate.html", "text": " After the Senate confirmed former senator Jeff Sessions as the newest U.S. Attorney General late Wednesday night, Alabama governor Robert Bentley announced his replacement: state attorney general Luther Strange.

Another reason Bentley may have chosen Strange is that the governor now gets to name his replacement. That could help Bentley out of a bind given the impeachment investigation launched by the state legislature last year after his affair with an aide was revealed. In November, Strange asked the legislature to hold off as he launched his own investigation of the affair. But now that hes on his way to D.C., Bentley gets to handpick his own investigator, a prospect that has some Alabamians nervous. Even with his appointment, Strange will have to run in a special election in 2018, which is why his statewide victories in 2010 and 2014 were seen as such an asset.

Then, he instructed the American people to blame the court system for the next terrorist attack on U.S. soil. This put Gorsuch in a bit of pickle: If he chastised the president, he could find himself reduced to the status of so-called judge; if he didnt, hed be excoriated for spinelessness at his confirmation hearing. But Neil Gorsuch believes that when life gives you lemons, you should avoid assisted suicide. And so the judge used Trumps comments as an opportunity to establish his independence from the unpopular president  and, thereby, make it a little more difficult for Democrats to obstruct his nomination. In a meeting with Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, Gorsuch described Trumps comments as demoralizing and disheartening. Ron Bonjean, a White House advisor, subsequently confirmed that Gorsuch had, indeed, made those comments. And this approach seemed to strike a deft political balance: On the one hand, Gorsuch hadnt let the presidents attack on the judiciary slide; on the other, he hadnt criticized Trump in public. Without video of Gorsuchs reprimand, cable news was unlikely to give the remarks wall-to-wall coverage. And then, on Thursday morning, the president signed onto Twitter. The presidents case here is airtight: Richard Blumenthal once apologized for saying that he had served in Vietnam, when, in fact, the senator had merely served as a Marine Corps Reserve during the Vietnam War, but was never sent overseas. By contrast, the president spent his Vietnam fearlessly weathering round after round of unprotected sex. Therefore, both Blumenthal and Bonjean are lying. After all, why would a federal judge complain about the president characterizing the judiciary as a national security threat? Alas, shortly after Trumps tweets, a Republican senator from Nebraska gave the president some Sasse. Minutes later, Trump turned his attention to another man whose Vietnam-era service he disdains. Earlier this week John McCain had described the raid of a Yemeni compound that the president ordered  which killed one Navy SEAL, many civilians, but not the terrorist it had been launched to target  as a failure.

In their few weeks in office, Trumps staff have apparently gotten comfortable enough with the arrangement that they are now routinely blending their roles as spokespeople for Trump the president and Trump the brand. Kellyanne Conway used an interview from the White House this morning to officially endorse the Ivanka Trump product line. This appears to be completely illegal.

Some nervous Republicans want to figure out what they want to put in place of Obamacare. Senator Mike Lee insists that Republicans repeal Obamacare first, before they decide on an alternative. And his reason is straightforward: If people saw the Republican alternative, they might not like it! There is a lot less agreement about what comes next, he tells reporters. If we load down the repeal bill with what comes next, its harder to get both of them passed. That is very true. If people see what Republicans would put in place of Obamacare, they would probably rather keep the status quo. Lee is right that the best way to eliminate Obamacare is to remain vague about the alternative.

Reince is giving me my daily back massage. The two men burst into a fit of conspiratorial laughter. Off the record! Reince Priebus said. Off the record! Bannon repeated. They continued to laugh. It was Tuesday morning and, having just returned from a weekend jaunt to the Winter White House in Palm Beach, President Donald Trumps chief strategist and the White House chief of staff huddled in the latters West Wing office to, as they put it, help make the truth come out. Specifically, the two men wanted to address, in each others company, reports in the media  many based on quotes from high-level White House officials  that they are engaged in a bitter, zero-sum power struggle to win primacy with Trump, instead of continuing to function as improbable co-equals. The contest is now, the story goes, being waged in the form of damaging leaks about each other. Plenty of savvy media observers see obvious intent in the gush of leaks now coming out of the White House. If you read between the lines in some of the anonymous quotes, Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to President Obama, said, its clear that Bannon, [Jared] Kushner, and Priebus are spending half their time blaming each other and the other half ensuring they dont get the blame. But Bannon and Priebus said these impressions are wrong, and that rumors and reports that they are furiously leaking to gut each other and gain more sway with Trump are mostly media inventions. Any leaks come from lower down the totem pole. The truth, they said, is that they are rather chummy. Bannon and Priebus spoke with me on a prearranged conference call, joined by Katie Walsh, Priebuss deputy, and Lindsay Walters, deputy to press secretary Sean Spicer. For about 25 minutes, talking into Walshs cell phone on speaker mode, Bannon and Priebus performed a buddy comedy, finishing each others sentences and swearing up and down that they are good friends who work together well  and constantly. Im quite aggressive, and Reince is a calming influence on hey  bang bang bang, heres how we ought to think about doing that, Bannon said, explaining how their personal styles complement each other. We talk a lot, pretty much all day long, Priebus said. And then we communicate at night  Until we fall asleep, Bannon interjected with a laugh. Priebus cut in, Until somebody falls asleep  You fell asleep last night. I did, Bannon said. I think, like, a quarter to 11, Priebus added. I did, Bannon said. He became unresponsive, Priebus laughed. Claims to the contrary, Priebus said, are upsetting to both of them. It bothers us because its not true, and we actually like and care about each other a lot. So its sort of like, if we were just sort of colleagues that kind of tolerate each other every day, maybe it wouldnt bother us. But because its the total opposite  and were sitting here, and were friends and weve kind of been to hell and back ten times together and we like each other  so then we see these things, yeah, it bothers us because it sort of hurts our friendship, and its not truthful. Bannon dismissed the entire theory as a manifestation of media myopia and incuriosity. The opposition party  meaning the press, not the Democrats  has to have  He paused. Since theyre too dumb and too lazy to actually do any work, um  am I over my skis here right now? he asked Priebus. No, no, Priebus laughed. They have to come up with the gossipy stuff. Its just like on the campaign, Bannon continued. He criticized the well-paid media and all the commentators who couldnt predict Trumps victory, blaming them for having never rolled up their sleeves to do the hard work of analyzing demographics and economics, which, he believes, would have revealed Trump was tapping into something. Its very easy to write the gossipy stuff, he said, mocking the media for reading into Priebuss Republican National Committee background, or casting himself and Stephen Miller as wild men and people who are crazy. Writing those stories, he said, was easy because it only required talking to underlings around here and then you just kind of type it up. Theres no question that the men offer a study in stark contrasts. After stints at Goldman Sachs and in Hollywood, Bannon got involved in populist right-wing media, taking control of Breitbart News after the death of its founder, Andrew Breitbart. He labeled it the platform for the alt-right in an interview last year. The alt-right, a broad label for the fringe far-right (including outright racists and anti-Semites), is at the forefront of the outsider hordes that are overrunning the conservative Establishment  that is, the political culture that produced Priebus, two-time chairman of the RNC. They even wear their differences: Bannon dresses in casual black clothing and is generally unshaven, while Priebus  called anal retentive by one source  is usually clad in crisp suits and bright-colored ties that make him look like hes just stepped out of a Brooks Brothers catalogue. But theres a bipartisan perspective that whats happening isnt normal. Steve Schmidt, who served in the George W. Bush White House, told me that the tactics employed by Trump officials  like leaking as a means of harming the competition within  would have been unthinkable in the Bush or Obama administrations. What youre seeing here is a total lack of discipline and an utterly chaotic process, he said, comparing it to Game of Thrones. Jon Favreau, the former director of speechwriting for President Obama, had a different reference. Every White House has its share of leaks and infighting, he said. But this is like Hunger Games shit. Even some people inside the White House see Priebuss mark on the emerging narrative that Bannon is the mastermind behind Trumps populism  a story Trump surely dislikes. He hates that, one source close to the president said. The way to kill somebody in the Trump orbit is to say to him, Oh, this guys your brain! Hes calling the shots! Youre just a fucker who does what he says! Thats the surest way to kill somebody, even if that somebody is doing a really good job. And potentially worse than suggesting Trump isnt thinking for himself is diverting the spotlight away from him at all. Bannons been very shrewd to give no interviews because when Trump urged [former campaign manager Paul] Manafort to give interviews and Trump urged Kellyanne [Conway] to give interviews  and they both went out there and did that and they both did a very good job  I still think theres some jealousy, the source said, noting that while Bannon has spoken occasionally to print media, he has stayed away from television. The Trump show only has one star, there are no co-stars. Priebus denied any involvement in furthering that narrative about Bannon. If I were the mastermind behind the Steve Bannonbrain story, Steve would know about it, because hes sitting here in my office all day long, he told me. Its totally ridiculous and I dont have time to play the double-reverse-agent role and run the White House at the same time. Its totally ridiculous and Steve would know because hes sitting right here! The two of them laughed. Its all phony-baloney garbage that doesnt exist and I hope that you can clear that up in the article, Priebus added. Bannon claimed that usually leaks from the Trump White House werent coming from people in the room. He pointed to the example of Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge funder who was tapped to work at the White House as a liaison to the business community, before he was suddenly and unexpectedly sidelined just before his scheduled swearing-in. Plenty of observers saw it as a power move by Priebus, who is generally acknowledged to be in control of staffing. Scaramucci, who has known the president and Bannon since the mid-1990s and maintains a friendly relationship with both, would have posed a threat to the chief of staff, goes the theory. You can tell when the stories come out, like the Scaramucci thing, its so 180 opposite from what reality is, we sit here and laugh about it, right? Bannon said. Its like these two factions and theyre all fighting for that is, about  Scaramucci? Riiight, he said sarcastically. Its not true, Priebus said of the rumors that he nixed the hire. The person closest to Anthony in the entire West Wing is me, he said. So, Bannon and Anthony know each other but Im the closest to Anthony, and I love the guy. Whatever the narrative is thats out there is 100 percent false. The White House similarly shot down claims that Priebus also undercut Monica Crowley, a Fox News personality who was Trumps pick for a prominent national-security communications job. When she was revealed to be a serial plagiarist, Priebus, sources said, forbade Crowley from appearing on TV to defend herself, and before long, she was asked to resign. Spicer, through an email, said there was zero truth to that story. True or not, paranoia has certainly set in among vulnerable members of the administration and those within its orbit, the most worried of whom have focused their frustrations and concerns on Priebus. Theyve nicknamed him Rancid, the creature of the swamp they thought they were going to drain. Are these and other pesky underlings also hell-bent on sabotaging the relationship of the presidents two most important staffers? Or, to borrow a phrase from Trump, is something going on here?"}, {"date": "2017/02/09", "title": "Arizona Mother May Be Facing Deportation Owing to Trump Immigration Order", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/arizona-mom-may-be-facing-deportation-due-to-trump-order.html", "text": " The detention of an Arizona mother who left Mexico and entered the U.S. illegally when she was 14 is drawing attention to an element of President Trumps executive order on immigration and border security that was overshadowed by discussion of the border wall. Seven people were arrested on Wednesday night in Phoenix, Arizona, at a protest to stop the deportation of Guadalupe Garca de Rayos. The 36-year-old mother of two American teenagers was taken into custody during one of her regular check-ins with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In 2008, Garca de Rayos was working at Golfland Sunsplash amusement park in Mesa, Arizona, when it was raided by then Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. She was convicted of a felony for using a fake social security number at work. For years, shes been checking in with ICE every six months, and she was able to stay in the U.S. because the Obama administration prioritized the deportation of people who had committed serious crimes or had gang affiliations. As the New York Times reports, Garca de Rayos knew the situation might have changed due to President Trumps executive order, which said undocumented immigrants convicted of any criminal offense  or even those who may have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense  are a priority for deportation. She showed up for her scheduled appointment anyway, and this time she was arrested. We all knew something could be different this time with the new administration, Carlos Garcia, director of the immigrant advocacy group Puente Arizona, told the Los Angeles Times. She went in with the lawyer and didnt come out. That was pretty much all there was. Puente volunteers accompanied Garca de Rayos to the ICE office, and dozens of activists held a prayer vigil for her on Wednesday evening. Later, protesters blocked the gates around the building in an effort to prevent several vans and a bus from leaving. They held up a van holding Garca de Rayos for about an hour, but later ICE vehicles were able to leave from a different exit. Phoenix police arrived on the scene around 9 p.m. and arrested seven demonstrators. The department wrote in a series of tweets: Some protesters at the ICE building have chosen criminal conduct instead of free speech  Officers are working to keep EVERONE [sic] safe including a scared group of people inside an ICE van being illegally blocked by some people  Despite repeated warnings, some engaging in criminal acts are refusing to stop. Additional arrests for the criminal acts are imminent  Besides the few people engaged in criminal acts, most people out here are peaceful and exercising their rights properly. By 1 a.m. on Thursday, fewer than two dozen protesters were still on the scene. A statement from ICE did not comment on why Garca de Rayos was detained after this check-in, though shed been allowed to leave in the past: It has 100 percent to do with the executive order, Ray Ybarra-Maldonado, a Phoenix immigration lawyer representing Garca de Rayos, told USA Today. Her case is no different than the last time she checked in. The facts are 100 percent the same. The only difference is the priorities for removal have now changed. Jessica Vaughan, policy studies director at the Center for Immigration studies, which supports Trumps immigration policies, agreed that ICE may have been responding to the executive order, which returns a great deal of discretion to ICE officers in the field to enforce immigration laws as they were written.

The incident occurred halfway through the first quarter of the Knicks game against the Los Angeles Clippers, which New York lost 119-115. Oakley was sitting courtside, several rows behind Knicks owner James Dolan, with whom hes had a contentious relationship for years. Several spectators told the New York Times that Oakley seemed calm at the start of the game, and they didnt see him interact with Dolan. However, the New York Daily News reports that Oakley was yelling at Dolan. T.J. Veenstra, who was sitting behind Oakley, told the Times that he saw Oakley say something to a security guard when he walked by. The guard then asked him to leave, and Oakley protested. He just couldnt understand why, said Matthew Barbara, who was sitting a few rows ahead of Oakley. We didnt see him throw a punch or do anything. He wasnt nasty to any of the people behind him. Were trying to figure out what happened. Soon security guards swarmed around Oakley. Video shows Oakley shoving one of the guards as they try to remove him. Players stopped to watch the altercation, and the crowd chanted Oakleys name as he was escorted out through a tunnel. Outside the court, Oakley shouted, I didnt do nothing, as he was handcuffed and surrounded by guards. Knicks president Phil Jackson tried to calm him, to no avail. The team released this statement: Oakley was charged with three counts of misdemeanor assault, and one of criminal trespass. He received a desk appearance ticket and was released from the Midtown South precinct around midnight. Oakley told the Daily News that he was asked to leave the game because Dolan didnt want him there. I was there for four minutes, Oakley said. I didnt say anything to him. I swear on my mother. They came over and wanted to know why I was sitting there. I bought the ticket. I said why do you guys keep staring at me. Then they asked me to leave. And I said Im not leaving. LeBron James expressed support for Oakley in an Instagram post: While its still unclear what started the incident, fans said it was sad to see. I dont think theres necessarily good blood between him and the organization, from what I understand. But its unfortunate. Put it that way, said Ian Schafer, whose video of the altercation went viral.

The vote was 52 to 47, with Senator Joe Manchin casting the one Democratic vote in support of Sessions. The Alabama senator voted present on his own nomination. For weeks, Democrats argued that Sessions, who was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 amid accusations of racism, would not uphold civil and voting rights for African-Americans. They also criticized his stance on immigration, womens rights, and LGBT rights. Senator Cory Booker made history by testifying against his colleague during Sessionss confirmation hearing. His record raises doubts about whether he can be a champion for those who need this office most and it also raises doubts about whether he can curb unlawful overreach by President Trump, said Senator Tim Kaine. As Democrats came to Warrens defense, with several reading the Coretta Scott King letter that led to Republicans barring the Massachusetts senator from the debate, Republicans said Sessions had been mistreated throughout the confirmation process. Hes honest. Hes fair. Hes been a friend to many of us, on both sides of the aisle, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said. Its been tough to watch all this good man has been put through in recent weeks. This is a well-qualified colleague with a deep reverence for the law. He believes strongly in the equal application of it to everyone. Tim Scott, the chambers only African-American Republican, defended Sessions on the Senate floor, saying he had earned my support. Scott read messages he received on social media accusing him of letting black people down by standing behind Sessions. I left out all the ones that used the n-word, he said, noting that the complaints werent that unusual. If you sign up to be a black conservative, the chances are very high you will be attacked. It comes with the territory, Scott explained. In a speech following the vote, Sessions acknowledged the heated debate and said he hopes members of the Senate can find common ground going forward. Denigrating people who disagree with us is not a healthy trend for our body, he said. But Democrats said they have no intention of holding back on the Trump administration. Just after Wednesday nights vote, Warren tweeted that shes deeply disappointed by Sessionss confirmation, and vowed that she and other Democrats will speak out if the attorney general violates the law.

You may call that sentiment Orwellian, but nine out of ten Republicans would call it common sense: A new poll from Emerson College finds 90 percent of Republicans believe that the Trump administration is truthful  while less than 10 percent say the same about the news media. By contrast, 77 percent of Democrats believe the Trump White House is untruthful, while 69 percent think the news media generally tells the truth. Independents tend to think theyre all a bunch of liars, with 52 percent calling the administration untruthful and 47 percent calling the media the same. Republicans nearly unanimous trust in the Trump White House  and contempt for the Fourth Estate  means that, on the whole, voters have more faith in the president: Forty-nine percent call the Trump administration truthful, 48 percent say the opposite; for the media, those numbers are 39 and 53, respectively. Ultimately, these results are probably more dismaying for journalists than they are encouraging for Trump. Overwhelming trust from self-identified Republicans is nice, but majority distrust from independents is not. Trump would not have won in November without the support of voters who said they didnt like him. Nothing in Emersons poll  or in the latest Gallup survey  suggests Trump is broadening his base of support. Maybe being less hated than the other candidate will work again in 2020.

Like their dear leader in Washington, North Carolina Republicans are quick to blast activist judges for interfering with their plans: This whining is pretty hilarious coming from people who got the outgoing governor to sign the bill reducing his successors powers as he was packing up his office after refusing to accept his defeat for the longest time.

Reagan, who was not at all reluctant to accompany his arguments for tuition with robust hippie-bashing, never succeeded in charging tuition at the states higher-ed facilities, but did get a camels nose under the tent with higher fees. By the time a new batch of conservative politicians and fiscal hard times arrived in the early 1980s, so too did college tuition in California. And tuition has kept climbing on both coasts and everywhere in between, along with levels of student indebtedness. So it is appropriate that a California city, San Francisco, has become the first to bring back no-tuition college as a reality, at least for that entryway to upward mobility, the community college: Low-income students already benefiting from tuition waivers will get a grant to cover books and transportation costs. But unlike New York Governor Andrew Cuomos free public-college initiative, the basic program is not means-tested (though it also applies only to community college, whereas New Yorks would be much broader). The funding source for the San Francisco free community college is perhaps its most interesting feature: last Novembers successful Proposition W ballot initiative, which imposed a new tax on the sale of properties costing more than $5 million. In a city with insane top-end real-estate prices and some of the worst inequality in the country, theres a lot of justice in this particular form of wealth redistribution.

When the raid was over, al-Rimi was still alive, and on the lam  while one SEAL, 14 (alleged) Al Qaeda fighters, an 8-year-old American citizen, and an unconfirmed number of other civilians lay dead.The SEALs did manage to collect some phones and computers, though the value of the information contained therein is not publicly known. Meanwhile, in light of the raids many civilian casualties, the Yemeni government is starting to rethink its support for U.S. ground operations on its soil. Surveying these results, Arizona senator and prominent war enthusiast John McCain dubbed the mission a failure. Last week, White House press secretary Sean Spicer sounded inclined to agree, telling reporters, I think its hard to ever say something was successful when you lose a life. But for Spicer, its gotten much easier to say such a thing in the days since. The action that was taken in Yemen was a huge success, Spicer said at his press briefing Wednesday. The life of Chief Ryan Owens was done in service to this country and we owe him and his family a great debt for the information that we received during that raid. I think any suggestion otherwise is a disservice to his courageous life and the actions that he just took. Full stop. Spicer did argue (without evidence) that the raid had saved the lives of American civilians (even as it killed an 8-year-old one). But a large part of his case for calling the raid a success seemed to be that Ryan Owens died during it  and, thus, to call it anything less would be to insult a dead American soldier. I think anybody who undermines the success of that [raid] owes an apology and [does] a disservice to the life of Chief Owens, Spicer said. You cant call an American military endeavor a failure without insulting the soldiers who died pursuing it.

As soon as President Trump fires off a tweet explicitly criticizing a publicly traded company, its stock price begins to dip. It happened again today, after Trump tweeted his criticism of Nordstrom, which recently dropped his daughters fashion line. But then something else happened. After a momentary decline, the stock price rose. At post time, Nordstrom was trading at $44.20 a share, up 3.35 percent on the day. Despite drawing the ire of the worlds most powerful man, Nordstroms stock price did not suffer, and its not the first company to have those two things happen in quick succession. Rexnord Corporation drew Trumps ire in December, when he called out the company for its plans to move a factory from Indiana to Mexico. Though its stock price responded with an initial downturn, it closed at a nine-month high Tuesday. And Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported the company is still planning to ship jobs to Mexico. The day after his Rexnord tweet, Trump took shots at Boeing on Twitter and in the lobby of Trump Tower for what he saw as overcharging the government for its work on the Air Force One program. After a small drop that day, Boeings stock price began steadily moving upward and currently sits about 8 percent higher than it was when Trump first tweeted. The pattern holds for United Technologies, GM, and Ford, which all have higher stock prices today than they did when Trump tweeted about them. Toyota, which Trump warned, on January 5, of a big border tax in a tweet full of inaccuracies, is down since the January 5 tweet. But thats reportedly got more to do with disappointing earnings than Trumps admonishment. If Trump really wants to teach a company a lesson, maybe he should try embracing them.

Last month, Trump announced a separation agreement, according to which he would continue to own his business while his children ran it in purportedly independent fashion. In the meantime, he has used his office to enrich that business in numerous ways (that we know of  the concealment of his tax returns means the extent of Trumps self-enrichment will remain unknown to the public). This morning, Trump denounced Nordstrom, which is dropping his daughters brands. At todays press conference, Sean Spicer elaborated. Theres a targeting of her brand and its her name, Spicer said. Shes not directly running the company. Its still her name on it. There are clearly efforts to undermine that name based on her fathers positions on particular policies that hes taken. This is a direct attack on his policies and her name and so theres clearly an attempt for [Trump] to stand up for her being maligned because they have a problem with his policies. It is probably true that Nordstrom is dropping the brand because consumers are refusing to shop there because of the stores association with Donald Trump. If you accept the logic of unlimited entanglement between Trumps presidency and his branding business, this is unavoidable: Trump brands are going to have to reorient themselves to the minority of the public that likes Trump. On the whole, the chance to use the presidency to leverage his brand is a lucrative opportunity for the Trump family, since even an unpopular president like Trump will still command a numerically huge fan base. But many people who loathe the first family will refuse to give them their money. Spicer is asserting that Trump can intermingle his public and private roles as he sees fit, and can enjoy all the financial upside of the arrangement, but should not have to suffer any of the downside. It is the official position of the White House that a store that finds it unprofitable to continue doing business with a Trump brand has made a direct attack on him. The Republican Party as a whole has decided not to object to any of this. Today, Mitch McConnell expressed a high level of satisfaction with the presidents behavior so far. Back during the campaign, there were a lot of questions: Is Trump really a conservative? A lot of questions about it, McConnell says. But if you look at the steps that have been taken so far, looks good to me. And it is true: Trump has supported mostly conventional conservative policies, and in return Republican leaders have turned their back to his unprecedented corruption."}, {"date": "2017/02/08", "title": "Trump Blames Undocumented Immigrants for Gang Violence in Chicago", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-blames-the-undocumented-for-gang-violence-in-chicago.html", "text": " Donald Trump loves to talk about how too many people get murdered in Chicago. Whether hes addressing the Republican National Convention, live-tweeting an episode of The OReilly Factor, giving an interview to ABC News, honoring Black History Month, or talking shop with a conference of sheriffs in D.C., the president makes sure to note that a lot of people get killed in the Windy City, and someone should really do something about it. Most of the time, that someone is himself  but the something is left opaque. Trump has vowed to send in the feds if conditions dont improve, but whether this means increasing federal assistance to Chicago  or occupying the city with federal troops  is unclear. Regardless, Rahm Emanuel asked Trump for federal aid to combat homicide, at a face-to-face meeting in December. That request has, thus far, been denied. In fact, the president has actually threatened to cut federal aid to Chicago, unless the city ceases providing sanctuary to undocumented immigrants. But on Wednesday, Trump suggested that such coercion might be just what Chicago needs to solve its homicide problem. You look at Chicago, and you look at other places, Trump told a law-enforcement conference in Washington. So many of the problems are caused by gang members, many of whom are not even legally in our country. If this were true, then forcing Chicago to crack down on illegal immigration would be an easy way for the federal government to address its homicide problem. And if checking Twitter were a good way to build muscle mass, I would have killer biceps. Alas, we do not live in that beautiful world. There is little evidence that undocumented immigrants commit crimes at a disproportionately high rate  and no evidence, whatsoever, that they are responsible for gang violence in Chicago. Further, sanctuary cities  municipalities that refuse the request of federal authorities to detain undocumented immigrants  tend to have lower crime rates than other cities. Per NPR: Chicago does have a homicide problem. As do many other urban communities where there is concentrated poverty, racial segregation, easily accessible firearms, and low homicide-clearance rates. If Trump wants to make America safer, he will push for federal policies that reduce the number of neighborhoods defined by those conditions. By contrast, if he wants to scapegoat those with the least political power in America for all the nations problems, he will carry on pushing for more draconian policies toward the undocumented. Who can guess which he will choose?"}, {"date": "2017/02/08", "title": "Spring Today, Up to a Foot of Snow Tomorrow", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/spring-today-up-to-a-foot-of-snow-tomorrow.html", "text": " This is very confusing, because New Yorkers are, right now, walking around without coats and squinting in the springlike sunshine, but here goes: In a matter of hours the city will be blanketed in snow.

George Gobel It was Saturday afternoon the day before the Super Bowl and, for the first time, it finally felt real. The Atlanta Falcons had qualified for the big game, a reality that I kept listening to but still could not hear. After arriving in Houston on Wednesday, I roamed the downtown area daily, seeing the word Falcons next to the phrase Super Bowl, but it still didnt make any sense. This was a team, after all, that was championship-less in the 51-year history of the NFL, the home football team of a city that has only one championship in the four major professional sports, that being the 1995 World Series. As a point of comparison, Boston teams have won at least one in all four sports since 2000, nine in total during that time period (four Super Bowls, one Stanley Cup, three World Series, and one NBA Championship). The last time the Falcons were close to the Super Bowl was 2013, making it to the NFC Championship game. I left Barack Obamas second inauguration to fly home to Atlanta for this game, bringing my mother and aunt to be witnesses to this historic moment. Early in the second quarter, the Falcons were leading the San Francisco 49ers 170. The Georgia Dome was a zoo. We could all feel it. We were going to the Super Bowl. At halftime, we were up by 10, 2414. The Falcons never scored again. And the 49ers advanced to the Super Bowl, winning 2824. So yes, actually making it to the Super Bowl was surreal. But as I traversed Houston, there was also a fear that walked alongside me, black cloak and scythe in tow, serving as a reminder that as exciting as this was, this could also backfire colossally. I arrived in Houston with 37 cents in my bank account, a midair victim of identity theft. Bad omen. Then, walking out of the Bank of America waving my fist at the sky and legitimately regretting this trip, I checked my texts. Every text was in all caps. BEYONC KNOWLES IS HAVING TWINS. BEYONC KNOWLES IS FROM HOUSTON. ATLANTA IS IN THE SUPER BOWL IN HOUSTON. I AM FROM ATLANTA. ITS ALL HAPPENING. Good omen. This was the only thing that could have improved my mood, and it did  a true foreshadowing for the week ahead. The slightly delusional narrative that this was Atlantas time was repeatedly met by something to scare the hell out of me, followed by a completely unrelated something else that I could convince myself was a sign that the Falcons would win the Super Bowl. Its what Falcons fans had all been doing for weeks, convincing ourselves that Donald Glover and Migos and John Lewis would carry us to victory as much as Matt Ryan and Julio Jones. And that irrational belief made sense: Relying on Atlanta athletes alone hasnt worked out too well, because we needed everything  signs, omens, crystals, everything  to be in sync for this to finally work. But this whiplash way of thinking meant that the more I thought about football, the more nervous I became about the game. So my strategy became to fill my waking hours in Houston with distractions, while putting myself in positions to have people see me  draped in Falcons gear as a smokescreen of confidence  and assure me that they thought it was our time. One of the best sites for consistent distraction was the main Super Bowl hotel  the Hilton Americas  which provided a packed lobby, a bar, and a catwalk for people to temporarily act as famous as actual athletes. It was a reminder that the Super Bowl is the all-star game for on-air television talent. Sitting at the bar, you can just spend hours watching the kind-of-famous (and the agents who kind of love them) have stand-up meetings in the center of the lobby, so everyone can watch or go up to them and ask for pictures. Nothing about this is accidental and its truly phenomenal to watch, the insecure celebutanteness of it all  like when the juniors and seniors are gone and the sophomores get to act like the kings and queens of school. If youve spent time in the sports-media universe, that makes it even better  an opportunity to lock eyes with the people you mock online in real life, people who know who you are and dont like the fact that youre wearing a bucket hat and yellow tinted shades surrounded by suits and not walking by to come kiss the ring. The main hotel bars at the great sporting weekends like Super Bowl and NBA All-Star Weekend are legendary places to people-watch. But theres no barrier to entry in these spaces, and by the second or third day, they become entirely packed with people, because word gets out. To find the actual athletes, to see some truly silly things, you have to go a bit off the grid  know some people, be in the right place at the right time, be sneaky, lie all the time, and get lucky. At the end of each night in Houston, something absurd enough happened to again make me forget that my Falcons were in the Super Bowl. There are always the one or two big parties that hundreds (or thousands) of people try to get into, but at some point  reliably  a surprising someone presents you with an interesting detour off the beaten path, something you always respond to with absolutely. One night, for example, I was underdressed at an extremely fancy party sponsored by CAA, which led to sneaking into an EA party unfortunately headlined by musics Menendez Brothers, the Chainsmokers, which then led to sitting three seats over from Terrell Owens in a private section of a bar that did not merit private sections, patiently hoping one of his friends would pass me a pineapple vodka. On another night, network rivals Fox and ESPN both had parties, the former of which included a man on stilts and the latter a performance by Fergie. Once I found a way to the top floor of the ESPN party, however, it was a reminder that all rivalries crumble in the VIP. You know, kind of like Hillary and Bill at Trumps wedding or something. By the end of the night, Id agreed to work for both companies at the same time, and said that if the Falcons won Id report live from Atlantas famed Magic City strip club. This pace got me to Saturday afternoon. After three full days of experiencing the many different waves of Super Bowl week, including doing videos, going on television, and recording podcasts, all in the name of discussing my love for and nervousness about the Falcons, I finally crashed. Two weeks prior, football had become a much-needed distraction from the happenings of the real world. But with only 24 hours left until the Super Bowl, exhausted from partying, terrified by football, and unwilling to go back into politics for one more day, I laid in my bed in the middle of the afternoon and flipped through the channels. News. Football. Football. News. News. Football. News. Just when I was ready to give up on television, one station fully stopped me in my tracks. I landed on the channel, four minutes into an infomercial, advertising a ten-DVD set of the Best of Johnny Carson. I didnt know this was what I wanted, but it was exactly what I needed. I turned the volume up, turned my brain off, and just laughed. Seeing a nervous Oprah Winfrey hit The Tonight Show stage, alongside Jerry Seinfeld (whom shed apparently never met before) was remarkable. Watching Carson riff reminded me of Dana Carvey impersonating Carson, which then led to me watch Carsenio four times, damn near crying with laughter. And seeing Dom DeLuise go back and forth with Johnny Carson transported me about as far away from Trump, the Falcons, and the idea of going out as I could imagine. It was an incredible hard reset, so much so it almost felt as if Id just gotten to Houston. One of the final sketches was from a 1969 episode of The Tonight Show. The first two guests were Bob Hope and Dean Martin  both veterans and superstars. The final guest was the lesser-known actor and comedian George Gobel. He walks onto the stage with a clear plastic cup, most certainly a few drinks in. With Bob and Dean sliding over so George can sit closest to Carson, he begins a bit filled with self-deprecation. Early in his story, clearly the odd man out, he asks a question: Do you ever get the feeling that the world is a tuxedo and you were a pair of brown shoes? The room erupts in laughter, and then Gobel takes another big sip from his cup. Once the howling dies down, Gobel continues: And I have a feeling its gonna get worse before it gets better. The laughs continue and Gobel stumbles through a series of drunken stories. While this is happening, without Gobel noticing, Dean Martin begins to ash his cigarette in Gobels drink, something Hope and Carson and the studio audience find hysterical. Still laughing at the bit, I went downstairs and ordered some gumbo, had a drink, decided it was time to pack for an early-morning flight out of Houston to Atlanta. I was over all the glitz and pomp surrounding the Super Bowl and truly just wanted this game to finally happen. I was going to give up a Super Bowl ticket to watch the game with my friends back home, a decision that felt true and honest. When asked about that decision, my prepared answer was that I wanted to be home for the greatest celebration the city might ever see. I said it so many times I actually began to believe it, but I knew it wasnt the truth. The reality was that I needed a break from this Atlanta fan caricature Id developed and, win or lose, itd be more of the same in Houston. Win or lose in Atlanta, itd be my purest emotion  extreme elation or devastating sadness. Either way, Id be feeling something. This extremely emotional spurt I was having over hotel gumbo was immediately interrupted by Ezekiel Elliott, who had come down to the bar and, only feet away, asked the bartender for a quadruple Patrn on the rocks. Twenty-one-year-olds are the absolute worst. I loved it. Watching the bartender say no was a highlight, as was watching another player in the bar trade his number with two women, and one of them asking a second bartender, Who was that? after he left the hotel. That second player was a comical reminder of an event like the Super Bowl. If youre at least six-foot-two, black, and have a beard, theres a 92 percent chance someone is going to ask to take a picture of you. Thats the funny part about football: Its a helmeted sport, so youre often as familiar with NFL players butts as you are with their faces. I stayed and watched more potentially real NFL players come in and out of the hotel lobby, all being treated like superstars. It was a nice reminder that there was still fun to squeeze out of the absurdity of this weekend. There was, after all, a retirement party for Michael Vick later that night co-hosted by Vick and Gucci Mane. And before that, I was set to go to a dinner sponsored by Nike with special guest ex-Falcon Warrick Dunn. There was so much Atlanta on the horizon. Theres no way it could be coincidental  it must be another sign. Just like that, I was back in narrative mode. It was truly remarkable how unstable Id become. Just like Id been saying for the past two weeks, everything that could mean something but definitely didnt actually mean anything most certainly felt like an omen. On Thursday, for example, the Atlanta Hawks came into Houston and beat the Rockets in thrilling come-from-behind fashion. Sign. The next day, I went to the first half of the Rockets-Bulls game and they were honoring Yao Ming. In attendance: former Hawk Dikembe Mutombo. Sign. It all just seemed too right  there was too much Atlanta in life for this all to blow up in my face. I never packed my bag Saturday afternoon and now it was 5 a.m. on Sunday morning. I also was not headed to the airport; I was on hour two at an after-hours warehouse in Houston  a place I was driven to by someone that my friend just met  following a stint at a Vanity Fair black-tie-ish party that required telling the bouncer with the iPad that I was an ESPN executive and that I was fully aware that my white T-shirt and yellow anorak was a different look simply to gain admission. I was having fun all night, but I also could feel my nerves about heading back home. The day had finally come, and I was filled with dread, so I didnt want to go to sleep. I recognized that the only thing that could destroy this anxious elation, this city-wide pride, and this feeling of real hope and belief that had steadily risen over the past few weeks was the actual game. The two weeks leading up to the Super Bowl were about as much fun as Ive had as a sports fan. It felt nice to be noticed. To be discussed. To have people on your side. To finally have respect. Id grown tired of, professionally, chronicling Atlantas sports sorrow. It was exhausting to get excited, to then fall on your face. And if any moment seemed like one in which Id get to discuss triumph over loss, it was this Super Bowl. But even with that reality within reach, the game could also turn out so terribly that wed go from being invisible to a laughing stock. We could get blown out or, even worse, we could get up in the game, taste it, and then lose it at the end. Fans, myself included, spoke all season about how we didnt mind being under the radar  but its Atlanta, the land of civil-rights leaders and rappers and mega-preachers and reality television. We love attention. And more than that, we love to talk our shit  were really good at it, even when we dont have a leg to stand on. I knew I could handle another letdown  we all could  but I wanted our city to feel that emotion that so many have felt. Watching both Cleveland and Chicago have their moment this past year, seeing so many people close to me go through that joy, only intensified the desire. And I wanted to be home for it. For that joy. For those tears. For the city. For the parade. For the A. Robert Alford picking off Tom Brady and walking that interception into the end zone like it was Freaknik to put the Falcons up 210, deep into the second quarter, was the moment I knew we were actually going to win the Super Bowl. Every thought Id suppressed in the spirit of never being sure, of jinxing, of theres a lot of game left, was gone. I was hugging a guy in another section of the Atlanta bar STATS, then running into my section filled with friends I grew up with and everyone was just screaming at each other. I thought about my guy, fellow journalist Lang Whitaker, whom I watch Falcons games with in New York, and who is an Atlanta native and probably losing his mind in the arena in Houston. I thought about my friend from high school Bradley who left me a voice-mail of hope before the game who was certainly talking felonious amounts of shit to any Pats fans that might be near. I thought about D-Roc from the Ying Yang Twins, who bought me a Fireball shot in the Houston airport en route to Atlanta, and after we drank it screamed, HANH. I thought about my uncle, who has been a Falcons fan since one could be a Falcons fan, who would finally have a reason to celebrate, and who was going to write the longest, best Facebook post about it. And I thought about myself. The game wasnt over and my body had never felt like this. I was speechless. In the moment when I thought Id have everything to say, I got really quiet and extremely happy. When the score hit 283, however, I was beating my chest. I knew this version of myself  brash and loud and unwavering in my confidence  but never in a game that mattered, never in the game that finally proved you were the best, that you  finally were a winner. Yet again, the Falcons never scored again. Up by 25 points, 283, in the third quarter of the Super Bowl, with 100 million people watching, the New England Patriots won the Super Bowl 3428. Sitting on my mothers couch in Atlanta watching the Patriots parade Tuesday morning, it truly didnt make any sense. We choked. All morning I tortured myself, watching replays, listening to commentary, and worst of all, seeing former players repeatedly say theyd rather not be in the Super Bowl than lose in the way the Falcons did. With the coverage going in and out of the parade, I kept catching myself smiling as Brady and Belichick and Kraft made speeches. I cant stand them, but my body was responding the way Id always responded watching other teams parades  a smile of longing for that feeling. Each time I felt the smile happen, Id stop it from going full teeth out of shame, but it kept coming back. I wanted it, we had it, and then it was gone. Atlanta is a city of legends, but not a city of winners  not yet at least. Its part of our DNA, style often more than substance. Its why we thought the signs were real, because thats the stuff we love: the mythology that surrounds the city that everyone knows about but no one understands. Its why, over the years, weve fallen in love with players like Dominique Wilkins and Michael Vick  players that brought home no rings, but made the city feel cool, because they were so electrifying. Its also why were thought of as fans of indifference, because its hard for most to understand a place that doesnt put winning over everything. For a few weeks, though, I understood how everyone else felt  with being a winner mattering more than anything else. It was a foreign feeling, but it felt good. It was fun. It was contagious. It was passionate. And after losing, in the fashion we lost, it hurt  because not only were we not winners, but we were beginning to feel like losers. Turning off the television to pack and finally leave Atlanta, I stopped and had one final dumbfounded laugh. George Gobels brown shoes in a sea of tuxedos  that was Atlanta. And more than any other moment I can ever remember, I felt like that stiff drink, except I knew that someone was ashing in my cup. But, for now, I kept taking sips  Id just run out of the energy to care. Maybe tomorrow."}, {"date": "2017/02/08", "title": "Want to Talk to Trump?

Instead, most of the talk has been about the private insurance exchanges, and the subsidies that help pay for individual policies, and the purchasing mandates designed to encourage younger and healthier Americans to participate, and the mandated benefit packages, and the regulations against preexisting-condition exclusions and overcharging old folks. Thats understandable due to the incredible complexity of the exchanges and the high visibility of premium increases and insurers pulling out of the exchanges altogether. But any repeal and replace scheme absolutely has to deal with Medicaid. And left to their own devices, Republicans would almost certainly pursue an idea thats been nestled in various Ryan budgets and was embraced by Donald Trump on the campaign trail: a Medicaid block grant that would to a greater or lesser degree shift responsibility for indigent health care to the states, in the process saving the feds a big chuck of change and getting rid of all those headachy policy decisions related to a troublesome, Democratic-leaning constituency. Unfortunately for the GOP, 31 states  including 16 governed by Republicans  accepted the ACA Medicaid expansion, going in exactly the opposite direction conservatives nationally have supported. Some including the current vice-president of the United States (who was then governor of Indiana)  rationalized accepting the filthy federal lucre (a much higher federal match rate covering new enrollees) for an expansion because the Obama administration let them conduct conservative-sounding policy experiments, mostly involving the kind of premiums and co-pays Medicaid beneficiaries normally dont have to deal with. So the political and substantive complexity of squaring a Medicaid block grant with Medicaid expansion on the ground has helped place Medicaid on the back burner for the Trump administration and congressional Republicans, as something that would probably be handled in a second budget bill later in 2017, or perhaps even in freestanding legislation  or, well, somewhere far down the road. Now there are signs that is changing. Politicos Jennifer Haberkorn reports that the transformation of Medicaid could be in the very first budget-reconciliation bill aimed at repealing Obamacare  the bill already authorized by a budget resolution that was whipped through Congress last month. But the above-mentioned dilemmas have not gone away: My guess is that they will come up with a Solomon-style solution, picking some arbitrary enrollment figure halfway between states that expanded Medicaid and states that did not  recognizing that there were major state variations even before Obamacare. But the key thing to understand is that putting a Medicaid block grant into the repeal bill means it can be enacted without Democratic votes. And more generally, doing so successfully would mean Republicans had succeeded in all but abolishing a key Great Society federal-safety-net program by making it about Obamacare. For the many millions of Americans who would ultimately be affected  including the majority of Republican voters who have no idea Obamacare repeal will affect Medicaid  it would represent a classic bait and switch. It would be a very good time for Democrats and others who care about guaranteeing that the poorest and sickest Americans have access to lifesaving health care to stop playing the GOP game of getting down into the weeds of Obamacares private-insurance provisions and beginning pointing and shouting about what Republicans may be about to do to Medicaid."}, {"date": "2017/02/08", "title": "ACA Repeal Is Forcing Republicans to Choose Between Conservatism and Compassion", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/aca-repeal-forces-the-gop-to-choose-conservatism-or-cruelty.html", "text": " These days, congressional Republicans cant go to a CNN town hall without some sickly citizen asking them, in so many words, Are you going to kill me? It happened to Paul Ryan, last month, and to Ted Cruz, last night. In each instance, the legislator assured an American with a curable cancer  whose life had been saved by the Affordable Care Act  that the GOP would never abandon those with preexisting conditions to their fates. But all the ensuing rhetoric about choice and access couldnt cover up the queasy subtext of these encounters: If Ryan and Cruz had had their way, they wouldnt have to answer these questions, because the questioners would be dead. To say that Obamacare saved your life is to say that Paul Ryan tried to kill you. When given the choice between maintaining a status quo that would have condemned Jeff Jeans to death  or a health-care law that raised taxes on the rich  every congressional Republican, in 2009, chose the former. In truth, Are you going to kill me? is a softball  the real question is, Why did you try to end my life? Ryan and Cruz both managed to evade that question, explicitly. But the GOPs deliberations over an Obamacare repeal are haunted by the political untenability of the answer: The ideological tenets of movement conservatism were more important to us than your survival. Now that a Republican president is in the White House, the congressional GOP has lost the courage of this conviction. Publicly, Ryan and company promise that people with preexisting conditions  who are currently covered under the ACA  will retain their insurance, so long as they maintain continuous coverage. This pledge is considerably less humane than Republicans make it sound. For one, by itself, this commitment does nothing for those who have yet to develop preexisting conditions, but will in the future. For another, maintaining continuous coverage isnt as easy as it sounds: If you lose your job  and can no longer afford to pay your premiums  then insurers will once again be free to deny you coverage. Nonetheless, Republicans are finding it difficult to make good on even this meager promise, as Politico reports: In most debates about social welfare, Republicans can tell a coherent story about why the conservative solution does not, in truth, amount to let the weak suffer. They can frame cutting food assistance to the indigent as a tough-love measure  one that will help the poor develop the skills of self-sufficiency. They can claim that requiring employers to provide family leave (and other benefits) will ultimately hurt American workers, by reducing hiring. And even on health care, before the ACA was passed, conservatives could plausibly tell an American audience that government intervention would cost lives, not save them. But now those who were saved by big government are standing in front of them; calling their offices; filling their town halls. And the truth about what conservatism demands can no longer be denied. A for-profit insurance industry will never provide affordable coverage to the already sick, absent government intervention to force the healthy onto their rolls. You simply cannot have a humane health-care system without socializing risk: The rich and healthy subsidize the treatment of the poor and sick, or else the latter die preventable deaths. And its a lot harder to blame the ill for their lot than it is to blame the unemployed  theres no plausible story to tell about how all the cancer patients would get better if the government just stopped coddling them. This is why every other major conservative party in the Western world has accepted that regulating health care is a legitimate government function. For Republicans, the choice on Obamacare is conservatism or compassion; collectivism or barbarism; to moderate their fanatical ideology, or sacrifice their most vulnerable constituents on its altar."}, {"date": "2017/02/08", "title": "Heres How Donald Trump Responded to Nordstrom Dropping Ivankas Line", "url": "http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/02/trump-tweets-at-nordstrom-after-they-drop-ivanka-trump-brand.html", "text": " Last week, Nordstrom confirmed that theyd be dropping the Ivanka Trump brand from their stores, citing the brands performance.

The Muslim Brotherhood, a broad Islamic political movement, officially renounced violence in the 1970s in favor of nonviolent reform. Throughout the next several decades, the Brotherhood and its regional offshoots became entrenched in the political structures of the Muslim world, fighting within governments to achieve their political goals. Still, the campaign to name the group a terrorist organization has persisted because its stated goal is to wage violent jihad against its enemies, Senator Ted Cruz said in 2015 when he introduced the Muslim Brotherhood Terrorist Designation Act. Despite pressure from Egyptian leaders, where the Brotherhood was pushed out of power in 2013, and American lawmakers, some of whom fear a fictional bogeyman of Muslim Brotherhood invasion in small-town America, the Obama administration resisted calls to designate the group a terror organization because there was no evidence that its leaders had systematically ordered terrorist attacks, the Times says. Naming the Muslim Brotherhood a terror group would be largely symbolic another bone thrown to the wing of GOP who believes its the foundation of modern terrorism, as Steve Bannon once said. But its also controversial within the government, as experts within the State Department tell the White House that there is no legal basis for it and that it could alienate allies in the region, the Times says. Granting Irans Revolutionary Guard the same designation, on the other hand, is reportedly a popular plan in the White House. While the Guards Quds Force is already on the U.S. terrorist list, naming the Guard itself a terror organization could create some upheaval in the Middle East. According to Reuters, problems could include further inflaming regional conflicts and mucking up the fight against ISIS in Iraq, where the U.S. and Iran are on the same side. The goal of the designation from the White Houses perspective, among other things, would be to dissuade foreign governments from doing business with Iran, where the Revolutionary Guard is deeply involved in the economy."}, {"date": "2017/02/08", "title": "Mayor de Blasio Will Reportedly Get Home-Field Advantage in Interview With Feds", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/feds-will-interview-mayor-de-blasio-on-his-turf.html", "text": " New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio confirmed last month that he would sit down with federal prosecutors, who are investigating the fundraising activities around his 2013 mayoral campaign and his now-shuttered nonprofit.

But in a surprising move, U.S. Attorneys will question the mayor in his territory  or more specifically, in the offices of de Blasios attorney, reports the New York Times, instead of on Preet Bhararas turf. The session will last four hours and cover at least a dozen topics, sources say, though its unclear exactly what those might be. Federal prosecutors are probing whether donors received special favors for giving to the mayors campaign, or to Campaign for One New York, de Blasios nonprofit, which disbanded last year. A grand jury has reportedly convened around the investigation, which may be honing in on at least one issue: the mayoral campaigns relationship to Queens restaurateur Harendra Singh. Singh is believed to be cooperating with authorities, and faces separate federal charges for a Hurricane Sandyrelated fraud scheme and another where he allegedly doled out favors to Long Island politicians. But grand-jury proceedings are secret, so details are scarce on the line of inquiry Feds are pursuing. Prosecutors with the Manhattan D.A.s office have also interviewed de Blasio, though thats a different investigation into possible violations of campaign-finance law during the 2014 State Senate races. A grand jury also met in that case, though de Blasio said he was not questioned by it. De Blasio has consistently denied any wrongdoing.

Bush Had Authoritarian Tendencies, Too.", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/george-w-bush-had-authoritarian-tendencies-too.html", "text": " Efforts to put Donald Trumps authoritarian tendencies into a historical context usually begin with the simultaneously troubling and reassuring precedent of Richard M. Nixon. Like Trump, Nixon was a mistrustful and self-conscious outsider who hated the news media and compulsively focused on enemies. As we fear Trump will do, Nixon harnessed government resources to harass those enemies, ordered widespread law-breaking, expanded presidential powers to the breaking point, and tried to hide his more nefarious activities from scrutiny. But despite his power and a reelection landslide victory that makes a mockery of Trumps pretensions of popularity, Nixon was brought to heel and eventually forced to resign. A potential authoritarian threat to democracy was repulsed. Nixon was not, however, unique in succumbing to the temptations of an imperial presidency. As Jonathan Rauch reminds us in an important new analysis of how to contain Trump if he goes off the rails, all presidents cross lines and seek to expand their powers. And in fact, the most relevant precedent may be a relatively recent one: Its initially hard to think of the sometimes-comical and often self-deprecating W. as resembling the volatile narcissist in the White House today; when Bush call himself the decider, more people laughed than cowered. But whatever the 43rd president lacked in bully-boy arrogance the people around him  most notably his vice-president  supplied abundantly. And there is no getting around the fact that the Bush team deliberately exploited the national emergency of 9/11 to do all sorts of things it had no real popular mandate to do, most notably the invasion and occupation of Iraq, and to intimidate opponents with the charge of anti-Americanism. It is very easy to imagine Team Trump doing the same thing. The presidents charge that he would hold the court system responsible for any future terrorist attacks is a credible threat that like Bush he might convert a national-security failure into a warrant for near-total power. As Rauch notes, however, Bush was, like Nixon, eventually brought to heel as well, without the trauma of a threatened impeachment and a resignation. He quotes one-time Bush administration Justice Department official Jack Goldsmith as describing a giant distributed networks of lawyers, investigators, and auditors, both inside and outside the executive branch that reined in a potentially authoritarian regime: Eventually Congress and the courts joined this effort, and in 2006, so did the American electorate, in a midterm buffeting of the presidents party that ruined Karl Roves painstaking efforts to build a durable GOP majority based on a combination of national-security fearmongering and carefully targeted domestic initiatives. But it was a near thing. The good news is that many of the same forces that helped rein in Bush are at hand today, and Trumps open contempt for norms has put them on high alert. But as Trumps election showed, the old norms dont have the power they had in the past  even the most recent past. It should be relatively apparent that the first step toward making sure the Trump administration doesnt lurch down the path to authoritarian abuse of power via a national-security emergency is to deny it the sort of government-of-national-salvation status Bush and his team enjoyed in the wake of 9/11. If that means Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans (the few who are left, anyway) have to run the risk of being attacked for insufficient patriotism, so be it. It is their patriotic duty to do so. And as the example of George W. Bush shows, the sooner the president is denied imperial powers, the sooner his imperial pretensions can be exposed as mere power-grabs. With luck, there will not be an incident like 9/11  or the Iraq War  during the Trump presidency. But if there is, does anyone doubt he will exploit it to the hilt? Thats the authoritarian emergency for which we must all prepare."}, {"date": "2017/02/08", "title": "Elizabeth Warren, Mitch McConnell, and the Gag Rule", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/elizabeth-warren-violates-gag-rule-by-criticizing-sessions.html", "text": " In 1836, at the behest of slave interests in the South, Congress created a rule prohibiting any debate over slavery in either House. The putative rationale for the rule was that Congress had no authority over slavery, therefore the issue was irrelevant, and any petition addressing slavery would be immediately tabled. John Quincy Adams, a former president turned member of the House and anti-slavery activist, called this the gag rule. The U.S. Senate in 2017 has applied a version of this rule to the debate over the nomination of Alabama senator Jeff Sessions for attorney general. Sessionss candidacy is obviously not the moral equivalent of slavery. It is, however, a faint echo of the same political tradition. Sessions is not an advocate of restoring slavery or even legal segregation. But he has labored during his career to restrict African-American voter registration, and is the senator mostly closely identified with Trumps ethno-nationalist themes. Sessions was the first senator to endorse Trump, and served as a valuable adviser to him and a platform between traditional Republicanism and the presidents brand of populist white identity politics. The rule in question, Rule 19, is a longstanding, though selectively enforced, ban on senators ascribing to another senator or to other senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a senator in a floor speech. Last night, Senator Elizabeth Warren denounced Sessions, and read from a 1986 letter by Coretta Scott King opposing Sessionss candidacy for a federal judgeship (which was denied). The Republican majority halted her speech on the grounds that she impugned the motives and conduct of our colleague from Alabama. The rule against impugning fellow senators is a slightly absurd imposition of etiquette designed to protect the swollen senatorial ego. What makes it not merely silly but utterly absurd in this instance is the fact that the senator being protected in this case is not only a party to the debate, along with 99 other senators, but also the subject of the debate. And the very argument of Sessionss critics is that he is unworthy of the office to which he has been nominated. The application of Rule 19, which has not always been enforced, prevents opponents of his candidacy from making their case. Many historians of the 19th century believe the gag rule backfired against the South. It dramatized the undemocratic nature of the Slave Power, changed the subject from the merits of slavery to the merits of being allowed to debate slavery (thus broadening the opposing coalition), and ultimately created far more publicity for anti-slavery petitions. Mitch McConnells gag rule on Elizabeth Warren will likely have the same effect. Sessions has the votes for confirmation, but the grossness with which his colleagues have suppressed criticism of his record has given the opposition a platform, and a cause."}, {"date": "2017/02/08", "title": "When the Ban Was Announced, My Husband Stopped Breathing", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/a-syrian-family-torn-in-two.html", "text": " For Doha Allahham, 42, a refugee living in Bayonne, New Jersey, Donald Trumps executive orders on immigration have left the fate of her children in the balance.

Democrats have no common agreement on a strategy, or even what objective to pursue. Thus they find themselves divided between one faction pursuing hopeless, doomed confrontation, and another advocating capitulation. The correct strategy is to approach the nomination from the standpoint of maximizing their ability to win future Supreme Court nomination fights. That means mounting a filibuster against the nomination, forcing the Republican Party to end the filibuster, and then voting to seat Gorsuch. The liberal argument for refusing to filibuster the nomination proceeds from the assumption that Democrats have the choice between Gorsuch and some other justice, and should base their vote on his qualifications and record. Gorsuch comes from the far extreme right, says Senator Jeff Merkley, who is leading the opposition. On the opposing side, Gorsuchs Democratic defenders insists he is better than the alternative. Moderates could do a lot worse than Judge Neil Gorsuch, argues Yale law professor E. Donald Elliott, and we probably will if he isnt confirmed. The prospect that Gorsuch will be defeated and replaced with a more extreme alternative is not worth considering. His nomination is a fait accompli. Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last month that the 52 Republican senators would seat whomever Donald Trump nominated for the Supreme Court vacancy  The nominee will be confirmed  even if it required abolishing the filibuster on Supreme Court nominations. Defeating Gorsuch is not a realistic option for Democrats. Contrary to the slogans of Gorsuchs critics, he is not extreme by the standards of a Republican nominee. The reason to oppose him is the legitimate belief that Republicans had no right to prevent Barack Obama from filling the vacancy when it opened. But Republicans have already won that fight. So what is there left to win? This is the major source of Democratic confusion. They should cross the aisle and join Republicans to cut off a filibuster, allowing an up-or-down vote by a simple majority on Judge Gorsuch, argues Elliott. That will prevent Republicans from invoking the nuclear option to change the Senate rules and abolish the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees. University of Colorado law professor Melissa Hart endorses the same conclusion. If Democrats filibuster, she warns, Republicans will eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations and the selection of judges  both for the Supreme Court and for the lower federal courts  will forever be a purely partisan process. It is very odd to argue that Democrats should value the existence of a weapon they can never use. The worst-case scenario for Democrats would be a system in which Republican presidents are able to seat a Supreme Court justice with 50 votes, but Democrats can only seat a justice if they can muster 60 votes. There is a lot of reason to believe this is the system that exists right now. If McConnell can smash all preexisting norms by blockading a Supreme Court vacancy, claim he is doing so in the name of voters, proceed to lose the next presidential election by 3 million votes, and then announce the next nominee will be confirmed sight unseen with or without a single Democratic vote, then McConnell can fill a Court seat any time he has 50 votes. Elliott argues that Democrats should save the filibuster for the next Supreme Court fight, which she predicts will matter more. And perhaps it will. But the technical existence of the filibuster would not give Democrats any leverage. The importance of the battle would simply increase the internal pressure on Republican senators to hold ranks. Democrats have nothing to gain by keeping the filibuster on the books. On the other hand, they have a great deal to lose. The last two Democratic Supreme Court nominees were confirmed only because Democrats had near filibuster-proof Senate margins at the time. The last nominee, Elena Kagan, received just 5 Republican votes, and several of those Republicans faced intense backlash from primary challengers for doing so. (Indiana Senator Richard Lugar was defeated in a primary in part because he voted for Democratic justices.) If the next Democratic president gets a Supreme Court vacancy, he or she will have an extremely difficult time defeating a filibuster. Democrats will probably need to abolish the filibuster for Supreme Court picks to get their justice seated. They may or may not have enough votes to do it. Some of their members (like West Virginia senator Joe Manchin) have political reasons to avoid siding with their party in a high-stakes social-policy fight. Other Democratic senators have expressed institutional reluctance to change the Senate rules. What they need is for Republicans to end the judicial filibuster for them. McConnell is a norm-violator. Thats what he does. Hes very good at it. Keeping in place an ambiguous set of rules, such as giving the minority a blocking power that the majority openly threatens to eliminate if it is used, is the kind of circumstance under which his tactics thrive. Democrats can eliminate his advantage only if they force the norms and the rules to say the same thing. The tactical imperative for Democrats lines up neatly with their moral understanding of the battle lines. Democrats object to the Republican Partys right to nominate anybody to fill the current vacancy. Most agree that if Republicans did have such a right, Gorsuch would make for a highly qualified pick. Their correct tactic is to hold 41 senators together to mount a filibuster on the explicit grounds that the seat belongs to a Barack Obama nominee. Once McConnell eliminates the filibuster, they should support Gorsuch on the final ballot to indicate their endorsement of his qualifications. If, on the other hand, they let McConnell seat Gorsuch without eliminating his own ability to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee later, they may come to regret it."}, {"date": "2017/02/08", "title": "Chaffetz Assures Everyone That Trump Wouldnt Even Let Him Talk About Oversight", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/chaffetz-says-trump-wouldnt-let-him-talk-about-oversight.html", "text": " On Tuesday, Voxs Ezra Klein published a piece arguing that the real threat to Americas system of government isnt President Trump, but a Congress that wont do its job.

Her infraction: quoting from a 30-year-old letter written by the late Coretta Scott King. In 1986 the Senate denied then-Alabama attorney general Sessionss nomination to be a federal judge. Warren read criticisms of Sessions from that debate, including the late senator Edward Kennedys comment, He is, I believe, a disgrace to the Justice Department and he should withdraw his nomination and resign his position. She also quoted from a letter Martin Luther King Jr.s widow wrote to the Senate. Mr. Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to serve as a federal judge, King wrote. This simply cannot be allowed to happen. After Warren read Kennedys quote, the Senates presiding officer on Tuesday night, Senator Steve Daines, warned her not to violate the Senate rule against impugning the motives of a fellow senator. She protested that she was merely reading the words of others, and Sessions was not a senator when they made their remarks. Daines said Rule 19 applies to quotes, articles, or other materials, but Warren was allowed to continue. A short time later McConnell cut in to object that Warren had once again impugned the motives and conduct of our colleague from Alabama, pointing to lines from Kings letter. Warren said she was surprised that Kings words werent suitable for the Senate floor and appealed the ruling. The Senate voted 49-43, along party lines, to confirm that Warren had violated Senate rules. Now she is forbidden from speaking on the Sessions nomination. Senator Warren was giving a lengthy speech, McConnell said. She had appeared to violate the rule. She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted. So far it looks like McConnells move backfired, particularly because Warrens speech wasnt likely to prevent Sessions from being confirmed on Wednesday. Warren quickly took to social media and the moment went viral, sparking the hashtag #LetLizSpeak. She also called in to MSNBC, telling Rachel Maddow, Ive been red-carded on Senator Sessions, Im out of the game of the Senate floor. I dont get to speak at all. The incident gave Democratic lawmakers  who are being pushed by their base to oppose Trump and his party more forcefully  a moment to rally around. Senate Democrats asked that Warren be allowed to continue her speech, and pressed to have Kings letter placed into the Senate record, but Republicans objected. Debate on Sessions will continue into the night, and Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, suggested he intends to violate Rule 19 as well. Warrens defenders highlighted an embarrassing incident from McConnells past, noting that in 2015 Senator Ted Cruz wasnt censured for calling the majority leader a liar on the Senate floor. Others joked that McConnell just wrote the slogan for Warrens 2020 presidential campaign. Redbubble.com is already selling a shirt that reads, She was warned. She was given an explanation.

Thursday afternoon, CNNs Jake Tapper pressed White House aide Kellyanne Conway about the Trump administrations misleading statements on terror coverage  and that was just the start. Tapper pushed Conway over and over again on the administrations sustained assault on the media, why Trump didnt tweet about the allegedly right-wing-inspired Quebec terror attacks, Trumps falsehoods about Americas crime rate, Conways Bowling Green massacre comment, and the administrations apparent disregard for the truth. It was a doozy. The back-and-forth began when, displaying footage of CNN correspondents covering those attacks, Tapper said to Conway, CNN and other media organizations cover terrorism around the world all the time. Saying we dont cover terrorism is just false. Conway admitted that CNN did amazing coverage, but indicated it was the other ones on the list that Trump was really talking about. I think hes making two points here. One is that we just cant allow ourselves to become inured to terrorist attacks, to see it as the new normal. The second point, Conway explained, was that there was too much coverage of other things, like candidate Trump during the GOP primary, and also Prince. Your spin about the idea that we dont want to be inured to that, thats a lovely spin. But thats not what he was saying, Kellyanne. He was saying that the media does not cover these stories because we dont want to cover them because we have some sort of agenda. Thats what he was suggesting, Tapper responded. The back-and-forth continued. Then Tapper made a devastating segue: While were on the subject of not addressing a terrorist attack, I want to ask you: In Quebec City last week, a white right-wing terrorist opened fire on a mosque, a mosque filled with innocent men, women, and children. Six people were killed. President Trump has not said or tweeted one public word about this. You want to talk about ignoring terrorism? Why hasnt the president offered his sympathy to our neighbors in the north? I know hes sympathetic to any loss of life, Conway said of the president. It needs to stop no matter who is lodging the attack. We are of course very sad about loss of life here. She added, He doesnt tweet about everything. He doesnt make a comment about everything, before jumping to Trumps travel ban. Tapper then pointed out that the list the White House distributed didnt include any terror attacks besides those that involved Islamic extremists, and he referred directly to Dylann Roofs hate-fueled massacre in South Carolina. [President Trump] tweeted when there was an attack at the Louvre Museum, where nobody was killed, Tapper said. I dont understand why he wouldnt tweet when six Canadian citizens were murdered. Tapper continued to hammer his point that Trump and his administration were deliberately trying to skew facts and undermine the medias credibility except for certain supportive outlets, pointing to the presidents wholly untrue comment Wednesday that the murder rate in America was the highest its been in 47 years. He said nobody in the media reports on that. Theres a reason nobody in the media reports on that. Its not true. The murder rate is not at the highest rate in 47 years. It spiked a little, it went up a little, but its still much, much lower, Tapper said. Its 4.9 people per 100,000. Thats dwarfed by the murder rate in the 1990s, and before that, in the 1980s, Tapper said. Facts are stubborn things, to say that were not reporting something that happens not to be true, therefore were not to be trusted, thats a problem. Conway dodged the question. Well, Jake, if I can take the broader issue of our relationship with the media. Im among, if not the most, open press person in the White House, Im now being attacked by the media, including networks that are familiar to you. Im just going to keep soldiering on, she said. I came to this White House to serve this president whos serving the people. She then went on to a deliver a word salad about veterans. Thats not addressing what I just talked about, Tapper replied. What were talking about is how the White House is waging war on people who are providing information. He added that hed much rather be covering veterans issues  or immigration, or trade, or, really, anything else. Conway responded that it goes both ways, criticizing some of the negative media coverage of Trump. Tapper followed up, asking Conway if she or the president had ever said something false. Conway brought up her Bowling Green massacre mishap. She apologized for the slip-up, but said she was glad to have raised awareness about the incident, even if it was done inartfully. Later, Tapper tried again to grill Conway about the White Houses attempts to undermine the medias credibility. Finally, Tapper bluntly asked, Are we fake news, Kellyanne? Is CNN fake news? No, I dont think CNN is fake news, Conway conceded. I think there are some reports everywhere, in print, on TV, on radio, in conversation that are not well-researched and are sometimes based on falsehoods. Conway continued to make the point that the media had made mistakes and errors in coverage of Trump, bringing up an anecdote of a reporter who had reached out to Conway after seeing a tweet from a parody account.

The government had the burden of convincing the judges that letting the TRO remain in place while the district court heard the case would represent irreparable harm to the national interest and would also interfere with the presidents exercise of congressionally delegated authority over immigration law. The Justice Departments August Fientje heavily emphasized that authority in his argument, and the more specific congressional warrant for looking closely at the seven countries of origin that are the focus of the travel ban. Fientjes argument that the states involved did not have proper standing to bring the suit  particularly with respect to refugees and visa applicants who had never been in the U.S. (the major groups affected by the ban after it was relaxed to not include those with permanent residence status)  drew much skeptical questioning from the judges, to the exclusion of the merits of the case. Washington State Solicitor General Noah Purcell ran into trouble with at least one of the judges  Richard Clifton, a George W. Bush appointee to the Ninth Circuit  for assertions that a ban affecting a relatively small percentage of Muslims overseas was necessarily religiously motivated. But that same judge upbraided Fientje for suggesting that evidence of an intent to impose a travel ban on Muslims by the president and at least one adviser was just newspaper articles. Both lawyers sought to encourage the judges on the Ninth Circuit panel  Michelle Friedland, an Obama appointee, William Canby, a Jimmy Carter appointee, and Clifton  to tailor a ruling in a way that gave its side the advantage in what happens next. Purcell sought a ruling that would let district court judge James Robart proceed with a hearing on the travel ban without the government interfering via an immediate appeal to the Supreme Court, which the government will most definitely try to pursue if the court of appeals denies its petition for a stay of the temporary restraining order, or TRO. Fientje repeatedly argued that, even if the judges thought the states had standing to bring suit on behalf of actual residents, they should knock out the TRO for people who had not been in the U.S. The New York Times Charlie Savage probably spoke for most listeners in making a perilous tentative prediction based on the oral arguments: But all that would mean is that the case would, for an instant at least, proceed at the district-court level, even as Trumps lawyers sought to drag SCOTUS in to stop it and (at least temporarily) restore the travel ban. Its unclear when the Ninth Circuit panel will make its ruling  though some time this week is a good guess. It would be wise to take any cheers and jeers for whatever it does with a grain of salt. This case probably has a long way to go in the courts, and both sides will obviously keep trying to score points in the court of public opinion as well."}, {"date": "2017/02/07", "title": "Trump Administration Gives Final Approval to Dakota Access Pipeline", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/army-gives-final-approval-to-dakota-access-pipeline.html", "text": " The Trump administration gave Energy Transfer Partners the green light to complete construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline Tuesday. The pipeline is 85 percent built, but its final leg cuts across land owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  and under the Missouri River, just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The Sioux see the pipeline as a threat to its sacred land and water supply, and mobilized a coalition of environmentalists and Native American rights activists to protest its construction last year. That activism persuaded the Obama administration to conduct an environmental-impact assessment and consider alternative routes for the pipeline. But then Donald Trump became president, and within his first week, signed an executive order encouraging the Army Corps to expedite its review and approval process. Army Corps officials told Congress Tuesday that it would be approving the final permit necessary for the pipelines completion, without a full environmental review  and that Energy Transfer Partners would be free to begin construction as soon as Wednesday. The Standing Rock Sioux plan to challenge the Armys decision in court. But as Voxs Brad Plumer notes, their prospects dont look good: Several hundred protesters remain camped out around the Standing Rock Reservation, and they plan to wage mass resistance far beyond what Trump has seen so far.

But the surprisingly difficult struggle over DeVos is not a good sign for the policies with which she has been identified. For one thing, her nomination and her performance in confirmation hearings galvanized public education advocates to an unprecedented degree, and also made her a symbol of the sometimes comical fecklessness of the incoming Trump administration generally. As Alia Wong notes, DeVos was the target of a savagely effective Saturday Night Live skit and has become something of a social-media cartoon villain. What matters most about DeVos, though, is the polarizing effect her nomination produced in the Senate. None of the ten Democratic senators from states carried by Trump who are up for reelection in 2018 supported her confirmation, and she lost two Republicans (Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski). That spells trouble for the idea Trump embraced during the presidential campaign: using federal education funds as a carrot and stick to get states to embrace and expand school choice options, which in the Trump-DeVos universe means giving parents public money to choose private (including religious) schools as well as independently operated public charter schools. Enacting that proposal would involve an amendment to the Every Student Succeeds Act (the successor to No Child Left Behind) that would normally require 60 Senate votes, including eight Democrats. Its hard to see where those votes would come from. It is possible a radical education proposal like this could be nestled into one of the two budget reconciliation bills Congress is expected to consider this year, assuming Republicans can get their act together on various related political and policy decisions. But the first of those bills is supposed to repeal Obamacare, and the second is reserved for tax cuts, and after the furor over DeVos it is doubtful the administration or its congressional allies will want to risk either of those mega-priorities by engaging the political buzzsaw that endangered the DeVos nomination."}, {"date": "2017/02/07", "title": "Trumps Labor Secretary Nominee Says He Hired Undocumented Housekeeper", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trumps-labor-nominee-says-he-hired-undocumented-maid.html", "text": " Andy Puzder, President Donald Trumps embattled nominee for Labor secretary, is entangled in another controversy.

Puzder said in a statement that he was unaware that she was not legally permitted to work in the U.S. When I learned of her status, we immediately ended her employment and offered her assistance in getting legal status. Puzder added he paid federal and state back taxes; the housekeeper reportedly declined the offer for immigration assistance. This is just the latest setback for Puzder, whose confirmation  pushed back four times  has now been postponed indefinitely. The head of the restaurant group that includes Carl Jr. and Hardees still has not filed the required paperwork to the Senate, including financial disclosure forms. Puzders nomination has also come under intense scrutiny for his opposition to increasing the minimum wage and other labor laws to protect low-wage hourly workers. Workers at his chain restaurants have also alleged wage theft, and the company has had to pay out millions after lawsuits. Critics have pointed to his sexist ads and domestic-violence allegations as disqualifying factors. And while opposition is mounting to Puzder  along with many of Trumps not-yet-confirmed nominees  this probably isnt Nannygate, especially because similar issues have plagued two other Trump picks: Commerce secretary nominee Wilbur Ross and South Carolina representative Mick Mulvaney, selected to head the Office of Management and Budget. Ross fired an undocumented housekeeper right before his hearings after re-checking paperwork before going before the Senate. Mulvaney allegedly just paid more than $15,000 in back taxes for a nanny employed years ago, saying he learned about his accounting hiccup while going over paperwork for his potential appointment. The delays in Puzders hearings led to some speculation that the businessman may be trying to get out of becoming Labor secretary.

Both avenues for legislation depended on relatively high levels of unity among Republicans. The latter would require in addition defections by eight Democrats. Its early days yet, but the blitz is not looking formidable at present. The budget-reconciliation bill that was supposed to repeal Obamacare (along with a few other tasty treats for the GOP conservative base, like defunding Planned Parenthood) is already past due, without any sign of resolution of the massive problems associated with trying to get rid of and replace the Affordable Care Act. Even if Republicans come up with a consensus scheme, its now no longer certain they can stop congressional defections of conservatives who are impatient with the pace of change on health-care policy, or those GOPers who are worried about disruptions of existing insurance. To the extent Obamacare repeal-and-replacement cannot be accomplished within that one budget reconciliation bill (and almost nobody believes it can), then Republicans are miles away from 60 Senate votes. And the Democratic senators they would need to get across the finish line will all come to the table with demands that are sure to infuriate the right and perhaps mess up the closely interrelated features of a new plan that are necessary to make it work. One central miscalculation that is complicating plans for Obamacare replacement and other controversial Republican efforts is the assumption that red-state Democratic senators would just roll over and begin voting with the GOP. It is beginning to become apparent that they are in fact looking for unpopular Republican initiatives to oppose, for the abundantly smart reason that voters need a reason to prefer them over their 2018 Republican opponents. This dynamic is obvious with the two most vulnerable Senate Democrats, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota (a state Trump carried 63-27) and Joe Manchin of West Virginia (Trump carried his state 69-26). Both senators were conspicuously considered by Trump for cabinet gigs; both have made billing and cooing noises at the new administration and talked about the need for bipartisanship. Both, however, went out of their way to announce opposition for any GOP move to privatize or otherwise reduce funding for Medicare, an objective beloved by conservatives nearly as much as the Obamacare repeal. And in the most controversial Trump cabinet confirmation fight, involving Education secretarydesignate Betsy DeVos, all Senate Democrats are holding fast in opposition, for the simple reason that teachers are more important to their reelection prospects than any gold stars for helping out Trump. This surprising solidarity may extend to other GOP priorities where Democratic votes are essential, and where Republican proposals are unpopular, especially among Trump voters. One example right on the horizon is the repeal of Dodd-Frank, a great white whale for the Wall Street types who have come pouring into the Trump administration  but not necessarily congenial to white, working-class voters in West Virginia or North Dakota. As a report from Bloomberg explains: That is the problem with many GOP initiatives. And it reflects the more general problem that big parts of the congressional Republican agenda are terribly unpopular, and not part of some 2016 electoral mandate. Legitimate congressional fears that President Trump could undermine them at the drop of a tweet add to the general atmosphere of fear and confusion. And the absence of Democratic support means less bipartisan cover for dangerous positions. So it is beginning to look like Republicans need a reboot for their 2017 legislative strategy. Ultimately they  and their president  will have to decide whether to trim their sails or go bravely into the high winds of public opinion to do what they really want to do. If they choose the latter direction, they may find their crew diminishing in size and enthusiasm."}, {"date": "2017/02/07", "title": "Theresa May Jokes About President Trumps Large Hand", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/theresa-may-jokes-about-president-trumps-large-hand.html", "text": " On Monday, the speaker of the House of Commons said that President Trump should not be allowed to address the British parliament.

In early January, several Senate Republicans indicated opposition to repealing Obamacare without a replacement  enough defections to kill repeal, given that the party can only lose two Senate votes. The plan to quickly repeal, and then figure out a replacement, appears to have been halted, and the party has yet to decide what will take its place. A week after the inauguration, a secret recording of a Republican Congressional brainstorming session revealed the party had not advanced beyond step one in conceptualizing a plan, let alone achieving consensus on any of the numerous dilemmas they would need to resolve. Were in the information-gathering mode right now, says Representative Mark Meadows. At the current trajectory, sometime next week, a Republican staffer will Google What is health care? In an interview Sunday with Bill OReilly, President Trump conceded that health care was very complicated, and floated a timetable for devising a replacement that could extend into next year: While Trump is known to be an unreliable narrator of his own administrations policy, the climbdown from his characteristic boasting of rapid victory is nonetheless striking. He seems to have absorbed from his advisers the difficulty of the situation and the need to reel back expectations. As the Republicans continue their long retreat, they are encountering every false premise that brought them to this point. The most important of these is a misconception about Obamacares popularity. For most of the time since 2010, polls have showed negative approval for the law, the single fact that conservatives have leaned on most heavily since 2010. Of the countless polemics against the Affordable Care Act that have appeared since 2010, the laws mediocre approval ratings are the data points conservatives invoke more than any other. It is the foundation for their belief the law is corrupt and was passed illegitimately, that the public shares the GOPs root-and-branch rejection of its very design, and that Republicans have a mandate to repeal it. Supporters of the law have had a different explanation for its poor approval ratings. People have very little information about what the law does, and even many people who benefit from it are not aware. The long, tortured negotiations required to pass the law did not prove the process was corrupt or failed, but that health-care reform is intrinsically difficult. People will fight much harder to avoid losing a benefit they have  even if that benefit is not actually at risk  than to create a new one they dont. Proponents of health-care reform always believed that bringing health care into reality would make it much easier to defend. That has turned out to be correct. The laws growing popularity can be seen across several dimensions. Repealing Obamacare first, without a replacement, is wildly unpopular, drawing 20 percent approval or less. Repealing the law and starting over with a new one  the Republican position since 2010  draws support from one-third of the public, while keeping Obamacare and fixing it gets nearly twice as much support. On the straightforward question of whether Barack Obamas health-care reform was a good idea or a bad one, for the first time ever, good idea now wins: And Americans by a significant margin believe it is the governments responsibility to make sure everybody has coverage: The chart above is especially telling. Notice that a huge majority agreed that the government should cover everybody before and after Obamas presidency, but that support collapsed during the time of an administration attempting to implement this goal. Political scientists have long recognized that public opinion has a thermostatic element, demanding more government services during Republican presidencies, and less during Democratic ones. It is striking how fast public opinion has swung  this is even before Republicans have begun to publicly debate an alternative plan, which would contain all sorts of unpopular specific elements that would drive down its support even farther. Republicans suffer from an additional handicap that Democrats did not face in 2010: they are not merely over-promising what they can deliver, they are promising the exact opposite. While GOP rhetoric has lambasted the cost of plans offered by Obamacare, their alternatives would all impose even higher costs. An extended public debate over actual, filled-out Republican plans that force people onto catastrophic plans that do not cover basic medical expenses would be a political debacle. It is not only majority opinion that is swinging against Republicans on health care. Lobbyists, too, tend to organize against change. Hospitals are demanding that Republicans either keep covering the Americans who have insurance through Obamacare, or else compensate the hospitals for the losses they would suffer from facing millions of customers who can longer pay for their care. AARP has staked out opposition to one of the GOPs favorite proposals to tweak Obamacare, which would allow insurers to charge even higher rates to older customers. Obamacare only permits insurers to charge older customers up to three times as much as the young. Republicans have railed against the burden this places on younger workers buying insurance  and its true that Obamacare makes the young pay more so the old can pay less. But now Republicans are learning the difference between posturing against a law, and cherry-picking its downsides, and actually having to endorse an alternative position. When you have to pick winners and losers, not just complain about the losers in the other partys law, you make people mad. The energy among political activists has reversed, too. In 2009, tea-party activists flooded town halls and harried Democrats, often frantic with terror at imaginary death panels they believed the law would contain. Now it is advocates of Obamacare mobilizing in anger and chasing terrified Republican members of Congress down the street. Conservatives spent years lionizing demonstrations against Obamacare as the justifiable anger of a free people. Now they can see what health-care reform looks like from the opposing end. There is no guarantee that Obamacare will survive. The Republican majority may decide melting down the health-care markets is worth the backlash. It wouldnt be the first time they have taken a political gamble that seemed irrational. Its possible that the Trump administration might intend to preserve Obamacare but wind up killing it through sheer managerial incompetence; a White House that can screw up something like an introductory phone call with the prime minister of Australia could screw up anything. Still, the pattern of the three months since the election shows the cause of Obamacare repeal collapsing. Obama and his party were able to design a plan that squared the minimal humanitarian needs of the public with the demands of the medical industry. There is no evidence at all that Trump and his party can do the same. It is dawning on the Republicans that the cost of destroying this achievement in social policy may well be to destroy their majority."}, {"date": "2017/02/07", "title": "Ranking the Trump-Administration Appointees, From Bad to Monstrous", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/ranking-the-trump-appointees-from-bad-to-monstrous.html", "text": " As the Senate moves to vote on the confirmation of Betsy DeVos, Donald Trumps nominee to head the Department of Education, our politics writers sat down to discuss whether she is the least qualified of all his nominees and appointees, and if others of that cohort present larger threats to the country. Below, our writers picks for worst, second worst, and third worst (and, in one case, a grudging top-three least-bad list). 1. Michael Flynn, National Security Adviser: Narrowing the Trump cabinet down to the worst of the worst of the worst is a triage operation that requires one to strip away normal policy considerations and focus on the single priority, Are we all going to die because of this guy? The figure who scores highest on this metric is surely National Security Adviser Michael Flynn  fake-news aficionado, rabid conspiracy theorist, Russophile, avowed hater of any information that questions his prior beliefs, and fan of trans-national far-right white nationalists. 2. Steve Bannon, Chief Strategist and Senior Counselor: Self-explanatory. Crazed Breitbartian ethno-nationalist who is reportedly dominating the National Security Council and has previously expressed a Leninist desire to bring the entire system down  a distinctly worrying strategic orientation for the chief strategist of the president of the United States. 3. Scott Pruitt, EPA Administrator: Climate-science-questioning chairman of the Environmental Protection Agency, whose modal approach to public office is to sign his name to documents written on his behalf by the fossil-fuel industry. Much less likely than other members of Trumps team to destroy all human life within four years, but much more likely to do so within a few centuries. Honorable mention: Rex Tillerson, Secretary of State: Theres an 80 percent chance Tillerson is fine, or possibly even good, at his job. Twenty percent chance he is working for Vladimir Putin. On a prorated basis, Tillerson is adequate, but with high variation. 1. Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, Attorney General: The Justice Department and its prosecutors have, for good or ill, vast discretion in enforcing federal laws. There is every indication that as attorney general Sessions would turn the priorities of his department upside-down, prosecuting imaginary voter fraud instead of real voter suppression, hounding immigrants and other powerless people instead of protecting them, and in general operating as the leading edge of a Trump Revolution in law and policy. The idea that Sessions, often called the intellectual godfather of Trumpism, and for a long time the only member of Congress who supported Trumps candidacy, would be independent of the 45th president is laughable. The bigger question may be whether Trump will be independent of Sessions. 2. Scott Pruitt, EPA Administrator: In Scott Pruitt, the EPA would have an administrator whose familiarity with the agency is mostly derived from attacking its regulatory efforts in court. Hes also (at best) a borderline climate-science denier with close ties to the fossil-fuel industries whose interests are fundamentally at odds with the national and global interest in, well, survival. I would elevate him on the worst list mainly because of the irreplaceable role of the EPA in protecting the environment. 3. Betsy DeVos, Secretary of Education: Another fox in the hen house. She ranks third only because the federal role in education is too limited to enable her to fulfill her career-long goal of replacing government schools (as her husband and closest associate likes to call them) with publicly funded private and, especially, religious education. Theres only so much damage she can do. 1. Ben Carson, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development: Granted, Ben Carsons oversight of Housing and Urban Development is unlikely to produce nuclear war or ecological collapse. He is not the worst cabinet nominee from a consequentialist perspective. But he is the worst in the sense of being the most wholly unjustifiable. One week before Trump nominated Carson, Carsons personal assistant announced that the retired neurosurgeon was not interested in any cabinet post  because he feared that his lack of qualifications for such an appointment could cripple the presidency. This was not an expression of irrational insecurity. Carson has no experience in managing a government bureaucracy, let alone in the field of urban development. Nor is there reason to think his genius for surgery is transferable to other realms. This is a man who believes that there is a broad scientific consensus that aliens built the pyramids  but that this consensus is wrong, because the biblical Joseph built the pyramids with help from God. (He also believes that they built said pyramids not as tombs, but as vessels for storing grain. He also believes that multivitamins can cure cancer, and efforts to track patterns of racial discrimination in housing are akin to communism.) Jeff Sessions is a heinous choice for attorney general. Still, his nomination is defensible, if you stipulate certain ideological premises. But regardless of ones views of federal housing policy, there is no good argument for why Ben Carson should oversee it. 2. Tom Price, Secretary of Health and Human Services: He is the anti-Carson: A pick whose badness stems from his competence. As a former physician  and author of many of the House GOPs health-care proposals  Price is wholly qualified for the position of secretary of Health and Human Services. He is deeply committed to increasing the number of Americans who die from curable illness. Price is a leading proponent of cutting Medicare and Medicaid, and making health insurance more expensive for people with preexisting conditions. He is an ideologue who is highly capable of arguing for  and implementing  his right-wing agenda. Plus, hes corrupt: The congressman bought discounted stock in an Australian medical device company, then pushed legislation that would increase the value of his shares. 3. Andy Puzder, Secretary of Labor: Andy Puzders nomination to the Labor department is an audacious betrayal of the forgotten working men and women whom Trump promised to fight for. In his professional life, Puzder is a fast-food CEO, whose restaurants have been serial violators of the Fair Labor Standards Act. In his public life, hes been an avowed opponent of minimum-wage increases and a champion of replacing workers with robots. The decline of organized labor in the Midwest was an underappreciated cause of Trumps victory, and Puzder is all but certain to use his new post to further weaken the labor movement. His appointment is a threat to workers in the immediate term, and to the prospects of progressive governance in the long. 1. Nikki Haley, Ambassador to the U.N.: I dont like this game because I realized that it was not possible for me to pick the worst. Trumps cabinet picks are each chilling in unique ways; to pick the worst feels like suggesting that the destruction of the planet is somehow worse than the rollback of our human rights or that either of those is worse than the eradication of our public-education system. All I could manage was a shortened list of least-bad cabinet picks. The least bad, as far as I could determine, was Nikki Haley, chosen by Trump to be ambassador to the U.N.. She qualified as least bad because as governor, she took the Confederate flag down in South Carolina, which was a small and overdue act, but nonetheless courageous for a southern Republican. Also, while the job of U.N. ambassador is important, it can cause  and again, Im speaking comparatively here  the least amount of damage to the republic or the Earth. Of course, when she gave her first speech, she talked about taking names of those who dont have our backs, a speech that gravely mitigated her least bad status in my head. 2. James Mattis, Secretary of Defense: The second least bad, I guess, is James Mattis for Defense, because he doesnt believe in torture. Which is a piteously low bar. And the fact that Mattis clears it is meaningless anyway since Trump is obviously not consulting him on anything, including the Muslim ban. 3. Rex Tillerson, Secretary of State: There is not a third-least-bad cabinet pick. I mean, I heard that Rex Tillerson might not hate gay people. Congratulations to Rex; he must be a real mensch. Too bad he has no foreign-policy experience and is a lifelong oil-industry baron with extensive business interests in Russia. *This article appears in the February 6, 2017, issue of New York Magazine. *This article has been updated throughout."}, {"date": "2017/02/07", "title": "Secret Target of Yemen Raid Is Still Alive, Taunts Trump", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/secret-target-of-yemen-raid-is-still-alive-taunts-trump.html", "text": " Last weeks Navy SEAL raid where almost everything went wrong had a more ambitious goal than previously reported.

The fool of the White House got slapped at the beginning of his road in your lands, al-Rimi says in a recording released Sunday. Military sources told NBC they believe its authentic. Al-Rimi also claims there were 25 victims of the attack, and scores of U.S. soldiers were killed or wounded. Chief Petty Officer William Ryan Owens, a Navy SEAL, was killed in the attack, and three other U.S. military personnel were injured. Nawar Al-Awlaki, the 8-year-old daughter of American Al Qaeda leader Anwar Al-Awlaki, was killed in the raid as well, but the exact number of civilian casualties has not been confirmed. The report also sheds some light on how the decision was made to proceed with the raid. The Obama administration planned the operation, but left the final decision to Trump. NBC News reports: Last week three anonymous U.S. military officials told Reuters that they felt Trump approved the mission despite insufficient planning and support. The New York Times reported that the decision was made over a dinner with advisers Jared Kushner and Steve Bannon, Defense Secretary James Mattis, Vice-President Mike Pence, National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, and Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

President Trumps main justification for his executive order barring refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries is the need to take swift and extreme action to protect the United States from terrorism. On Monday, after several courts blocked the order and journalists pointed out that it doesnt make sense to focus on those groups, Trump tried to preemptively shift the blame for any future terror attack from his policies to the courts and the media. Then, while speaking to U.S. Central Command, the president suggested that the media is covering up terrorist attacks for some unspecified reason (not unlike President Obama). Youve seen what happened in Paris, and Nice. All over Europe, its happening, Trump said. Its gotten to a point where its not even being reported. And in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesnt want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that. The remark was reminiscent of Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conways widely mocked complaint that the media didnt cover the Bowling Green massacre  which is true, as theres no such thing. Conway claimed she meant to say Bowling Green terrorists, referring to two Iraqi men caught trying to aid terror groups back home while they were living in Kentucky. However, Cosmopolitan revealed on Monday that shed used the term Bowling Green massacre before. While the Conway controversy might have been fresh in his mind, Trumps accusation has deeper roots. For months, the conspiracy-theory website InfoWars has been reporting that the mainstream press is downplaying reports of terror attacks. (A sample headline from July: SCANDAL: MASS MEDIA COVERS UP TERRORISM TO PROTECT ISLAM.) And as the Washington Post reports, the general concept predates InfoWars: The press might have stayed focused on why President Trumps suggestion of a widespread media coverup is so dangerous were it not for Sean Spicer working the refs, as the Posts Philip Bump put it. The White House press secretary said Trumps vague suggestion that the media doesnt want to report on terror attacks was actually a reference to several instances in which the media didnt devote enough attention to terrorism. He felt members of the media dont always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered, Spicer said. Protests will get blown out of the water, and yet an attack or a foiled attack doesnt necessarily get the same coverage. Spicer promised to provide specific examples, and hours later the White House put out a list of 78 terror attacks that they claim didnt receive adequate media attention. It included several attacks that drew weeks of extensive coverage, like the killing of 14 people in San Bernardino, California, in 2015, the Orlando nightclub shooting that claimed 49 lives last summer, and even the 2015 massacre in Paris that left 129 people dead. Also listed are several incidents that had no casualties, and thus received far less coverage. The list appeared to be put together hastily, and it was far from comprehensive. There were strange omissions, like no mention of terror attacks in Israel or those carried out by white extremists. And the document includes spelling errors; Denmakr instead of Denmark and the repeated misspelling of attacker as attaker: White House spokesperson Lindsay Walters pivoted even further from Trumps claim that the very, very dishonest press  have their reasons for downplaying terrorism. Rather than suggesting some nefarious motive, she said there were simply too many terror attacks for the press to adequately cover them all. The real point here is that these terrorists attacks are so pervasive at this point that they do not spark the wall-to-wall coverage they once did, she said. If you look back just a few years ago, any one of these attacks would have been ubiquitous in every news outlet, and now theyre happening so often  at a rate of more than once every two weeks, according to the list  that networks are not devoting to each of them the same level of coverage they once did. Now, rather than focusing solely on the presidents remarks, the media had a bizarre list to pick apart. Some outlets noted that there are valid criticisms to be made about how the media covers terrorism  though Trump didnt make them. Other journalists tried to disprove the assertion by recalling their coverage of incidents mentioned in the list. Most outlets were trying to illustrate that the so-called evidence released by the White House does not back up Trumps attack on the press. However, their discussion might have bolstered his larger point that Americans should be very alarmed about terrorism, even if theres no new incident currently dominating media coverage. Its hard not to be more worried about threats to national security when headlines remind you of the dozens of attacks committed by Islamic extremists, and terrorism is all anyone is talking about."}, {"date": "2017/02/07", "title": "Trump Reportedly Upset That Sean Spicer Was Spoofed by a Woman on SNL", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-upset-that-a-woman-played-sean-spicer-on-snl-report.html", "text": " Aside from the reports that President Trump continues to watch far too much cable news, the biggest takeaway from the near-daily leaks from the White House is that Sean Spicers job is absolutely terrible. From the start, there were rumors that Trump wanted a woman to serve as White House press secretary, but was forced to settle for the former Republican National Committee communications director. To make matters worse, Spicer has taken on two jobs, acting as communications director in addition to press secretary. Then, during his first full day on the job, Spicer was transformed into a meme when he fumed at the press for misreporting the size of Trumps inauguration crowd. Trump reportedly demanded that Spicer do the press conference, then complained about Spicers demeanor and ill-fitting suit. Over the weekend, the New York Times reported that the president makes time to watch Spicers daily press briefings then summons Spicer to critique his performance. Now Spicer is said to be in trouble for being hilariously spoofed by Melissa McCarthy on Saturday Night Live  and not because he was portrayed as an unhinged, furious purveyor of alternative facts. Politico reports, More than being lampooned as a press secretary who makes up facts, it was Spicers portrayal by a woman that was most problematic in the presidents eyes, according to sources close to him. A top Trump donor added, Trump doesnt like his people to look weak. On Monday Spicer said hes fine with the skit, though he told Politico hed much rather have the focus be on the presidents agenda and the success hes having. While the president habitually attacks SNL on Twitter, he had nothing to say this weekend. That was reportedly seen internally as a sign of how uncomfortable it made the White House feel. If true, the report adds another bizarre layer to how the president views gender roles. While he may have wanted a woman to fill Spicers role, multiple reports suggest that hes particularly irked by women who stand up to him, or generally behave in a manner he disapproves of. On Sunday the New York Times noted that while McCarthys comedic talent is what makes the skit so funny, seeing the presidents spokesman skewered by a woman gave it an extra edge: In light of Politicos report, people are clamoring for classic Trump nemesis Rosie ODonnell to replace the Grim Reaper as SNLs Steve Bannon. ODonnell said shes game: SNL gave us Larry David as Bernie Sanders, and Alec Baldwin is hosting the show next weekend.

The first and worst, as my colleague Eric Levitz explains, is that such inflammatory charges endanger the independence of the judiciary, and with it the rule of law. But on a political level, there is something else sinister about this sort of talk coming from the president of the United States: He is preemptively clearing himself and his administration of any responsibility for future terrorist acts its policies might fail to prevent  or even invite. As Jeet Heer notes: That much is very clear. Perhaps the larger challenge is how Trump opponents can safeguard themselves and the country from this sort of irresponsible blame-shifting, which could not only misrepresent the causes for terrorist acts, but justify steps by Trump that endanger our security even more and vitiate civil liberties even further. Heer argues Democrats should respond with their own anticipatory arguments: Sure, Trumps defenders may argue that is not fair to him. But they cannot have it both ways, blaming the 44th president for terrorist acts he had nothing to do with (as Trump did) while insulating the 45th from responsibility. The harder thing for Democrats may be resisting the temptation to rally around the president if his administration does succeed in provoking or failing to prevent or intercept future attacks. Whether or not you think George W. Bush bore any responsibility for 9/11, there is no question he exploited the atmosphere of post-attack solidarity to launch an unnecessary preemptive war against Iraq, and then argue mendaciously that it had made Americans safer. Does anyone doubt Donald Trump is capable of similar deceptions?"}, {"date": "2017/02/06", "title": "Trump Is Turning Americas Closest Allies Against Us", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-is-turning-americas-closet-allies-against-us.html", "text": " The Republican Partys critique of Obama-era foreign policy boiled down to 11 words: Our allies dont trust us and our enemies dont fear us. Dick Cheney, Paul Ryan, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Marco Rubio, and virtually every other Republican on Capitol Hill, cable news, or their second drink at the country club recited that phrase verbatim at some point in Obamas eight years. Even Donald Trump  when he wasnt decrying Americas allies as ungrateful freeloaders  found time to chastise Obama for alienating our best geopolitical buddies. To our friends and allies, the GOP nominee said in April, America is going to be reliable again. It was never clear how, precisely, Obama had lost our allies trust (unless one defines Americas allies as members of the Likud government). Nonetheless, if there was one thing every Republican could agree on, it was that the measure of a presidents foreign policy was the free worlds faith in American leadership. Two weeks into the Trump presidency, the British parliament has barred Americas commander-in-chief from addressing the House of Commons; a leading German newspaper has called on all freedom-loving peoples in Europe and Asia to mobilize against the United States; a senior cabinet minister in the Australian government has coined the phrase normal Trump tantrum; Israeli intelligence agents are (reportedly) unsure if they can safely share information with the White House; the Mexican president cant meet with the U.S. president without inviting a political backlash; members of the global economic elite have started referring to China as the leader of the free world; and Canada wont stop putting its southern neighbor to shame. Those first two developments are new, and, thus, worth unpacking. British prime minister Theresa May recently invited Trump to the U.K. for a state visit. One million Britons promptly signed a petition telling Trump to sod off. Eventually, the speaker of the House of Commons  former Conservative Party MP John Bercow  was asked to weigh in on the matter. If a state visit takes place, that is way beyond and above the pay grade of the Speaker, Bercow said. However, as far as this place is concerned I feel very strongly that our opposition to racism and to sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary are hugely important considerations in the House of Commons. It isnt clear that Trump had any intention of addressing the House of Commons, but, regardless, Bercows rebuke reflects a profound decay in the British publics enthusiasm for thespecial relationship. One day earlier, Der Spiegel implored Germany to mobilize the free world against the United States: That Europe should unite with Asia against Trumps America isnt merely the idle fantasy of a German columnist. Weve always said that America is our best friend, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup, told the New York Times last month. If thats no longer the case, if thats what we need to understand from Donald Trump, then of course Europe will look for new friends  China is a very strong candidate for that. The Chinese involvement in Europe in terms of investment is already very high and expanding. If you push away your friends, you mustnt be surprised if the friends start looking for new friends. To be fair to Trump, it would be difficult to say that Americas enemies dont fear us, now that an emotionally volatile demagogue has his hands on the nuclear codes  its just that everybody else does, too. I have no friends, as far as Im concerned, Donald Trump told supporters in New Hampshire last February. One month later, the New York Times ran a feature that suggested this claim was mostly true. Hes the kind of guy who likes throwing hand grenades in the room, real-estate tycoon Richard LeFrak told the paper, in explanation of his fellow moguls lack of close ties.

From centrist Democrats like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer who initially made conciliatory noises about cooperation with Trump on items such as infrastructure investments to populists like Bernie Sanders who have long argued for a class-based economic message for Democrats, a common front is emerging based on the simple strategy of total resistance to the 45th president. That is most evident in the Senate, where Democrats  who cannot actually filibuster Cabinet confirmations because of their own nuclear option vote in 2013  have decided to make the seemingly inevitable confirmation of Education Secretary nominee Betsy DeVos as grueling, lengthy, and humiliating as possible. While they dont have the votes to stop any Trump picks, they have decided to comply with activist demands that they conduct mini-filibusters by using up the 30 hours of debate allowed under current rules, starting with DeVos: These dilatory tactics could expose new evidence damaging to the administration about this or that nominee  or perhaps not so much, since Republicans are responding by scheduling around-the-clock sessions to run out the 30 hours while most Americans sleep. The Democratic protest will take the form of an all-night Senate-floor gab-a-thon that will probably get some attention on the morning shows. But the most important element of the Democratic action is that it represents a collective decision not to let a business-as-usual atmosphere take over Washington. The overwhelming left-of-center response to the Trump/Bannon immigration order  and the administrations attack on the federal judiciary that stood in its way guaranteed that change of mood, as Politico reports. It is entirely possible, of course, that this counter-polarization by Democrats is actually what Trump and Bannon intended to generate by behaving so provocatively. Pushing otherwise reluctant Republicans into a posture of anti-anti-Trumpism is certainly one by-product of depicting everyone to the left of the political center as allies of anarchists in Berkeley and activist judges in Seattle and Muslim-loving civil liberties lawyers in airports everywhere.

The financial industry invested almost exclusively in Hillary Clintons campaign, while markets recoiled at every improvement in her opponents prospects. And then Trump won. And he delivered a victory speech that was free of calls for dissolving the judiciary  and full of reassuring pablum about national unity. And the markets, in their infinite rationality, realized that Trump never really wanted to roll back global trade and the liberal international order. Surely, the president is sincere about the parts of his platform that I like, but insincere about all the ones I do not, the utility maximizers coldly reasoned. Soon, the Dow hit 20,000. To be fair, Trump did reward Wall Streets optimism. The president appeared to pick half his cabinet from the guest list at Lloyd Blankfeins birthday party, while promising to cut the taxes of his fellow diners at Manhattans 21 Club. Meanwhile, his transition team advertised a supply-side agenda, with a side of infrastructure stimulus. Further, whatever interest Trump may have had in challenging entrenched corporate interests seemed to dissipate the second said interests kissed his ring: The president went into a meeting with pharmaceutical lobbyists vowing to negotiate down the cost of drugs  and left vowing to keep big government from stifling innovation with price controls. But while Trump seems less than sincere in his economic populism, he appears to be quite genuine in his nativism. His first weeks in office have featured radical immigration restrictions enacted via executive order, vows to repatriate global supply chains, and noises about defunding the United Nations. Now, Goldman Sachs is starting to remember why it was once with her. Following the election, the positive shift in sentiment among investors, business, and consumers suggested that the probability of tax cuts and easier regulation was seen to be higher than the probability of meaningful restrictions to trade and immigration, a group of Goldman Sachs economists, led by Alec Phillips, wrote in a note late last week. One month into the year, the balance of risks is somewhat less positive in our view. Phillips cites three reasons for his banks fading enthusiasm for Trumpism. First, the GOPs struggle to chart a course for Obamacare repeal does not bode well for reaching a quick agreement on tax reform or infrastructure funding. Second, the bank remembered that Senate Democrats exist. While bipartisan cooperation looked possible on some issues following the election, the political environment appears to be as polarized as ever, suggesting that many issues that require bipartisan support are likely to face substantial obstacles, Phillips wrote. While we have not expected a sweeping overhaul of regulation in any of these areas to become law, recent developments lower the probability somewhat that even incremental changes could pass in the Senate. Finally, there are the recent developments, themselves, which serve as a reminder that the president is likely to follow through on campaign promises on trade and immigration, some of which could be disruptive for financial markets and the real economy. For now, Wall Street remains nervously optimistic. Trumps presidency still offers an excellent chance of corporate tax cuts, and all-but-certain savings on regulatory compliance. But the fact that it also offers Steve Bannon a seat on the National Security Council is causing a little heartburn in Americas C-suites."}, {"date": "2017/02/06", "title": "Some Boston Globe Subscribers Woke Up in a World Where the Patriots Lost", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/some-boston-globe-subscribers-woke-up-in-nightmare-world.html", "text": " The Boston Globe may have sent their early edition to the printer around the same time Patriots fans gave up and went to bed, with New England down 28 to 3.

That is because he is uniquely qualified to understand what the American people want. Why? Well, presumably because he won the presidency despite fake polls suggesting he would lose. It appears Trump is going to keep repeating this chain of convoluted logic until people who look favorably upon him accept it implicitly: He won a big, landslide victory that was disguised by media lies and many millions of fraudulent votes against him; thus he has a mandate to do exactly what he is doing; and what hes doing is popular, notwithstanding the lies about it from the same lying pollsters and media. Once you accept the landslide premise, it all follows naturally, since Trumps popular-vote defeat and incredibly narrow path to an electoral vote majority are wished away, and with them the reasonably good record of national polls, which were more accurate in 2016 than in 2012. Thus, the foundational untruth about the actual results of the 2016 election paves the way to the authoritarian (in the most literal sense of the term) premise that only Trump or Trump-approved sources of information can ever, ever be trusted. And actually, that may understate the claim, since the president constantly asserts that media are deliberately, consciously lying about him. And so: Once you accept his overarching lie, everything that contradicts it must be a malicious untruth. The logic is inexorable. It is not especially novel for a politician to try to convince her or his supporters to ignore uncongenial information. But typically the maneuver is executed by the recitation of more congenial information, or by changing the subject, not just by arguing that in all things Daddy knows best. This tack constitutes the death of all rational political discourse across partisan boundaries: Youre either with the boss or against him, and if you are against him, you cannot take a breath without lying. Yes, Trump seems to exhibit a vague sense of accountability for mistakes in that he does not always stay on the same course if he is manifestly screwing up. But again: Any type of yardstick for success or failure that depends strictly on an elected officials self-assessment is worth almost nothing. And that is true even if the elected official in question does not suffer from the personality defect of narcissism. Right now it is not entirely paranoid to wonder what would convince him to relinquish his office in 2021 if he is not reelected. He is as likely to have evidence that many millions of illegal votes were cast against him as he had in 2016, and as likely to argue that national media  in league, it is now clear, with activist judges have usurped the power of the American people to choose a president. If Donald Trump is the only legitimate source of information about public opinion, why even bother with elections? Its becoming a real question. After all, when Trump kept hinting he might not accept defeat last November, he did not have the vast powers of the presidency at his disposal. Four years from now, he will."}, {"date": "2017/02/06", "title": "Man Arrested for Murder of Queens Jogger Karina Vetrano", "url": "http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/02/chanel-lewis-arrested-for-murder-of-queens-jogger-karina-vetrano.html", "text": " On August 2, 30-year-old Karina Vetrano was found dead in Spring Creek Park in Queens hours after she had gone out for a run.

Sort of! A handful of Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, broke with the president on Sunday, saying they do not think theres any equivalency between the U.S. and a foreign leader suspected of killing scores of journalists and political opponents. In President Trumps preSuper Bowl interview, he said he respects Putin and hopes Russia can help in the fight against ISIS. But hes a killer, though. Putins a killer, said Bill OReilly. There are a lot of killers, Trump said. Weve got a lot of killers. What do you think? Our countrys so innocent? I dont know of any government leaders that are killers, OReilly responded. Well, take a look at what weve done too. Weve made a lot of mistakes, said Trump, claiming, once again, despite the lack of evidence, that he was always against the war in Iraq. A lot of mistakes, okay, but a lot of people were killed. So a lot of killers around, believe me. Since President Trumps remarks about Putin were released as a preview on Saturday, Republican leaders had to address them on the Sunday shows. On CNNs State of the Union, McConnell rejected Trumps characterization, calling Putin a thug  though when Jake Tapper asked how he would have reacted if President Obama had made the same remarks, the majority leader said he does not intend to critique the presidents every utterance. I dont think theres any equivalency between the way that the Russians conduct themselves and the way the United States does, McConnell said. I do think America is exceptional. America is different, he added. We dont operate in any way the way the Russians do. I think theres a clear distinction here that all Americans understand, and no, I would not have characterized it that way. In an interview with ABC News, Senator Ben Sasse said the U.S. is nothing like the Putin regime: The U.S. affirms freedom of speech; Putin is no friend of freedom of speech. Putin is an enemy of freedom of religion; the U.S. celebrates freedom of religion. Putin is an enemy of the free press; the U.S. celebrates free press. There is no moral equivalency between the United States of America  the greatest freedom-loving nation in the history of the world  and the murderous thugs that are in Putins defense on his cronyism, he added. Several Republicans criticized Trumps remarks on Twitter, including Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Liz Cheney. House Speaker Paul Ryan declined to criticize Trump directly, but his spokeswoman AshLee Strong pointed to the speakers condemnation of Putin at a CNN town hall last month. Speaker Ryan has consistently and frequently spoken out on Russia and Putin and made his opinions well known, including the need for continued sanctions, she told the Washington Post. Unsurprisingly, the Trump administration stood by the comments, and even had Vice-President Mike Pence defend them, arguing that somehow Trump was not suggesting the U.S. is like Putins Russia when he said our countrys so innocent? I simply dont accept that there was any moral equivalency in the presidents comments, Pence said on Face the Nation. Look, President Trump throughout his life, his campaign, and in this administration has never hesitated to be critical of government policies by the United States in the past.

The latest dispatch from the New York Times Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman suggests the Trump administration has far bigger problems on its hands: The piece is chock-full of tidbits that bolster previous reports that aides treat the president like a moody teenager who watches too much TV. Highlights include:  Trump is still struggling to work in his requisite amount of TV time. Hes upgraded the TV in his private dining room so he can watch the news with lunch, and he almost always makes time to watch White House Press Secretary Sean Spicers daily briefing, which can last as long as 50 minutes. Trump summons Spicer to critique his performance, and the two regularly go through news clips, with the president marking unfavorable coverage with a black Sharpie.  Trump heads up to the residence around 6:30 p.m., and When Mr. Trump is not watching television in his bathrobe or on his phone reaching out to old campaign hands and advisers, he will sometimes set off to explore the unfamiliar surroundings of his new home.  Trump finds the backdrop of the Oval Office validating, and is obsessed with the dcor  but he doesnt always get the details right. Though he excitedly poured over a book that offered him 17 options for window furnishings, he incorrectly bragged to a visitor that his office drapes were used by Franklin Roosevelt when they were actually made for Bill Clinton. Lightbulb jokes aside, theres truly alarming news tucked deep in the piece. The Times reports that in response to the chaos of the first few weeks, Trump has directed his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, to implement a more orderly process for executive orders  including having the president looped in much earlier in the process. And the sloppily executed travel restrictions arent whats bothering the president: Many interpreted that to mean that Bannon made himself a regular on the National Security Council Principals Committee and Trump didnt realize it until after hed signed the executive order. But its not clear what Trump is angry about. Thrush retweeted a remark from Times Zeke Miller that suggested Bannon did tell Trump about his new NSC role before the order was signed: Times Bannon cover story notes that the president added his CIA director as a regular attendee of NSC meetings: Its possible Trump was angry about the omission of Pompeo, not Bannons elevated role.

But apparently it wasnt enough to have the specter of the 2016 election hanging over the game; America had to watch the Patriots and the Falcons do a live reenactment of Election Night. The first half of the game looked like a blowout for the Falcons, with Atlanta racking up a 21-3 lead before Lady Gagas subtly subversive halftime show. In the third quarter, Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan threw a second touchdown pass to Tevin Coleman. Along with the extra point, that touchdown brought the score to 28-3. No team has ever trailed by more than ten points and come back to win the Super Bowl. Nate Cohn of the New York Times Upshot noted that New Englands chances of winning were even worse than Donald Trumps. Then New England, and the nations PTSD, came roaring back. In the third quarter, Patriots running back James White scored the teams first touchdown of the game, bringing the score to 28-9. Then, in the fourth quarter, the Patriots racked up 19 points, including two two-point conversions. Suddenly everyone on Twitter started flashing back to the night of November 8. Julian Edelman set up the touchdown that would tie the game with one of the greatest catches in Super Bowl history. Falcons cornerback Robert Alford deflected a pass meant for Edelman, but he caught it just inches above the ground. With the game tied 28-28, the Super Bowl went into overtime for the first time ever. The Patriots won the coin toss, then quarterback Tom Brady led a 75-yard touchdown drive. Running back James White clinched New Englands victory with a 2-yard run for a final score of 34-28. At five titles each, Tom Brady now has the most Super Bowl wins of any quarterback, and coach Bill Belichick has the most of any head coach.

As a result of that order, federal agencies have suspended their enforcement of the travel ban, and anyone with a valid U.S. visa is once again able to enter the U.S.  at least for now. Vice-President Mike Pence vowed on Sunday that the White House will use all legal means at our disposal to reinstate the entry ban on refugees and the citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries. President Trump has repeatedly attacked the rulings against the ban, but has also maintained that his administration will emerge victorious. Earlier Sunday, however, Justice Department lawyers failed to obtain an emergency stay against Robarts order in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, pending the appeal theyll finish filing by Monday. Regardless of how the appeals court decides to rule, it seems likely that the case will make it all the way to the Supreme Court, possibly within the week. Below is a look at the recent history and likely future of the legal battle. Whats the story with the order that the Trump administration is appealing?On Friday, U.S. District Judge James L. Robart granted a temporary nationwide restraining order against the travel ban, siding with the attorneys general of Washington State and Minnesota, who had sued to overturn parts of Trumps executive order instituting the ban. Robart did not offer an opinion on the constitutionality of the ban, but nonetheless decided 1) that he thought the plaintiffs were likely to win based on their constitutional claims, 2) that blocking the ban was in the public interest, and 3) that allowing the ban to remain in place while the case was underway would cause Washington and Minnesota irreparable harm. More specifically, Robart ruled that Trumps executive order adversely affects the States residents in areas of employment, education, business, family relations and freedom to travel, and causes significant and ongoing harm to the two states tax bases and public universities. Robarts nationwide ruling is broader than any of the rulings that other judges have made against the travel ban. Thats unusual since district-court judges rarely issue nationwide orders, though such rulings are still within their legal power. In this case, Robart said he was concerned that partial implementation would undermine the constitutional imperative of a uniform Rule of Naturalization, and Congresss instruction that the immigration laws of the United States should be enforced vigorously and uniformly. Some of the language in Robarts ruling echoed a Texas-based district judges 2015 nationwide injunction against the implementation of President Obamas executive order granting protections to the children of undocumented immigrants. Temporary restraining orders usually remain in place for 14 days unless the judge makes the order permanent by issuing a preliminary injunction at the trial court level, or the restraining order is overturned by a higher court  like at a court of appeals, which is where the Trump administration is currently seeking a stay. Traditionally, the government has to wait for a preliminary injunction before filing an appeal, but in this case, the Justice Department is arguing that, because of the nature of the original hearing and Robarts judgment, the order more resembles a preliminary injunction and should thus be appeal-able. That potential technicality could be a problem for the government, however. What case is the Trump administration making in their appeal?In the appeal that Justice Department lawyers filed on Saturday night, they argued that Robarts order should be overturned because it is improper for a lower court to substitute its judgment for the presidents and thwart an executive order, particularly since the order pertains to a potential national-security threat and courts do not have access to the classified information about terrorist threats that the president does. (For what its worth, Judge Robart seems to have challenged the Justice Department on this point and was clearly not satisfied with the answer.) As the President acted well within both statutory and constitutional authorization, the relief irreparably harms our system of government by contravening the Constitutions separation of powers, the Justice Department claimed. The government also argued that Washington and Minnesota arent actually affected by the order and thus dont have the standing to challenge it, insisting that the states arguments to the contrary are insufficient because they only identified speculative harms they would suffer on account of the ban. Put another way, as law professor and legal analyst Steve Vladek explains to CNN, the government believes that the executive order is directed at non-citizens with no meaningful constitutional rights, and any impact on those with substantial ties to the United States is incidental, and given the special relief the government lawyers are seeking, its not clear [the states have] done enough to show that they are harmed by the district courts order to anywhere near the same degree as immigrants from these seven countries are harmed by the executive order. Judicial second-guessing of the Presidents determination that a temporary suspension of entry of certain classes of aliens was necessary at this time to protect national security would constitute an impermissible intrusion on the political branches plenary constitutional authority over foreign affairs, national security, and immigration, the Justice Department said. In addition, Politico explains that there was another recurring element in the brief: Why didnt the Trump administration win an emergency stay?The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals opted against an emergency stay because it said it wanted to see both sides legal briefs before making a decision (and thats what it then asked for). Put another way, the court didnt actually reject the request, it just wasnt willing to go ahead and immediately stay Robarts ruling before getting a look at both sides briefs. So how long is the appeal process going to take?Not very long, it seems. The Ninth appears to be fast-tracking the schedule, and already asked Washington and Minnesota to file by midnight Pacific time on Sunday, and the government to file their now-second brief by 3 p.m. Monday. Whats next for the appeal?Both sides will have filed their next round of legal briefs by Monday, and its likely the appeals court will issue their ruling as soon as possible after that. If the Ninth District Court of Appeals rules against the government, what are the chances that President Trump or the administration accuses it of liberal bias?Pretty good. The court is currently made up of one Carter appointee (William Canby Jr.), one Obama appointee (Michelle Friedland), and one George W. Bush appointee (Richard Clifton), and as Hot Airs Jazz Shaw points out: In addition, Trump is already attacking a federal judge who was appointed by George W. Bush, as well as the entire U.S. court system, so its unlikely anything will stop him from attacking a court ruling he doesnt like, or the judges who made it. Will the case go all the way to the Supreme Court?Most likely. Legal experts seem to agree that whichever side loses the appeal will almost certainly ask the Supreme Court to review the judgment, and depending on how fast the appeals court rules, the SCOTUS Justices might be weighing in on that within days. Just keep in mind, the Court is currently short handed and ideologically split thanks to the GOPs nomination blockade on Obama, so if the court either opts against reviewing the case, or becomes deadlocked, that means the lower-court ruling would stand. Will Trumps attacks on judges and the judiciary system matter in the minds of other judges? Will the general confusion and unrest surrounding the implementation of the ban have an effect?Maybe. Trump finished the weekend by tweeting that Judge Robart and the U.S. court system should now be blamed in the event of a future terrorist attack inside the U.S., and Trump seemed to question Robarts legitimacy as a judge in another tweet on Saturday. Plus, its not like this weekend was the first time Trump has attacked a judge who has ruled against him. As far as what effect these comments could have, John Banzhaf, a professor at George Washington University Law School who opposes Robarts ruling, told Politico that they absolutely could come back to bite Trump in the legal ass: Former Justice Department spokesperson Matthew Miller, who worked for the Obama administration, put it more bluntly: The chaotic and confusing way the Trump administration rolled out the travel ban could also have an impact on the governments legal credibility, as Lawfares Peter Spiro explained last week: Spiro also believes that the widespread criticism of the Trump administrations stated rationale for the ban could help shift the courts away from their historically cautious approach to anything implicating national security values: What about Judge Robart and the case in the district court in Washington State?Robart ordered the states and the Justice Department to propose a schedule for filing additional legal briefs regarding whether to make the temporary order more binding, but he may delay that until after the appeals court weighs in. It seems that if a higher court doesnt allow the governments request say on technical grounds, Robart would need to make the temporary restraining order a preliminary injunction before the government could try for another stay. What about the other court cases against Trumps executive order?There are a lot of them, at least 19 by the last count of the Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse, and its not yet clear how they will turn out. For a primer on the three basic arguments that most of these cases are using, read NBC News roundup here."}, {"date": "2017/02/06", "title": "The True Purpose of Trumpism", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/the-true-purpose-of-trumpism.html", "text": " The chaos of Donald Trumps opening weeks should not come as a total shock. The first president with no experience in government, surrounded by a chief of staff, a chief strategist, and a son-in-law who also lack any government experience and who seem to be competing ruthlessly with each other for power, is not a formula for quick success. The administrations incompetence manifested itself most visibly in the rapid execution of a cruel, overbearing immigration restriction that provoked protests nationwide and even grumbling from some Republicans in Congress. At another level, though, the travel ban might be seen, from the ideological perspective of the people who crafted it, not necessarily as a failure at all. Despite its ostensibly narrow scope, the operation was extraordinarily ambitious, designed to send a message to the world about who Americans are, who can become American, and, most especially, who cannot. The mayhem, inconvenience, and heartbreak it caused were in fact its very intent. There are three different aspects of the Trump presidency at play. One is simply characterological: The presidents distinct troubled-adolescent behavior pattern, which, via regular bouts of insult-spewing, braggadocio, ignorance, extravagant promises, wild lies, and absolute intolerance of criticism, frequently throws the policymaking process into disarray. The second component, and the largest, is standard Republican policy, developed in Congress and conservative think tanks for decades, which Trump has begun to implement fairly smoothly. The administration has already nominated Neil Gorsuch, an orthodox movement conservative, to the Supreme Court; it has frozen regulations and green-lit pipelines and snapped back government support for foreign organizations that provide abortions. The final and most mysterious element  the one that created the travel ban  is Trumpism. This is the ethno-nationalistic aspect of the presidents governing ideology, which springs both from Trumps own impulses and from ideas nurtured by a handful of his closest aides, including Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller, and several staffers brought over from the alt-right publication Breitbart. Trumpism combines an instinctive belief in zero-sum relations between countries with a narrow and retrograde definition of American identity. And a key aspect of Trumpism is surprise. This is partly due to circumstance: There are no off-the-shelf Trumpist agendas that the White House can immediately translate into policy. But in developing their plans, Bannon and Miller have cultivated a maximum amount of secrecy, reportedly conscripting GOP legislative aides who hid their work from their own bosses and shielding most of Trumps own Cabinet from their plans. The executive order halting admission of refugees and cracking down on immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries was a narrower codification of the total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States that Trump had promised during the campaign. The implementation was a fiasco. Tens of thousands of travelers en route to the U.S. found themselves blocked, detained, or even deported by Customs agents. Families were separated, children and elderly people terrified. Parents of a 4-month-old with a serious heart condition had to cancel their babys planned heart surgery in Oregon. On and on the tragedies mounted. Beyond the humanitarian costs, the toll on business and intellectual life was immediate. A Danish archaeologist was allegedly denied admission to the U.S. because he excavates ancient sites in Iraq. A computer-science-department staffer told one reporter his university had lost 11 Ph.D. candidates to the ban. The confusion spread worldwide and made a statement of its own. A pillar of Trumpism is the refusal to distinguish between peaceful and violent Muslims. Trump has said Islam hates us, and when asked if he distinguishes between radical Islam and the religion as a whole, he brushed off the distinction: Its very hard to separate, because you dont know who is who. Bannon has repeatedly emphasized his belief that Islam as a whole poses an existential threat to Christianity. (Islam is not a religion of peace, Bannon has said. Islam is a religion of submission.) Trump has falsely implicated the entire Muslim-American community in the terrorist attacks of domestic radicals in San Bernardino and Orlando. Trump advisers have depicted the threat of radical Islam as multidimensional and multigenerational  that is, pervasive and intrinsic to all Muslims. From 1975 to 2015, immigrants from the seven excluded countries killed a total of zero Americans in terror attacks on U.S. soil. And yet Trumpists see terrorism as a pervasive, invisible threat that spreads within Muslim communities. Punishing innocent Muslims for the threat posed by terrorists is not a side effect of their policy but an expression of its tenets. The collateral damage to academia and tech firms from the ban may, too, have been part of the point. There is a plausible argument that low-skilled immigrants depress wages for workers in blue-collar fields and that their numbers should thus be reduced. But leaked memos suggest the administration is designing crackdowns on highly skilled immigrants, despite mounds of evidence showing that such immigrants increase incomes for Americans of modest means. Bannon has denounced what he calls progressive plutocrats in Silicon Valley and complained that engineering schools are all full of people from South Asia and East Asia. Describing his vision for Trumponomics after the elections, he enthused, Its the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything. Shipyards, ironworks, get them all jacked up. There is no economic analysis identifying shipyards and ironworks as promising sectors for public investment. His mind simply runs automatically toward nostalgia for the manly work of an older generation. Trumpism is a culture war sold through chimerical economic and security gains. Michael Anton, a national-security staffer in the administration and a key Trumpist intellectual, wrote an anonymous essay during the campaign predicting that Trumps election would stanch what Anton called the ceaseless importation of Third World foreigners with no tradition of, taste for, or experience in liberty. America has long been defined  unlike France or Germany or Japan or Russia  as a country lacking a singular race. The ambition of Trumpism seems to be to create a blood-and-soil American nationalism, an identity from which Asian, Muslim, and Latin American immigrants are excluded permanently. It is widely known that very few Republican elites share this Trumpist vision. Whats grown clear since the election is how little this matters. Traditional Republicans would prefer to build a coalition for their small-government policies that would attract immigrant communities, but they will take any coalition that presents itself. Paul Ryans professions of love for tolerance and openness before the election reflected the calculations of a politician who expected his nominee to lose and was planning to repair the anticipated damage to his partys brand. The ideas that deeply troubled Ryan when articulated by a losing presidential candidate sound far more acceptable when articulated by a sitting president who promises to sign his fiscal bills. People close to Ryan and the White House say the Speaker shares an easy rapport with Steve Bannon, reports Politico. Trumpisms greatest vulnerability lies not in the buried qualms of his Republican partners. It is in the American public. January was a month of citizen protest unlike anything this country has witnessed in decades. After the travel ban was announced, mass outpourings at airports  many spontaneous  beamed around the world a message perhaps just as potent as the one the president delivered. Previous American presidents have espoused Americas openness and belief in harmony, but it took Trump to inspire Christians, Jews, Muslims, and others to join together in demonstrations of patriotic, ecumenical solidarity. At the moment, they are the strongest defense of the American idea against an ideology determined to thwart it. *This article appears in the February 6, 2017, issue of New York Magazine."}, {"date": "2017/02/05", "title": "Trump Says Judge and U.S. Court System Deserve Blame If Something Happens", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-escalates-attacks-on-judge-and-u-s-court-system.html", "text": " President Donald Trump has carelessly escalated his attacks on the U.S. judicial system in light of a federal judge temporarily blocking his travel ban on refugees and citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries.

In response, President Trump spent much of Saturday criticizing both the ruling as well as appearing to delegitimize this so-called judge who issued it. On Sunday, he went even further, suggesting that Judge Robart and the entire U.S. court system should face the blame if the U.S. faces a future terrorist attack. Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril, Trump stated, if something happens blame him and court system. The president then falsely claimed, People pouring in. Bad! In fact, there is not only no evidence that any of the current U.S. visa holders that were affected by Trumps ban are in any way dangerous, there is also no evidence of any surge of visa holders attempting to travel to the U.S. following the suspension of the ban. While some foreigners are taking advantage of the ban suspension to travel to the U.S., most reports indicate it has been a relatively small number of people. And again, those people have already faced some of the most intensive vetting done by any country in the world under the existing visa-approval process. I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY, Trump added in another tweet. The courts are making the job very difficult! This is also incorrect. By virtually all accounts, the federal government was already screening visitors, immigrants, and especially refugees to the U.S. very carefully, and no citizens from the seven countries included in Trumps ban have perpetrated a fatal terrorist attack on U.S. soil over the past four decades. In expanding his attacks to the U.S. judicial branch, Trump is likely referring not only to Robart, but also to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which on Sunday rejected the Justice Departments request for an emergency stay against Robarts order, pending appeal. That ruling does not mean the Trump administration cant eventually win an appeal that reinstates the travel ban, just that the Ninth Circuit wont immediately overrule Robarts restraining order before hearing the governments case  a process which is set to begin on Monday."}, {"date": "2017/02/05", "title": "Trump Administration Suspends Travel Ban Pending Appeal, Trump Attacks Judge", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-questions-legitimacy-of-judge-who-blocked-travel-ban.html", "text": " A U.S. appeals court has denied the Trump administrations request for an emergency stay on a federal judges order blocking the presidents recent travel ban. Early Sunday morning, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said it would not reinstate the ban, pending the appeal that government intends to file on Monday. Meanwhile, government agencies have suspended the ban while President Trump has appeared to question the legitimacy of the judge who issued the nationwide restraining order against the ban on Friday. Tweeting on Saturday morning in response to the block, Trump insisted that, The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! Additional critical tweets would later follow throughout the day and night. On Friday, Federal District Court judge James Robart temporarily blocked Trumps week-old executive order from being enforced on a nationwide scale, leading the State Department to reinstate some 60,000 visas of previously banned travelers, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to instruct airlines to begin allowing those passengers onto flights to the U.S., and the Department of Homeland Security to announce that it was suspending enforcement of the travel ban. The White House promised to request an emergency stay on the outrageous order on Friday, and did so on Saturday only to have that request rejected, pending judgment on their actual appeal. In the meantime, all travelers and refugees with valid U.S. visas are free to travel to the U.S. The president continued to tweet about the order later Saturday, eventually firing off a series of complaints based on the false and fear-mongering notion that foreigners have some kind of unfettered access to the U.S. They dont: The process for obtaining a visa to enter the U.S. includes a lengthy vetting, which can take up to two years and by no means guarantees entry. What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.? the president tweeted, before irresponsibly suggesting that because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. Trump also said that some Middle Eastern countries agreed with the ban, but did not provide any evidence to support that claim. In the evening, he even tried to give his government lawyers some strategic advice, wondering why the administrations lone court victory with regards to the ban wasnt being used to counteract the block. (Judge Robarts ruling appears to supercede the ruling Trump referenced.) Trumps objections notwithstanding, Robarts order immediately suspended both the 90-day ban on citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, as well as the 120-day ban on refugees. Those bans will resume should the White House win an emergency stay on the order, but on Saturday morning, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed that it was complying with the ruling and had suspended any and all actions implementing the affected sections of Trumps executive order. Meanwhile, airlines have been announcing that any passenger with a valid U.S. visa will be allowed to board planes to America, though its not clear how many people will take advantage of the opportunity to do so, particularly since the ban could be reinstated at any time. In issuing the nationwide injunction against Trumps order, Judge Robart  an appointee of President George W. Bush who was unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 2004  argued that there was no support for the Trump administrations argument that the government has to protect the country from citizens of the seven listed countries. In Robarts opinion, the attorneys general of Washington and Minnesota, who had filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the travel ban, had met their burden of demonstrating that they face immediate and irreparable injury as a result of the signing and implementation of the Executive Order since the order adversely affects the states residents in the areas of employment, education, business, family relations and freedom to travel. The States themselves are harmed by virtue of the damage that implementation of the Executive Order has inflicted on the operations and missions of their public universities and other institutions of higher learning, as well as injury to the States operations, tax bases and public funds, Robart added. Politico reports that the order appears modeled on litigation conservative states used to halt President Barack Obamas 2014 executive actions on immigration, in that those states argued that they have standing to challenge federal actions that affect them financially. In another tweet sent by the president on Saturday morning, he implied that allowing certain people from Middle Eastern countries would lead to death and destruction. In addition to banning refugees, and especially Syrian refugees, Trumps executive order had also stipulated that the U.S. give preferential treatment to persecuted religious minorities when admitting refugees in the future, which he has indicated as meaning Christians in majority-Muslim countries. That priority classification for religious minorities was also blocked by Robarts ruling.

Its also the magazines annual anniversary issue, but they opted against the traditional Eustace Tilley-inspired image in light of the news of Trumps travel ban. Finally, for their latest issue, Bloomberg Businessweek put on a meme-makers hat and took advantage of Trump holding up a piece of Photoshop-able paper to comment on the haphazard nature of many of Trumps recent executive orders:"}, {"date": "2017/02/04", "title": "White House Denies Report That Bannon Had to Be Reminded He Wasnt President", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/report-bannon-had-to-be-reminded-he-wasnt-the-president.html", "text": " Chief White House strategist Steve Bannon tried to order Department of Homeland Security secretary John Kelly to not issue a waiver exempting green-card holders from President Trumps travel-ban executive order, according to a report  which the White House is denying  in the Washington Post. Per two Trump administration officials who spoke with the Posts Josh Rogin, Kelly apparently rebuffed the attempt, telling Bannon that he only takes orders from the president. The president never weighed in, and Kelly went ahead and issued the waiver, which was made public on Sunday night, ending two full days of confusion and chaos around the question of whether or not permanent U.S. residents from the seven predominantly Muslim nations included in the ban would be allowed to reenter the country. The White House itself then confirmed that green-card holders were exempt from the order on Tuesday. Rogins post has undergone a series of revisions since it was published early Saturday, mainly because he didnt request comment from the White House before publishing the story, and once the White House weighed in, press secretary Sean Spicer denied most of what Rogins sources had reported. Despite the revisions, Rogin and the Post seem to be standing by the central thrust of the piece  that two administration officials say that Bannon and Kelly had a disagreement over issuing the waiver for green-card holders, and Kelly told Bannon that only President Trump could order him to back off on the waiver. Originally, the Post report said that Bannon had even made an unscheduled visit to Kellys office on Saturday over the issue, but that was later removed from the story. Spicer and Bannon both deny that any confrontation ever occurred, and Spicer went so far as to tell the Huffington Post that the whole report a patently false, made up story and that it was unbelievably unprofessional for Rogin and the Post to not seek comment from the White House before publishing. That being acknowledged, Rogins unnamed sources also said that cabinet officials had banded together during a 2 a.m. phone call among senior White House staff on Sunday to oppose the haphazard way the presidents executive order had been conceived and implemented by the White Houses growing Breitbart wing, Bannon and White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller. Then at a larger meeting on Sunday, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus ordered a temporary suspension of the issuing of additional executive orders until better procedures  as in ones that were inclusive of more White House voices  could be put in place. (Rogin originally reported that Trump himself had made that decision, but apparently it was Priebus, and Spicer denies that a pause was ordered  just new procedures.) If Rogins reporting is accurate  and again, the White House insists its not  Bannon would seem to have lost an important early power struggle, though not for lack of trying. Last weekend, CNN reported that the DHS had finished a legal analysis of the travel-ban order on Friday and concluded that it did not apply to green-card holders, but that the White House, and more specifically Bannon and Miller, had overruled that conclusion. On Friday and Saturday, Trump administration officials ended up sending mixed signals as to whether or not permanent residents were to be allowed onto planes to the U.S., as well as whether or not they would face extra screening, or have to apply for a waiver somehow, to gain re-entry to the U.S. As a result, many of these travelers were stranded and detained, ultimately for no reason. According to Rogins sources, Bannon  who has previously indicated that he would like to get rid of all legal immigration  attempted to intervene with Kelly over the issue at some point over the weekend, possibly in addition to the attempts at shaping the implementation of the ban that are reflected in CNNs reporting. Rogins story also ties in with this weeks TIME cover story asserting that Bannons contributions to the tumult of the new administrations first few weeks has rattled the West Wing and perhaps even dismayed the President, and that the controversy was leading to a slowing of the pace of the new administrations agenda. Though some in the White House have tried, there is virtually no way to spin the disastrous rollout of the travel ban as a success  unless confusion, mass protests, and inner-circle backstabbing was the desired outcome. Several reports have indicated that the travel-ban order was hastily and incompetently written, barely reviewed, and implemented and communicated with next to no planning. So far, the blame seems to have landed on the Trump administrations Breitbart wing. And while there doesnt seem to be any evidence of Bannon or Millers influence diminishing, there are at least some indications that other White House cabinet members are pushing to confront them. Then again, its also important to realize that, as The Atlantics Rosie Gray points out, most of these unnamed Trump officials are leaking negative stories about Miller and Bannon in an attempt to limit their influence in the administration. Indeed, it should go without saying that almost every leak that comes from these White House or Trump administration officials (who always wish to remain anonymous) should be understood as having some ulterior motive beyond simple transparency with the public. Understanding that, the fact that the Breitbart wing is being widely and specifically scapegoated for the travel-ban fallout likely illustrates how powerful it has already become.

Of equal significance, the order was in response from petitions not just from civil libertarians and immigrants advocates, but from the states of Washington and Minnesota. The Washington Post reports: When it all shakes down, presidential authority over immigration law will be hard to challenge. But for now, barring some immediate countervailing action by higher courts, Robart has put a stop to the travel ban and its deliberate and carelessly incidental human toll.

The states climate-change activists are equally determined to fight the new boss in Washington and his oily friends. Silicon Valley is potentially an important source of corporate resistance to Trumpism. Talk of a Calexit from the U.S. is no longer just a gag. Trump himself is bringing back memories of 1960s Cali-centric culture wars with threats against the University of California, Berkeley, for failing to use force against protesters who stopped an appearance by Daddys little provocateur, Milo Yiannopoulos. But all this friction could get a lot worse if Trumps likely-to-soon-be-confirmed Attorney General, the unrepentant Warrior on Drugs Jeff Sessions, decides to aggressively prosecute federal laws in conflict with the legalized cannabis regime California voters approved by a landslide the same day they rejected Trumps candidacy. Sessions dodged questions about his intentions toward jurisdictions with legal marijuana sales and/or consumption during his Senate confirmation hearings. And the issue could come to a test first in the states where legal cannabis is already up and running, like Colorado. Californias new legalized marijuana regime wont take effect until the beginning of 2018, and snarls over licensing and tax arrangements could make that deadline slip.

Many, no doubt, are hoping Super Bowl LI provides a brief escape from the endless shit storm of political controversy that hasnt let up since Donald Trumps inauguration two weeks ago. Theyll be disappointed. Like seemingly every other aspect of modern life, Super Bowl LI will be dominated by politics. On the field, onstage, on TV, and on the ground in Houston, issues such as immigration, racism, taxes, and sexism will be impossible to avoid. Heres why: The Patriots devotion to Trump: Weve covered this at length here, but the short version is that Tom Brady, Bill Belichick, and Robert Kraft, respectively the quarterback, head coach, and owner of the Patriots, are all big fans of President Trump. Thats why theres a movement afoot among guilty Pats fans to donate money to progressive causes every time their team makes them cheer. The halftime show: Even if Lady Gaga doesnt broach politics during the halftime show, the NFLs choice of a high-profile Hillary Clinton supporter to headline the performance has already led thousands to sign a petition declaring the league a leftist propaganda machine. For her part, Gaga says the halftime show will not make any statements beyond the ones that Ive been consistently making throughout my career. Those include inclusion and equality, concepts that sound innocent enough, but could make half the country throw their remote at the screen if she advocates for inclusion and equality for the wrong people. The commercials: Two ads set to air during the Super Bowl have set off sirens for the anti-immigrant crowd in the past week. The first, from Anheuser-Busch InBev, shows Adolphus Buschs journey to St. Louis from Germany and was meant to convey a message of hope and perseverance. But a little more than week after President Trump banned immigration to the U.S. from seven majority-Muslim countries, its bound to piss off a few drunk uncles. The other immigration-themed ad set to air Sunday comes from the building-materials company 84 Lumber. The spot appears to show a Mexican mother and daughter working their way toward the U.S. border, but ends before they get there. In mid-January, 84 Lumber CEO Michael Brunner said Fox rejected the ad because of its depiction of a border wall, with the network deeming it too controversial. Brunner said the ad was re-cut into its current version, which splits the story into two parts, the second of which will be put online Sunday night. If this sounds like a publicity stunt, thats because it probably is. Rather than produce another goofy ad like 2014s Doberhuahua, Audi decided this year to step into the debate over the gender pay gap  for which there is no debate  with this sappy spot thats already received pushback from the MAGA crowd. The national anthem: Remember the controversy stirred up earlier this season when San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem? Dont expect to see any of that Sunday. But even without overt political displays  something Patriots players Martellus Bennett and Devin McCourty did earlier this season when they raised their fists after the song  The Star-Spangled Banner is now a potential flashpoint at any gathering where the woke mingle with the sleepy. The guacamole: Most years, the most important thing to remember when eating your Super Bowl guac is to not stick chips too deep into the bowl and snap them off on the way out. This year, things are different, as the guac you enjoy Sunday could be the last guac of your life. Or at least, the last guac you enjoy before it gets too expensive to make. If the 20 percent import tax that the Trump administration has floated as a way of paying for the Presidents border wall becomes a reality, the price of avocados is going to go up so fast you might actually consider making your guac with peas. The only Muslim in the game: Mohamed Sanu, wide receiver for the Falcons, is the only Muslim playing the Super Bowl. Will Fox broadcasters Joe Buck and Troy Aikman mention that during the game? Should they? Sanu himself was tight-lipped when asked about Trumps travel ban at Super Bowl media day, saying, I just pray that us as a country and a world can be united. He added that its really hard for me to talk about this right now and didnt want to say much more. The protests in Houston: By the time the Super Bowl kicks off, Houston will have seen no fewer than five separate protests if all goes as planned. USA Today reports that groups protesting the travel ban, and Trump generally, are planning to stay visible all weekend and come together outside NRG Stadium on Sunday. Among those planning to participate are members of Black Lives Matter, religious leaders, the local Democratic Party, and anti-circumcision activists."}, {"date": "2017/02/03", "title": "Mike Pence Will Likely Break Senate Tie on DeVos.

But when her actual confirmation comes up next week, the odds favor a tie vote, since two Republicans (Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski) have announced they intend to vote against the controversial education-privatization advocate, who has aroused the kind of intense and highly organized opposition that lights up phones on Capitol Hill. No Senate Democrats have indicated an interest in coming to DeVoss rescue. If this is the situation when the actual confirmation vote occurs, Vice-President Mike Pence will have to do something Joe Biden did not have to do for eight years: vote to break a Senate tie. And in fact it would be the first time a tiebreaker has been used in a confirmation vote. According to Senate records, there have been a grand total of 244 Senate tiebreakers cast by veeps, with the very first, John Adams, being the all-time leader with 29 such votes. The last tiebreaker, by Dick Cheney, occurred on a bill to roll back alternative-minimum tax rates in 2008; it was Cheneys eighth. Part of the reason Joe Biden never had to break a tie was the large Democratic margin in the Senate for the first two years of the Obama administration. But from 2011 to 2015, the routine deployment of filibusters by the Senate GOP minority made 60 votes, not 51, the threshold for enactment of legislation. And then after Republicans took the Senate, votes typically were not held on Democratic legislation the leadership did not favor, and were not held on Republican legislation everyone knew would either be filibustered or vetoed by Obama. With Republican trifecta control of the federal government, the floodgates have opened, and the narrow margin of GOP control of the Senate means tie votes are a lot more likely. In addition, the decline in use of the filibuster, initiated by its elimination for executive and non-SCOTUS judicial appointments by Senate Democrats in 2013, will mean the sheer volume of close Senate votes will increase. One could easily imagine Pence having to break ties over the confirmation of Supreme Court Justices (either including or after Neil Gorsuch) if the filibuster for that type of vote is also eliminated, and for such high-profile, high-impact bills as the budget-reconciliation measures Republicans plan to use for most of their 2017 legislative agenda. So Pence had better grow accustomed to the path from his office to the Senate floor. And lets dont entirely ignore the remote possibility that Donald Trumps veep will someday break a tie against the will of the Senate GOP conference.

But this is because he has persisted in his campaign practices of telling comically obvious untruths (33 of them so far by Trump alone, by one count) and shredding long-standing ethical standards. Conway believes that Trump is entitled to friendly, or at least friendlier, coverage as a matter of respect for the office that he holds.

The White House press secretary responded by asking America to cooly assess the costs and benefits of president Trumps discriminatory travel ban. Three-hundred-and-twenty-five-thousand people flew into this country from airports, and 109 people were affected and slowed down in their travel, Spicer told MSNBC. I understand that is an inconvenience, but at the end of the day that is a small price to pay as opposed to somebody losing their life because a terrorist attack was admitted. Framed like this, Trumps travel ban does sound like good public policy: Given a choice between slowing down the travel of 109 people  or allowing a fatal terrorist attack to be executed on U.S. soil  most American voters would happily take the former. The trouble, of course, is that theres no evidence the ban actually averted a terrorist attack  and considerable reason to think it actually made Americans less safe. Oh, and Spicer slightly underestimated the number of people inconvenienced by the White Houses gift to ISIS recruiters: Instead of slowing the travel of 109 people, it stripped legal access to the United States from between 60,000 and 100,000 people, depending on which government source you believe. Per the Washington Post: Hours later, the State Department contradicted the Justice Department lawyers claim. Regardless, nearly 60,000 revoked visas is a lot of revoked visas.

Theres something very troubling about the way this is playing out, Virginia solicitor general Stuart Raphael told the Post. While I am pleased that they are willing to whisk people back if they come to our attention, they wont come to our attention if we dont know who they are.

Until then, many members of American communities will remain stranded overseas.

Irans continued support for terrorism and development of its ballistic missile program poses a threat to the region, to our partners worldwide and to the United States, the Treasurys acting sanctions chief John E.

By focusing on Irans missile program and terrorist-supporting military groups, the U.S. believes the sanctions are not a violation of the 2015 United Nations nuclear deal, which prevents new nuclear-related sanctions on Iran.

Since 2014, tens of thousands of Americans have died by overdosing on opioids  and the price of one lifesaving overdose cure has risen by 500 percent. Naloxone hit the market in 1971, as the first drug for reversing an opioid overdose, and has been off-patent for decades. But with overdose antidotes, delivery systems matter: There isnt always time to get a sufferer professional help, which means a naloxone products ease of use can mean the difference between life and death. Kaleo was first conceived as a competitor to EpiPen, which has also (infamously) found that people are willing to pay a high price for easy-to-use, lifesaving drugs. But as the opioid epidemic grew, Kaleo realized its injector devices could work just as well for dispensing naloxone. This insight resulted in Evzio, an injector with a built-in voice recording that talks the user through the process of injecting the drug. This feature is genuinely valuable  it has made Evzio the first nalaxone injector that can be used by anybody, not just doctors and first responders. That innovation allowed Evzio to capture 20 percent of naloxones retail market in 2015 and 2016. It also allowed Kaleo to raise Evzios price from $690 in 2014 to $4,500 today. To be fair, Kaleo has paired its price-gouging with a heavy dose of charity: The company has donated large numbers of its devices to cities and drug-treatment programs. But Kaleos generosity hasnt kept up with demand, and its donation supply was exhausted by July of last year. Further, by charging its paying consumers a price exponentially higher than the cost of production, the company has made its device impossible to access for many buyers that desperately need it  including the state of Vermont. And it isnt just Kaleo. Other naloxone makers are also responding to rising demand by jacking up prices. According to a new paper in the New England Journal of Medicine, the cost of Hospiras injectable increased from $62.29 in 2012 to $142.49 today, while Amphastars naloxone nasal spray has risen by 95 percent since 2014. Shaming individual companies and pharmaceutical CEOs for hiking the price of drugs is easy. Also fun. And somewhat effective. But America could really use a better mechanism than spiteful memes of Martin Shkreli for controlling pharmaceutical costs. Like, for example, joining every other developed nation in letting the government enact price controls on lifesaving drugs. Fortunately, America just elected a populist president who was propelled into power by communities suffering from the opioid epidemic  and who has promised to take on Big Pharma and bid down the price of drugs. Unfortunately, that president is actually a con man who scratched that plan after meeting with pharma lobbyists earlier this week."}, {"date": "2017/02/03", "title": "Protests Erupt on NYU Campus Over Conservative Speaker on Campus", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/protests-erupt-on-nyu-campus-over-right-wing-speaker.html", "text": " At least 11 people were arrested when New York University demonstrations turned violent Thursday night. Dozens gathered to protest the conservative actor, comedian, and Vice Media co-founder Gavin McInnes, whom the NYU College Republicans had invited to speak on campus. McInnes, who left Vice in 2006, is also the founder of Proud Boys, which describes itself as a fraternal organization that wants to reinstate a spirit of Western chauvinism. Protesters, many of whom were dressed in all black, clashed with NYPD cops and attendees  some of them in Make America Great Again hats  outside the Kimmel Center, an NYU campus building where McInness talk was scheduled to take place. NYU denied entry to nonstudents who tried to get into the event, including some apparently affiliated with the Proud Boys, whose presence fueled tensions with the demonstrators, as the two sides cursed and insulted at each other, forcing cops to intervene. NYU Anti-Fascists organized the demonstrations, which NYC AntiFa  a nonstudent group  joined. According to NYU Local, an independent university blog, there were reports that an alt-right group, intent to agitate the crowd, also snuck in among the protesters. Protesters also managed to get inside the event, where they chanted and interrupted McInness speech, apparently forcing him to cut short the event. McInnes also claimed he was hit by pepper spray. Ive never gotten pepper sprayed before, he said to start the event. You get the sense of panic where youre like How do I know it isnt acid? And then youre like, Oh yeah, this isnt Islam. The individuals arrested  eight men and three women  will face charges, including criminal mischief, drug possession, disorderly conduct, and obstructing government administration, reports the New York Daily News. The outrage on NYUs campus comes a day after aggressive protests broke out on the UC-Berkeley campus after alt-right figure and Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos was invited by college Republicans to speak  though the talk was canceled after anti-fascists vandalized buildings and set fires.

The attacker is reportedly in serious condition while the soldier suffered only minor injuries to his scalp. The attacker, who was reportedly yelling Allahu akbar before he was shot, went after the soldier in the Carrousel du Louvre, an underground shopping mall outside the museum. After he was shot and taken into custody, bomb specialists inspected two backpacks he was carrying but they were found to not be a threat. Visitors to the museum learned of the attack over loudspeaker and were ordered to sit, away from windows, until they were evacuated about an hour later. French President Franois Hollande responded to the attack on Twitter, writing, I salute the courage and determination demonstrated by the military this morning at the Carrousel du Louvre. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo also praised the efficient and relevant Paris security features that stopped the attacker before he caused any serious harm. President Donald Trump remarked on the attack too, but he took a different angle than the two French leaders. Trumps quick response to the Paris attack, which resulted in small wounds to one person, has led to criticism given the presidents continued silence about last Sundays murder of six Muslims at a Quebec mosque. Its also worth noting that the Quebec attack by a white right winger has received less attention by the Trump administration than the Bowling Green massacre, which never happened."}, {"date": "2017/02/03", "title": "Trump Announces Plan to Let Wall Street Scam America Again", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-announces-plan-to-let-wall-street-scam-america-again.html", "text": " One of the revelations that came out in the wake of the financial crisis is that financial firms were dumping on their customers investments they knew to be bad. Among the many changes in the Dodd-Frank law is a fiduciary rule, requiring firms to provide investment advice that is in the best interest of their customers. Donald Trump has filled his administration with Wall Street veterans, who believe that their industry is overregulated. (Financial firms accounted for 30 percent of all corporate profits before the economic crisis, but only 17 percent now, thanks largely to Dodd-Franks tighter regulation.) Americans are going to have better choices and Americans are going to have better products because were not going to burden the banks with literally hundreds of billions of dollars of regulatory costs every year, National Economic Council Director and Goldman Sachs veteran Gary Cohn tells The Wall Street Journal. Cohn is planning to weaken the fiduciary rule, which he believes robs Americans of their freedom to hire financial advisers who might want to rip them off. This is like putting only healthy food on the menu, he tells the Journal, because unhealthy food tastes good but you still shouldnt eat it because you might die younger. Cohns metaphor is worth exploring. Healthy food, in Cohns example, is equivalent of investment advice thats good for the client. Unhealthy food is like investment advice thats bad for the client (but good for the adviser he has hired). Why shouldnt people choose how much healthy versus unhealthy financial advice to hire? Well, the reason financial advisers are required to follow their clients fiduciary interests, rather than assuming that the logic of the free market will naturally produce optimal scrupulousness, is that investing is extremely complex. There is a huge asymmetry of information between professionals who work at investment firms and their customers. A customer at a restaurant might be able to eyeball the menu and guess that the spinach salad is healthier than the pizza, but a customer shopping for financial advisers is not going to know which ones will give them the best financial advice versus the ones who might might be trying to enrich themselves at the customers expense. Cohn promises his plans to gut the fiduciary rule are just the beginning of Trumps offensive against Dodd-Frank. This is a table setter for a bunch of stuff that is coming, he promises the Journal. The items hes setting out on that table will probably be healthier for Goldman Sachs than for the country."}, {"date": "2017/02/03", "title": "There Are So Many Reasons to Root Against Trumps Team in the Super Bowl", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/so-many-reasons-to-root-against-trumps-team-in-super-bowl.html", "text": " As anyone who has heard my cracker drawl could guess, Im from Georgia, and have spent over half my life in and around Atlanta. Not being much of an NFL fan (my passion is college football), I had no more than a mild rooting interest in the Falcons as they made the playoffs and then kept on winning. But now that they are facing the New England Patriots in the fifty-first Super Bowl (I stubbornly refuse to use the pretentious Roman numerals), its hard to ignore the fact that this game is developing political undertones, or maybe overtones. The Pats have an unholy trinity of conspicuous associations with the 45th president of the United States. Owner Robert Kraft calls Donald Trump a very close friend of mine for over two decades. Coach Bill Belichick, another self-identified good friend of Trump, sent him a fawning letter that the candidate read aloud on the eve of his victory in the 2016 New Hampshire Republican primary. And most of all, star QB Tom Brady is identified with Team Trump, as reflected in this 2015 testimonial for the mogul: And Trump has reciprocated to an extent that is sometimes, well, a tad creepy, beginning with that 2002 beauty pageant: Now, rich, white professional-football-team owners, coaches, and star QBs tend to be pretty conservative, so we probably shouldnt hold such views against the entire franchise, particularly when it represents a region that gave Donald Trump the princely sum of a single electoral vote (from Maines rural second congressional district, which awards its vote independently of the state as a whole). But there is another thing that has politicized Super Bowl Fifty-One: Trumps gratuitous attacks on the city of Atlanta and its civil-rights-icon congressman, John Lewis. When Lewis said he would boycott Trumps inauguration, the president-elect cut loose on Twitter, and fired not just at the man who was nearly killed in the struggle for voting rights, but at his congressional district, which encompasses most of the city of Atlanta: As Atlanta-based sportswriter Jason Kirk observed, these tweets slandered Atlanta in multiple ways: And my favorite: Theres another thing that ties the Patriots to Trump and the Falcons to Lewis: popularity. As a recent survey from Public Policy Polling shows, the Pats are even more disliked nationally than is Trump: So its reasonably clear that the American people who Trump acts as though he uniquely understands are going to be cheering against his team on Sunday. But, yeah, there will be a special intensity of feeling from Atlantans near and far. Heres how sportswriter Kirk puts it: With all due apologies to Patriots fans who arent fans of the president or really just dont care about politics, many other Americans are going to enjoy an extra helping of schadenfreude if the Falcons win on Sunday."}, {"date": "2017/02/03", "title": "Kellyanne Conway Cites Made-up Bowling Green Massacre to Justify Travel Ban", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/kellyanne-conway-cites-fake-bowling-green-massacre.html", "text": " Do you remember where you were during the horrific Bowling Green Massacre? Probably not, because its just something Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway made up while trying to justify the travel ban on refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries. During a Thursday night interview with Chris Matthews, the alternative facts proponent cited an underreported terror attack, while arguing that career civil servants shouldnt have spoken out against Trumps immigration order. Conway said: Essentially the only accurate part of that statement is that there were no media reports fitting that description. It appears Conway is misstating details about a 2009 incident in which two Iraqi refugees living in Bowling Green, Kentucky, were arrested for plotting to send money and weapons to insurgents back in Iraq. In response to the incident, the processing of Iraqi refugees was drastically slowed for six months in 2011, as the U.S. tightened up vetting procedures. As PolitiFact notes, hundreds of Iraqi refugees were still admitted to the U.S. during that time. Later, Conway corrected herself on Twitter, saying she misspoke and intended to say terrorists instead of massacre: She also implied the mix-up was an honest mistake: To be clear, the story is a troubling example of a failure of the U.S. refugee-vetting process. Mohanad Shareef Hammadi and Waad Ramadan Alwan were cleared to enter the U.S. in 2009, though they had been detained by local authorities during the Iraq War for insurgent activities. Alwans fingerprints had been found on an unexploded IED, but that didnt show up when he was vetted. Following a tip, the FBI set up a sting in which an undercover operative offered Alwan an opportunity to ship money and weapons from Kentucky to mujaheddin in Iraq. Alwan got Hammadi involved in the project, and they were both arrested in 2012 on federal terrorism charges. Alwan was sentenced to 40 years in prison, and Hammadi was sentenced to life in prison. After Alwan and Hammadi were arrested, it was discovered that they may have been involved in an IED attack that killed four soldiers in Iraq in 2005. ABC News reported at the time: As a result of the incident, fingerprint databases for Iraqi militants were integrated into the databases used to check refugees. President Obama ordered a new review of the 57,000 Iraqis who had recently been admitted into the U.S. Those incidents received a fair amount of media coverage, but public interest was limited, since there was never a plot to massacre people in Kentucky.

While the White House statement only mentioned that innocent people were subject to Nazi terror, Politico reports that the State Departments Office of the Special Envoy for Holocaust Issues prepared a message that mentioned Jewish victims, as it had done in the past. Sources say State Department officials thought the statement was being drafted for use by the White House. An unnamed White House official said they didnt see the State Department draft until after they had issued their own statement, and then told State not to release its version because it came in after 7 p.m. The official denied that they asked the State Department to draft a statement. While critics note that downplaying the Nazis persecution of the Jews is a key feature of Holocaust denial, various White House officials have said the incident is overblown. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer accused critics of nitpicking and noted that the statement was written with the help of an individual who is both Jewish and the descendent of Holocaust survivors.

The rule, which the NRA opposed and the House struck down 235180, would have applied to people who receive Social Security disability or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits and are unable to manage their own finances because of a documented mental illness, including schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. It would have covered about 75,000 people, reports USA Today. Under the rule, which was finalized in the last days of the Obama administration and now will no longer be, the Social Security Administration would have reported these particular individuals to the FBI, so their names would have come up in a background check if someone tried to purchase a firearm. The SSA would also notify those potentially affected by the rule, and implement a system so people could appeal their placements on the background-check list, if necessary. Second Amendment and some disability advocates opposed the rule, calling it discriminatory and a violation of due process. Those in favor argued that if someone is unable to work or manage his or her affairs because of a severe mental illness, perhaps he or she should not easily be able to purchase a firearm. Congress is knocking down these and other regulations put in place in the last six months of Obamas tenure under the authority of the Congressional Review Act. Under this law, the Senate only needs a simple majority to strip away a rule, so Democratic support isnt necessary to tear away these and other policies.

But surprise, surprise: A senior administration official in Washington went to the trouble of telling the Jerusalem Post that Trump didnt want any unilateral actions that could undermine our ability to make progress, including settlement announcements. This was a clear reference to settlement announcements the Netanyahu government in fact has made since Trump took office. Even more surprisingly: For the first time, the administration confirmed that Trump is committed to a comprehensive two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict negotiated between the parties. Yes, Trump has on occasion referred to a two-state deal between the Israelis and Palestinians as the ultimate deal that he would relish making, with his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as his diplomatic wing man. But Israelis and Americans alike mostly concluded Trump was about as committed to a two-state solution as Netanyahu  which is to say not really at all  given Team Trumps reaction to the Obama administrations scolding of Israel in connection with its decision not to veto a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning settlement activity. The early appointment of hard-line settlements advocate David Friedman as the new U.S. ambassador to Israel made that impression even more natural. So whats up, now? As is often the case with this president, its hard to say. Perhaps Trump just doesnt want Bibi upstaging him before theyve met, or publicly compromising any options. Maybe all his thundering about his unshakable commitment to Israel-right-or-wrong was just anti-Obama agitprop that hes casting aside now that hes in office. Who knows: could be Vladimir Putin in that famous phone call this week cooled Trumps jets on this particular front.

Early in the GOP primary, the mogul fell head over heels for such surveys  but by the general election, infatuation had given way to a tumultuous, love-hate affair. After November 8, polls turned against Trump. Now, they dont mean anything to him at all. Its hard to blame Trump for feeling bitter. Over the past three months, barely a day has gone by without some poll reminding him that he is the least popular new president in recorded history. But earlier this week, a Reuters/Ipsos survey showed the commander-in-chief a rare bit of kindness: Americans approved of his temporary travel ban on citizens from seven Muslim countries by a margin of 49 to 41 percent. This was excellent news for the president, who had spent the weekend listening to protesters, pundits, tech executives, terrorism experts  and even members of his own cabinet  criticize the order that was wreaking havoc at airports all across the country. The Reuters poll told Trump the same thing that so many other surveys had told him, back in the halcyon days of the primary: Dont listen to the experts and activists, the people are on your side. But beneath the headline number, the polls message was more ambiguous. Only 31 percent of respondent said that Trumps order had made them feel more safe, while 56 percent opposed prioritizing the resettlement of Christian refugees, as Trump had proposed. And on Thursday, new surveys from Gallup and Public Policy Polling suggest that support for Trumps crackdown on Muslim immigration  and his obsession with border control, more broadly  is shallower than the Reuters poll made it appear. Another indication of the publics discomfort with Trumps first round of executive action is the unusually high percentage of voters who think the new president is moving too fast. PPPs findings dont present as resounding a rebuke, at first blush. Overall, the pollster finds that 47 percent of voters support Trumps executive order on immigration, while 49 percent oppose. But when you ask Americans about the orders specific provisions, support plummets: Whats more, PPP finds that only 39 percent of voters thought the order was well executed, while 39 percent said the opposite. So, it doesnt look like inflicting arbitrary cruelty on Muslim immigrants will turn Trump into a popular president: Fifty-two percent of Americans disapprove of the president, according to Gallup, while PPP finds that 40 percent of the country would like to see him impeached  including 3 percent of his own voters."}, {"date": "2017/02/02", "title": "Trump Vows to Get Rid of Electioneering Restrictions on Churches", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-goes-after-electioneering-restrictions-on-churches.html", "text": " It is beginning to look like a big week for the Christian right in Washington. On Tuesday night President Trump gave them the SCOTUS nominee most of them wanted, in Neil Gorsuch. Then word got out that the administration had drafted a sweeping executive order on religious liberty that could have been drafted by Jerry Falwell Jr. And then on Thursday morning, at the National Prayer Breakfast (itself an annual ritual of presidential deference to conservative Christians), Trump repeated a campaign promise to repeal the so-called Johnson Amendment, a 1954 law preventing open electioneering by tax-exempt nonprofit organizations. Actually, the term he used was not repeal, but totally destroy. Very presidential of him. What this would mean in practice is that people employed by religious bodies (and other kinds of nonprofit organizations), most especially ministers of the Christian Gospel, could endorse and exhort support for special candidates and other matters decided at the ballot box right there in the pulpit  or perhaps more importantly, through utilization of church resources (signs, flyers, phone and email lists, and presumably even paid ads). It would save the time and trouble involved in the winking and nodding that often goes on with clerical politicking. But less innocently, the proposed new policy might also pave the way to coerced electioneering statements imposed on individual ministers and congregations by denominational leaders. It would definitely politicize the Sabbath in a big way. Trump, of course, tries to make this sound like a simple matter of freedom, daring to cite as an authority the predecessor for whom separation of church and state was a first principle: Put aside for a moment the fact that religious groups violating the Johnson Amendment practically have to hit the IRS over the head with their views to attract the rare investigation or enforcement action. Even if it were regularly enforced, nothing in the Johnson Amendment keeps anyone from worshiping as they wish; representatives of faith could have devoted every 2016 sermon to demanding votes for Donald Trump or excoriating the baby-killing devil-woman Hillary Clinton if they wanted. They just cannot at the same time accept taxpayer subsidies. That is the real misunderstanding here. Groups demanding the freedom to say and do whatever they want, and/or to violate anti-discrimination laws in the name of God, seem to view tax-exempt status as quite literally a matter of divine entitlement. But its a very secular thing conveying crass, material benefits in great abundance. Not only does church property (and some forms of church employee compensation) escape taxation: The dollars placed in the collection plate convey a tax benefit to the contributors. All told, the value of the tax exemptions for churches has been estimated in one recent study as amounting to $71 billion annually. Thats certainly enough to justify a bit of self-control in playing with electoral politics. Since the Johnson Amendment is a matter of statutory law (enacted, as it happens, by a Republican-controlled Congress and signed by a Republican president), not executive-branch policy, Trump cannot get rid of and totally destroy it by fiat. But because it involves the tax code, congressional Republicans can almost certainly nestle a Johnson Amendment repeal into one of the two budget reconciliation bills on tap this year  perhaps the first one, mainly aimed at whatever the GOP decides to do with Obamacare, which will supposedly be unveiled this month or next. Such a bill cannot be filibustered by Senate Democrats, and given everything else that will be going on, a big juicy treat for the Christian right will probably get through without the kind of attention it deserves.

Just look around at his Breitbart author page: If you ignore the overheated headlines and constant references to his own greatness, its clear that Yiannopoulos is, for the most part, serving up microwaved portions of mass-market right-wing goonery. Same goes for his college speeches. The transcript of one is headlined MILO at Cal Poly State University: No More Dead Babies. Can you imagine, and I dont think this is a stretch, the senior leaders of Planned Parenthood sitting in a conference room discussing the best timing for an abortion, to maximize their profits from the dead babys body? he told his Cal Poly audience. Its horrifying, and its what feminists want more of. Its also the same argument youve heard on a Fox News segment. If you are above a certain age and familiar with right-wing discourse in the U.S., much of Yiannopouloss work, a sizable portion of which is (or at least was) written by a small army of interns, just isnt particularly new or interesting. His articles and arguments are usually just iterations of the same right-wing talking points you can hear on Rush Limbaugh or Michael Savage or Sean Hannity or a dozen other right-wing bomb-throwers at any hour of any day: Did you know that theres a lot of black-on-black crime? Why dont libtards realize that Muslims want to destroy America? How many babies are Democrats going to kill? Thats not to say these arguments arent hateful and harmful to the groups they target, or that these hosts dont, like Yiannopoulos, say crazy-sounding things to get attention and rile up the left  but the fact is that they are mainstream, and they represent the views of a big chunk of the country. Yiannopoulos has been able to have it both ways: portraying himself as some unspeakably dangerous exemplar of politically incorrect Truth, the ber-triggerer, all while staying mainstream enough to allow for certain valuable-from-a-marketing-perspective forms of plausible deniability and a fat book deal from Simon & Schuster. In other contexts, and with the exception of media-tracking organizations like Media Matters, progressives have generally realized that there is very little bang for the buck in freaking out over figures like Limbaugh and Hannity, given that these sorts of pundits are an entrenched part of our discourse and are preaching to loyal choirs. Which raises the question: How has someone like Yiannopoulos managed to set a college campus on fire despite bringing so little thats new to the table? Yiannopoulos capitalizes on the fact that his youngest fans and detractors (and its not an accident his most ardent fans and detractors tend to be young) are typically only familiar and comfortable with a pretty narrow discourse  precisely what one finds on college campuses at the moment. Academic communities tend to be places where the bounds of acceptable expression and thought are significantly different than they are on, for example, right-wing AM radio. Ideas that are unfortunately commonplace in a nation of 350 million people, and especially among older demographics, seem more singular and uniquely dangerous (to use Yiannopouloss chosen term) on college campuses  especially when theyre coming from such a flamboyant, gleefully bellicose figure. The fact that Yiannopoulos has a tendency to harass people, both online and off-, only acts to further mask the staleness of his actual beliefs. His Leslie Jones tweets are the most famous examples, but there are plenty of others. During two of his recent talks, for example, he showed pictures of and denigrated members of the communities where he was speaking  one involving a sociology professor, whom he called a Fat Faggot onscreen, and the other a trans student  in a way that seems geared at inciting harassment. (Yiannopoulos is himself gay and once wrote an article giving his fans permission to call other people fags.) Yiannopoulouss fans also misconstrue his shtick as new or uniquely edgy, and from their point of view its a good thing. Since he first got famous stoking the anti-feminist fires of Gamergate, he has attracted an audience of resentful young people frustrated with political correctness, many of whom believe they arent allowed to say various offensive things. Now, it is plainly false that reactionary speech is severely restricted in the U.S.: Anyone who listens to the aforementioned talk-show hosts knows that theres a huge market for misogynistic and racially dog-whistling language. This is a common conservative falsehood, that in a country that elected Donald Trump people are getting fired or blacklisted left and right simply for tellin it like it is. But again, if youre a young person who hasnt been exposed to that side of the discourse, and youre suspicious of the liberal discourse that prevails on many campuses, Yiannopoulous is a shock to the system. He feels new and important, despite the fact that he isnt. Its hard to blame college students for being outraged at this sort of rhetoric, of course. Every day, Yiannopoulos and figures like him really do slander and insult huge swaths of the American public. But theyre also, unfortunately, a fairly entrenched part of our political culture that isnt going anywhere. In many cases, from a progressive perspective, theyre best ignored except on those occasions when they cross certain lines that, at least arguably, demand some sort of response (some reactionary pundits treatment of Sandra Fluke springs to mind). Think of it this way: If you had limited funds to donate to progressive causes, would you donate to an organization dedicated to fighting Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity, or would you feel like you were wasting your money? As Ive argued previously, Yiannopoulos has mastered a sort of campus-outrage outrage feedback loop. He announces hes coming to a campus, theres pushback to it, the pushback itself gets propagated by Breitbart and other outlets determined to run an article every time a left-wing activist on a college campus sneezes, and his notoriety grows, allowing him to book more talks (he doesnt charge for them, making it an easy sell), generate more outrage, pre-sell more books, and so on. This time around, the president of the United States got into the act and cable-news networks covered the protests live in prime time. So that feedback loop just got a lot bigger."}, {"date": "2017/02/02", "title": "Spicer Puts Iran on Notice and Falsely Claims Bombing of U.S. Navy Ship", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-puts-iran-on-notice-iran-calls-threat-useless.html", "text": " White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer followed the leads of President Trump and National Security Adviser Mike Flynn Thursday when he warned Iran that it is on notice for a recent ballistic missile test. Then Spicer mentioned another Iranian transgression: the actions that it took against our Navy vessel. Only, that never happened. Spicer is likely referring to an attack on Monday on a Saudi frigate, which was not carried out by Iran. Rather, the Pentagon tells the Intercept, Houthi rebels, an Iranian-backed group fighting in Yemen, are the prime suspects. To recap: It wasnt a U.S. ship and the attackers werent Iranians. Spicers comments come a day after Flynn put Iran on notice for the ballistic missile test, and hours after President Trump did the same on Twitter. Flynns remarks were delivered Wednesday in the White House briefing room, where he called the missile test a violation of the 2015 United Nations resolution that called upon Iran to cease any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons. Though Flynn did not lay out how the U.S. might respond to Iran, an administration official told CNN, We are considering a whole range of options. Were in a deliberative process. Iran responded Thursday with little more than a shrug. The nation maintains that it did not violate the U.N. resolution and Ali Akbar Velayati, a top adviser to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said, threatening Iran is useless. This is not the first time that an inexperienced person has threatened Iran, Velayati told the Fars News Agency, often described as the semi-official outlet of Irans government. Iran is the strongest power in the region and has a lot of political, economic, and military power  America should be careful about making empty threats to Iran. He went on to say that Iran will continue testing capabilities in ballistic missiles and will not ask any country for permission in defending itself. Trumps first Iran tweet this morning was quickly followed by another implying that the nation would have collapsed without the assets that were unfrozen as part of the 2015 nuclear deal. In his tweet, Trump misstates both the amount of money and wrongly suggests the U.S. cut Iran a check. Of course, theres more wrong with that tweet than the misstated facts. For starters, Irans collapse would be very bad, further destabilizing the Middle East and removing one of the regions foremost enemies of ISIS. Also, the idea that Iran was on its last legs appears to have come from the same place as so many other claims Trump makes: his imagination."}, {"date": "2017/02/02", "title": "Mexican President Gives Nafta Timeline, Rallies Around Mexican Manufacturing", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/nieto-is-bullish-on-mexican-products-plans-for-nafta-talks.html", "text": " The constructive and productive phone call last Friday between Donald Trump and Mexican president Enrique Pea Nieto may have been a little more tense than originally advertised. And though Trumps attention has shifted from the border wall to feuds with Iran, key ally Australia, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mexicos president has also been keeping busy. On Wednesday, the Mexican president announced a series of manufacturing and business initiatives that push back against Trumpss rhetoric, particularly on the issue of trade. Officials called it the Made in Mexico event, so billed because one of Nietos big initiatives includes a manufacturing P.R. push by reviving this flashy Hecho en Mexico (Made in Mexico) stamp, which will be placed on all those great products that catch this?  were produced in Mexico. Whats made here, President Nieto said, is a symbol of quality and source of pride for all. The president described the seal as something that would give competitive edge to Mexican products: When someone sees a product with the mark of the Mexican eagle, he said, they will be certain that this is a product well made and made in Mexico. Nieto is pretty unpopular, but the spat with Trump over the border wall has galvanized the country  something the Mexican leader appears to be taking full advantage of right now. In his statement, Nieto also extolled Mexicos economy as a model of openness and competition, and mentioned a few of the countrys top exports  from flat-screen televisions to refrigerators to, yes, avocados. In the future, these products might arrive in the U.S. with a passive-aggressive new label. Nieto also spoke of a push to make Mexico even more friendly to the private sector, including international investors. The president said that as of next month, for every regulation passed, two others would be eliminated. That should sound familiar. Finally, Nieto also offered the first hints at an official timeline for Nafta negotiations. The president outlined a 90-day consultation period  starting now  between the Mexican government and businesses  which would also happen simultaneously in the United States. After that, talks would begin, but no earlier than May. But Trump, at a meeting with senators in the White House, said Thursday that he wanted to speed up Nafta talks. I want to change it. And maybe we do it  maybe we do a new Nafta with an extra F in the term Nafta. You know what the F is for, right? Free and fair trade, Trump said. Not just free trade. Free and fair trade.

Now Sarah Posner has found and written up the actual draft order that is kicking around Trumpland and affected advocacy groups, and it is, in a word, breathtaking: It reflects the demands of conservative Christians for (in effect) plenary permission to violate anti-discrimination laws and policies that allegedly trouble their consciences, without any consequences for their dealings with the federal government, whether it is as employees, contractors, federally subsidized entities, or as beneficiaries of the tax exemption for nonprofit organizations. And sweeping aside the history of such exemptions as confined to religious organizations and their offshoots, the draft order would be extended to individuals whatever their business. In effect the order would (so far as the federal governments regulatory power reaches) let conservative Christians create their own parallel society where it is still 1972, and abortion is illegal, birth control is discouraged, and anyone who is not heterosexual can be openly discriminated against. Its description of the protected beliefs so tracks conservative evangelical and traditionalist Catholic tenets that it screams for a First Amendment challenge, though if promulgated we can be sure it would be defended as applying equally to all religions (just like, wink wink, the travel ban). When your inspiration is the social policies of the State of Mississippi, you are already on constitutionally shaky grounds from the get-go. As Posner notes, the provisions of the order dealing with Obamacares contraception-coverage mandate sweep away years of painstaking compromises over how to provide coverage without requiring direct subsidies from religious organizations, and jump the gun on the Obamacare repeal and replacement that Republicans are struggling with in Congress. In reading that section, keep in mind that most of the people fighting contraception coverage claim that a variety of common birth control methods are actually abortifacients because they may in some cases violate the sanctity of a fertilized ovum. The same section, by the way, directs the Justice Department to establish a new section or working group dedicated to protecting religious freedom. So the order would not represent some one-time gesture but the beginning of an institutional commitment to fight for the religious right to discriminate. No one knows how close the administration is to issuing the draft order. One would normally think the torrent of criticism it will soon receive, not just from equality advocates but from legal experts horrified by sloppy drafting, will make a big difference. But this is the White House that issued the travel-ban order in a huge hurry, with indifference if not enthusiasm for the chaos it would cause. It is interesting that the new principal deputy press secretary sent out by the White House to stonewall media questions about the draft order was none other than Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a Christian-right political fixture who ran her fathers 2016 presidential campaign before joining Trumps when Huck dropped out after the Iowa caucuses. This is not an administration that will be even-handed on the conflict between LGBTQ and reproductive rights and the right to override them in the name of an angry God. Trump can provide happy talk all day long about his own supposed tolerance and social progressivism. But as he showed in finding a Scalia clone for SCOTUS and now in moving toward the widest possible validation of religious-based discrimination, he knows who butters his political bread, and he can be expected to continue to pay his debts to the cultural and religious right."}, {"date": "2017/02/02", "title": "The White House Has Thrown Out the Mooch", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/the-white-house-has-thrown-out-the-mooch.html", "text": " A gig as the White Houses intermediary between the business world and the Trump administration has fallen through for hedge funder Anthony Scaramucci, the New York Times says. Despite previous reports that the job was his, Scaramucci lost the post because of concerns over the recent sale of SkyBridge Capital, his hedge fund of hedge funds. At least thats the official line. Last month, Scaramucci sold a majority stake of SkyBridge to HNA Group, a Chinese company with deep ties to the Communist Party, that some think is trying to gain influence in the Trump administration. The White House Counsels Office was reportedly going to need three months to clear Scaramucci of potential ethical conflicts, and with his role unfilled, the story goes, Trump and company had to move on. If a newfound emphasis on ethical propriety seems surprising in the Trump White House, that could be because it may be a convenient cover story. According to multiple reports, Scaramucci was simply unwanted. Fox Business reported this week that he is a favorite of Steve Bannons but Trumps chief of staff Reince Priebus was pushing for continued vetting of his business ties. Scaramucci was also not getting along with Trump adviser and The Apprentice alum Omarosa Manigault. Priebus didnt just want more vetting for Scaramucci, he wanted the man known as the Mooch gone, Politico reports. It didnt have much to do with ethics, one person told Politico. Reince is trying to cut someone who has a direct line to Trump, the source said. Further support for that theory comes from Richard W. Painter, George W.

That was all America knew Monday morning: an act of violence with Muslim victims. The shooters identity was anybodys guess. So, the guessing began. Right-wing tabloids in Britain saw a Muslim killer, his mind warped by ancient sectarian hatreds. Fox News added details to this portrait, painting him a Moroccan immigrant who shouted Allahu akbar as he fired. Radio host John Cardillo predicted that these revelations would vindicate President Trump  and the refugee ban that the liberal media had spent all weekend decrying. Donald Trump Jr. appreciated that sentiment. White House press secretary Sean Spicer called the attack a terrible reminder of why the presidents immigration restrictions were so important. And then Canadian police named a white French-Canadian  whose Facebook likes included Marine Le Pen and Donald Trump  as their sole suspect. And the murders ceased to be a matter of political concern. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau condemned the shooting as a terrorist attack. The American president did no such thing. In fact, Trump released no formal statement on the subject  despite the fact that he had rarely missed an opportunity to comment on smaller-scale acts of violence perpetrated by Muslims in more distant lands. Trump once savaged Barack Obama for refusing to utter the phrase radical Islamic terrorism. He, and his GOP allies, accused the former president of putting political correctness above national security: Obama was too worried about offending his oversensitive constituents to confront the threat to our homeland. This critique was either cynical or mindless. The president explained, repeatedly, that his aversion to the phrase was not driven by the complaints of campus liberals, but by the advice of counterterrorism experts: Emphasizing the Islamic nature of the threat would alienate Muslim allies whose cooperation enhances our security. Against this cost, Republicans have never been able to name a concrete benefit of deploying their favorite phrase. Rather, they have insinuated that Obamas reluctance to confront Islamic extremism rhetorically betrayed his indifference to doing so militarily. This is a bizarre charge to level at a president who ordered ten times more aerial strikes against terror suspects in the Muslim world than did George W. Bush. But in the case of Donald Trump and white supremacist violence, the presidents reluctance to name the threat really does reflect a disinterest in combatting it. According to Reuters, the Trump administration wants the governments Countering Violent Extremism program to stop targeting neo-Nazis and focus exclusively on violent Islamists. The CVE program aims to deter lone-wolf terrorists by sponsoring community groups and educational programs that counter-message violent ideologies. Among the organizations currently receiving federal funds is Life After Hate, which works to rehabilitate white supremacists and other right-wing extremists. Trump wants the government to sever ties with such groups, and rename the program Countering Islamic Extremism, according to sources who spoke with the news wire. Even if one stipulates that federal resources should be devoted exclusively to countering radical Islam, this rebrand is foolish: The ostensible point of the program is to attract the cooperation of mainstream Muslim groups in deterring extremism within their communities. It is highly unlikely that such organizations would be more willing to work with the program if its name stigmatized their religion. And, in fact, the Trump administrations overt hostility to Islam has already cost it such cooperation. Per Reuters: Beyond its self-defeating aspects, Trumps exclusive focus on Islamic extremism is not consistent with a cold-eyed appraisal of the threats America faces. Since 9/11, right-wing extremists have murdered 50 Americans on U.S. soil. Before Omar Mateens mass murder in Orlando, that figure exceeded the post-9/11 domestic death toll from Islamic extremists. Of those killed by white reactionaries, 47 died after Barack Obamas election  an uptick anticipated by a 2009 report from the Department of Homeland Security. The DHS analysis warned that the combination of a weak economy and an African-American president was spurring a wave of white supremacist radicalization, which had made lone wolves and small terrorist cells embracing violent right-wing extremist ideology into the most dangerous domestic terrorism threat in the United States. But this idea offended the sensibilities of conservative media and elected officials. So the report was withdrawn. Two years later, the Washington Post reported that the analytical team behind the report had been effectively eviscerated. The most paranoid denizens of the far-right fever swamp claim that jihadists have infiltrated the American government  and that this was the true reason why Obama never condemned radical Islamic terrorism. There is no evidence for this charge  but there is considerable evidence that white supremacists have infiltrated American law enforcement. Or so says the FBI. Perhaps the strongest argument for focusing counterterrorism resources entirely on violent Islamists is that American white supremacists have never executed an attack on the scale of 9/11. But that isnt for lack of trying. In 1997, three Ku Klux Klan members plotted the bombing of a natural-gas plant outside Fort Worth, Texas. Had the local Klan leader not gotten cold feet  and reported the plan to the FBI  authorities believe as many as 30,000 could have been killed. In truth, President Trumps exclusive focus on Islamic terrorism is not about protecting national security, but about protecting white conservatives emotional security. It is about protecting the comfort one can find in imagining that evil is a quality exclusive to an alien other  and in dividing the world between the righteous, who look like us, and the wicked, who look like them; between Gods people and the barbarians; Judeo-Christian civilization and the Muslim hordes. But we cant allow conservatives to make the Pentagon their safe space. We cannot ignore the reality of evil to protect their tender illusions. We must say the words radical racist terrorism. We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore."}, {"date": "2017/02/02", "title": "Staten Island Chuck Doesnt See His Shadow, Claims Early Spring", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/staten-island-chuck-predicts-early-spring.html", "text": " The annual tradition of getting weather forecasts from small, furry mammals is here again, and, this year, New Yorks own Staten Island Chuck has predicted an early spring.

How to slash the top corporate tax rate from 39 to 20 percent, while keeping the overall tax plan revenue neutral. 2. How to throw president Trump a bone on trade protection without starting a trade war via heavy tariffs. Paul Ryans caucus found a magic bullet to slay both these quandaries: the border-adjustment tax (or BAT). Currently, the U.S. taxes corporations based on their net profits  regardless of where those profits are earned. With the BAT, we would stop taxing the profits that American firms make from overseas sales, and raise taxes on corporations that import a lot of goods, like retailers. In other words, it would shift the corporate tax system away from taxing production and toward taxing consumption. And since America consumes more than it produces, the proposal increases total revenue. This policy isnt without its virtues. For one thing, America is the only G7 country that taxes the overseas profits of its domestic firms, which puts our exporters at a competitive disadvantage. For another, since we cant actually collect on those foreign profits until American companies bring them back home, our current system creates an incentive for U.S. firms to hoard their profits abroad  or else relocate to a tax haven. The BAT would, ostensibly, eliminate both these problems. And, according to the policys partisans, the tax wouldnt actually raise the cost of imports for consumers, since cutting taxes on American exporters would spur a stronger dollar. Or, at least, thats how it would work in a world of perfectly functioning, frictionless markets. In our world, the picture is less rosy. As UC Davis economist Kaddie Russ notes, even if a stronger dollar fully offset the tax on imports, it would take a while for that equilibrium to be reached  specifically, at least two years, according to the latest economic literature. So, who would bear the burden of the BAT in that time period (and, forever after, if the theoretical model proves faulty)? According to Russs analysis: the poorest among us. Its possible that the BAT would provide the working poor  especially those who work for exporters  with wage gains big enough to offset the rise in consumer prices. But for the unemployed, including retirees (a.k.a. the GOP base), border-adjustment looks like bad news.This is a big problem for the GOP. The BAT already has powerful opponents. Walmart does not trust the abstract economic models. They think retailers and other importers are going to get hit hard by the BAT  and when they do, it will be the end of always low prices.And so, the two senators from Walmarts home state of Arkansas are already being pushed hard to oppose border-adjustment, according to Axios. Other GOP senators with big retailers in their states have already come out against the measure. With Republican lawmakers and Walton family money behind them, it shouldnt be hard for Democrats to make the idea of cutting taxes on corporations  and raising them on the poor and working class  an unpopular one. But without the BAT, the GOPs tax plan will add to the deficit. And if their plan adds to the deficit, then they cant pass it through the reconciliation process without putting a ten-year expiration date on it (which is what killed the Bush tax cuts).

Its previously anonymous author turns out to be former Bush administration speechwriter Michael Anton, reports Michael Warren. Anton is now working as a senior national security official in the Trump administration. Antons role in the administration lends his signature essay all the more importance as a statement of Trumpism. The essay has many interesting aspects, which made it the subject of fervent debate during the election. But its most notable characteristic is its almost textbook justification for authoritarianism. The premise of democracy is that  unlike dictatorships, in which the winning side gains total and essentially permanent power  the losers can accept defeat, because they know they have a chance to win subsequent elections. Without that predicate in place, the system collapses. Antons essay makes the case that conservatives should support Trump because, despite his manifest flaws, they cannot survive a single election defeat. Anton makes the case through the metaphor that carries his essay. Conservatives are like the passengers on Flight 93, an aircraft that has been hijacked by Al Qaeda terrorists and is headed for destruction. Anton presses home the motif through an evolving series of duplicative metaphors. 2016 is the Flight 93 election: charge the cockpit or you die, he begins. And then: If you dont try, death is certain. To compound the metaphor: a Hillary Clinton presidency is Russian Roulette with a semi-auto. And then: We are headed off a cliff. Switching from metaphors to direct argument, Anton predicts in the essay that a Hillary Clinton victory would usher in vindictive persecution against resistance and dissent. Anton describes the government (pre-Trump) as the junta. This cannot be dismissed as mere rhetorical exaggeration. To Anton, the rising share of the nonwhite population is a foreign invasion: The ceaseless importation of Third World foreigners with no tradition of, taste for, or experience in liberty means that the electorate grows more left, more Democratic, less Republican, less republican, and less traditionally American with every cycle, he writes. He describes the children of immigrants as ringers to form a permanent electoral majority. The racial and political implications of this argument are both clear and extreme: Anton believes the white Republican base is the only legitimate governing coalition. Democratic governments are inherently illegitimate by dint of their racial cast. Race is integral to Antons sense of his own persecution. He sees the enthusiasm for Trump among avowed white supremacists as more reason to support Trump: The Left was calling us Nazis long before any pro-Trumpers tweeted Holocaust denial memes, he argues. And how does one deal with a Nazi  that is, with an enemy one is convinced intends your destruction? You dont compromise with him or leave him alone. You crush him. It is a fascinating line of reasoning: There are Nazis supporting his chosen candidate, therefore the left will crush conservatives like Nazis, therefore his chosen candidates triumph is all the more necessary. If there is a single passage of the essay that most succinctly summarizes its case, it is this: I want my party to live. I want my country to live. I want my people to live. Anton equates all these things  his party, his country, and his people, insisting that four more years of a Democratic presidency will extinguish all three. This is a textbook example of the kind of reasoning, the conviction that a single election defeat will usher in permanent destruction, that liberal theorists see as inimical to democratic government. It would be a mistake to attribute too much power and influence to a single essay. The Flight 93 Election did not change very much. As I argued a few months ago, currents of authoritarianism have run through conservative thought for years. What Antons essay did was to synthesize and intellectualize the right-wing case against democracy and marshal it on behalf of the Republican party presidential nominee. And now that nominee has won, and his administration has appropriately brought onboard the author of authoritarianism."}, {"date": "2017/02/02", "title": "Conservatives Are Losing Their Base To Trump", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/conservatives-are-losing-their-base-to-trump.html", "text": " The announcement of Neil Gorsuch as SCOTUS nominee represented a new high point in Donald Trumps relationship with the conservative movement and the GOP. It was a full-on love-fest  and beyond the immediate and overwhelmingly positive response among right-of-center folk, the nomination has established significantly more trust for Trump among serious conservatives. But before mainstream Republicans get too comfortable with the 45th president, they should consider the bad news: That he is stealing their voter base away from them, even as they cheer him on for nominating Gorsuch. That is the most obvious lesson to derive from some new large-sample data from Morning Consult (via The Upshot): To put it simply, while Republicans may have assumed their most conservative base supporters would help them bend Donald Trump to their will when push came to shove, the opposite may prove true: the GOP base increasingly looks like it may become a whip with which Trump lashes establishment conservative elected officials and opinion-leaders to keep them in line. Its been true for quite some time that most Republicans in Congress feared primary challenges from their right more than anything Democrats could throw at them. What has changed is that the voters most likely to participate in Republican challenges seem to have fallen in love with Donald Trump, and could keep elected officials who previously thought themselves safe on their toes and ready to defend Trump even when long-cherished ideological tenets would otherwise have them supporting different policies. The alternative would be to likely face a primary challenge by a more robustly Trumpian politician, with the knowledge that the base would probably be with the populist. While its premature to predict the potentially wild course of events just ahead, friction between Trump and his party could be relatively manageable  and a visible schism might never open up between the president and the party mainstream. We could see an implicit deal where Trump gives the older forces in the GOP most of what they want on economic and fiscal policy so long as they go along with Trump on trade, immigration, crime, and maybe some token populist gestures like jobs initiatives or protecting Social Security and Medicare.They can probably reach rough agreement on most national security matters so long as defense spending goes up and the administration doesnt completely abandon Europe to Putin. But if there is a rupture that threatens the smooth-functioning machine Republicans need to enact an agenda with little or no Democratic support, dont assume Trump will have to come hat in hand to Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, or beg for support from conservative think-tanks or opinion outlets. If you look at how far most of them, from Fox News to Ted Cruz to the Wall Street Journal, have come in Trumps direction since they all mocked and defied him just a year ago, they may have to keep moving towards him, especially if their constituencies are already there."}, {"date": "2017/02/02", "title": "U.S. Military Sources Say Trump Approved Yemen Strike Without Enough Preparation", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/u-s-military-sources-criticize-trump-approved-yemen-strike.html", "text": " New questions have emerged about what went wrong in the U.S. military raid against Al Qaeda in Yemen last weekend. Chief Petty Officer William Ryan Owens, a Navy SEAL, was killed in the operation and three other U.S. service members were injured. Nawar Al-Awlaki, the 8-year-old daughter of American Al Qaeda leader Anwar Al-Awlaki, was also killed, and local reports say as many as 30 people died. The raid was the first operation approved by President Trump. Earlier this week, a senior military official told NBC News that almost everything went wrong during the mission. The aim was to detain Yemeni tribal leaders working with Al Qaeda and gather phones and computers that could yield intelligence. But Navy SEALS found themselves in an intense 50-minute firefight, with Al Qaeda fighters using women and children as cover, and some of the women firing at the commandos. Airstrikes were called in to take out the Al Qaeda fighters, and then two MV-22 Ospreys were sent in to extract the SEALs. One experienced a hard landing, injuring crew members, and the $75 million aircraft had to be destroyed by a precision-guided bomb to keep it from falling into enemy hands. Now several military officials are suggesting that President Trump was to blame. Per Reuters: U.S. Central Command spokesman Colonel John Thomas responded, CENTCOM asks for operations we believe have a good chance for success, and when we ask for authorization we certainly believe there is a chance of successful operations based on our planning. He also noted, Any operation where you are going to put operators on the ground has inherent risks. The Obama administration spent months planning the raid, but the New York Times reports that President Obama did not authorize the attack because the Pentagon wanted to conduct the attack on a moonless night, which wouldnt happen again during his term. One of the three officials told Reuters, The decision was made  to leave it to the incoming administration, partly in the hope that more and better intelligence could be collected. The Times said Trump decided to approve the raid during a dinner attended by Defense Secretary James Mattis, Vice-President Mike Pence, National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, and Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Top advisers Jared Kushner and Steven Bannon were also present. The Reuters report does not offer any more detail on whether the officials fault the Obama administration for inadequate prep work as well, or what exactly they think the Trump team should have done differently. But the Times notes that Flynn has said that it wants to speed the decision-making when it comes to such strikes, delegating more power to lower-level officials so that the military may respond more quickly. And the Pentagon has been working on plans to move faster against Al Qaeda in Yemen. Its significant that three military sources were willing to suggest President Trump was too hasty, particularly when the administration is having public disagreements with the State Department, the acting attorney general, and other public agencies. But so far its not clear what  if anything  could have been done to prevent the tragic events in Yemen."}, {"date": "2017/02/02", "title": "U.S.Australia Relationship Rocked by Trumps Angry Call With Prime Minister", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/u-s-australia-alliance-rocked-by-trumps-angry-call-to-pm.html", "text": " A report about heated remarks President Trump made to Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull during a Saturday phone call has sparked an incident with the close U.S. ally, and confusion over whether the U.S. will honor a refugee resettlement deal. Senior U.S. officials told the Washington Post that, after bragging about the size of his electoral college win, Trump lashed out at Turnbull when the latter tried to confirm that the U.S. would honor its commitment to take 1,250 refugees from an Australian detention center. Trump reportedly fumed, This is the worst deal ever, complaining that he was going to get killed politically and accusing Australia of trying to send over the next Boston bombers. When Turnbull suggested they move on to other topics, Trump ended the call. The discussion, which was expected to take an hour, lasted about 25 minutes. Trump reportedly told Turnbull that he had spoken with four other world leaders that day, and this was the worst call by far. The disagreement concerns about 2,500 mostly Muslim refugees who were rejected by Australia and are being held in facilities on New Guineas Manus Island and the island of Nauru. After human-rights organizations criticized the conditions in the detention centers, the Obama administration reached an agreement to settle about half of the refugees in the U.S. President Trumps order to temporarily ban refugees and certain immigrants from entering the U.S. raised questions about whether the agreement would be honored, since many of the refugees are from Iran, Iraq, Sudan, and Somalia. A line in the order says exceptions will be made for those authorized to enter the country under a preexisting international agreement, but Trump was still unhappy about the deal. He reportedly told Turnbull, I dont want these people, and repeatedly said the U.S. had agreed to take 2,000 refugees, when the number is actually 1,250. Trump said it was his intention to honor the deal, but warned that they would be subjected to extreme vetting. Under the terms of the deal, the U.S. does not have to accept any refugees who fail the usual vetting processes for those trying to enter the U.S. The initial White House readout on the call said that the two leaders merely emphasized the enduring strength and closeness of the U.S.Australia relationship that is critical for peace, stability, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and globally. A separate AP report on Wednesday, which was based on a readout written by White House aides, suggested that Trump threatened to send U.S. troops into Mexico during a call with President Enrique Pea Nieto. According to a transcript of the call obtained by CNN, Trump actually offered to help Nieto with the drug cartels, saying, You have some pretty tough hombres in Mexico that you may need help with. We are willing to help with that big-league, but they have to be knocked out and you have not done a good job knocking them out. The Post report sparked an uproar in Australia, and there were mixed signals from U.S. and Australian officials on the status of the refugee resettlement deal. At first, Turnbull said Trump assured me that he would continue with the resettlement, but declined to confirm other details about the call. Then the U.S. embassy in Canberra issued this statement, referring to previous assurances made by White House press secretary Sean Spicer: About an hour and 40 minutes later, President Trump contradicted the State Department on Twitter, saying he was still considering this dumb deal to take in thousands of illegal immigrants. (As the Guardian notes, under international and Australian law, its not illegal for refugees seeking asylum to arrive in a foreign country without the proper documents.) In radio interviews, Turnbull said the U.S.Australia alliance is absolutely rock-solid, it is so strong, and stressed that President Trump had personally committed to preserving the agreement. When Sydneys 2GB radio asked if hed seen the tweet, he said, Well, that is his tweet. Im telling you whats been said to us. The Australian opposition leader criticized Turnbull for not being more open about his interaction with President Trump, but a cabinet minister tried to put a positive spin on the incident. Malcolm has stood up for Australia  he actually had a row with the president of the United States and he hasnt crowed about it. He has since gotten on with the job, the minister told the Sydney Morning Herald. We are offended, but as long as these people [refugees] get off Manus and Nauru, thats the main thing. Im confident the deal will be honored; this is part of the process. Trump is trying to get the message out that he hates the deal but cant do anything about it. According to the paper, some in Canberra are speculating that White House adviser Steve Bannon leaked details about the call so Trump can say he grudgingly accepted a deal that goes against the spirit of his immigration order. Malcolm Davis, a senior defense analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute  an independent, nonpartisan think tank  told the paper that Australians need to figure out how to preserve their alliance with the U.S., regardless of the presidents intentions. For this to happen is unconscionable. I think that probably where we need to take this is [to] rise above it, make sure we dont let this derail a vital relationship, because its too important to let go, he said.

The New York Times reports that in a series of interviews, which were at times moody and meandering, Dr. Bornstein revealed that Trump takes Propecia to promote hair growth. The presidents use of the prostate-related drug explains why he had such low levels of prostate-specific antigen, a marker for prostate cancer, in health data Dr. Bornstein released during the campaign. Dr. Bornstein takes the drug as well. He has all his hair, he said. I have all my hair. Dr. Bornstein told the paper that Trump also takes antibiotics to control rosacea, a statin for elevated blood cholesterol and lipids, and a daily baby aspirin to reduce his risk of a heart attack. In addition to the potential HIPAA violation, Dr. Bornstein shared a weird observation about the presidents behavior during his exams: And he complained that he had a bad experience at the inauguration: Dr. Bornstein said he recently told Trumps secretary, Rhona Graff, You know, I should be the White House physician.

In that role, he brokered deals with foreign governments  often repressive ones  to secure his companys access to oil and gas. Among Tillersons most ambitious deals was an agreement he struck with Vladmir Putin that allowed Exxon to extract Russias reserves of Arctic oil (which, thanks to climate change, are a lot more accessible than they used to be!). That whole project got iced by Americas sanctions on Russia, following the latters invasion of Crimea. But now, Tillerson is in a position to thaw that rift.

Today: the presidents SCOTUS pick, Paul Ryans support for Trumps executive order on immigration, and Samantha Bees alternative White House Correspondents Dinner. Donald Trump has selected Neil Gorsuch, an originalist in the model of the late Justice Scalia, to fill Merrick Garlands stolen seat on the Supreme Court. How should the Democrats respond to the nomination?The Trump administration is still less than two weeks old, but based on what weve seen so far, the verdict is in: It has no respect for the Constitution, for the officials and institutions essential to a functioning democratic government, even for the most fundamental American freedoms granted to religious minorities and the press. The Trump White House has if anything declared war on American governance itself, all to facilitate the birth of a new political order guided by the ideas of Steve Bannon, until recently the proprietor of a white-nationalist fake-news organization, and Jeff Sessions, the attorney generaldesignate who has tried but not succeeded in covering up his past as a stalwart opponent of civil rights in Alabama. At a time like this, it is clearly incumbent upon Democrats in Washington to oppose, obstruct, or resist every presidential action they can. Their constituents, many of whom were less than enamored with the Clinton party Establishment that fell to Trump, have had enough and are taking to the streets. The burden is on the partys leaders, such as they are, to catch up. Otherwise they might as well just go out of business. In the case of Trumps Supreme Court nominee, its a no-brainer: It is not hyperbole to say that the Republican Senate majority stole a Supreme Court appointment from President Obama on the spurious grounds that he only had a year left in his presidency when Scalia died. The Democrats can argue no less spuriously that a president who lost the popular vote lacks the standing to fill that same seat. So, what is the argument for Senate Democrats behaving better than their GOP peers? The case was made by the Washington Post editorial page, the most prominent Beltway champion of bipartisanship in a capital where there hasnt been bipartisanship in the two decades since the Bill Clinton impeachment. In urging the Democrats to practice due deference to Trumps nominee, the Post warned that fierce opposition might provoke the Republicans to resort to the so-called nuclear option of abolishing the filibuster so that a Supreme Court nominee could be approved by a simple majority of 51 votes rather than 60. If the GOP did this, the Post explained, it would leave Democrats disarmed of that weapon against a second Trump pick should another vacancy arrive during his presidency. How nave can you be? The Senate Republicans would happily invoke the nuclear option for the second Trump pick if it doesnt do so with Gorsuch. Theres no rationale for Democrats engaging in premature unilateral disarmament. The GOP will stop at nothing to install Trumps court nominees, so the Democrats might as well stand up and fight from the get-go. The Posts other argument is that Democratic mobilization against a Trump nominee would deepen the harmful politicization that is afflicting the Senatorial process of advise-and-consent. How much deeper could that politicization be than it already is? The Democrats, President Obama included, got nowhere by trying to make nice with the Party of No for the past eight years. From the day Obama entered the White House, the GOP did everything it could to try to delegitimize his presidency, ultimately to rally around a presidential candidate who was a leader of the birther movement. That candidate, as president, now dismisses Democratic leaders like Chuck Schumer as clowns. It is no time for a pacifist response. In any case, the approval process for Gorsuch has already been politicized by Trump. His decision to announce his nominee to the court in prime time  before an audience of cheering toadies more appropriate to So You Think You Can Dance  reduced Gorsuch to the stature of a supplicant at a corrupt royal court. When Trump referred to the late, great Justice Scalia in his remarks, he was using language youd expect to hear from a Vegas lounge singer paying homage to Sinatra. All that was missing was a reprise of Trumps chosen inaugural-ball anthem, My Way  though, contrary to that songs lyric, the end is not near, alas. After silence in the face of nationwide protests and pushback on both sides of the aisle, and despite speaking out against a Muslim ban when Trump proposed it on the campaign trail, Speaker Paul Ryan has come out in support of Trumps executive action on immigration (though he admitted the rollout was regrettable). Is he making a mistake?As I and others have been saying ad infinitum, Paul Ryan is the leading Vichy Republican, a coward who will do anything to hold on to power. His Hamlet-like equivocations about Trump during the campaign always ended with capitulation. This surrender was just more of the same  he once again weighed in late, with trying-to-have-it-both-ways language, and with no discernible moral compass. Is he making a mistake? Not with the Trump base he is terrified by and panders to. Polls show that the overwhelming majority of Republicans  80 per cent-plus  still approve of Trump. But when the wind changes, you can bet Ryan will change with it. Though hes fond of releasing lofty policy prescriptions laced with cooked numbers, his only real concerns are politics and self-preservation. Can anyone name a single accomplishment he has achieved in office that befits his august station of Speaker of the House? Samantha Bee announced an alternative gala to the White House Correspondents Dinner  to be held in Washington on the same night, of April 29  partly, she says, out of a concern that the main event would be canceled this year. Does this increase or decrease the odds of that happening?We can only hope that Bees alternative gala  which will offer better comedy and attract a superior audience both in the flesh and among television viewers  will force the White House Correspondents Dinner to cancel despite its claim that its own show will go on. This annual rite has been an embarrassment for a couple of decades: a cheesy spectacle in which prominent journalists can be found sucking up to their official sources, to corporate patrons who shell out for the high-priced tables, and to show-business celebrities, not all of whom are of the first or even second tier. When a comedian hired to host the event actually draws blood from the dais with satirical darts  as Stephen Colbert most famously did in 2006  the easily affronted audience sulks and whines and never quite grasps the fact that the joke is on them. Some presidents, most especially Obama in his now historic takedown of Trump, make the best of their coerced appearances there. But few, if any, of them have liked having to show up. Until this president. The Correspondents Dinner is tailor-made for Trump; hell bend it easily to his will because the one subject he knows something about is show business, a trade about which the Washington-press types who run the event are utterly clueless. One way or another Trump will manipulate and usurp the night to his own advantage. The White House Correspondents Association should not give him the platform to do so. Theres another reason the dinner should bite the dust. The real-news industry is under siege as never before in modern America. Steve Bannon has defamed the media as the opposition party and, in league with the legions of fake news purveyors, is doing everything he can to undermine the presss credibility as well as to brand it as an elitist cartel out of touch with the country it covers. The sight of Wolf Blitzer posing on a red carpet, or of a newspaper reporter yukking it up with Kendall Jenner, plays directly into Bannons hands. In announcing that the dinner will go on despite the competition from Bees counter-fest, the correspondents association cited the fact that it gives awards to promising young student journalists as part of each years festivities. Its pathetic that it is using innocent students as a beard to justify its unseemly bacchanal. The money the association will save by canceling the dinner should be donated to a legal-defense fund for the journalists certain to be battling the Trump administrations efforts to roll back the First Amendment in the years to come."}, {"date": "2017/02/01", "title": "Gorsuch Could Give WASPs Representation on SCOTUS Again", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/gorsuch-could-give-wasps-representation-on-scotus-again.html", "text": " There has been much talk since Donald Trumps nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court about the choice thrilling conservative evangelical activists. I wonder how many of those happy, religiously oriented Court-watchers knew Gorsuch was a fellow Protestant Christian who would, if confirmed, break an odd duopoly that Roman Catholics and Jews have had on the Court since 2010. Thats right: Since John Paul Stevens retired from the Court in 2010, the Court has been bereft of WASPs, or any sort of Protestants. From then until Antonin Scalias death, there were six Catholics (Alito, Kennedy, Roberts, Scalia, Sotomayor, and Thomas) and three Jews (Breyer, Ginsburg, and Kagan) on SCOTUS. So there will still be a Catholic majority no matter what happens to Gorsuch, but it will be diminished if he gets through the Senate as most people expect. The new nominee does not, however, belong to an evangelical church. He belongs, like Donald Trump, to one of those much-despised-and-derided-by-conservatives mainline Protestant denominations; while Trump is a Presbyterian, Gorsuch is an Episcopalian. In fact, Gorsuch would be the 34th Episcopalian to serve on the Court, reflecting that faith communitys once-dominant position among white American elites. If there are any Catholics out there upset about one of their co-religionists being replaced by a Protestant, they may be comforted that Gorsuch went to a Jesuit prep school before decamping to the Ivy League for his postsecondary education. The apparent lack of interest in Gorsuchs personal faith affiliation among conservatives most interested in faith is a sign of the extent to which the Christian Right has itself become secularized. What you do on the Sabbath matters little to them so long as you are willing to fight against reproductive rights, anti-discrimination policies, and threats to those God has blessed with great wealth."}, {"date": "2017/02/01", "title": "Steve Bannon Sees Himself As Thomas Cromwell. Will His Head End Up on a Spike?", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/what-it-means-that-bannon-sees-himself-as-thomas-cromwell.html", "text": " In the wake of the travel ban crisis engineered by presidential chief strategist Stephen Bannon and his sidekick Stephen Miller, inquiring minds are looking back at a rare moment of self-revelation by Bannon in the immediate wake of Trumps shocking November victory. It was an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in which Bannon (interrupted occasionally by hat-in-hand supplicants like Ted Cruz) gloated over the defeat of his political adversaries in both parties and predicted a populist-nationalist realignment that would enable people like him to govern for 50 years. When in appeared in mid-November, The Hollywood Reporter piece mainly drew attention for Bannons assertion that Trump would propose a huge infrastructure investment program that would scandalize conservatives. But in the wake of the chaos Bannon helped produce in the first days of the Trump administration, the Washington Post has taken a fresh look at the November interview and other past Bannon statements to discern his world view. What jumps out at you now is the former Breitbart executives understanding of his role and Trumps. Heres a key passage from The Hollywood Reporter article: Its not surprising, then, that Bannon identifies with another historical figure who guided a famously erratic prince toward revolutionary goals: Cromwell, for a time Henry VIIIs chancellor and chief adviser, has gained fresh fame on both sides of the Atlantic via Hilary Mantels trilogy of sympathetic novels, the first of which (Wolf Hall) was turned into an award-winning public-television mini-series starring Mark Rylance as Cromwell and Damian Lewis as his moody monarch. The traditional view of Cromwell was as an evil influence on Henry, exploiting the kings sexual and financial lusts to gain vast power, leading to the despoliation of the monasteries and the vainglorious elevation of Henry into the head of both church and state. Mantel dissents by taking seriously Cromwells own Protestant religious convictions, and views him more as a tragic figure who was ultimately outmaneuvered by conservative rivals and ungratefully sacrificed by Henry in one of his trademark changes of direction. But most everyone agrees Cromwell was both the architect and the victim of royal power. And thats what makes Bannons identification with Cromwell fascinating, as noted by the great historian of the Tudor Reformation, Diarmaid MacCullough, interviewed by the Post for insights into the Trump Court: As Bannon surely knows, Cromwell wound up with his head on a pike, not that long after he engineered the trumped-up treason trial and execution of Queen Anne Boleyn. Though, of course, the Reformation did eventually take permanent root in England through Annes daughter Elizabeth. If Trump ever turns on Stephen Bannon  perhaps, as with Henry, at the behest of powerful conservative clans who convince him the loyal underling is undermining his power  he will have a less bloody end than Cromwell. His legacy is far less certain, beyond the agony he has already inflicted on thousands of people (and the furor he probably welcomed) with the travel ban. The reversal of Americas demographic trends away from the traditional hegemony of Europeans is probably beyond Bannons reach, or Trumps. But Bannon may be right that the violent cleavages he has promoted are here for a good while. Theres a reason we are still arguing about Cromwell and Henry VIII."}, {"date": "2017/02/01", "title": "WATCH: Who Is Neil Gorsuch, President Trumps Supreme Court Nominee?", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/who-is-president-trumps-scotus-nominee-neil-gorsuch.html", "text": "  Dont worry.

To scroll through your Facebook feed is to be reminded that a racist clown has the nuclear codes; America is soul-sick; and the moral arc of the universe bends toward the sun swallowing the Earth. Even when the monotonous parade of terrible developments is broken up by a feel-good story, the effect can feel akin to lighting a single stick of incense in a room where Steve Bannons morning breath is forever flowing through the vents. Take the protests that broke out at airports all across the country last weekend. The Trump administration came for the refugees, and the American people spoke out. At JFK International in New York, thousands gathered outside Terminal 4 to show their support for those being detained. Within hours, a court order had provided a measure of relief to a small subset of those affected by the White Houses mindless cruelty. As the protestors celebrated, it was possible to believe that the authors of this fiasco might pay dearly for it. And then, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 49 percent of Americans agreed with Trumps executive order, while only 41 percent disagreed. So, no question, the state of the union is weak as hell. The stench of Bannon breath is overwhelming. But theres reason to think that the seeds those protestors planted will eventually allow liberals to smell the flowers. The first wave of anti-Trump actions may not have freed America from the spell of post-9/11, anti-Muslim fearmongering. But it did inspire Democrats to increase their political involvement  while also securing more than twice as much popular support as the tea party had in April 2010. A Washington Post-ABC News poll finds that 57 percent of the public heard a lot about the Womens March  a result that suggests the anti-Trump demonstrators attracted as much attention in a single day of protests as the tea party movement did through months of organizing and demonstrations. Polls from Pew Research Center in 2010 found that just 31 percent of voters had heard a lot about the right-wing movement in March of that year, with awareness of the group reaching a peak of 54 percent, just before the midterm elections in October. And the Womens March didnt just make a bigger impression than the tea party  they also made a better one. As liberals are painfully aware, being more popular with the public is no guarantee of electoral success. After all, nonvoters are disproportionately Democratic. To make America already great again, liberals wont just need to win over a majority of voters  theyll also need to mobilize them, starting in the 2018 midterms. But the Post poll has excellent news on that front, too: 40 percent of Democratic women say they plan to get more involved in political causes this year. Only 25 percent of all American adults, and 27 percent of Democratic men (sigh), say the same. Democrats under 50  particularly those who lean left  are also planning to step up their game in large numbers. The tea party had some advantages that the anti-Trump left lacks  among them, the Koch networks vast resources and the fact that conservative, white, middle-class retirees have more free time to spend on politics than your average, non-old Democrat. But todays left has its own strengths. Its enemy is the least popular new president in American history; it has years of organizing by Black Lives Matter, Occupy Wall Street, and other Obama-era social movements to build on; and its policy goals are more appealing and coherent than Keep the government out of my Medicare. Theres a lot of bad news coming down the pike. But if liberals can find in it cause for mobilization  instead of demoralization  theyll have a lot of happy headlines to read in November 2018."}, {"date": "2017/02/01", "title": "Senate Democrats Are Speaking Out Against Trumps Muslim Ban", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/democrats-are-speaking-out-against-trumps-muslim-ban.html", "text": "  Dont worry.

The What the fuck, Chuck? rally, as some demonstrators called it, started in Brooklyn Grand Army Plaza, near Prospect Park. The crowd, chanting and waving signs, marched from Grand Army to Schumers luxury building on Prospect Park West. So large was the crowd, not all the demonstrators could fit on the sidewalk outside the Minority Leaders windows, but those that did manage to get close unfurled a huge banner that read, Resist Trump Tuesdays. Schumer said Monday  citing the presidents executive order that temporarily suspended travel from majority Muslim countries and halted the refugee program  that he would oppose most of the rest of Trumps cabinet picks, and seek to delay the remaining confirmations. Still, Schumer did vote in favor of three of Trumps choices, among them Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. On Tuesday night, Schumer, along with other Democrats, did criticize Trumps Supreme Court pick Neil Gorsuch. The senator also put out a statement that hinted Democrats might filibuster Trumps nominee. Maybe all those signs and spines are getting through."}, {"date": "2017/02/01", "title": "The White House Has Cut Off CNN", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/the-white-house-has-cut-off-cnn.html", "text": " President Trump and his team at the White House are giving CNN the silent treatment, refusing to send official spokespeople on the network in what one reporter says is an attempt to push down the networks ratings. An unnamed White House official confirmed the CNN boycott to Politico, but was less blunt about the reason: Administration officials are still answering the questions of CNN reporters and White House press secretary Sean Spicer is still calling on CNN at briefings. But the last time an administration official appeared on the news network was January 11, when Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway was on Anderson Coopers show, Politico says. That was the same day that Trump blew up on CNN reporter Jim Acosta at his first and only press conference as a president-elect. As New York previously reported, the drama between CNN and Trump goes back to the presidents relationship with network head Jeff Zucker, who Trump believes has personally betrayed him. Trumps tiff with CNN recalls the tense relationship between Fox News and the Obama administration, which came to a head in 2009. While the White House never froze out Fox, it did try to leave the network out of certain interviews, which drew protests from the other TV news networks. Obamas choice of invective against Fox News  operating, basically, as a talk-radio format  was also not quite as pointed as Trumps repeated cries of CNN being fake news."}, {"date": "2017/02/01", "title": "What President Trumps Executive Orders Could Actually Do", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/what-president-trumps-executive-orders-could-actually-do.html", "text": " President Trump spent his first days in office chaotically unveiling executive orders in an effort to prove hes making good on his campaign promises. Judging from the stream of unsettling headlines, Trump dealt serious blows to Obamacare, sanctuary cities, and immigration policy  all while obsessively poring over photos of the crowd at his inauguration. While Trumps orders have led to protests, widespread confusion, and the detention of many people trying to enter the U.S., upon closer examination, he did not instantly undo major elements of the Obama administration with just a few strokes of his pen. The documents were drafted primarily by Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller, the Breitbart faction of Trumps advisers. Since they consulted with virtually no one, some of the orders are vague, legally questionable, or even impossible to carry out. Heres what Trumps first executive orders might actually do. Note: This post was originally published on January 27, 2017. It has been updated to include Trumps most recent executive orders. What Trump ordered: He suspended the resettlement of refugees in the U.S. for four months, ostensibly to give federal agencies time to develop enhanced vetting procedures. Syrian refugees are banned indefinitely. There is also an exemption for religious minorities facing persecution by their governments, and Trump said in an interview that Christians would receive preferential treatment. The order also bars immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries  Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen  for 90 days. It applies to people who hold dual citizenship with those countries and another nation. There were contradictory messages from the Trump administration about whether the order applied to green-card holders. Initially, the Department of Homeland Security said the ban did apply to U.S. permanent residents from those seven countries; then, one day later, the White House said green-card holders were exempt, though they may have to undergo additional screening. Can he do that? The courts will decide. Over the weekend, federal judges in five states blocked the removal or detention of those who were in transit when the order went into effect. Four states  Washington, New York, Massachusetts, and Virginia  are involved in lawsuits that argue the order is unconstitutional. On Monday, acting attorney general Sally Yates advised the Justice Department not to enforce the new measures, saying it wasnt clear that the order was legally defensible. Trump responded by firing Yates from her post, saying the Obama administration holdover  in charge until Jeff Sessionss confirmation  had betrayed the DOJ. The president, however, does have broad powers to regulate immigration  and there is good reason to think that this temporary order is just a first step in Trumps plan to use those powers aggressively. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows the president to bar any immigrants he considers detrimental to the interests of the United States. But experts say the order, which did not go through the normal vetting process, may violate federal and constitutional law. For starters, the Immigration and Nationality Act also states that no person shall receive any preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the persons race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence. That applies only to green-card holders, not refugees hoping to come to the U.S. What Trump ordered: Its typical for presidents to issue orders reorganizing the National Security Council at the start of their term, but putting a political adviser on the Principals Committee is not. While presidents usually want to show that theyre not letting politics affect national security decisions, Trump made Bannon a regular attendee of the Committee, an interagency forum for considering national security issues. Can he do that? Yes. A tweet by Jonathan Alter sparked reports that an obscure law required Bannon to be confirmed by the Senate, but Harvard law professor Larry Tribe told Snopes thats a misreading of the law. He explained that Bannon has not been made a member of the NSC itself  hes just been invited to attend meetings of the Principals Committee: Tribe said he thinks Bannons role is crazy and dangerous, but it doesnt appear to violate the law  though it probably should. Meanwhile, Trump downgraded the director of National Intelligence and the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to being optional members. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer pushed back against criticism of this move, saying the two officials are at every NSC meeting and are welcome to attend the Principals meetings as well. What Trump ordered: Hours after his inauguration, Trump signed an executive order declaring that his administration will take all actions consistent with the law to ease the burden of Obamacare. It instructs the heads of all executive departments and agencies to exercise all authority and discretion available to them to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay parts of the Affordable Care Act that put financial burdens on individuals, health-care providers, or states. Can he do that? Yes, but its not clear what that is. Only Congress can repeal the Affordable Care Act, but the Trump administration can severely weaken the law by changing how its carried out. The Incidental Economist blog compiled a long list of administrative changes that could be made to the law immediately, from reducing reinsurance payments to insurers, to removing the requirement that health plans cover all forms of contraceptive. Trump is reportedly mulling whether to kill the individual mandate, which could send the individual-health-insurance market into the proverbial death spiral. The secretary of Health and Human Services can grant hardship exemptions from the mandate using any criteria he or she wants. That means that, without touching the law itself, the Trump administration could effectively kill the individual mandate by granting an exception to everyone. As FiveThirtyEight notes, Trump HHS secretary pick Tom Price could have done this even before Trump issued his order, but in case there was any question, the folks at HHS now have their bosses itemized list of priorities. Of course, Price hasnt even been confirmed yet, so it may be weeks before we know what the Trump administration will actually do to the ACA. What Trump ordered: He reinstated and expanded the Mexico City policy, also known as the global gag rule, which stipulates that foreign nongovernmental organizations that promote or provide abortion cannot receive U.S. federal aid. Previously, the policy only applied to groups that receive U.S. family-planning funding, but Trumps version applies to organizations that get global health money as well. Can he do that? Yes. Ronald Reagan implemented the policy in 1985, and its subsequently been rescinded by every Democratic president and restored by every Republican president. Mark J. Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University, argued in The Hill that this showcases the troubles with governing by executive order, but its generally accepted that every president will change the Mexico City policy upon taking office. The Kaiser Family Foundation explains that Congress could step in, but obviously thats not going to happen with Republicans in control: What Trump ordered: He signed a brief presidential memorandum declaring that the U.S. is withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and that his administration intends to deal directly with individual countries on a one-on-one (or bilateral) basis in negotiating future trade deals. Can he do that? Yes. The TPP was never ratified by Congress, so Trumps order was mostly symbolic. The 11 other countries say they want to salvage the deal, but it would have to be revamped significantly and would have much less weight without the U.S. What Trump ordered: As part of two sweeping executive orders on immigration, Trump said his administration intends to secure the southern border of the United States through the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border. Can he do that? Not without help from Congress. Republican lawmakers believe the president has the authority to construct the wall under the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which called for the construction of at least 700 miles of physical barrier along the southern border. The fence was never completed, and the Homeland Security secretary could interpret physical barrier to mean a big, beautiful concrete wall. But the wall could cost as much as $20 billion, and Trump cant come up with that money on his own. He ordered the Department of Homeland Security to look for available funds within its $41 billion annual budget, but the House and Senate appropriations committees would have to approve an internal reallocation of money, and it still wouldnt be enough to fund the entire project. Luckily for Trump, congressional Republicans are willing to put a massive amount of U.S. taxpayer money toward the project. House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday that Congress intends to fund the wall through a supplemental appropriations bill in the spring. When pressed on how theyd make Mexico pay for it, GOP leaders suggested theyd leave that to Trump. We intend to address the wall issue ourselves and the president can deal with his relations with other countries on that issue and others, said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. What Trump ordered: His two executive orders on border security said he is terminating the policy known as catch and release, in which people caught crossing the border illegally are freed, pending hearings. In order to hold and process them, Trump called for the construction of new detention facilities, the hiring of 5,000 additional Border Patrol agents, and 10,000 additional U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers. Can he do that? The cost and logistics are daunting. Reuters reports that in the last three months of 2016, 136,670 people were caught crossing the border, and about 48 percent were unaccompanied children or families with children. Existing facilities have about 34,000 beds. Trumps order directs his cabinet secretaries to take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately construct, operate, control, or establish contracts to construct, operate, or control facilities to detain aliens at or near the land border with Mexico. But he wont find the money needed for such an enormous undertaking without approval from Congress. Politico did some rough math, and concluded that Trumps immigration proposals could increase federal spending by $13 billion a year, not including the wall. The combined budgets for ICE and border protection in 2016 came to $19.4 billion. John Sandweg, who was acting director of ICE in 2013 and 2014, estimated that Trumps plan would require four or five times as many detention beds per day, which would cost $10 billion annually. Hiring another 10,000 ICE agents could cost $3.9 billion a year, and adding 5,000 Border Patrol agents could add $900 million annually. Immigration courts are already severely backlogged, and its illegal to keep children in immigration detention indefinitely. Even if Congress gave Trump the money, the time and effort it would take to establish new detention centers, train new officers, and fend off legal challenges would be enormous. I just view this as a political document more than anything, Sandweg said of the executive orders. What Trump ordered: Cities and counties that limit their cooperation with federal immigration officials are not eligible to receive federal grants, except as deemed necessary for law-enforcement purposes. As Vox notes, nothing has been defunded yet: Can he do that? Its unclear, and it would take a massive legal battle to find out. The Trump administration could try to sue the cities for violating federal law, but the federal government cant force state and local law enforcement to enforce federal law. In 2014, a federal appeals court ruled that local police do not have to hold undocumented immigrants for ICE agents. The Trump administration could try to coerce sanctuary cities into following the law by withholding certain federal grant money. Some federal money is distributed by Congress, but Republicans may go along with Trumps effort. Several Republican lawmakers have tried to pass laws that would cut money for sanctuary cities in recent years. Even if Congress doesnt approve, the Trump administration could withhold the grants administered by federal agencies, potentially cutting off funding for various local programs. Mayors from several cities  including New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles  have already vowed to stand up to Trumps crackdown on sanctuary cities, but on Thursday, Miami-Dade County mayor Carlos Gimenez signed an executive order ordering his corrections department to comply with all ICE requests. He said his county cant afford to lose out on the $355 million its set to receive in federal funding next year. What Trump ordered: He reversed decisions made by the Obama administration by inviting the TransCanada Corporation to promptly resubmit its application to build the Keystone XL pipeline, and directing the Army to review and approve in an expedited manner the last section of the Dakota Access pipeline. He told reporters he would renegotiate some of the terms and ordered his secretary of commerce to develop a plan to ensure that all of the pipelines are built and repaired using U.S.-made steel. Can he do that?: Trump can help advance the pipeline projects, but even he acknowledged that it wasnt a sure thing. Well see if we can get that pipeline built, he said. A lot of jobs. Renegotiating the terms of the deals would be a lengthy and legally questionable process  plus he would have to contend with the environmentalists and Native American rights activists protesting the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline. Legal experts tell CNN that the executive order may also violate the constitutional right to due process and the Establishment Clause. While the order says nothing about banning Muslims, Trump and his surrogates have made public comments suggesting that was the aim. The courts could rule that the order discriminates on the basis of national origin or religion, while offering no rational justification for why people from the seven countries pose a particular terror threat. Trade-policy experts have criticized the order that the pipelines be constructed from U.S.-made material, as it would violate international trade laws that say a government cant treat foreign and domestic companies differently. First of all, this is private investment, so theres no legal authority for the government to require a private company to use domestic materials, Dan Ikenson, director of the Cato Institutes Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, tells CNBC. Is it good policy to have the president dictate where U.S. companies buy their inputs? No. I think thats terrible. I think thats dictatorial. I think its very bad precedence."}, {"date": "2017/02/01", "title": "Trumps Trip to Milwaukee Canceled Over Planned Protest: Report", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-milwaukee-trip-canceled-over-planned-protest-report.html", "text": " So far, massive protests have been a regular feature of Donald Trumps presidency, but Harley-Davidson was reportedly uninterested in being the site of the presidents first out-of-state encounter with the demonstrators. An administration official told CNN that President Trump was set to visit a Harley-Davidson factory in Milwaukee on Thursday, but the trip was called off after the company decided it didnt want to deal with a planned protest. The White House announced the visit to Milwaukee on Monday, but did not give a specific location. Technical Sergeant Meghan Skrepenski, with the 128th Air Refueling Wing of the Air National Guard in Milwaukee, confirmed to the AP on Tuesday that the trip was canceled. Trump was expected to sign executive orders related to manufacturing during the trip. The group Milwaukee Coalition Against Trump said it organized a call-in protest to Harley-Davidson after learning that Trump would tour the companys plant in Menomonee Falls. By Tuesday afternoon, 1,200 people said on the groups Facebook page that they were planning to protest outside the plant on Thursday. Harley-Davidson issued a statement on Tuesday saying they dont have, nor did we have, a scheduled visit from the president this week at any of our facilities. The statement noted that the company has hosted three of the last five presidents, and said, We look forward to hosting the president in the future. A White House spokesperson denied that the visit was called off because of the planned demonstration. Due to scheduling, the leadership he was potentially traveling to meet with is now coming here, said Deputy Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham. Members of the Milwaukee Coalition Against Trump, who were marching against the immigration ban on Tuesday, cheered when they heard the news. Hes not welcome in this state, Maricela Aguilar Monroy told Fox 6 Now. Van Mobley, president of the Village of Thiensville, Wisconsin, laughed at the suggestion that a demonstration could keep the president away.

After boycotting votes on two of President Trumps cabinet nominees earlier in the day, a handful of Democratic senators announced  immediately after Trump revealed his Supreme Court pick  that they have no intention of voting for Neil Gorsuch. Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon said on Monday that he would filibuster anyone who is not Merrick Garland, who was nominated by President Obama but never even given a hearing. Following Trumps reveal, Merkley vowed to do everything in his power to stop the stolen seat from being filled by an illegitimate and extreme nominee, though he did not mention Gorsuch by name. Ohio senator Sherrod Brown said hed already reviewed Gorsuchs record, and wont support a nominee who does not recognize that corporations are not people. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts pointed to issues with Gorsuchs record as well, saying, We dont need another justice who spends his time looking out for those with money and influence. Her fellow Massachusetts senator Ed Markey said Gorsuch is outside the judicial mainstream, and hell vote against him because his opinions have demonstrated hostility to womens reproductive rights, commonsense environmental regulations, and the rights of workers, consumers, and the disabled. Oregon senator Ron Wyden announced his opposition in a series of tweets, saying none of his colleagues should back Gorsuch if they believe individual rights are reserved to the people, not the government. At least a dozen other Democratic senators released statements criticizing Gorsuch, though they stopped short of a commitment to vote against him. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also issued a statement on Tuesday night suggesting that Democrats will filibuster a Supreme Court nominee for only the second time in modern history. The Senate must insist upon 60 votes for any Supreme Court nominee, a bar that was met by each of President Obamas nominees, he said. The burden is on Judge Neil Gorsuch to prove himself to be within the legal mainstream and, in this new era, willing to vigorously defend the Constitution from abuses of the executive branch. Assuming all 52 Republicans support Gorsuch, they would need eight Democratic votes to break the filibuster. According to The Hill, seven Senate Democrats have publicly expressed reservations about their colleagues plan to block his confirmation, suggesting that they shouldnt force Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to nuke the filibuster. Gorsuch will almost certainly wind up on the Supreme Court, but if Democrats dont put up a fight, they could face a backlash from their base. Several liberal groups, including MoveOn.org and Democracy for America, are promising to oppose any senator who doesnt do everything they can to block Trumps nominee. If any of them vote for Trumps Supreme Court nominee, were going to mark them down as collaborators, Murshed Zaheed, head of the progressive group CREDO, told Vox. If Chuck Schumer wants to maintain any credibility as a progressive leader, he needs to shut the Supreme Court seat down. And if he doesnt do it, there will be a massive revolt."}, {"date": "2017/02/01", "title": "Make Republicans Nuke the Filibuster to Confirm Gorsuch", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/make-republicans-nuke-the-filibuster-to-confirm-gorsuch.html", "text": " Once Mitch McConnell had blockaded Barack Obamas last Supreme Court nomination, and Donald Trump had carried the Electoral College, the chance that Republicans would fill the Court vacancy rose to 100 percent. Trump chose a well-regarded conservative jurist in Neil Gorsuch, rewarding both McConnells decision to mount the blockade and the institutional Republican partys decision to mostly support Trump. The only choice before Senate Democrats is whether to allow Republicans to claim their reward the easy way or the hard way. They should choose the hard way. The Senate rules currently allow a filibuster of Supreme Court nominees (although not nominees for other judicial nominations). But the majority can change that rule at its whim. Even before Gorsuchs nomination, McConnell already indicated that he does not respect Democrats right to filibuster, and that he would eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations if one is used. Recent history shows how foolish the Democrats would be to submit to this threat without forcing the Republican majority to take action. In 2005, faced with Senate Democratic opposition to federal court nominees they deemed ideologically extreme, Republicans threatened to eliminate the filibuster for judicial nominations below the Supreme Court level. Democrats backed down in the face of that threat. In 2013, Republicans began wholesale blockade of federal court vacancies, irrespective of the candidates qualifications, insisting the seats in question should not be filled at all. Democrats, in response, eliminated the filibuster for judicial nominations below the Supreme Court level. Republicans decried this choice  even though they had threatened to do the same thing  and have since held it up as justification for a wide array of unpleasant behavior, including the unprecedented blockade of Merrick Garland. Democrats are reportedly tempted to abandon the filibuster, so that it remains in place for a future Court fight. Preserving the filibuster now could give Democrats more leverage in the future, some Democrats tell CNN. But this is fantastical. There is no leverage gained by a weapon ones opponent can disarm at will. The Supreme Court filibuster is like a pair of handcuffs in which the handcuffed person is holding the key. It was clear to some of us several years ago, and has become clear to almost everybody else since, that the rules of politics have changed completely. The old norms presumed that a president can fill a Supreme Court vacancy with a jurist of his own broad philosophical bent, and that the opposing party is only entitled to block a candidate they consider especially unqualified or extreme. (These norms allowed for bitter fights over individual candidates, such as Robert Bork, without questioning a presidents right to nominate somebody qualified from his own team.) Those norms are gone. The new norm is that a president needs 50 Senate votes to fill a seat, or it will go unfilled. It would be better for the health of American democracy to change the rules to something more stable. But pretending otherwise delays rather than hastens the day when some formal rule change comes about. In the meantime, Democrats have an extremely simple choice: They can make McConnell abolish the filibuster, or wait for the day when McConnell attacks them for doing it. It is McConnell, with his extraordinary blockade tactic, who has functionally changed the rules of the game. He should be forced to do it in name."}, {"date": "2017/02/01", "title": "Trump Has Given the Right Another Scalia", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/neil-gorsuch-trump-has-given-the-right-another-scalia.html", "text": " Bringing to a faux-dramatic close a process that was central to his conquest and seduction of serious conservatives, Donald Trump has chosen Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Neil Gorsuch of Colorado as his nominee for the Supreme Court seat vacated by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia nearly a year ago. Trump told a solid half-truth at the beginning of his odd, live-TV event announcing Gorsuch: He bragged about keeping his promise about the Supreme Court  and he did. But it was a promise to conservatives, not to the American people at large, as he suggested in his remarks. Gorsuch became the favorite for the gig in recent days, after Team Trump let it be known that Trumps short list was down to three; the other two, Eleventh Circuit Judge William H. Pryor Jr. and Third Circuit Judge Thomas Hardiman, were plagued by last-minute fears from conservative activists that they were not rock-solid enough in their views on, respectively, religious liberty and abortion. Pryor was also considered a potential risk for confirmation thanks to his very outspoken condemnation of Roe v. Wade. Indeed, by the time Trump revealed Gorsuch as his choice, he had almost overplayed the game. The suspense was exacerbating fears on the right about someone else getting the prize in a way that exaggerated intensity. Conservative judicial activists, you see, hate suspense when it comes to Republican Supreme Court nominees  they have been burned so many times before. From Dwight D. Eisenhower through Poppy Bush, every post-World War II GOP president before Bush 43 has managed to put somebody on the Court who has extended or defended some key liberal tenet of constitutional law. In 1992, the last time the landmark abortion-rights decision of Roe v. Wade looked ripe for overturning (far and away the most common and fiercely held goal for conservative activists), the five-judge majority that saved Roe was made up entirely of justices appointed by Republican presidents. So of course, conservatives did not trust Donald Trump to do the right thing about SCOTUS, and his own history of social liberalism did not help. Thus, a key part of his efforts to bring strong ideological conservatives (and especially SCOTUS-obsessed, conservative, evangelical activists) into his camp after winning the GOP presidential nomination involved the most elaborate process of public SCOTUS-vetting ever. In May of last year, Trump unveiled a list of 11 potential candidates for Scalias seat that had been precleared by the rigorous legal conservatives of the Federalist Society and the all-purpose ideologues of the Heritage Foundation. Hardiman and Pryor were on that list. Then, in September, he released a final list of 21 vetted prospects for the Scalia seat; Gorsuch made that last cut. It was no accident that, during the announcement, Trump mentioned his determination to choose someone in the Scalia tradition. Gorsuch does not have the perceived shortcomings of Hardiman and Pryor, and he does have a lot of positives in the eyes of the activists for whom his nomination was a gift-wrapped present and campaign thank-you note. His legal thinking and writing style remind a lot of legal beagles of Scalia, who  with the possible exception of his protg, Clarence Thomas  had long been conservative ideologues favorite justice. SCOTUSblogs Eric Citron said of Gorsuch: [O]ne study has identified him as the most natural successor to Justice Antonin Scalia on the Trump short list, both in terms of his judicial style and his substantive approach. But the key reason for conservative enthusiasm about Gorsuch is that he has been a real judicial pioneer in recognizing and expanding the right to an exemption from anti-discrimination laws and regulations for those citing religious objections. He was involved in two Tenth Circuit cases that wound up producing SCOTUS landmark decisions that allowed religious believers (include those running for-profit businesses) to disregard the contraception-coverage provisions of Obamacare. This background is worth its weight in gold when it comes to the Christian rights reactions to Trumps SCOTUS choice. For older conservatives, it may actually matter that Gorsuch comes from good stock: Hes the son of Ronald Reagans first EPA administrator, Anne Gorsuch Burford, who was sort of the Scott Pruitt of that era (though, in some respects, Pruitt makes her look like Rachel Carson). And for everyone on the right, his age is a big plus; at 49, with any luck, he can help bend the Court in a starboard direction for three decades or more. That would be a conservative legacy for Trump that would last well beyond the next several partisan exchanges in control of the White House. There will, of course, be talk of Democrats asking Gorsuch tough questions during confirmation hearings, and hes not the sort of judge who is likely to exert much bipartisan appeal. The donkey party will have to decide whether to filibuster this nomination, and the elephant party will have to decide whether to kill the filibuster in SCOTUS debates once and for all. Unless something unexpected comes up, however, Democrats probably should not imagine they can convince enough Senate Republicans to cross the barricades to defeat Gorsuch altogether. The GOP did not spend ten months denying hearings and a vote for Obamas nominee, Merrick Garland, only to fall apart over a GOP presidents pick. And you had better believe that the GOPs conservative base would wreak holy hell on any Republican who breaks ranks on this, the single most important reason they came around to Trump in 2016. Speaking of Trump: His reward for nominating a reliable conservative to the Court is to keep many conservative ideologues in his corner, as he seeks to consummate his conquest of the GOP in 2017 and beyond. He may well need them to keep congressional Republicans in line. But when it comes to crucial constitutional issues like abortion, putting Gorsuch on the Court may simply whet conservative appetites. By most accounts, they would need another justice to overturn Roe v. Wade. If another opening on the Court appears while Trump is in office, the pressure on him to get it right  and right  will make the path to this nomination look like, well, a reality TV show."}, {"date": "2017/01/31", "title": "White House Considers Deporting Legal Immigrants for Being Poor", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-considers-deporting-legal-immigrants-for-being-poor.html", "text": " First, they came for the Syrian refugees and visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries  and 49 percent of the American public approved. Now, with the huddled masses yearning to breathe free taken care of, the Trump administration is coming for your tired and your poor. Or so a draft executive order obtained by Vox and the Washington Post seems to suggest. Under current law, legal immigrants have access to certain public benefits. But the federal government can deny an individual entry to the United States  or reject an immigrants request for permanent residence  if there is evidence that the individual is likely to become primarily dependent on government benefits for his or her subsistence. When making that determination, the government can hold immigrants use of cash-based welfare programs (like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) against them, but not their use of in-kind benefits, like food stamps or Medicaid. But the Trump administrations draft order would change that, by instructing the Department of Homeland Security to bar immigrants from the U.S. if they are likely to receive any means-tested benefit at all. More radically, the order would subject visa holders who are already in the U.S. to deportation, if they use public benefits above a certain threshold. And  just in case that isnt enough to keep non-wealthy foreigners away from our shores  the order would require the friend or family member who sponsored the deported immigrant to reimburse the federal government for the cost of the benefits he or she used. The order would also bar undocumented immigrants from accessing the child tax credit, even when their children are U.S. citizens. Further, the order would direct the government to publish recurring reports on how much money it spends on benefits for immigrants  and how those funds could be reinvested in Americas inner cities. While theres much to be said for informing the public on how its tax dollars are spent, the ostensible purpose of this report is to direct the anger and resentment of the native-born working poor toward the immigrants below them  instead of at the oligarchs above. After all, you could just as easily start publishing weekly reports on how subsidies to oil companies and the revenues that will be lost to Trumps tax cuts for the rich  or the $20 billion the president wants to spend on his monument to American xenophobia  might be reinvested in our urban centers. The Trump administrations interest in directing working-class resentment toward immigrants is further affirmed in a separate executive order obtained by the Post: Note the highlighted bit. In the eyes of this orders authors, it isnt just the undocumented  or welfare-leeching visa holders  whose presence in the United States is a subject of concern. Even foreign-born American citizens are counted among those who are, ostensibly, taking jobs that should have gone to real Americans. The notion that immigrants are a primary cause of American wage stagnation is not economically supportable. But for an administration that wants to have its populist branding and its plutocratic agenda, too, its a politically useful one. So it wouldnt be surprising if these drafted orders end up getting Donald Trumps autograph."}, {"date": "2017/01/31", "title": "Imagining the White Houses Black History Month Schedule", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/imagining-the-white-houses-black-history-month-schedule.html", "text": " Today, Donald Trumps press secretary, Sean Spicer, announced that the White House would host a series of events in February for Black History Month.

The staffers made that clear today, sending a so-called dissent cable to their bosses at State. A policy which closes our doors to over 200 million legitimate travelers in the hopes of preventing a small number of travelers who intend to harm Americans from using the visa system to enter the United States will not achieve its aim of making our country safer, the diplomats wrote in the cable, rumors of which had been circulating since yesterday, according to the AP. While State Department employees are supposed to be able to sign their names to this sort of document without fear of retribution, this wasnt a riskless act for the approximately 800 who did so  as the AP notes, the cable was received just a day after White House spokesman Sean Spicer suggested those disagreeing with Trumps new policy should resign. Buried at the bottom of the AP story is a sign that even before the EO was signed, some employees had begun to resist it: Whether and to what extent this will make much of an immediate difference for individual visa-seekers is a tricky question to answer, given that different sorts of visas last for different lengths of time, and given the possibly temporarily nature of Trumps EO. But whatever the details, its heartening to think about State Department staffers working frantically to help foreign residents who had already been vetted get into the U.S., at a time when the Trump administration seems intent, for highly questionable reasons, on keeping them out."}, {"date": "2017/01/31", "title": "Trump Meets Big-Pharma CEOs, Then Seems to Flip-flop on Negotiating Drug Prices", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-seems-to-flip-flop-on-drug-prices-after-pharma-meeting.html", "text": " Without much question, the recent moment when Donald Trump showed the most independence of (or possible ignorance of) conservative economic orthodoxy was during his big pre-inaugural press conference on January 11, when in a ramble about industries leaving America he suddenly said something that freaked out many listeners and tanked pharmaceutical stocks: So today the president met with some of those very lobbyists and their bosses, and came out singing a very different song, which had a very different impact on pharma stocks: Trump also spoke vaguely of drug prices being too high, and of the need for bidding, which some observers apparently think was a veiled threat to revive the stick of government drug negotiations if the carrot of deregulation and lower taxes didnt work. But it is hard to interpret some of these comments as anything less than an abandonment of what he said on January 11: Price-fixing is precisely how pharma and its conservative allies describe Medicare negotiations for better drug prices. It sure sounds like Trump heard pharmas talking points and adopted them. And thats why this incident has implications beyond the immediate issue, important as it is. Ezra Klein understood it right away: That belief, if its even partially true, is an enormous asset for those who want to tame the populist beast and turn Trumps perpetual fury away from GOP-leaning business lobbies and toward anyone who wants to use government to solve problems other than insufficiently enormous corporate profits.

Its a move right out of The Apprentice. This seems to be mostly a matter of presidential theater, though apparently this plan preserves The Bosss right to redirect the course of U.S. constitutional law at the last minute. For all we know, given the 45th presidents priorities, he wants to see which of these men looks the most judicial in person. But hes playing with fire here. Gorsuch has become the late favorite of the conservative activists most interested in this pick, partly because hes a big religious liberty enthusiast; partly due to his similarity in views and writing style to the late justice he would succeed, Antonin Scalia; and partly because of last-minute fears about whether Hardiman is stone-cold certain to do what the right wants him to do on issues ranging from abortion to immigration. If Trump names Hardiman instead because he likes the cut of his jib or because the judges Third Circuit colleague happens to be the presidents sister (a source of major angst on the right today), there could be a pretty serious backlash among people Trump needs to keep congressional Republicans under his yoke. The shiny object of a SCOTUS appointment or two was clearly an important factor in keeping GOP base voters, especially conservative white evangelicals, in the Trump column last November.

And now, the Trump administration is turning its fire on Europes largest economy. On Tuesday, Trumps top trade adviser told the Financial Times that his team has little interest in a trade deal with the European Union, in no small part because Germany exploits its trade partners. A big obstacle to viewing TTIP as a bilateral deal is Germany, which continues to exploit other countries in the EU as well as the U.S. with an implicit Deutsche Mark that is grossly undervalued, Peter Navarro told the paper, referring to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Unlike the newly deceased TPP, the TTIP could be understood as a bilateral deal  an agreement involving only two parties. The Trump administration prefers such agreements, believing that they provide the U.S. with more leverage. In multilateral deals, the thinking goes, small countries can team up to demand larger concessions from great powers. But if America takes on each nation individually  like an action hero fighting his way through a super-villains henchmen  it has a better chance of setting the terms of trade. But, as Navarro notes, the EU is, itself, a conglomeration of smaller nations. Thus, any trade deal with the union is, essentially, multilateral. The German structural imbalance in trade with the rest of the EU and the US underscores the economic heterogeneity [diversity] within the EU, Navarro told the Times. Ergo, this is a multilateral deal in bilateral dress. Germanys massive trade surpluses have irked Washington for years. The Obama administration implored Berlin to rebalance its economy by stimulating domestic consumption. But these complaints were gift-wrapped in diplomatic niceties. After all, whatever the divergent interests of our national economies, maintaining friendly relations with Germany is a core national interest. Or it was. Navarros less than diplomatic remarks reflect the new administrations broader aversion to designing trade policy with an eye toward strengthening geopolitical alliances. In the wake of World War II, the United States provided heaps of foreign aid to its decimated allies, while offering their exporters access to the American market. The cost of such moves  both to the U.S. treasury and to the dominance of American manufacturing  was seen as small compared with the benefits of preventing desperate Western European countries from seeking recovery through alignment with the Soviet Union. Similar geopolitical considerations weighed on the ensuing decades of American trade policy. A core part of president Obamas argument for the TPP was that the agreement would check Chinas influence over the nations of the Pacific Rim. The Trump White House seems unmoved by such considerations  least of all the idea that American trade policy should prioritize the maintenance of the postwar liberal order. In fact, the Trump administration seems to desire the unraveling of that order. Or, at least, significant parts of it: Navarros true complaint appears to lie less with Germanys monetary policy than with the existence of the eurozone itself. Germanys currency isnt undervalued because Berlin favors low interest rates. Within the EU, Germany has been an inflation hawk. The nations central bank has called for less monetary stimulus, while its lawmakers have pushed for higher interest rates (measures that would strengthen the euro). A stronger euro would do far more harm to Europes periphery than to Germany, as unemployment  not inflation  is the principle worry in the former. Nations like Greece benefit from a weaker currency, which make its export and tourism industries more competitive. Thus, Germanys currency is undervalued because it is in a monetary union that must, to some extent, consider the interests of Europes weakest economies. Which is to say: Navarros problem with Germany isnt a technical dispute over the finer points of monetary policy, but over the fundamental question of the eurozones viability. Throughout his presidential campaign, Donald Trump displayed a proclivity for contradicting himself  particularly when doing so brought him into closer alignment with GOP orthodoxy. After making some noises about raising taxes on the rich early in the primary, Trump proposed the largest tax cut in U.S. history; after decrying Wall Streets influence over our politics, the GOP nominee called for a moratorium on financial regulations. Given this apparent nihilism, it was easy to imagine Trump taking the path of least resistance once in office: Do a symbolic gesture or two on trade, while focusing primarily on the deregulatory agenda that he and his party agree upon. But even if Trump isnt a sincere anti-globalist radical, hes surrounded by advisers who are. In his interview with the Financial Times, Navarro suggested that the White House is aiming for nothing less than a revolution in global trade: There are compelling critiques to be made of the global economys vast supply chains, on economic, environmental, and national-security grounds. But add Navarros ambition on that front to Steve Bannons interest in dissolving the European Union and drastically restricting legal immigration to the United States, and you have a far more radial international agenda than most Republicans had bargained for. Whether the White House can pursue that agenda while staying friends with the congressional GOP remains to be seen. So far, Trump has shown little deference to the latter objective."}, {"date": "2017/01/31", "title": "More Than 800 Refugees Will Now Be Let Into the United States", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/more-than-800-refugees-will-now-be-let-into-the-u-s.html", "text": " President Donald Trumps controversial executive order suspended the United States refugee program for 120 days, and barred Syrian refugees indefinitely.

Without these exemptions, these individuals and families would face undue hardship, said acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection Kevin McAleenan. Its unclear the origin countries of these refugees, or whether additional waivers will be granted. This somewhat hopeful announcement comes after protests broke out at airports across the country during the chaotic and disjointed implementation of Trumps measure, which  in addition to its refugee policy  temporarily prevents citizens from seven predominately Muslim countries from coming to the United States."}, {"date": "2017/01/31", "title": "Trump Could Still Undermine the Obama LGBTQ Order He Just Reaffirmed", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-could-still-undermine-lgbtq-order-he-just-reaffirmed.html", "text": " It is pretty safe to say that the first decision of the Trump administration that has gained widespread progressive approbation occurred this morning: The Obama order in question protects LGBTQ workers at companies with federal contracts from discrimination. Leaving it in place technically breaks Trumps campaign pledge to revoke all of Obamas executive orders. More to the point, todays announcement contradicts rapidly spreading rumors that Trump was about to do something that gay-haters would love. Or does it? At Vox, German Lopez explains that another shoe may soon drop that could undermine todays action significantly, or even effectively reverse it in many cases: On the campaign trail, Trump said a whole lot more about protecting the right to discriminate as essential to religious liberty than he said about LGBTQ protections. Indeed, he received a definitive seal of approval from none other than Hobby Lobby CEO David Green, whose lawsuit defying Obamacares contraception-coverage mandate led to the most important Supreme Court precedent carving out an area of protected discrimination for religious individuals who run for-profit corporations. Anyone supporting that line of reasoning will certainly have no trouble exempting federal employees who claim a religious motive for disliking LGBTQ folk from the executive order allegedly protecting them. So any celebration of Trumps announcement today should be put on hold until we see whether it represents the presidents final word on the subject. And keep in mind the overall context at play: Trump will tonight announce a Supreme Court nominee. Religious liberty enthusiasts are mostly rooting for Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Neil Grouch, who is considered an important judicial champion of their cause. If Trump goes in another direction, he could assuage hurt feelings among conservative Christian activists by a complementary gesture like a religious liberty executive order. But odds are hell let the potentially false impression that hes broken with the Christian Right on LGBTQ rights percolate for a while first."}, {"date": "2017/01/31", "title": "24 Hours at JFK: The Hour-by-Hour Account of Two Iraqis Detainment and Release", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/24-hours-at-jfk-two-iraqi-refugees-detainment-and-release.html", "text": " Last Friday night, after a very long week, Mark Doss, a 29-year-old attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP), was out to dinner with a couple of friends in Brooklyn, when he got a text. One of his clients from Iraq, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, had just landed at John F. Kennedy Airport with his wife and three children. Darweesh had spent much of the past decade working for the United States government, part of it as an interpreter for the 101st Airborne Division, in Baghdad and Mosul. The Darweeshes had flown from Baghdad to Istanbul, and on to New York, where Hameeds wife and children had passed through border patrol without incident. Hameed, however, had been stopped. It had now been several hours, and no one had heard from him. Earlier that day, lawyers at IRAP had been watching live so they could note the precise time  4:42 p.m.  at which President Donald Trump signed an executive order instituting a ban on immigrants from seven predominately Muslim countries, including Iraq. IRAP had been preparing for the order all week, fearing it might be signed any day, and when a draft was released on Wednesday, they advised their clients to get on flights as soon as possible. For several, they sent letters via Viber and WhatsApp for them to present to border officials, with the lawyers phone number and an explanation of why they had well-founded fears that returning to their home country would be dangerous. They also advised clients that there was a chance they could be detained if the order was signed before they took off, and that it was their choice to decide whether getting to America was worth the risk. (All of them said that it was.) The question of whether anyone in the air would be allowed in was an open one that had apparently been answered at JFK: The Darweeshes had landed around 6 p.m., just an hour after Trump had signed the order. Two hours later, another IRAP client from Iraq, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, who was connecting at JFK to meet his family in Texas, had landed and never emerged from customs. Around 11 p.m., two agents from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) approached Darweeshs wife and children, who were anxiously waiting in the arrivals hall; the agents asked them to voluntarily come back into the customs area, seeming to have realized that in the uncertain aftermath of the orders signing they had let through four members of a family but not the fifth, and were trying to re-detain Darweeshs family. Jonathan Polonsky, an attorney from the firm Kilpatrick Townsend, who was representing Darweesh along with IRAP, had met the family at the airport with three students from the CUNY School of Law, and asked the CBP agent whether this was a request or an order. Told it was the former, at least for now, Polonsky advised the Darweeshes to get into a cab and leave the airport. The detention of Darweesh and Alshawi, followed by the swift response from a group of lawyers, two members of the House of Representatives, and a spontaneous protest movement  all of them feeding off one anothers energy  helped launch a nationwide movement against President Trumps ban and detentions across the country. By the time Doss arrived at the airport, along with Julie Kornfeld, another IRAP attorney, who had been at a friends birthday party, CBP officers had relocated Darweesh and Alshawi from Terminal 1, where they had arrived but which closed at midnight, to Terminal 4, with their hands restrained. The terminal was largely empty, save for passengers landing on late-arriving flights from Latin America and the West Coast. With no access to their client, and nowhere to turn, Doss walked over to the doors leading back to the customs area, where a CBP officer insisted that he step back. Doss asked to see his client, but was rejected. Who is the person we need to talk to? he asked a CBP official. Mr. President, the official responded. Call Mr. Trump. On Saturday morning, Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez, whose district includes Chinatown, was preparing to attend an event marking the Lunar New Year when she got a call from Javier Valds, the co-director of Make the Road New York, who reported the fear that several people at JFK might be deported and asked whether Velazquez could get to the airport and see what she might be able to do. Velazquez immediately got in a car and called Jerrold Nadler, who represents parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, who was planning to spend the morning at synagogue, to say a set of ritual mourning prayers for his recently deceased mother. Jerry, Im going to JFK, Velazquez says she told Nadler. Im already in a cab, Nadler said. At the airport, Amy Rutkin, Nadlers chief of staff, spotted Doss, Kornfield, and Lara Finkbeiner, another IRAP lawyer who had arrived that morning, sitting near a Dunkin Donuts in an array of untucked button-down shirts. (Finkbeiner is a close friend, and Ive met Doss socially on several occasions.) The IRAP lawyers gave the representatives a rundown of the situation. They were being given no access to their clients, and there was some concern that Darweesh might be deported, or transferred to a facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey, where he would be administered a credible fear interview, to determine the level of danger he might face if the United States sent him back to Iraq. Shut out by the CBP officers they encountered, the lawyers had taken to cold-calling any phone number they could find for the agency. Eventually, they spoke with a supervisor at JFK who began offering sporadic updates on their clients. They had been able to speak to Darweesh by phone, briefly, at which point they told him not to sign any papers CBP presented him. At 5:33 that morning, several organizations, including IRAP and the ACLU, had filed a habeas corpus petition on behalf of Darweesh and Alshawi, hoping to put a stay on the executive order. After 6 a.m., however, when the CBP shifts changed, the IRAP lawyers said that the new supervisor on duty declined to offer them any information and said they had to call the press office at the Homeland Security office in D.C., despite the fact that they werent members of the press, and no one was manning the phone on a Saturday morning anyway. Well, Nadler said. Lets go see what thats about. Nadler and Velazquez approached the customs door Doss had unsuccessfully tried to enter early that morning. The doors were closed and couldnt be opened from the outside, but as soon as an arriving passenger walked out, triggering the automatic door, the congresspeople stepped through to find a young CBP employee in glasses and blue latex gloves, for examining hundreds of passports a day. These are two members of Congress, Rutkin, Nadlers chief of staff, said, holding up Velazquezs and Nadlers congressional IDs. The CBP officer wouldnt let them through, and several more officers approached, one shouting, Gotta go, Gotta go and waving his arms for them to turn and leave, insisting they were blocking the doorway. Nadler and Velazquez stepped out of the door frame, but only far enough that the automatic door couldnt close. After several tense minutes, a CBP supervisor approached and agreed to speak with Nadler and Velazquez. She turned down their request to speak with the detainees, or to allow the lawyers to speak with them, claiming Darweesh and Alshawi had not yet entered the United States, and were thus not subject to due process. Courteous, but surprised to have been confronted by two members of Congress on a Saturday morning, she said the issue was a lack of guidance from Washington on what to do about people who were in transit when the law was put in place. It was Saturday, and they were having trouble getting through to anyone in D.C. We are as much in the dark as everybody else, she said. She also confirmed what the lawyers had suspected: In addition to Darweesh and Alshawi, ten other people were currently being held because of the order. Nadler and Velazquez marched out of the terminal, and gave a press conference to the small gathering of reporters and protesters who had begun to congregate outside. As they wrapped up, Rutkin got a call from the CBP supervisor: Darweesh was going to be released. When he emerged in a baggage area to the side of the terminal, he had been in custody for 19 hours. The first thing he asked, putting his hands behind his back as if they were being restrained, was, Why did this happen to me? He couldnt stop crying as both Velazquez and Nadler gave him hugs. Eventually Doss started rubbing his back and began speaking with him in Arabic. Its been a long trip, and I know its been very difficult, but youre free now, Doss told him. Several CBP officials approached the group and demanded that they leave the terminal. Doss told Darweesh there was a growing crowd outside who might be interested in greeting him, if he was interested. Darweesh said that would be fine, but that he had a request. Listen, Im Iraqi, he said. The first thing you need to do is get me a cigarette. Leslie Wellington woke up in her Carroll Gardens apartment on Saturday morning to a familiar sight  her 17-month old sleeping between her and her husband, Ben  and an unfamiliar one. He doesnt cry a whole lot, she said of her husband. But he woke up crying. The Wellingtons had spent much of the previous day grappling with the fact that Trumps executive order had been signed on Holocaust Remembrance Day Wellingtons stepfather is a rabbi  and had woken up to a story in the Times detailing the detentions at JFK and Dosss encounter with the CBP. I kept thinking, This is a luxury, Leslie said, of being in bed with her husband and child, unlike some of the families who were being kept apart. And it shouldnt be. The Wellingtons were not frequent protesters  he teaches statistics at Pratt and has a Tumblr called I Quant NY, while she is the executive director of a nonprofit that promotes urban manufacturing  but they felt like doing something. Anyone else think we should descend on airports across the country to protest this? Anyone want to meet at Terminal 4 at JFK? Ben wrote to his 1,200 Facebook friends, at 9:30 on Saturday morning. If enough people will join, Im in. Only one wrote back. Thats 2, he wrote. Leslie called her sister to come babysit while they started making phone calls. At that point, the Wellingtons werent even sure you could protest at an airport. Leslie had graduated from Brooklyn Law, and vaguely remembered a class on civil liberties, from which she remembered cases detailing how demonstrations at airports could occasionally be quashed. We were anxious about getting a bunch of people into trouble, Ben said. Leslie called Carlos Menchaca, a Brooklyn city councilman she had previously worked for, who quickly offered to help secure permission from the Port Authority to hold the protest, and suggested several groups that might want to get involved. Having gotten minimal response from his Facebook post, Ben created an event called JFK Detention Rally and Vigil. By late morning, the Facebook event had gone from a few dozen interested people to several thousand  Ben offered a hard-to-follow mathematical explanation for how interest had grown via various multipliers  and the Wellingtons had coordinated with the New York Civil Liberties Union, the New York Immigration Coalition, Make the Road New York, and several other organizers, who began planning and promoting the rally. When someone at the NYCLU asked the Wellingtons for an affiliation to include in a press release, they didnt know what to put, so they suggested citizen organizers. The Wellingtons had scheduled their protest to begin just after sundown, out of respect for the Jewish sabbath, but when they arrived JFK with their 17-month-old strapped their chest at around 3 p.m., a crowd of several hundred was already gathered and chanting No Hate, No Fear and remixing Gwen Stefani (This Shit is Illegal  I-L-L-E-G-A-L). They hadnt been the only ones with the idea to protest an immigration ban at an airport  other Facebook events had popped up recommending similar protests, though the Wellingtons was the largest in New York  and Nadler and Velazquezs press conference with Darweesh had helped drive even more coverage. As the noise grew outside, the terminal remained eerily quiet, populated only by families of arriving passengers and hired drivers, many of them immigrants from Muslim countries, holding signs waiting for passengers with last names like Campbell and Fukuyama and Hamid. With Darweesh freed, the IRAP lawyers were now trying to sort out why their other client, Haider Alshawi, was still detained. Alshawi was arriving on a refugee visa, and had been scheduled to fly on February 8, but with the executive order imminent, his American lawyers had begged the U.S. Embassy in Sweden to get him onto an earlier flight. He boarded a plane in Stockholm four hours before the order was signed, and was en route to Houston, where his wife, a 32-year-old Iraqi who had been a contractor with the American military, was living with their 7-year-old son. They had not seen each other in three years, and on a visit to a local mall before Christmas, their son had written a note to Santa at Macys: Dear Santa: Can you bring my Dad from Sweden pls. Alshawi had been able to call his wife, in Houston, who was relaying messages to Kornfeld, the IRAP lawyer. According to his wife, the agents were asking him to sign something about booking a new flight, but it was unclear whether the flight was to Texas or back to Iraq. The IRAP lawyers told her to tell Alshawi not to sign anything. Though CBP did not say why it chose to release Darweesh, the timing of Nadler and Velazquezs arrival at JFK, and subsequent press conference, seemed too coincidental to have had no impact. CBP officers said they were bumping decisions up the chain in Washington, but wouldnt be specific. After the press conference with Darweesh  security guards tried to bar the IRAP attorneys from getting back into the terminal, until the representatives interceded  Nadler and Velazquez went back to CBP to demand answers on Alshawis case. Youre putting me in a very difficult position, one CBP employee told Velazquez. Alshawis case was complicated by the fact that he had arrived on a refugee visa. (Darweesh had a special immigrant visa, reserved for people who worked for the U.S. government.) At one point, a CBP official told Nadler and Velazquez that the order only allowed for a refugee to be admitted with the signature of both John Kelly, the secretary of Homeland Security, and of the secretary of State  a position that is currently unfilled. When they said that, my heart just sank, Finkbeiner said. I thought, Is he going to be in detention for weeks? Earlier in the week, in preparation for the orders signing, IRAP had put out a call for lawyers willing to volunteer at airports across the country  3,000 volunteered in just four hours  and by midafternoon a stream of lawyers, some with immigration experience, others from big corporate firms in the city, had begun arriving at JFK. (Women make up just 35 percent of all lawyers, but 60 percent of public-interest attorneys are women, and the numbers seemed to reflect that.) One lawyer in Portland landed at Terminal 4 that afternoon, found the group of lawyers, and asked how he could help. The most common estimate was that somewhere in the neighborhood of a hundred lawyers fanned out across four different terminals. After Nadler and Velazquez learned from the CBP that ten other people were currently being detained in Terminal 4, the lawyers began canvassing families in the arrivals area and found that some had been waiting since the previous night for their loved ones to arrive, but had no lawyer to turn to when they didnt. An emergency conference-call among several immigration law groups had determined that the most effective strategy was to file habeas corpus petitions on behalf of anyone they could determine was being detained, so the lawyers at IRAP and elsewhere prepared a template for habeas petitions that could be filed in anyones name. By late afternoon, the Central Diner, a restaurant in Terminal 4 with blue and red neon signs, had become an impromptu law office. (At OHare, lawyers later took over a McDonalds.) As families were discovered in the crowd, lawyers brought them to tables at the restaurant and began asking them for personal information about their family members that could be inserted into a habeas petition. After a few more hours of silence on Alshawis case, the IRAP lawyers asked Nadler and Velazquez to investigate. They were told they were waiting for a waiver from Washington, but that Alshawi was resting comfortably. Both Nadler and Velazquez had been at JFK for more than five hours, and had to leave, but they had already contacted other representatives who were heading to the terminal to take their place. Its not ideal to be cold-calling members of Congress to come to an airport on a Saturday, Rutkin, Nadlers chief of staff, said, with a shrug, before doing so anyway. Nadler and Velazquez demanded that CBP give the lawyers a phone number to call for updates. When the lawyers tried the number several times later in the day, no one ever picked up. By the time the protesters outside paused for a vigil at 6 p.m., the crowd had grown into the thousands, with many more people pouring out with each arriving AirTrain. The organizers were trying to deliver messages to the crowd via mic checks, a communication tactic popular from the Occupy movement, but the crowd seemed to be filled with people for whom mass protest was a relatively new activity, and many of the mic checks were drowned out by rising chants. Across the street, a dozen police in riot gear had lined up in front of the sliding doors at the east entrance of Terminal 4, in case the protesters tried to move the protest into the terminal  they never did  and the Port Authority briefly shut down the AirTrain, claiming it was overloaded, before Governor Cuomo demanded that it be reopened. The taxi union ordered a work stoppage at JFK between six and seven oclock, although by then the protest had more or less slowed traffic to a halt. Inside Terminal 4, a dozen members of the New York State Police, one with an assault rifle of the kind Alshawi and Darweesh had often seen on American soldiers in Iraq, had materialized at the entrance to the customs area where Nadler and Velazquez had confronted CBP earlier that day. A little after six, a new CBP supervisor appeared and spoke to Finkbeiner and Kornfeld. (After being awake for more than 30 hours, Doss had finally left the airport that afternoon.) While she had no real news to offer, Finkbeiner reminded her that as a CBP officer, she had the authority to parole a person into the country  while the order had been made many stations above her authority, this individual decision was one that she had in her hands. By that point, similar gatherings of lawyers, protesters, and elected officials had begun to take over airports across the country, many of them looking to New York for guidance. Lawyers at JFK and elsewhere worked through the night, and beyond, and Nadlers and Velazquezs staff members were relaying tactics that had proven effective to their colleagues across the country, including John Lewis, who went to Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, in Atlanta, and asked a CBP official how many people were being detained. When he didnt get an answer, he replied, Why dont we just sit down and stay a while. After the vigil outside Terminal 4, the organizers of the protest announced, through a mic check that worked just fine, that there would be another protest the next day, in Battery Park; 30,000 people showed up. Twenty minutes after Finkbeiner confronted the CBP officer, the official returned and said Alshawi would be released shortly, out of the same side door as Darweesh. Alshawi had been detained for more than 20 hours, and his eyes were filled with tears as he greeted the lawyers from IRAP: He pulled $60 from his pocket, and tried to stuff it into Kornfelds hands to thank her for her help. There were no more flights to Houston that night, but he would be on the first available plane in the morning."}, {"date": "2017/01/31", "title": "The Attorneys Fighting Trumps Immigration Ban at Airports Around the Country", "url": "http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/01/the-women-fighting-trumps-immigration-ban.html", "text": " This weekend, as protesters descended on airports nationwide to protest Trumps executive order banning entry to the U.S. from a number of Muslim-majority countries, hundreds of lawyers from organizations and firms around the country were busy setting up impromptu crisis centers to offer their legal services to those impacted by the order. And according to reports, an overwhelming number of those attorneys were women. Chicago-based lawyer Dee Armstrong told the Cut that she saw an approximately 70-30 female-male ratio during her weekend shifts working with immigrants and refugees at Chicago OHare, while on Twitter, Atlantic editor Matt Ford pointed to a similar striking gender disparity among the lawyers at Washington Dulles Airport. As Rebecca Traister points out, women have been a major force in crafting the legal opposition to Trumps administration: It was four female judges (plus one male judge) who issued stays on Trumps executive order this weekend, while Sally Yates, Obamas now-fired appointee for attorney general, became an overnight hero for refusing to enforce Trumps executive order. The Cut spoke to some of these women, many of whom spent both Saturday and Sunday at their nearest airports and have plans to return this week, about what the experience was like and the people they worked to help. I felt like I had a superpower, said attorney Esther Panitch of her time at Atlanta Airport. And my superpower is that I have the experience and the training to help people, which is exactly why I went to law school. Dispatch from JFK: People really stepped into action. There were dozens and dozen of lawyers. We were all congregated near the Central Diner in JFK Terminal 4. Everyone was on laptops either drafting petitions or trying to make contact with passengers or passengers families, trying to deal with press contacts, questions from congressmen and -women. When I got there in the morning, there was a young woman whose parents were coming on visitors visas from Iran and they had been held overnight. She had been waiting a very long time for them. Habeas petitions had been filed in their cases, and they had been told that they would be sent back. But ultimately, around 3:30 p.m. they were released, which was wonderful. People worked really hard. I was so inspired by the people that were there. People really stepped into action to put systems in place to make a more cohesive effort. Spreadsheets were coming together, Google Docs were being sent for people to put in client intake information in a centralized way. And, of course, it was chaotic but as the day went on it really came together. Melanie Zuch, staff attorney at the Urban Justice Center, New York Dispatch from LAX: It was Kafkaesque at best. Ive spent my career trying to raise awareness about immigrant rights and the plight of refugees and have always felt a bit frustrated that the public at large isnt aware of these issues, so it was incredible to see people who had never been engaged come out. I think were going to see a very different dynamic in the months and years to come. I spoke with a cousin of an Iranian woman whos a graduate student here in California with a student visa. She went abroad briefly to visit family, and came back to this disaster. And when she landed she was told that if she did not go back she would never get into this country again. They canceled her visa. She was put on a plane after the New York court issued a stay preventing the government from removing people. There was also a couple that was finally released after 22 hours  they had been held without food and water. They were the elderly parents of a lawful permanent resident who lived in L.A., and they had a history of heart surgery so their daughter was very worried. These are not normal times  It was Kafkaesque at best. This was not the country that any of us were used to operating in. Judy London, directing attorney of public counsel, Immigrant Rights Project, Los Angeles Dispatch from ATL: Every lawyer is gonna fight like hell. An immigration lawyer at the airport was essentially giving me and a couple other lawyers a quick and dirty [rundown] of what the law is, because were not immigration lawyers. We all figured that the more of us [who showed up], the more likely it would be that somebody would know how to handle a situation. So even though its not my wheelhouse, I felt pretty empowered that I knew enough about the Constitution to make an argument if somebody needed it or that I would know who to call to get help. I was on the train home from the airport, and there was a family who were speaking in Farsi I think, and one of the women walked up to me and asked, Are you a lawyer? And then it was lot of thank-yous from people who realized I was a lawyer on the train. That was unbelievable. And then they were asking about their own situations, and what [do I think] is gonna happen? And I told them that I dont know. Essentially I said, Were gonna fight like hell. Every lawyer is gonna fight like hell. Yesterday it was an incredible day to be a lawyer. I felt like I had a superpower and my superpower is that I have the experience and I have the training to help people, which is exactly why I went to law school. Esther Panitch, criminal and civil trial attorney, Atlanta Dispatch from DIA: The longer the government refuses to discuss whats happening, the longer we will stay out there. We set up this little station outside of international arrivals so that we could be prepared for anyone who needed help. Customs and Border Protection was not actually sharing any information about who was being detained or what their official policies are, so mostly, our presence was to interview people leaving those flights to see what they were seeing: Did you see anyone get pulled away for secondary inspection? Right now were intending to have groups at the airport for at least the next couple of days. The longer the government refuses to discuss whats happening and what their policies will be, the longer we will stay out there and make sure that they know were there and were going to be there to defend anyone who needs help. The non-immigration lawyers in our group came down knowing that they dont know a lot about representing someone specifically in this sort of situation but that theyre willing to learn and willing to help, but they actually ended up being very useful for different issues that arose. On Sunday we had an issue where the Denver police department and the deputy city attorney thought we were soliciting in the airport and there was some talk of us needing a permit or being arrested and so having some civil rights attorneys and constitutional law attorneys, that really helped us. We had a team right there who could get the information together that we needed to defend ourselves and avoid arrest. Christina Brown, immigration lawyer, Denver Dispatch from ORD: The entire situation was incredibly harrowing and catastrophic. In the first ten minutes of arriving, I met a man whose wife and 18-month-old daughter had been detained. He showed me a picture of his daughter. I have kids myself, and it immediately felt like this was my child. This was all of our children. This was a person that we needed to immediately act and defend and stand up for. That family, the mom and the daughter were not released until the federal order of the stay was issued. The entire situation was incredibly harrowing and catastrophic because they were detaining children and they were detaining U.S. citizens who were traveling with people who were legal residents. We all were called to the airport expecting to meet with refugees who were trying to gain asylum into the United States and every single person that we represented, throughout the weekend, was a legal permanent resident or had a visa of some kind. What I think is unique about [the support from the legal community] was it happened so instinctively and so immediately. People heard what was happening and I think their own sense of humanity was triggered. Everybody who encountered this issue understood the gravity of the situation and how critical every moment was and how fast we had to move.

But a question more of us should be asking is why the Trump administration put itself and Yates in this position in the first place. In a tweet after firing Yates, Trump tried to make it sound like he was stuck with this snake-in-the-grass Obama AG because Democrats were standing in the way of the confirmation of his choice for the job, Jeff Sessions. Last time I checked, Republicans controlled the Senate and Chuck Grassley controlled the Judiciary Committee that is in charge of Sessionss confirmation. Said committee is scheduled to vote this very day on Sessions, and the odds all along have been that his name will be sent on to the full Senate directly. So the question we ought to be asking is why Trump and company could not wait a couple of weeks before turning the immigration system upside down to get their own appointees into place in the relevant agencies, especially the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security. Indeed, youd think maybe Sessions could have indirectly gotten word to his former staffer Stephen Miller, reportedly at the wheel when all the madness broke out Friday night, to hold off for a brief interval of time because the nativist cavalry was on the way. It is not a good sign that trigger fingers were so itchy in the White House that no one was inclined to tell Trump his plans for the sure-to-be-controversial travel ban could only benefit from taking the time to get it all within shouting distance of standard procedures. I have already offered the hypothesis that the chaos of this last weekend may have been actually what the Miller and Stephen Bannon faction wanted, in order to spread fear and awe of Trumps powers of destruction and to foster even greater polarization. If so, having Yates in place to defy Trump may have been part of the plan. But either way, the people now running the Executive branch of the United States government have no one but themselves to blame for her insubordination."}, {"date": "2017/01/31", "title": "The Statue of Liberty Was Originally Conceived As a Muslim Peasant Woman", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/the-statue-of-liberty-originally-muslim-peasant-woman.html", "text": "  Dont worry.

In recent days, a potential right-wing presidential front-runner was embroiled in a corruption scandal, and a very progressive leftist candidate won the nomination for the Socialists, which was seen as a clear rejection of current Socialist president Franois Hollandes administration. The unpopularity of the president is no big secret; Hollande declined to run for another term and has an approval rating in the single digits. But many believed his prime minister Manuel Valls, a left-of-center candidate who marketed himself as pro-business and hawkish on law-and-order, would end up the front-runner (especially since the struggling economy and fear of terrorism were what helped to sink Hollande). Instead, Valls was defeated by Benot Hamon, the most left-wing candidate in the Socialist race, whose economic policies include radical ideas such as a universal basic income, a robot tax, and reducing the workweek from 35 to 32 hours. He is also a proponent of legal weed. Even though Hamon won the Socialist runoff by a large margin, hes a long shot for the presidency; the Guardian puts his odds at 30 to 1. Based on current polling, hes likely to come in last or close to last among the five candidates in the April elections. Theres even more drama on Frances right. Last week, reports surfaced that leading conservative presidential contender Franois Fillon may have paid his wife $500,000 from public funds for a job in Parliament, from about 1992 to 2002. This would theoretically be allowed under French law, if his wife, Penelope, actually worked  and theres scant evidence that she did. Fillon is a pretty far-right candidate on social issues and immigration, but he was the front-runner to win the election. His support has been flagging in recent weeks, and Penelopegate hasnt helped. Fillon denies any wrongdoing, but the investigation will likely continue throughout his campaign. The potential fading of Fillon opens the door a smidge wider for Marine Le Pen, the candidate for Frances controversial far-right Front National, who has a populist, anti-EU, anti-immigrant platform. Le Pen stands to gain from Fillons troubles, and appears to have edged him out in the most recent polls. Yet Le Pen isnt the only one. The centrist, independent candidate Emmanuel Macron appeared to get a boost from Fillons troubles too, pulling even with him in the polls, slightly behind Le Pen. Macron also gets some help from the fact that the Socialists will now run Hamon, an extremely progressive candidate. France has a very fractured presidential field  theres also a far-left candidate, Jean-Luc Mlenchon, who doesnt really have a shot  so for the first round of voting, a Le Pen victory isnt improbable. But shes such a polarizing figure that pulling out a victory in a head-to-head runoff still seems unlikely  especially since one would assume left-leaning voters would throw their weight behind even the less extreme conservative, Fillon, or maybe the centrist Macron.

Despite claims that they would advocate for climate change and peace in the Middle East, so far their only visible contribution to the Trump White House has been an Instagram post that showed them decked out in eveningwear, as those affected by the immigration ban were detained in airports across the country. The internet derided the photo as the social-media equivalent of Marie Antoinettes let them eat cake. But now sources close to the First Couple Jr. are claiming that they had nothing to do with the discriminatory travel ban or its chaotic rollout  and they even have an alibi. President Trump announced his executive order minutes before the sun set on Friday night, and Vanity Fair reports that Ivanka and Jared were initially unaware of the uproar because they were observing Shabbat. The couple, who are both Orthodox Jews, do not use technology or do work from sundown on Friday to sundown on Saturday. Kushner is often portrayed as a moderating force, both on his father-in-law and between the different factions in his orbit. One source suggested thats why both Saturdays of the Trump administration were especially tumultuous. He wasnt rolling calls on Saturday when this happened, a source said of the day after the inauguration. To me, thats not a coincidence. Sources tell Vanity Fair that Kushner cant really be blamed for the other six days of the week either, because his influence over his father-in-law is already waning. He reportedly expended a great deal of effort to arrange Mexican president Enrique Pea Nietos visit to the White House, only to have the president call off the meeting in an angry tweet. Kushner was fucking furious, said a source. Id never once heard him say he was angry throughout the entire campaign. But he was furious. Sources claim that despite what their tone-deaf social-media missive would have you believe, the stress is getting to Jared and Ivanka. Per Vanity Fair: As for Ivanka, she feels just awful about advertising her opulent lifestyle at an inopportune moment. Of course, someone must be blamed for the apparent disarray within the Trump administration, and if not the Kushners, then who? Initial reports suggested senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, who wrote the order, would take the fall. (Particularly after Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough looked into the camera and told Miller, This weekend was a disgrace and its all on your shoulders.) Several sources told the Washington Post that the growing influence of Miller and Steve Bannon, the Breitbart wing of the Trump team, is making Priebus suspicious. A little bit of under-competence and a slight amount of insecurity can breed some paranoia and backstabbing, the source said of Priebus. We have to get Reince to relax into the job and become more competent, because hes seeing shadows where there are no shadows. Nothing boosts confidence and cures paranoia like a colleague leaking some backhanded advice to the press."}, {"date": "2017/01/31", "title": "Trump Fires Acting Attorney General for Defying Immigration Order", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/acting-attorney-general-fired-for-defying-immigration-order.html", "text": " Acting Attorney General Sally Yates was fired on Monday night shortly after ordering Justice Department lawyers not to enforce President Trumps executive order suspending immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. Yates had said she was not convinced that the order was legally defensible. Several hours later, the White House said Yates, a holdover from the Obama administration, had been relieved of her duties. The president appointed Dana Boente, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to serve as acting attorney general until Senator Jeff Sessions is confirmed by the Senate. The White House issued a statement saying Yates had betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce Trumps executive order. It also described her as an Obama administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration. The statement noted that the executive order was approved by the Justice Departments Office of Legal Counsel, but in a one-page letter to top lawyers at the Justice Department, Yates said that the review only considered whether the order was lawful on its face and properly drafted. Yates argued that, as head of the department, she had a broader task. My responsibility is to ensure that the position of the Department of Justice is not only legally defensible, but is informed by our best view of what the law is after consideration of all the facts. In addition, I am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institutions solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right, Yates wrote. At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities, nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful, she continued. For as long as I am the Acting Attorney General, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the Executive Order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so. President Trump initially responded to Yatess defiance by tweeting that he was forced to keep an Obama appointee as acting attorney general due to Democratic obstruction. The chaotic implementation of Trumps immigration ban sparked anger even among members of Trumps cabinet. The Washington Post reports that Defense Secretary James Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly fumed privately because they were caught off guard by the travel ban. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker told reporters that they werent briefed before Trump signed the order, and congressional aides said GOP lawmakers received little guidance as protests erupted at airports across the country. Senator Marco Rubio said on Monday that the State Department was refusing to answer his questions about how the order would be implemented, though the White House denied that. More than 200 State Department employees have reportedly signed internal memos criticizing the order. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said State Department employees can either get with the program or they can go. Over the weekend, federal district courts in several states issued temporary stays blocking parts of the order from being implemented. On Monday, officials from Massachusetts and Washington said they would challenge the executive order in court. White House senior adviser Stephen Miller, who reportedly drafted the executive order along with chief strategist Stephen Bannon, defended the orders legality in a Monday night appearance on MSNBC, saying, The ability to exclude any class of would-be visitors or immigrants to our country [is] based on our national security interests. Miller said Yatess move is a further demonstration of how politicized our legal system has become, adding, Its sad that our politics have become so politicized, that you have people refusing to enforce our laws. Democrats praised Yates, and several lawmakers said the incident demonstrates why theyre opposed to confirming Sessions as attorney general. The vote on Sessions could come as early as Tuesday. Yates was asked during her confirmation hearing in 2015 if the attorney general has a responsibility to say no if the president asks them to implement a policy they believe is improper. She said she believes the attorney general has an obligation to follow the law and the Constitution and to give their independent legal advice to the president. Ironically, the senator pressing Yates was Sessions. Yatess firing drew comparisons to the 1973 Saturday Night Massacre, in which President Nixons attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned after refusing to carry out the presidents order to fire Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor in the Watergate case. While a federal judge ruled that it was illegal for Nixon to have Cox dismissed, it is legal for President Trump to fire the acting attorney general. Another difference: It doesnt look like there will be any more firings tonight. Boente is a 31-year veteran of the Justice Department who is known for handling public corruption cases. Several colleagues told the Washington Post that they dont know his political affiliation, but theyre sure he would not uphold the executive order unless he believed it to be legally sound. I was enforcing it this afternoon, Boente told the Post. Our career department employees were defending the action in court, and I expect thats what theyll do tomorrow, appropriately and properly. This post has been updated throughout."}, {"date": "2017/01/30", "title": "What Is Stephen Millers Job, Anyway?", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/what-is-stephen-millers-job-anyway.html", "text": " If the Trump administrations chaotically implemented and legally suspect travel ban winds up unraveling, it looks like the person who is going to take the fall for it is White House senior adviser Stephen Miller. According to most accounts, Miller and his mentor, chief strategist Steve Bannon, were in charge of drafting and promulgating the orders that put this poorly thought-through policy into place. And Bannon is way too far up the food chain in Trumpland to suffer the consequences of a screw-up. Joe Scarborough broadcast that the more junior Stephen needs to be taken to the woodshed. So this raises the obvious question: Who put this guy into a position to go on a power trip and bypass the rest of the administration? Miller didnt just wander into the White House and execute a coup. Miller first gained big-time national attention when he was revealed as the major wordsmith (with an assist from Bannon) of Trumps presidential nomination acceptance speech in Cleveland. He was also an important liaison between Trump and his earliest and most important congressional ally, Senator (and now Attorney General-designee) Jeff Sessions. Eventually he emerged as a sort of combination speechwriter, policy wonk, and all-purpose promoter of the Breitbartian wing of the Trump movement  a key cog in the machine that made Trump into one of the less likely populist figures in American history. A Politico profile of Miller last summer credited him with (or blamed him for) major responsibility in orchestrating the successful GOP opposition to comprehensive immigration reform in Congress. This along with his belief that anti-immigrant sentiment was essential to Trumps election probably convinced him that, despite his lack of legal education and any experience beyond the shadow shows of the Senate and the campaign trail, he could breeze past the two cabinet agencies responsible for vetting and implementing the travel-ban orders. But theres something basically disturbing about Miller, who also lacks the business background of the older Stephen: The realization that Miller may have accidentally wandered onto the national stage was becoming apparent well before Trumps upset win opened up all sorts of vistas for the young man, who during the campaign enjoyed warming up crowds for the boss: Its not so funny anymore, is it? In any event, nobody has yet explained what a near-adolescent speechwriter and policy adviser was doing during the first week of the Trump presidency, essentially firing off instructions to U.S. diplomatic and customs officials around the world and touching the lives of thousands of real people. What is his job, anyway? Immigration czar? Its hard to say.

Alexandre Bissonnette, an international-relations student from Quebec City, has been charged with six counts of murder for opening fire on a mosque during evening prayers. Two suspects were initially arrested after the attack, but authorities later cleared one man, Mohamed el Khadir, as a witness. Officials are now classifying this as a lone wolf attack. According to the Globe and Mail, Bissonnette was known as a right-wing troll among local groups for his ultraconservative comments on social media. He openly expressed support for Marine Le Pen, of Frances far-right Front National, and defended Donald Trump in online forums. Local police initially declined to comment on what might have motivated the shooting, but Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau released a statement calling it a terrorist attack. We condemn this terrorist attack on Muslims in a center of worship and refuge. Muslim-Canadians are an important part of our national fabric, and these senseless acts have no place in our communities, cities, and country, Trudeau said. It is heart-wrenching to see such senseless violence. Diversity is our strength, and religious tolerance is a value that we, as Canadians, hold dear. The shooting occurred at the Islamic Cultural Center of Quebec just before 8 p.m., as evening prayers were concluding. It seemed to me that they had a Qubcois accent, a witness told the CBC. They started to fire, and as they shot they yelled, Allahu akbar! The bullets hit people who were praying. People who were praying lost their lives. A bullet passed right over my head. There were even kids. There was even a 3-year-old who was with his father. I cant believe it, said center president Mohamed Yangui, who wasnt at the mosque during the shooting. Weve never done anything to provoke anyone, and weve never cultivated hatred for anyone. Im just beside myself. Quebec premier Philippe Couillard and Quebec City mayor Rgis Labeaume held a joint press conference to echo Trudeaus sentiment, with Couillard saying, I want to say a few words to our Qubcois compatriots of the Muslim confession. Were with you. You are home, you are welcome in your home. Were all Qubcois. Couillard also said that he would increase the security presence at Quebecs mosques. Over the summer, a pigs head was left on the centers doorstep. We thought: Oh, theyre isolated events. We didnt take it seriously. But tonight, those isolated events, they take on a different scope, said a congregant who left the mosque prior to the attack. The shooting came shortly after Trudeau reaffirmed his commitment to welcoming those fleeing persecution, terror, and war in the wake of President Trumps ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees in general. President Trump phoned Trudeau Monday to offer his condolences and offered to provide assistance, if needed, reports the Hill."}, {"date": "2017/01/30", "title": "More Trouble for Tom Price on His Biomedical Investments", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/more-trouble-for-tom-price-on-his-biomedical-investments.html", "text": " Representative Tom Price was nearly out of the woods, despite mammoth confusion over the Trump administrations plans in the areas he would supervise as secretary of Health and Human Services, and also notwithstanding hazily answered questions from Senate Democrats about his dubious habit of investing, while he was in Congress, in companies potentially affected by health-care legislation. But a new revelation from the Australian biomedical company at the center of these questions has raised new suspicions Price has been hiding something. The Wall Street Journal had the story today: This is precisely the concern Senate Democrats have doggedly pursued: Price got a sweetheart deal via his House colleague Chris Collins, from New York, who was reportedly heard boasting he had made some friends a lot of money with tips to buy this stock. At a minimum, Price will have to once again refresh his memory: Initially he disclaimed any personal involvement in the purchase of the stock, before admitting that, oh yeah, he directed it after talking to Collins. The controversy over this particular stock draws additional attention to the more generally shady habit Price has had of investing in companies that could definitely be affected by his legislative activity. So this issue arises once again on the very eve of Tuesdays scheduled vote in the Finance Committee on Prices confirmation. Democrats may be stiffed by Committee Chairman and Utah Republican Orrin Hatch from reopening questions about Prices financial irregularities. But its bound to come up again on the Senate floor, assuming the latest news doesnt screw up Prices expected committee approval on a party-line vote.

Though the statement does not mention Trump or the immigrant ban explicitly, the context is clear. The full text of the statement, released by spokesperson Kevin Lewis, who was apparently not invited to accompany the Obamas on their Virgin Islands vacation, reads: This isnt the first time Obama has criticized the type of ban Trump has now instituted.

At least 200 State Department employees have signed onto internal memos harshly criticizing Trumps order. According to Foreign Policy, there are a few different versions of the memo but all share a similar theme  that contrary to the White Houses assertion that the new rules are about protecting the United States, this ban will increase anti-American sentiment and not achieve its stated aim of to [sic] protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nations. The memo added that the policy runs counter to core American values of nondiscrimination, fair play and extending a warm welcome to foreign visitors and immigrants. (A full draft of at least one of the reported memos is available here.) Right now, this document is just floating around Foggy Bottom, but it will likely become a dissent cable, a formal process  begun during the Vietnam War  that State Department employees use to register opposition to a White House policy, which gets turned over to the secretary of State. This particular memo is a big deal for a few reasons, starting with the number of people who are registering their opposition. Its also taken Trump less than two weeks to rile his cadre of diplomats  so early into his term that the secretary of State isnt yet in place to receive the dissent cable once its filed. Rex Tillerson, likely to be confirmed by the Senate this week, will have to start his post with a restless agency, and figure out how to respond. (Last year, more than 50 State Department diplomats and bureaucrats caused a stir when they gave top diplomat John Kerry a dissent cable over former President Barack Obamas Syria policies.) The State Department confirmed that such a memo existed, and that it will respect it, according to the Washington Post. Acting secretary of State Thomas Shannon will probably end up receiving the cable. But it doesnt appear, right now, that the dissent cable will do much to change the minds within Trumpworld  especially since world leaders, former high-ranking intelligence officials, and our allies on the front lines fighting ISIS dont seem to be getting through to the administration. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, conceding that such a memo existed, told reporters those in disagreement needed to either get with the program or they can go. Hes been clear on it since taking office, that hes going to put this safety of this country first. He is going to implement things that are in the best interest of the safety of this country prospectively, not re-actively, Spicer continued.

At issue for critics of this seemingly arbitrary rule is the emphasis on quantity of regulations over quality. The one in, two out rule appears to be based more on a slogan than logic. As William Gale of the Brookings Institution, who served on George H.W. Bushs Council of Economic Advisers, told the Washington Post, the number of regulations is not the key. Its how onerous regulations are. This seems like a totally nonsensical constraint to me.

And so the newest meme has been born: Paul Ryan has no spine. Andy Borowitz and ClickHole have columns riffing on the Spineless Paul Ryan meme, and somebody even edited the Wikipedia invertebrate page to add the House Speaker. It is true that Ryan does not care about the principles he claims to care about. But its inaccurate to imagine him as merely a soulless careerist. Ryan does have serious principles. He is deeply committed to the principle of liberating the affluent from the burdens of progressive taxation. That description may sound like an arch comment to those of us who dont share Ryans bent. But to people like Ryan, it is a moral conviction of the highest order. Ryan has repeatedly cited the influence in his younger days of such works as Wealth and Poverty, by George Gilder; The Way the World Works, by Jude Wanniski, plus, of course, Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand. These books treat the struggle against progressive taxation as the fundamental project of politics. The central problem of mass-participatory politics, in this view, is its tendency to allow the masses of voters to gang up on the rich (whether through democratic or undemocratic means) and redistribute their deserved rewards to themselves. It is tempting to dismiss his fixation with the top tax rate as greed on behalf of his donors, but to adherents of this ideology there is nothing more serious. Obviously, the defense of the right of the one percent to keep its earnings is an unpopular basis for political messaging. And so Ryan has an ecumenical view of the political message needed to sell his policies. He is happy to posture as a fanatical debt hawk if debt-hawkery is a promising vehicle to advance the goal of cutting taxes for the rich, but he will also support and even demand massively higher deficits if that is what is needed. Ryan has promoted outreach to Latinos and other socially moderate constituencies as a practical step toward expanding his partys base. Ryan continued to defend those policies before the election, when it looked probable that Trump would lose, and he would need to rebuild in the wake of the expected defeat. But he is also perfectly willing to abandon those policies if he happens to have a race-baiting Republican prepared to sign his cherished tax cuts into law. Ryan might supplicate himself to limitless acts of corruption or misrule by Trump, but he would never stand silent if Trump attempted to implement even a tiny tax increase on the highest-earning one percent. I happen to find Ryans belief system to be rather deranged.

Thats a new one, and so, too, is the announcement in advance by Jeff Merkley that he and the vast majority of Senate Democrats will filibuster whomever Trump appoints. You can expect Republicans to scream about partisan bias and obstruction, but Democrats will counter, as Merkley did, by calling attention to the GOPs unprecedented refusal to offer even hearings for Barack Obamas nominee for the Scalia seat, Merrick Garland: What this probably means from a practical point of view is that, after some wrangling back and forth, Mitch McConnell will, as he has long suggested (and as Donald Trump has suggested as well), invoke what is called the nuclear option and kill filibusters of Supreme Court nominees once and for all. Only McConnell knows how many crocodile tears he will first shed about the sacred Senate precedents Democrats are forcing him to violate, and how many times he will blame the action on his Democratic predecessor as Majority Leader, Harry Reid, for nuking the GOPs use of the filibuster to block most of Barack Obamas executive-branch and lower-federal-court nominees, in 2013. But unless theres some elaborate deal McConnell wants to cut that somehow moots the issue, or unless Democrats relent and preserve the filibuster for future use (against, say, a second Trump SCOTUS nominee who could form a majority to overturn Roe v. Wade), its all Kabuki theater at this point. As to the identity of Trumps pick, all we know for sure is that she or he will come from the list of prospects Trump released during the campaign. It was vetted by both the Heritage Foundation and the conservative legal group the Federalist Society, so there is zero chance it will be someone conservatives would dislike and progressives would like. Word is, as I wrote about last week, the choice is really down to three circuit court judges: Neil Gorsuch, Thomas Hardiman, and William Pryor. The odds on Pryor are not great, since he has recently annoyed conservatives and has said the sort of things liberals will cite to justify a filibuster. But again: This is high political theater, beginning with tomorrow nights Trump TV show. A lot of Republican had their patience and confidence tested by the airport chaos over the weekend. The SCOTUS pick will likely remind conservatives of the rewards they will eventually harvest  pro-business and anti-regulatory judicial precedents, protection for big GOP priorities like Citizens United and the gutting of the Voting Rights Act, and, someday, the bright shining goal of being able to keep women from controlling their reproductive systems  if they just put up with Trumps other legal shenanigans. You can expect the relative youth of the nominee to get a lot of attention from conservatives once the name is revealed.

On Monday, the Iraqi parliament voted in reciprocate and institute a travel ban on Americans, while the countrys foreign ministry took a more diplomatic line, requesting that Trump reconsider this wrong decision. Iran too promised reciprocal measures in a statement that called the ban an obvious insult to the Islamic world.

Sadiq Khan called the ban shameful and cruel, while Boris Johnson, now the British foreign secretary, tweeted this: Across Europe, leaders struck the same tone.

As an excellent summary from the legal website Just Security explains, there were five relevant judicial orders issued over the weekend: in New York, Boston, Virginia, Seattle, and Los Angeles. All involved stays to stop detention and deportation decisions until legal challenges to the order were heard, and all involved people who had some prior right to be in the United States under the system Trump displaced on Friday. There is some doubt about the nationwide applicability of the judicial stays, though the New York and Boston actions did indeed appear to reach beyond the particular detainees at those cities airports. There could be others emerging today. But in any event, the order remains in legal limbo, and no judge has yet done anything to lessen the orders effect on people who were not in physical limbo when the order came down. Before anyone assumes too quickly the Trump administration is going to lose that war, it should be remembered this is an area of law where presidents have an unusual degree of leeway, as a New York Times take on the situation notes: The question that could be resolved very soon is whether the sloppiness of the travel ban and its chaotic implementation raise enough statutory, constitutional, or international issues to override this presumption of presidential authority.

It really is a massive success story in terms of implementation on every single level, explained a senior administration official. And yet news has depicted scenes of chaos, confusion, and inhumane treatment of innocent people. The administration has thus been forced to supply a series of defenses: 1. President Obama did the same thing. My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months, insists Trump. Multiple fact-checkers have examined this claim and found it wanting. In response to intelligence linking two refugees from Iraq to a bomb attack on American forces there, the Obama administration slowed, but did not stop, its refugee-admission process in order to tighten its screening. A tightening of vetting procedures in response to specific intelligence about a single country is not the same thing as a sweeping halt in the absence of a reported breach. 2. Only 109 people were detained. Its not clear where Trump got this figure, but the Department of Homeland Security announced that in the first 23 hours alone, 375 people were detained. 3. There were some big problems, but it was caused by Deltas computer system. In fact, problems began Friday night, and Deltas system went down Sunday night, and was fixed after a few hours. 4. The premier president loves surprises. Possibly the most interesting defense is that the administration was unable to use the normal interagency review process because it would have tipped off the terrorists. What we couldnt do was telegraph our position ahead of time to ensure that people flooded in before that happened, before it went into place, said White House spokesman Sean Spicer. If we had telegraphed that ahead of time, then that would have been a massive security problem. President Trump, as usual, put the argument in pithier terms: This defense suffers from two enormous flaws. First, it assumes that allowing agencies tasked with security to have input on a policy would be tantamount to publicizing the policy. The president is supposed to be able to discuss plans in confidence without assuming they will be leaked immediately. That is how the federal government works. If the only way to announce a foreign-policy move was to keep new policies a closely guarded secret within the administration, then this kind of amateurism would be standard. There is a long record of American presidents announcing surprise foreign policy decisions that were planned in advance by officials other than a speechwriter in his early 30s and a Breitbart lunatic. The second problem with this defense is that it assumes terrorists were sitting around the world, planning to enter the United States to launch an attack, and able to enter at any time, but lacking any special urgency. (Perhaps they were waiting for the fares to drop.) An announcement of one weeks notice would have given them just the motivation they needed to hop on a plane. This bears no relation to reality. People from the countries banned by Trump already face an extensive, 20-step vetting process that can take up to two years. None of them could have legally made it through within a week, or anything close. And once you realize this, it becomes clear that Trumps policy was not only bungled in its implementation but conceptually flawed. Trump originally proposed a Muslim ban. But he had to back away from this policy given that it is both unconstitutional and transparently unenforceable (how do you prevent a terrorist from lying about his religion?). This forced Trump to relabel his policy extreme vetting. But the reality is that vetting is already extreme. Trump has not identified any weak points in the vetting procedure. Indeed, there is no connection whatsoever between his policy and any terror incidents in the United States. Radicalized domestic American terrorists have all come from countries not on Trumps list. His policy grows out of a need to take some kind of action. In a way, it makes perfect sense that he would skip the normal interagency review  input from security experts would only reveal that Trumps plan has no relationship to any security objective. The purpose of this policy is to retroactively justify Trumps campaign fearmongering."}, {"date": "2017/01/30", "title": "Mike Flynn Is Annoying Trump Because He Acts Just Like Trump", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/mike-flynn-is-annoying-trump-because-he-acts-just-like-trump.html", "text": " In a lot of ways, Donald Trumps national security adviser, Mike Flynn, seems more like the president than most of his appointees.

Internationally, the mess is alienating allies, ruining Americas image, and quite possibly inciting the very terrorism it is alleged to prevent. At home, protests have erupted at most airports with international flights, where federal judges are beginning to intervene to stop implementation of the orders. Confusion is evident within the administration, with the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security having been blindsided by the orders. And Republicans, whose relationship with Team Trump is already being strained by confusion and conflict over a host of domestic policy issues, are mostly running for the hills or publicly protesting. It is all, to bring back a metaphor from the 2016 campaign, a dumpster fire. And as with major elements of the Trump general-election campaign, the whole brouhaha is being micromanaged by Stephen Bannon and Stephen Miller, two nonlawyers and outside-the-mainstream political operatives who are ignoring the legal and political ramifications of their actions. Its all so familiar that Trumps critics should resist the temptation to underestimate these people yet again. They do not give a damn about respectable opinion; they live to defy it. They will not be shaken by judicial thunder; they view judges as pawns in larger battles involving more powerful political and economic forces. They dont fear GOP elected officials; theyve watched Republicans turn tail, roll over, and beg for tax-cut treats and other policy concessions; just the day before Trump started this latest conflagration the entire congressional party assembled in Philadelphia to beg its new master for direction. And most of all, Trump and his closest associates do not fear blue-state protests of the sort that swept the nation this weekend. More likely than not, they exult in them, and have planned all along to exploit them to show Trump loyalists they are fighting disorderly and essentially unpatriotic people who value civil liberties more than national security, diversity more than national identity, and Americas enemies more than America. The Muslim ban is just one of many signs that the new administration is courting confrontation and encouraging fear and anger among its enemies. So where a lot of liberal observers may look at this weekends events and envision an early grave for Trumps presidency, a victim of its leaders incompetence and extremism, it could well be the beginning of four or eight years of regular provocation and intensifying polarization engineered by people on both sides who value the radicalization of American politics as essential to their radical goals. Bannon and company could, of course, miscalculate and overreach. But the thing to watch is not how many people join protests in places where Donald Trump has always been despised and derided. Nor do the conservatives who have not completely sold their souls to Trump have many battalions, either. Its whether Trumps core supporters and the closely associated GOP base begin to lose faith. A movement built largely on hatred of political correctness is not going to be stopped by protesters demanding acceptance and equality for Muslims and other minorities. And there are early signs Trump fans are either indifferent to the chaos at the airports, or are enjoying the anguish of those most affected. In any event, Trump-haters need to remember how often they were wrong in the past about the political salience of his strange crews hateful message. The weekends protests, like the womens marches the day after Trumps inauguration, and the many signs of defiance before that, could be critical in building the kind of united and energized opposition that could inspire fear in Republicans facing reelection in 2018 and 2020, and eventually drive Trump from office. But the new regime is not going to collapse by the weight of its craziness and irresponsibility, certainly not so long as the people who own much of America see the glittering prospect of owning even more, while millions thrill at the discomfiture of hated elites."}, {"date": "2017/01/30", "title": "Reince Priebus Doubles Down on White Houses Jew-less Holocaust Statement", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/priebus-doubles-down-on-jew-less-holocaust-remembrance.html", "text": " In addition to issuing an executive order banning refugees in general and adherents of one religion in particular, the Trump administration observed International Holocaust Remembrance Day by releasing a statement that didnt mention Jews, 6 million of whom died in the Holocaust.

The White Houses unconventional Holocaust memorialization was criticized by, among others, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, several Jewish organizations (including at least two Republican ones), former national security adviser Susan Rice, and Senator Tim Kaine, who noted that downplaying the Nazis anti-Semitism is often a feature of Holocaust denial. Its either to deny that it happened, or many Holocaust deniers acknowledge, Oh, yeah, people were killed. But it was a lot of innocent people. Jews werent targeted, Kaine said. The fact that they did that and imposed this religious test against Muslims in the executive orders on the same day  this is not a coincidence.

Priebuss defense of the statement came after White House spokesperson Hope Hicks suggested that the administration was merely trying to be respectful of the 5 million non-Jews killed during the Holocaust. After providing news outlets with a link to a Huffington Post article noting that priests, gypsies, people with mental or physical disabilities, communists, trade unionists, Jehovahs Witnesses, anarchists, Poles and other Slavic peoples, and resistance fighters were also murdered by the Nazis, Hicks said, Despite what the media reports, we are an incredibly inclusive group and we took into account all of those who suffered.

Most notably, Trump added senior adviser Steve Darkness Is Good Bannon to the NSCs elite Principals Committee while diminishing the roles of the director of National Intelligence and chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who will now only attend the groups meetings where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed. Bannon is best known for heading alt-right clearinghouse Breitbart News, making him an unexpected addition to the Principals Committee, which guides the president on national security policy and is supposed to at least appear nonpolitical. Bannons Bush-era counterpart, Karl Rove, was not allowed at NSC meetings. Top Obama adviser David Axelrod attended some meetings, though he never had a standing invitation, as Bannon now does. The last place you want to put somebody who worries about politics is in a room where theyre talking about national security, Obamas former Defense secretary and CIA director, Leon Panetta, told the New York Times. Former Defense secretary and CIA director Robert Gates, who served under both Bush and Obama, said that the demotions of the National Intelligence director and the Joint Chiefs of Staff chair were a big mistake (though he wasnt bothered by Bannons new gig). Obamas former national security adviser, Susan Rice, called the NSC reshuffling stone cold crazy. Press secretary Sean Spicer defended the shake-up, saying it would streamline decision-making, and pointed to Bannons time in the Navy and his tremendous understanding of the world and the geopolitical landscape as proof that he was qualified to be on the committee. But many, including Senator John McCain, remained skeptical. The role of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has been diminished, I understand, with this reorganization. The one person who is indispensable would be the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in my view, said McCain on Sundays Face the Nation. I am worried about the National Security Council. Who are the members of it and who are the permanent members? The appointment of Mr. Bannon is something which is a radical departure from any National Security Council in history. That wasnt the only Trump-related criticism McCain had this weekend. Also on Sunday, he and fellow Republican senator Lindsey Graham issued a joint statement on the presidents entry ban: It is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trumps executive order was not properly vetted, they said. We are particularly concerned by reports that this order went into effect with little to no consultation with the Departments of State, Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security. We fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security. A few other Republicans  including Senators Ben Sasse, Jeff Flake, and Bob Corker, as well as Representatives Raul Labrador, Michael McCaul, and Charlie Dent  questioned various aspects of the order and its execution over the weekend, but only McCain and Graham managed to get a response from Trump on Twitter:"}, {"date": "2017/01/30", "title": "Democrats Secret Weapon: Republicans Own Everything Now", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/democrats-secret-weapon-republicans-own-everything-now.html", "text": " Without question, January 20 was a depressing day for left-of-center Americans generally, and Democrats in particular. Its a mistake to sugarcoat that fact, or to minimize the potentially disastrous implications of a President Trump and a radically conservative Republican Congress. But there is a silver lining for the Donkey Party that could be a lot shinier than depressed Democrats realized when Donald Trump took the oath of office: At that moment, they handed off the terrible political burden of being held responsible for a status quo in Washington and in national life that sizable majorities of citizens simply dont like. Even as some Clinton supporters probably could not help thinking of the Inauguration Day they had imagined and expected, they should remember that what they failed to secure was hardly a bowl of cherries. Consider this election-eve tableau from one of the many Doomed Democrats pieces floating around since November 8: The backlash, that is, to a decade of Democratic control of the White House. The control is gone, and with it, more than likely, the backlash. For the first time since 2006, Democrats can look forward to midterm elections without a sense of foreboding, given the long history of poor showings in nonpresidential contests for the presidential party. And 2006 itself should offer solace. After all, George W. Bush brought a Republican Congress in with him in 2004 after a campaign in which he barely bothered to appeal to voters beyond his partys base. Within two years, Karl Roves plans for an enduring GOP majority were in shambles, control of Congress was gone, and Bushs approval ratings were at 40 percent and headed down. Given the already low popularity of Trump and the GOP  and for that matter, of much of their common agenda  a bad midterm is not at all hard to envision. Yes, the GOP will benefit from a ridiculously positive Senate landscape in 2018. And yes, it will also continue to benefit, at both the U.S. House and state-legislative levels, from the effects of its overwhelming control of the last decennial redistricting cycle (though its worth noting the GOP was supposed to have had a lock on the House in the last decade, too, until it ended in 2006). But even if there are factors that might limit Democratic gains in 2018, significant gains are likely. Indeed, the antiWhite House sentiment that usually fuels out-party performance in midterms may be compounded two years from now by an underlying anti-Washington mood that could turn on Donald Trump with a special intensity. As one Democratic strategist recently suggested: All those people who voted for both Obama and Trump look like reliable anti-Washington voters primed to boomerang against the GOP now that the other guys are in charge. There is, however, one structural handicap Democrats have recently had in midterms. Their coalition now depends heavily on precisely those voters who have been, since time immemorial, least likely to participate in nonpresidential elections: young and minority voters. Conversely, the Republican base skews older and whiter, and older and whiter voters are disproportionately more likely to show up for midterms. As President Obama recently said: What I was able to do during my campaigns, I wasnt able to do during midterms. I didnt crack the code on that. For Democrats, cracking the midterm code more than likely means generating the kind of serious grassroots mojo that will help motivate and then mobilize turnout. And thats where Inauguration Day and the day just after it offered another bit of potential good news for Democrats: The massive marches and protests we are seeing make the progressive uprising against George W. Bush look like a sandbox temper tantrum. That is only more true after this past weekend and the massive backlash against Trumps temporary travel ban against seven Muslim countries. There is nothing about Donald Trump (or Paul Ryan or Mitch McConnell) that suggests these protests will go away any time soon. And already, some Democratic thinkers can envision a passionate, if diffuse, grassroots movement emulating the tea partys success eight years ago in channeling public fear and frustration into pressure on officeholders in both parties and into preparation for the midterms. Indeed, this could be just what the donkey ordered: a relentless grassroots campaign of resistance to Trump and his allies, combined with a strategically and tactically flexible cadre of Democrats in Congress prepared to wage guerrilla warfare against GOP plans while staying alert to opportunities to exploit GOP divisions. Such divisions (not to mention confusion and disarray) are popping up everywhere, on issues ranging from defense spending to taxes to Obamacare. And the leadership of a lone-wolf eccentric like Donald Trump means they will probably continue to erupt. But even if total partisan war consumes Washington, a campaign of progressive resistance could not but help Democrats turn out their vote in 2018. Some Democrats worry about the lack of any one national leader. Obviously enough, Republicans didnt have one either in 2010 or 2014. And in fact, the effectiveness of Democratic resistance to the new regime both in Washington and around the country almost certainly depends on no longer wasting energy on replaying 2016s contest for national leadership. They should not transfer those divisions into a DNC-chair fight, which is far more damaging than anything that could be gained from having an ideal person in that essentially marginal job (as Theodore White once put it, party chairs are the fools gold of American politics). So donkeys would be well advised not to look back, but to realize in this dark hour for their cause, things actually are looking up. If the early days of Donald Trumps presidency represent not the high point of his strange appeal but the beginning of some sort of pro-right-wing realignment, then progressives have bigger problems than how they do in the next few months or years. But more likely, the turbulent reign of Trump will undo either him or his party, or both, and the next midterms  and perhaps even the off-year elections of 2017, in Virginia and New Jersey  will show that all the obituaries for the doomed Democratic Party are vastly premature. If Americans continue to have a jaundiced view of politics and 21st-century life, the guy who promised to make America great again is probably going to get a healthy portion of the blame."}, {"date": "2017/01/29", "title": "Protests Against Trumps Travel Ban Break Out Across America", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/protests-against-trumps-travel-ban-break-out-across-america.html", "text": " Protests against President Trumps anti-immigrant executive actions  particularly the one on Friday that banned refugees and citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the U.S.  expanded and spread on Sunday.

It seemed to cement for all time the defeat of Adamss vision of an active federal government that would invest in education and infrastructure, and the triumph of the Southern vision of slavery and weak central authority. I fell, and with me fell, I fear never to rise again the system of internal improvement by national means and national energies, he wrote in 1837, according to Louisa Thomas, and mourned that the defeats would rivet into perpetuity the clanking chain of the slave. Long-term pessimism about the liberal project has come roaring back in style since the election. Barack Obamas pet line, the moral arc of the universe is long, but it bends toward justice, has been hauled out for a great deal of public mockery on all sides. The liberal coastal elite has wallowed in self-flagellation about their failure to understand the great country, a sentiment Donald Trumps henchmen have exploited to cast the news media as an alien appendage from the real America and its deep, mystical bond with the new president. (They dont understand this country, claims Steve Bannon, They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States.) But the events of the last two weeks, both of which have seen massive nationwide protests against the new presidency, suggest a different conclusion. It is Trump who does not understand this country. And it is Obamas vision of the country that will ultimately win out. The election has provided ample reasons for alarm. But it is important to have some clarity about what we ought to fear. The federal government is in the hands of an extremist claque. It will probably carry out enormous amounts of terrible policy, and the tail risks of permanent disasters arising from misgovernance  new Katrinas, new Iraq Wars, or worse  are terrifyingly high. On the other hand, there is no reason to believe Trump is actually good at politics. He has the largest popular-vote deficit of any president ever elected and comes into office with historically low approval ratings. The only things he has done well are to gauge correctly the fecklessness of his Republican rivals, who he understood would fall in line behind him even after he smeared and bullied them mercilessly, and to beat up on Hillary Clinton while James Comey, Vladimir Putin, and the national media pinned her arms behind her. Some liberal journalists have greeted each new Trump action by solemnly insisting that we take him literally and that he will do what he says. But what exactly should we take literally? His promise to provide terrific health insurance that covers everybody, at lower cost? Forcing Mexico to pay for the wall? Resuscitating the declining coal industry? The complete eradication of Islamic terrorism? The most competent president would not achieve these goals. And Trump is a political amateur who has surrounded himself with other political amateurs. He will wreak a fearful toll on this country before he is finished, but the assumption that Trump will do what he promises extends him credit he does not deserve. The argument of my new book is that Trump (who was an important character in it even before the election) represents the death rattle of a declining vision of American retrenchment, and Obama represents the future. The civic values our grandchildren will celebrate and be taught in schools will be Obamas, not Trumps. American history is punctuated with horrors. Yet the reality is that life in the United States is better  more affluent and more egalitarian  than it was 50 years ago, and 50 years ago it was better than 50 years before that, at which point it was better than a half-century before. Obamas story about the arc of history does not imply that progress moves forward steadily and without interruption, or that liberals should adapt to complacency, or that progress will occur without conflict. Indeed, that conflict has burned for more than two centuries. What we now call the struggle between red and blue America was the same basic divide that pit Adams against Andrew Jackson. Blue America envisions a positive role for government in developing the talents of all its citizens, regardless of identity. Red America intertwines a suspicion of elites and centralized authority with a commitment to racial revanchism. Adamss fatalistic assessment 180 years ago seemed accurate at the time, after his party had suffered three consecutive defeats. And, indeed, his Whigs would suffer a series of misfortunes leading to its ultimate expiration within two decades. Yet, in the long run, Adamss ideas won out. Slavery was abolished in 1865, a national bank was established in 1913, and the federal government actively invested in education and infrastructure, all as Adams had dreamed. From the vantage point of the twenty-first century, writes historian Daniel Walker Howe, we can see that the Whigs, though not the dominant party of their own time, were the party of Americas future. Why have the successes of blue America proven more durable than those of red America? One reason is that liberal politics has a better record of producing successful policies. For all the rage conservatives have generated against Obamacare, it is fulfilling its goals and providing access to medical care to people who are too poor or sick to afford it. When Republicans gathered Friday to strategize on health care, a secret recording revealed that they havent the faintest idea how to proceed. Trumps immigration crackdown was drafted and executed in an absurd fashion. It looks like what an intern came up with over a lunch hour, one lawyer told Ben Wittes. My take is that it is so poorly written that its hard to tell the impact. Demographic change is another source of liberal confidence that has sustained a lot of post-election mockery. Yet the fact remains that Republicans remain heavily dependent on running up large margins among the oldest voters. The youngest cohort has remained about as staunchly Democrat today as it was in 2008. Americans under the age of 30 are far more racially diverse than their parents and grandparents, and young whites are far less likely to vote Republican. The Trump coalition can win an election, but its margin for error is shrinking. The blue coalition has weaknesses of its own. Liberal voters have a congenital tendency to sulk when Democrats hold the presidency. And the younger voters Democrats have come to rely on turn out less reliably than the Republican base. But the Womens March last weekend, and the immigration protests this weekend, have drawn on powerful American ideals: inclusion, social mobility, and optimism. Obamaism may have lost control of the levers of government, but it has never lost the country."}, {"date": "2017/01/29", "title": "Giuliani Says Travel Ban Was Legal Way to Enact Trumps Muslim Ban", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/giuliani-says-trump-order-was-legal-way-to-enact-muslim-ban.html", "text": " Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, during a Saturday interview on Fox News, seemed to indicate that the executive order President Trump signed on Friday was, by design, the best legal way to fulfill Trumps desire to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. without illegally banning Muslims. Recounting the process which led to the new executive order, Giuliani said that Trump had asked him to put a commission together to come up with the right way to implement Trumps oft-proposed Muslim ban, legally. To accomplish that, the commission, which included lawmakers and lawyers, then decided that instead of religion, danger would be the focus, according to Giuliani. During his presidential campaign, Trump had repeatedly called for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S., citing fears of terrorism. The new presidents executive order temporarily bans citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, as well as all refugees, from entering the United States, including an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees. The areas of the world that create danger for us, which is a factual basis, not a religious basis, Giuliani remarked on Saturday, Perfectly legal, perfectly sensible. The seven countries included in the ban, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, were chosen because they had already been selected under an amended 2015 Obama administration bill, which had restricted those countries citizens from the U.S. visa waiver program, having identified the nations as safe havens for terrorists. In fact, no terrorists from any of the seven countries in the Obama bill or Trump order have conducted fatal attacks in the U.S. over the past three-plus decades, and Obamas bill, at the time, was largely seen as a measure of security theater, following recent terrorist attacks both in the U.S. and around the world. Trump administration officials have also pointed out that the list of banned countries can, and likely will, grow. Giuliani, Trump, and members of the Trump administration have all repeatedly insisted that Trumps new executive order is not a Muslim ban.

Of course, as with virtually every executive order that the pen-happy, plan-lite new president has sought over his first week-plus in office, the details as to how these actions will actually play out isnt totally clear. For instance, there is no explanation how the Trump administration will enforce the lifetime ban on lobbying for other countries after it is no longer in the White House, if they can even correctly determine who is or isnt lobbying in the first place, since there are now plenty of ways to lobby the government without registering as an official lobbyist. Regarding the security-council reorganizations,People have talked about doing this for a long time, Trump assured reporters at the signing ceremony. Like, many years. That apparently long-sought plan is to restructure the councils so they are more adaptive to modern threats like those posed by hackers and terrorists. Its not clear how the restructuring will accomplish that goal, and analysis of the late-released text of the executive order was still underway as of mid-Saturday evening.

The intended results are saving an unknowably large amount of people on a humanitarian level. Looking at the text, Trump wants a comprehensive strategy, new rules of engagement, and some new partners identified to join the U.S. anti-ISIS coalition, which may or may not include Russia, as often mentioned by Trump and his national-security advisor, Michael Flynn. Its not yet clear if U.S. military planners have anything in mind that would mark an actual departure from the current U.S. strategy. I think its going to be very successful, Trump nonetheless remarked of the unknown plan.

Now, the lies that Donald Trump tells himself to protect his ego appear poised to serve a similar function. Unwilling to accept that more Americans cast ballots for Hillary Clinton on November 8, the president has spent much of his first week in office explaining that he actually won the popular vote once you subtract the 3 to 5 million undocumented immigrants who all, to a person, cast ballots for his opponent.

Just a few months ago, it looked like one of Americas most resolute pro-choice pols was about to win the presidency. Before that, it appeared the right-to-life movements iron grip on the GOP might slip, as someone who owed it nothing won the Republican presidential nomination. But now everythings coming up roses. Donald Trump improbably won in November, after passing all sorts of initiation tests for enrollment in the RTL cause. The GOP controls both houses of Congress, even as pro-choice Republicans are hunted to virtual extinction. After successfully convincing Senate Republicans to break all precedent by sitting on an Obama Supreme Court nomination for nearly a year, RTLers can look forward to a Trump selection for the high court chosen from a list carefully pre-vetted by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society, both places where anyone not sworn to favor the overturning of Roe v. Wade would not make it past the first job interview. Trump has already performed the traditional first-day act of GOP presidential allegiance to the cause by reviving (and actually expanding) the so-called Mexico City Rules banning use of U.S. funds by any international organization thought to promote abortion. And hes signed off on other RTL priorities, like a permanent version of the Hyde Amendment banning use of federal funds for abortions here at home. Cheerful as they were as they listened today to a speech from an old friend who is suddenly very powerful, Vice-President Mike Pence, some RTLers may pause to realize they were at this juncture before, 16 years ago. Thats when the only Republican president rivaling Ronald Reagan as a vocal supporter of elevating the rights of the unborn over the rights of grown-up women took office, George W. Bush. Unlike his old man, W. was not a late-life convert to the cause of outlawing abortion. His conservative evangelical reputation gave RTLers a reason to believe his stated convictions. And he more or less delivered. He was the first Republican president since Herbert Hoover who did not appoint a Supreme Court justice complicit in creating or defending the constitutional right to choose. And he extended the anti-abortion fight into new territory with his opposition to federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research. But it was on another symbolic issue that both Bush and the RTL movement experienced a Waterloo in 2005: the bizarre, unsuccessful effort, which included a special session of Congress, to intervene in a state courts direction of end-of-life care for a Florida woman named Terri Schiavo. The Schiavo incident was an exercise in egregious hubris that may have set back the cause by many years. On the all-important legal front, the Bush era witnessed what initially appeared to be a breakthrough that challenged the inviolability of abortion rights: the 2007 Gonzales v. Carhart decision. Carhart not only upheld a federal ban on so-called partial-birth abortion, but seemed, through the majority opinion from Justice Anthony Kennedy, to open a whole new line of challenges to Roe v. Wade, by making dubious claims involving the health of the woman seeking an abortion a rationale for letting legislators deny her the procedure. Republican-controlled state government flooded through this opening (especially after the GOP landslide of 2010) with all sorts of TRAP (Targeted Restrictions on Abortion Providers) laws ostensibly regulating conditions in abortion clinics but clearly aimed at shutting them down. And then, in a very good demonstration of how capricious constitutional law can be in this area, the same Justice Kennedy who opened this door helped slam it shut, by concurring with Justice Breyers 2016 opinion in Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt that Texass classic TRAP law on clinic requirements constituted an undue burden on abortion rights. Kennedys position in this 53 decision pretty clearly indicated that after Justice Antonin Scalias death there are only three reliable votes on the Court to reverse or seriously restrict Roe. And so all those Marchers for Life understand that they need at least two SCOTUS appointments from their unlikely champion Donald Trump before they can proclaim victory and turn their attentions to vicious state-by-state trench warfare against legalized abortion. The wiser among them surely understand that while they avoided disaster last November, triumph could be far away, and will in no small part rely on perhaps the most erratic chief executive since Nixon, the Republican who placed on the Court the justice (Harry Blackmun) who wrote Roe v.

Both May and Trump began by praising the special relationship between the U.S. and U.K. May emphasized the importance of a trade deal between the two countries, given plans for the U.K. to leave the European Union. Trump, meanwhile, praised the British people for voting to leave the E.U., calling it a wonderful thing, and patted himself on the back for predicting Brexit, while squeezing in a plug for his golf course in Scotland. Despite the pressers short running time, Trump made several other headlines on NATO, Russia, and Mexico. Regarding NATO, Trump appeared to step back from his position that it is obsolete. While he didnt say so himself, Trump did tell May that he is 100 percent behind NATO. Or so she says. Trump also touched on his scheduled call with Russian president Vladimir Putin. He repeated his position that it would be ideal for the U.S. to have a positive working relationship with Russia, but said he doesnt know if that will happen. He added that it is very early to be talking about lifting sanctions on Russia, seemingly leaving the door open to do just that. May was more forceful in her comments on Russia. As far as the U.K. is concerned on sanctions on Russia in relation to their activities in Ukraine, we have been very clear that we want to see the Minsk Agreement fully implemented, she said, referencing the plan to bring long-term peace to Eastern Ukraine. Trump was also asked about an hour-long phone call he had Friday morning with Mexican president Enrique Pea Nieto. Thursday, Nieto cancelled a planned trip to the U.S. to meet with Trump. Despite their public spat over Trumps border wall, the two leaders had a very, very friendly call, Trump said. Though he declared his love for the Mexican people, Trump said, The United States cannot continue to lose vast amounts of business, vast amounts of companies, and millions and millions of people losing their jobs. So we are going to renegotiate our trade deals. And were going to renegotiate other aspects of our relationship with Mexico, he added. What Trump did not mention was an agreement reached with Nieto to not speak publicly about this controversial issue [the wall] for now. News of that agreement comes in a release from Nietos office. The countdown to when Trump violates that agreement, probably on Twitter, begins now."}, {"date": "2017/01/27", "title": "Republicans Even More Clueless on Obamacare in Private Than in Public", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/gop-quietly-admits-there-will-be-no-obamacare-replacement.html", "text": " The history of the development of the Republican alternative to Obamacare since the beginning of the health-care debate, in 2009, has been an endless loop of loud promises that a full plan will be announced soon, followed by quiet admissions that it will not. Seventeen days ago, Donald Trump promised a vote to repeal the law probably some time next week with a vote for a replacement very quickly or simultaneously, very shortly thereafter. At a meeting in Philadelphia yesterday, Trump and his House Republican allies produced no agreement on a plan. If there is a consensus, it is that there will be no replacement plan at all. Representative Greg Walden, a key leader of the House Republican efforts on health care, tells Julie Rovner, Theres no single fix. Theres no single plan. Representative Marsha Blackburn touted bills to limit medical malpractice lawsuits and to allow the sale of state-regulated insurance across state lines. Neither of these proposals would have any significant impact on insurance coverage. If Obamacare is repealed, this would leave the individual-health-insurance market a smoldering crater. Republicans are portraying the lack of a plan as a philosophical aversion to lengthy legislation. If youre waiting for another 2,700-page bill to emerge, youre going to have to wait until the sun doesnt come up, because thats not how were going to do it, says Walden. You may not need 2,700 pages of legislative text. But you cant blow up the health-care system and replace it with a series of piecemeal measures. Any real plan to provide even crappy coverage  let alone the better, more affordable coverage Trump has repeatedly promised  is going to need to be paid for. Making those trade-offs means figuring out some big-picture strategy for where the money will come from. The reason health-care reform is done by assembling a big bill with a high page count is that all the stakeholders want to know beforehand whether the final product will be acceptable to them. Hospitals or insurers or doctors or drug makers might be willing to accept provisions that hurt their bottom line if there are other provisions that help them. But they wont support passing a bill that hurts them on the promise of getting help in a future bill, because they dont know whether the future bill will pass. Going step by step is a talking point, not a plausible way to actually write laws. Step-by-step changes could work if they leave the current system in place and alter it incrementally. But if you blow the market up, you need comprehensive changes to rebuild something in its place. Several Senate Republicans have expressed severe reservations about repealing Obamacare without having a replacement. Now the House is admitting there isnt going to be a replacement. So now the choice falls to Republicans to either defeat repeal, or allow the system to hurtle toward chaos. Update: The Washington Post has obtained a recording of House and Senate Republicans meeting over how to proceed on Obamacare. The meeting, held privately, suggests that Republicans have even less idea over how to proceed than their public comments suggest. There appears to be no consensus on anything. Can Republicans repeal the law through a budget-reconciliation bill, and then try to pass a replacement later? They dont know. (The fact is, we cannot repeal Obamacare through reconciliation, says Representative Tom McClintock. We need to understand exactly, what does that reconciliation market look like? And I havent heard the answer yet.) Are they going to keep the laws expansion of Medicaid? They dont even agree on attaching a measure to defund Planned Parenthood. Numerous members expressed fears about the backlash they would face by snatching coverage from 20 million Americans. They have spent eight years promising to implement something better, and the Republican Party is still gawking at a whiteboard trying to figure out step one."}, {"date": "2017/01/27", "title": "Trump Just Undermined Americans Access to Healthcare Out of Sheer Spite", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-undermines-americans-healthcare-access-out-of-spite.html", "text": " If the Republican Party repealed the Affordable Care Act without a replacement, 18 million people would lose their health insurance, the budget deficit would rise, and tens of thousands of Americans would die. These are all indisputably bad things  no politician, of either party, has ever campaigned on a platform of reduced insurance access, a higher federal debt, and more preventable deaths. Still, one could not fairly claim that no Americans would benefit from ACA repeal. Millionaire investors would see their capital gains taxed at a lower rate; young, healthy people would likely see their premiums go down as insurers left people with preexisting conditions to their fates; and conservatives who believe that every American  no matter their color, creed, or annual income  should have the freedom to die from a curable illness would see their ideology affirmed. But the Trump administrations latest attack on Obamacare will benefit no one  except, perhaps, some career politicians in Washington, D.C. This week, the White House cancelled advertisements alerting consumers to the upcoming enrollment deadline for 2017 coverage under the ACA  even though the ads had already been paid for, according to Obama administration officials who spoke with Politico. Since human beings have a tendency to put off filling out boring paperwork for as long as possible, the final days of enrollment season are crucial. With the aid of increased advertising and outreach during this period, the ACA marketplaces have consistently enjoyed last-minute surges in sign-ups. But now, the Trump administration is trying to prevent such a surge from happening. Lower ACA enrollment does not help anyone. It is bad for insurers, bad for those who will go uninsured due to ignorance about the deadline, and bad for any American who wants to pay a lower premium next year  last-minute sign-ups come disproportionately from young and healthy people, for whom health insurance is not a pressing concern. The more such consumers get in the habit of buying health insurance, the lower the costs in the future should be for everyone else. The only people who would immediately benefit from weaker enrollment are Republicans on Capitol Hill, who are struggling to find a way of throwing millions off of their health insurance  without getting blamed for having done so. The best thing that could happen for Paul Ryan and friends would be if the ACAs marketplaces just collapsed by themselves. As Jonathan Cohn explains in the Huffington Post: But even as a piece of cynical, political sabotage, Trumps move accomplishes little. By January 4, 8.8 million individuals had signed up for ACA coverage  already an increase over the previous year. While Trumps actions could prevent the program from hitting its forecast of 13.8 million enrollees, no collapse-inducing drop-off is forthcoming. Thus, the only genuine benefit of Trumps decision to cancel the ads might be this: The president has just informed the American people that he cares more about tarnishing his predecessors legacy than improving our nations health-care system. An earlier version of this post reported that the Trump administration had shut down email outreach on ACA enrollment. While sources within the Health and Human Services Department and Congress had told Politico that this was the administrations new policy earlier in the week, on Friday, email outreach was resumed."}, {"date": "2017/01/27", "title": "Jason Miller, Former Trump Insider, Hired by Former Clinton Insider", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/former-trump-insider-hired-by-former-clinton-insider.html", "text": " Jason Miller, a one-time member of Donald Trumps inner circle, has a new job at a D.C. consulting firm that was founded by the man credited with running Bill Clinton Inc.

Since Donald Trump became president while securing less than a third of the vote in California, the Yes California campaign  a.k.a. Calexit  has gotten a lot of attention and perhaps even some momentum in getting an initial measure placed on the 2018 general election ballot. An estimated 7,000 volunteers have begun amassing the 585,407 signatures necessary to place a constitutional amendment on the 2018 ballot deleting the states adherence to the United States and authorizing a 2019 referendum on independence. The arguments for Calexit are pretty simple: The state is drifting ever-further away from the rest of the country in cultural attitudes and public policies, especially with respect to immigration and the environment. Californias size and wealth (its GDP is similar to that of France) make it the one state that might make a go of it alone. It is also a donor state when it comes to the relationship of federal taxes collected from Californians to the federal spending conducted there; one recent analysis showed California ranking 46th among the states in relative dependence on Washington. But its clear the main reason for sudden interest in Calexit is Donald J. Trump, and the possibility a federal Republican regime under his direction would preempt California preferences on a wide range of issues. Even though Governor Jerry Brown and other statewide Democratic elected officials have kept their distance from Calexit, the saber-rattling they have conducted about the states willingness to fight Trump and the GOP in court has undoubtedly fed the Calexit sentiment. The latest Trump provocation, threatening sanctuary cities with the cancellation of all federal funds, is being perceived by both his friends and enemies as mainly aimed at the Golden State. Having said all that, the process required to make Calexit a reality is not just daunting: Its basically impossible. The first part is the easiest: If Yes California can get its initiative onto the 2018 ballot, it needs only 50-percent-plus-one approval to amend the state constitution. But then the 2019 referendum it authorizes is on shaky legal ground, and according to Yes Californias own ground rules, it would only pass if 50 percent of registered voters participated and 55 percent voted for independence. The participation standard alone sets a pretty high bar for success in an off-year election; turnout in the last regular midterm election was only 42 percent. If a Calexit referendum in California succeeded, of course, it would only take effect if the rest of the country went along with it. That would mean a constitutional amendment requiring two-thirds votes in Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the states, or the first constitutional convention since 1787. The only alternative, unilateral secession, was tried in 1861, as close scholars of history could tell you, and it did not work out well. What the whole Calexit movement really represents is a cry of defiance against Trump, and against the temporary national triumph of people who are fine with melting down the polar ice caps to build more strip malls, instituting racial profiling as a cherished national law-enforcement policy, and criminalizing abortion. Any number of developments could take the steam out of Calexit, including the collapse of the Republican Party amid internecine quarreling. In any case, it aint happening  but its still a convenient lightning rod for real West Coast fury. And interest in the idea will get a boost from contemptuous conservatives who have long regarded the state as a nature preserve for hippies, sodomites, and border-crashers. Theres nothing like the prospect of secession to dramatize Americans very real differences."}, {"date": "2017/01/27", "title": "Trump and Putin to Talk Saturday and Lifting Sanctions Is Under Consideration", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-and-putin-to-talk-saturday.html", "text": " President Donald Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin will talk on the phone Saturday, their first time speaking since a congratulatory phone call Putin made after the election, the Kremlin announced Friday.

She said the two leaders would discuss where they can find common ground and specifically mentioned finding ways the U.S. and Russia could maybe defeat radical Islamic terrorism. In a separate interview on Fox & Friends, Conway said the call could include discussions on removing Russian sanctions.

But Bannon did blaze new trails by suggesting in an interview with the New York Times that getting the 2016 presidential outcome wrong should permanently disqualify media types from, well, pursuing their profession: Obviously Bannon is using the many failed predictions of a Clinton presidential victory as just the biggest stick nearby with which to beat his long-time media enemies and rivals. But the persistent suggestions (mostly, but not entirely, from conservatives) that political journalism showed its cluelessness by failing to anticipate Trumps win should make journalists spend some time in understanding where they went wrong. As it happens, data journalist Nate Silver has been exploring this topic in some detail recently. Hes in a pretty good position to do so, in part because of the harsh criticism he received late in the campaign (some of it later retracted) for not writing off Trump entirely, and in part because hes an expert on polls, the alleged inaccuracy of which were the most common excuse offered by journalists for overrating Clintons odds of victory. Actually, as Silver has explained, the national polls  most of which predicted a narrow Clinton win in the popular vote, which is exactly what happened  were more accurate in 2016 than they were in 2012, when they underrated Barack Obamas standing. Yes, state polls were off a bit more, but thats often the case, and the bigger problem is that there wasnt much high-quality polling in several of the states that gave Trump his upset. So why were so many journalists so confident Clinton was going to win? Silver has examined a lot of factors, including a misunderstanding of the fundamentals as favoring Clinton, the overplaying of early voting numbers that seemed to give the Democrats a big battleground-state edge, and the underplaying of the possibility that an unusually high number of undecided voters might break toward Trump. I imagine before he is done Silver will address the deep-seated belief that Clintons campaign was a powerful turnout machine while Trumps was incompetent. But the question of what journalists got wrong leads inevitably to the question of what they  we  should have been doing. And Silver thinks a lot of journalists are getting that wrong, too: Ive certainly heard that a lot. But its a bit of a shallow argument when you think it through. The reality is that no reporters go out there randomly talking to human beings with the goal of figuring out whos going to win a close election. More often than not, they have a hypothesis about whats happening and they find people who will challenge or (more likely) validate it. Perhaps the most celebrated got it right reporter of the 2016 elections, Salena Zito, didnt just happen upon the non-college-educated white voters she so frequently interviewed about their affection for Donald Trump; she went looking for them. And if a relative handful of votes in a few states had gone the other way and Trump had lost, her reporting would have been no better or worse. The trouble is a lot of journalists are reacting to 2016 by concluding they need less, not more information  fewer polls, reduced reliance on Big Data. Silver is arguing they often need more of all these things, but more than anything else, need to understand uncertainty. Im probably as guilty as anybody in thinking Clinton was going to win, for many of the reasons Silver cites. But I never publicly called it a done deal or stopped paying attention to what I could discern, and I did twice write pieces explaining Trumps path to victory. So sorry, Mr. Bannon, Im not going to keep my mouth shut, if only because you and your colleagues on Team Trump were hardly conceived in the crucible of infallibility, and need to show some humility yourselves."}, {"date": "2017/01/27", "title": "These Are Some of the Last American Citizens Naturalized Under Obama", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/these-are-some-of-the-last-americans-naturalized-under-obama.html", "text": " At 11:05 a.m. on Friday the 13th of January, an Iranian woman was the first to check in for New Yorks last naturalization ceremony during Barack Obamas presidency. She approached the kiosk alone  her husband was too ill to accompany her  and, when she handed over her green card, began to cry. Her journey had begun way back in 1996, she later explained, when she left Iran with her husband, two children, and $15,000 in her bank account. Her tears set the tone for what many staff on duty that day described as one of the more emotionally loaded citizenship ceremonies they have experienced at 26 Federal Plaza. A total of 95 people from 41 different countries officially became American, but it was a video message from the president that turned the room into an emotional hotbox. One 39-year-old, from Senegal, said his aunt had been teasing him about getting his letter of citizenship from Donald Trump. I was like no! I do not want that letter, he said. When I opened the envelope and I saw Obamas signature I was jumping up and down. Juana, 34, Dominican Republic A few days ago, it was like I didnt exactly belong. But today, the morning after the ceremony, I woke up feeling like a different person. Knowing Im a citizen felt like a dream. I cant put all the emotions into words. I was so happy. I smiled all day and I hurt my face because I was smiling so hard. Today I feel more friendly. I have rights. Now I can vote! They played a video of Obama speaking and he said that if we give back to America just a little bit we can make change. I felt sad seeing him because I dont know what the other president will do. But I also loved seeing him and hearing his words because I knew they were from his heart. It was like, hes a human  and hes a human who knows what its like to not always feel like you belong. They talked about Martin Luther King Jr. and how he got so many people to make a little bit of change and I was almost crying because its true, and I am part of this history now, too. Papa, 39, Senegal My father moved here in 1984, when I was only 2 years old, and now I am 39. In the beginning, I did not like it here. I only spoke French; I didnt speak any English. I had to learn English myself from watching TV  I was watching those devil movies and laughing. You know, like Friday the 13th? Id watch them over and over again. Its funny; I got my citizenship on Friday the 13th! I got out of D.C.; I needed 24-hour culture, and fashion. D.C. was not my space, so I joined my aunty in Harlem. Yesterday was like a daydream, or a fantasy. As soon as I read the papers they sent me about the ceremony I decided to wear a suit, and I only have one. My aunt bought me the tie from Macys. I had to work but I told her I wanted a black one with a specific design. We were FaceTime-ing while she chose my tie. She was there with me yesterday and I looked at her and she was crying. I said, Why are you crying! She said, Because you are so happy and I love you and you are such a kind boy and I am so happy for you. I said, I dont want you to cry because I will, too. I have a son who lives in Senegal, I havent seen him for five years. I miss him so much and he wants me to come visit so bad, but I havent been able to afford it. Each time we talk I am crying. Now I can make plans to have him and my mom here with me for good. But back to Friday the 13th. I was happy, but I knew if I thought hard about it I would be sad about everyone who cant have this. All those people who have been here 40 years and they have no papers. They are so scared. We dont know what Trump is going to do  we dont know. When I woke up today I was like, I am still from Senegal. If you ask me tomorrow I will say I am an American citizen but I am not going to go into detail and I will not tell people unless they ask. And thats because I dont want to brag about it. I know I got lucky. Constance, 52, France My husband of 26 years, an American, came with me to the ceremony. He was very emotional  he comes from a family that has always had a great sense of civic duty. We celebrated with New York oysters in the evening. Aside from avoiding the harassment every time I go through U.S. immigration, Im happiest about joining my husband and my three sons. And I am very proud to join this great nation. I have a photo that shows the flag my grandmother and her sisters sewed 72 years ago to welcome the U.S. soldiers about to liberate their town in eastern France. She loved the U.S.  and Louis Armstrong! She would have been so happy  Maru, Argentina It was funny that the ceremony took place on Friday the 13th. Lots of friends made fun of that, you know: Bad luck for America lolz. I told them that beyond anything else I was so grateful to become American under Obamas presidency. The most meaningful moment during the ceremony was when I watched Obama welcome us to the United States. His speech is actually the only thing I recorded. Im unbelievably proud to be an American under his excellent presidency. We moved to New York before he got elected and Ill never forget the night he won. Pure magic. New York was on fire that night. I could live off that energy forever. We all know that theres a ton of work to do to make sure the new president is not normalized. I see so many petitions and actions that American citizens can take to make sure there are checks and balances in place and that the government is held accountable for its actions. Before Friday I could never sign any of those. I could never speak to my representative. Now I can, and you bet I will  in fact Im registering to vote this week. Ana, 30, Dominican Republic I was so proud to watch Obama speak on that video. I was proud of him not only as a president but as a humble man who knew how to reach his people. Maybe we were the last to hear those words. When I watched him speak I was thinking about how excellent he was as president. His words were spoken as if he knows us. I was happy and emotional because this country is difficult and hard but I know that everything I have been through since I got here has made me strong and independent. I was proud of myself. It is another step. This is an achievement. Maybe I am just a grain of sand, but together with others one grain of sand becomes thousands, and we can make a difference. Carlos, 47, Venezuela I had mixed feelings when I surrendered my green card to the officer. A part of me felt weird because that had been my main ID for such a long time, but, on the other hand, I was excited because I knew it marked the beginning of a new life with plenty of goals, opportunities, and challenges. Of course I could feel the positive energy in the room, I think we all felt it, right? I feel so fortunate that I will be able to exercise my right to vote in elections to come. I believe that it was a big mistake Donald Trump won. We all know he is a very successful businessman but I think we need an experienced politician to guide this country, and this is now my country. From now on, this is my country. Yong Zhao su, 51, China We arrived about 22 years ago. At first we stayed with relatives in Chinatown; its a typical immigrant story. We hardly knew anyone. Eventually we moved to Bensonhurst where there was also a very strong Chinese community, and now I live Chelsea. When we first got here my husband worked in restaurants in Chinatown  he was a chef back in China  and I sewed clothes. I moved on to working other low-wage jobs and now I work in child care, back in Chinatown. On Friday, I felt relief because now our entire family has citizenship. Luckily my daughter was on her break from college, so she came with me. She said that she was sad, a bit, because she knew that everyone in the room has struggled for so long to get citizenship, tests, paperwork, and answering all these questions that so many Americans dont even know. I think there were a few other Chinese people, but there were so many Dominicans! Everyone clapped so loudly when they stood up. Many people were dressed in suits and nice outfits. I cant really read in English, so my daughter looked at the instructions and told me to wear something nice. She said, Be respectful. Astero, 49, Cyprus I was 6 years old when the war happened in Cyprus. I lived with my grandmother in the village. I survived bombings; when bullets came flying through our windows I hid with my 3-year-old brother under a table. We had to flee our village on a tractor as my grandfather did not own a car. He went back to the house that same night to feed the farm animals and was captured as a prisoner of war  Before Friday I thought that the ceremony would just be a bureaucratic exercise, but it was so much more than that. The best and most solemn part for me was when I took the oath of allegiance. It was as if, during that precise moment, I made the transition to being a U.S. citizen. It was like I crossed over. But it was a day of mixed emotions. I was happy that the long path to citizenship had successfully come to an end but I was emotional rethinking about how much it took to for me get there. I did not expect it but, by the end of the ceremony, a new sense of pride, for a country that I can now call my own, overwhelmed me. I came to the ceremony with my partner, Nicholas. It was a special day for both of us. As soon as it was over I called my family back in Cyprus to share with them the good news. Unfortunately, I had no time for a special celebration as I prepare intensively for another landmark in my life, my Ph.D. viva, which is scheduled for next Friday. I hope to have a double celebration then! Bandar, 33, arrived from Syria (via Saudi Arabia) I moved here in 2001 to attend school in Worcester, Massachusetts; I was only 19, and 2001 was a very interesting year to come to the U.S.  Not only did I have to adjust to this different culture, but I also had to adjust to post-9/11 America  the terrorist attacks happened two weeks after I got here. My immigration journey was further complicated by the introduction of screening processes to people from certain countries  I am Syrian but I grew up in Saudi Arabia. Now Ill be able to travel more freely and go back to see my family more often  I have not left the USA in almost seven years. And this also means that my family can get an immigration status and the process of them coming here to visit will be so much easier. And I am very excited to vote and participate in American democracy. I will vote in every election  so much sacrifice was made and is still being made around the world for people to obtain the right to vote and participate in picking the political, social, and economic future of their nations. Voting is a right and duty that should be cherished and honored. No one should ever say that their vote wont matter. Emilsis, 38, Dominican Republic I was in tears the whole day. I thought about the men and women who made America and especially New York a land of opportunities. I felt proud of this country, and I felt proud of myself and my parents and proud of all those people out there who make this country safe. Even though I felt very happy, I was sad, too. Happy because of the opportunities I have been given to serve others and the right to use not only my voice but my vote, but I felt sad because I was all the time thinking about the people who work as hard as I work every day in this country and have no legal documents. I came with my partner of life  I call him My Super A. We met when I was in a very hard place. I had cancer and he took care of me and wanted to marry me even though I was sick, could you imagine? I said no, because I thought I was going to die. I didnt think it was fair to him to marry someone who was going to die soon. The day of the ceremony, when we left the building, something strange happened  We are from Yonkers so we are not very familiar with the businesses in the area. In front of the Federal Plaza building there is a jewelry store. When we head to walk to the train station, a man standing outside of the jewelry store invited us to enter to see the engagement rings. Why engagement rings? I dont know. But we looked at each other and said Sure, why not? And guess what? My Super A bought the rings that day. What a day for us! Im so excited. I had to return to my job, but after work we went to celebrate at a Mexican restaurant here in Yonkers called Rancho Grande. We ate tacos, drank mojitos, and sang Juan Gabriel songs. Glenroy, 43, Jamaica That was one of those moments that you can only describe as surreal. I woke up the next day and I thought: Wow, I am a citizen of the most powerful country in the world. I was crying! It actually made me cry. The tears started when Obama spoke. I always wanted to become American under Obama. I was getting nervous knowing Trump is on his way. And as a matter of fact, they called me and told me about the ceremony only a week before. They called in case I didnt get the letter. My letter is signed by Obama. I wanted to become a citizen under Obama. I remember the first time I traveled after getting my green card. Instead of all the fingerprints and questions and fear that they will just say, Go! Go away for no reason, they said, Welcome home. You can imagine how much better it is going to be next time I leave the country and come back. When I hear those words, I am going to be so happy. You bet I will be listening for those words, and if I dont hear them I will say, excuse me, did you forget something? Abul, 60, Bangladesh My son was the one who got the call and then I got the letter. It was such short notice, less than a week. Then we got the letter and we were so excited when we saw Obamas signature  If it had been Trumps  what a joke. Im a die-hard Hillary fan and it is the saddest thing that I could not vote for her. Thats the only sad part, if only I could have voted this year. Johannes, 26, Germany I loved seeing the excitement on other peoples faces. Im privileged because I came from a safe and economically stable country, but other people in the room are not as lucky as me. The woman I sat next to told me that her parents never had the chance to make it to the U.S. after decades of trying. I had no idea what to expect on Friday and maybe I was still anxious because I actually made sure I know all the lyrics to The Star-Spangled Banner  just in case they quizzed us! Mayumi, 46, Japan When I first came to America I was here to meet a guy who lived in Los Angeles. But when I arrived his wife showed up. It was a complete shock to me, but I had a friend in New York City who invited me to come for the remainder of my visa. I was living in the Bronx, off of Watson Avenue. I didnt know it was an extremely bad area. I did get robbed. I met a guy who impressed me with his style and fun, and I enjoyed New York so much I didnt want to leave. And when I was supposed to go back to Japan he cried and begged me to stay and to marry him. I did. I felt he really wanted me and I really wanted to be part of New York. But it was a big mistake, because it turned out he had a long criminal history and he was extremely violent. Things quickly changed after we got married. I could have lost my life; he beat me and once he put a gun to my head. Finally, he was arrested after he showed up to a friends house looking for me with a gun. My life was hell for a little while, but good things always come out of bad. I met my current husband in a club at the Bronx way back in the day, and we communicated by writing on napkins, because I am deaf. Together we researched American history that we dont often read in books. I wrote my autobiography in Japan in 2000  it was called Fighto, and its about how I had to fight my way through life being deaf. Its very difficult for deaf people in Japan, and when I came to America it was a whole other experience. Paul, 33, Ireland When the speaker said Remember this flag, it may have only cost all of only 5 cents to make, but its your first American flag, remember that. I will never forget those lines. Taraneh, 56, Iran The ceremony started at 11:05 and I was the first person to get there. As soon as I went to the kiosk to hand my green card to the lady I started to sob. And I stayed very emotional the whole morning. I first came from Iran during the IranIraq war  I didnt want my son to be drafted. People born here take this country for granted. But if you work hard and you are talented you can become whatever you want. It gives you everything; you just have to want it. Those who live here, they see this from the beginning and they dont realize how lucky they are to  just express an opinion! To talk about stuff  I see people who are upset about the elections and they can open their mouth and say things about it and thats because we have democracy. It doesnt matter: You have democracy, and that is so beautiful and thats what brings you here. You get an identity when you get here. You can show your talent. You can talk-talk-talk and you can talk so openly; its not like that in my country. After being in America I realized I had some stuff inside me and I started writing music. I was able to let my talent grow. Thats what America is all about. You can get what you want if you are capable. Yasmine, 47, Nevis I came to Obamas America, so it was so emotional to reach the milestone of being a citizen just before hes going. Coming here was rough. I was a single parent, but thank God I kept struggling and going. I lived in the Bronx with family who I didnt really know, and I was treated like a stranger. It was a horrible experience for me, but I have five kids and I kept strong for them  worked as hard as I could. In June 2011 my kids finally came and we were all together. Ive cried so many times about how hard it was, but by 2012 we finally got our own apartment. I thank God every day."}, {"date": "2017/01/27", "title": "Trump Personally Called National Park Service About Inauguration Crowd Size", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-called-national-park-service-about-inauguration-size.html", "text": " In yet another sign that we are all just living in Leslie Knopes nightmare, the Washington Post reports that on his first morning in office, President Trump personally contacted acting National Park Service director Michael T. Reynolds and ordered him to produce more photos from the inauguration, believing they would prove his false claims about the size of the crowd. Reynolds was reportedly directed to call the White House on Saturday morning. In addition to requesting photos to settle his feud with the media, the president expressed his anger over the National Park Service Twitter account retweeting a photo showing that the inauguration turnout was about a third of what it was eight years ago. The retweets were later removed, and NPS spokesman Thomas Crosson apologized for mistaken RTs from our account. After the call, Reynolds forwarded more aerial photos of the inauguration crowd to the White House, but they did not support Trumps claim that more than a million people showed up to see him sworn in. In response to the story, Crosson said, The National Park Service does not comment on internal conversations among administration officials. White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tried to spin the phone call as a sign that, as a manager, Trump is so accessible, and constantly in touch. Hes not somebody who sits around and waits. He takes action and gets things done, she added. Thats one of the reasons that he is president today, and Hillary Clinton isnt.

But before that, she addressed Republican lawmakers at their retreat in Philadelphia, delivering a foreign-policy speech that stressed the importance of the United States and United Kingdoms world leadership. But she included a dash of Trump with her declaration that the days of Britain and America intervening in sovereign countries in an attempt to remake the world in our own image are over. May said for Britain there would be no return to the failed policies of the past, a clear criticism of her predecessors. At the same time, May stressed that neither Britain nor the United States could take a complete step back, saying the countries could not afford to stand idly by when the threat is real and when it is in our own interests to intervene. We must be strong, smart, and hard-headed. And we must demonstrate the resolve necessary to stand up for our interests. May also hammered the importance of the United Nations and NATO. The institutions upon which that world relies were so often conceived or inspired by our two nations working together, May said. On NATO, which Trump has criticized, the prime minister called it the cornerstone of the Wests defense. May also took a hard line against ISIS, saying Britain shares in your determination to take on and defeat Daesh and the ideology of Islamic extremism. But in perhaps a subtle rebuke to Trumps executive order to ban refugees and immigrants from certain Muslim countries, May stressed: May used Islamic extremism to segue to Syria and then to Russia. Knowing her audience, she invoked Reagan to the GOP crowd: When it comes to Russia, as so often it is wise to turn to the example of President Reagan, who, during negotiations with his opposite number Mikhail Gorbachev, used to abide by the adage trust but verify, May stated. With President Putin, my advice is to engage but beware. May also touted the importance of the Iran deal, something both the GOP and Trump has also lambasted. May concluded with her hope, as the United Kingdom prepares to leave the European Union, that the two countries could work out a favorable trade deal. Because of these strong economic and commercial links  and our shared history and the strength of our relationship  I look forward to pursuing talks with the new administration about a new U.K.-U.S. free trade agreement in the coming months, May said. It will take detailed work, but we welcome your openness to those discussions and hope we can make progress so that the new, global Britain that emerges after Brexit is even better equipped to take its place confidently in the world. May concluded with another Reaganism in a speech that appeared to mostly play well with Republican lawmakers present, even if it differed in tone and content from some of Trumps positions. Mays promise of avoiding interventionism nodded to Trumps America First statements, but she also returned again and again to the the history of Britain and the United States special relationship, appearing to remind her audience of the dangers of taking its isolationism too far. But May still has to sit down with Trump before she leaves the U.S. She told reporters she believes she can work with the new president because sometimes opposites attract."}, {"date": "2017/01/26", "title": "Bannon Calls Press the Opposition Party, Which Should Keep Its Mouth Shut", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/bannon-tells-press-to-keep-its-mouth-shut.html", "text": " President Trumps chief White House strategist and former Breitbart News head Steve Bannon granted a rare interview to a member of the mainstream media Wednesday night, and used it as an opportunity to declare war on the Fourth Estate.

While not quite severe enough to justify trading even small increases in tax revenue for spending cuts  no crisis could be that dire to Paul Ryan  the deficit was still a civilizational calamity. Ryan repeatedly promised his party would solve the problem if given power. Now Republicans have the power. Ryan is no longer promising to save the Republic from the Greece-like fate in store for our people. Indeed, when reporter Steve Dennis asked Ryan the other day if he would merely promise not to increase the budget deficit, Ryan refused to commit to clearing even that low bar. Ryan is carrying on the modern Republican tradition of demanding fiscal austerity in opposition and implementing fiscal promiscuity in power. This chart, via The Wall Street Journal, shows an interesting pattern. The dotted, colored lines depict the projected deficit or surplus every president since Ronald Reagan has faced since entering office: Reagan and George W. Bush didnt run on platforms of creating big deficits. Quite the contrary: Reagan campaigned by denouncing Jimmy Carters alleged fiscal irresponsibility. Bush promised to pay off the entire national debt. Both presidents enjoyed favorable forecasts for surpluses, which they used to pass enormous tax cuts and military buildups. The favorable budget forecasts they inherited gave them free money to play with, letting them put their imprint on the government without the painful tradeoffs that would limit their options. Obama entered office facing a $1.2 trillion deficit projection, which subjected all his long-term budget changes (after the immediate, one-time fiscal stimulus) to the requirement that they reduce the debt. Obamacare would have been a much easier law to write if Obama had put the whole thing on the national credit card, the way Bush financed Medicare Part D, rather than prying every last dollar out of Congress. Trump wont have as bad a situation as Obama, but neither does he enjoy the same luck as Reagan and George W. Bush. He has a deficit running toward 5 percent of the economy. Trump wants to pass huge tax cuts, infrastructure, a military buildup, plus of course terrific health care for everybody without any of the terrible things in Obamacare that pay for it. Whether Trump will hit his limit when the deficit is at 5 percent of GDP or 6 percent or 8 percent, it will come. There is another conclusion to draw from this. Obama faced unrelenting pressure throughout his presidency to make a deal to cut the deficit. The default position of centrist pundits over the course of his first term and a half was that the definition of success was a bipartisan debt agreement. This was bad fiscal policy during the first few years, when the economy was recovering from the biggest economic crisis in three-quarters of a century. And in any case it was impossible to get a deal with a Republican Party that refused to make any concessions on revenue. But the dynamic facing Trump indicates yet another reason why its a good thing Obama didnt strike that deal. The better the budget forecast he left, the more leeway he would have given the Republicans to give the money away in the manner of their choosing. Thats what happened when Bill Clinton left Bush a huge surplus  Bush dissipated it on Republican priorities. Trump would have done the same thing if Obama had left him a balanced budget. The fabled bipartisan commitment to fiscal responsibility only works if both parties actually care about it. If one party only cares about low taxes, and pretends to care about deficits when the other party controls government, then the budget is an iterative game where using your political capital to reduce the deficit is a suckers play."}, {"date": "2017/01/26", "title": "The 20 Percent Tariff on Mexico That Wasnt", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/white-house-calls-for-a-20-percent-tax-on-mexican-imports.html", "text": " On Thursday afternoon, White House press secretary Sean Spicer was asked how the president planned to finance his monument to American xenophobia, now that Mexico had (once again) said not to put it on their tab.Here was Spicers reply: To the pool reporters gathered around Spicer  including representatives from the Associated Press and New York Times  it sounded like the press secretary was proposing a 20 percent tariff on all Mexican goods. That policy would be a radical break with bipartisan orthodoxy, and would very likely increase the price of fresh produce (among other things) for American consumers. Considering that radical, bad-sounding ideas have been a hallmark of the Trump administration, the pool reporters didnt hesitate to print their presumption. And soon, certain bloggers were recycling those dispatches with a few dashes of snark. But then Spicer pushed back  claiming that the 20 percent tax was only a policy option, not a policy proposal. And then the actual transcript of Spicers remarks came out. And tax-policy analysts realized that Spicer almost certainly had not been describing a tariff at all. Rather, in his clumsy, laypersons way, he was describing the official Republican tax plan  which would lower the corporate rate to 20 percent, and then apply that tax to the inputs that corporations import, while exempting the products they export, a policy known as border adjustment. This is very different than a punitive tax on Mexican imports. It is a plan to shift the corporate tax system away from taxing production and towards taxing consumption. And since America consumes more than it produces, the proposal increases total revenue  making it one of the only genuine offsets within the GOPs broader tax-slashing plan. In other words, Spicer was really just saying that Trump will pay for the wall with the part of the Republican tax plan that increases revenue. This isnt a very good answer, since the revenue generated by border adjustment is already needed to offset the GOPs other tax cuts. But its not a so wild its newsworthy answer.Economists predict that border adjustment would not actually impact the trade deficit, as the tax break it gives to exporters would be immediately countered by a strengthened dollar. And the proposal is much less likely to raise consumer prices than a 20 percent tariff on Mexican goods.The Trump White House has generated alarming, ill-explained proposals at such a steady clip, the fact that the press assumed the most sensational interpretation of Spicers remarks is understandable. But its unfortunate  because the end result was something that could be fairly described as fake news.

That is where newly installed President Donald Trump was issuing a fusillade of executive orders (and reviewing others that were promptly leaked), several of them involving his signature issue of immigration. Assuming news reports involving draft executive orders are indications of the way the wind is blowing in the Trump White House, in short order we will have a blitz of new immigration policies and practices imposed by the 45th president that include building the famous border wall; supporting that wall with a massive increase in border-control agents and temporary detention facilities; revocation of Obamas DACA and DAPA initiatives providing protection from prosecution for Dreamers and their parents; a beefed-up e-verify program aimed at employers of undocumented workers; new measures to prevent immigrants from accessing any sort of public benefits; punitive actions toward so-called sanctuary cities that refuse to help the feds enforce immigration laws; and plans for a tightening of legal immigration as well. Sure, some cynics may have thought Trumps hard-line talk about an immigration crackdown was just campaign-season chump change attractive to the talk-radio-listening element of the GOP base. But no one can honestly say the man didnt give us all fair warning. While it is easy to get bogged down in the details of these steps, it is important to understand that many of them are addressing what is at the moment a phantom menace as illusory as the immigrant voter fraud Trump says he will investigate: that would be the idea that huge numbers of bad people are pouring over an unprotected Mexican border to do crimes and go on welfare. The simple fact is that net immigration from Mexico is at zero. So the massive cost (an estimated $20 billion for construction and $13 billion a year for staffing) and energy involved in building the famous wall and backing it up with the appropriate resources to seal off the border is basically a symbolic initiative to solve a problem that no longer exists. Meanwhile, the Trump initiatives dealing with the real immigration problem, the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S., are mostly aimed at making these people feel insecure and exposed to prosecution. DACAs protection of 750,000 Dreamers, and DAPAs prospective protection (it has been held up by a federal judge) of as many as 4 million more, would go away (after temporary work permits expire, to be exact). Presumably the restrictions on public benefits, the enhanced e-verify program, and attacks on sanctuary cities would make still more of the 11 million fear the next knock on the door or traffic stop. What Trump is not doing, however, is putting together the plan or providing the resources to in fact prosecute and deport the undocumented population, despite his repeated promises to eschew any sort of amnesty for people who entered the country illegally. Yes, he will have some showy deportations of people convicted of crimes (which would simply continue the enforcement priorities of the Obama administration). But there is no sign yet Trump is willing or able to undertake the immense costs (one estimate for a total deportation plan is $114 billion) and risk the humanitarian blowback of a mass-deportation program. For one thing, it could create a major collision with the Roman Catholic Church, a natural focal point for resistance in the U.S. and across Latin America, extending most likely to the Latin American Pope. So at present, all of Trumps posturing and policy-making on illegal immigration really amounts to a loud and expensive plan to encourage self-deportation of the undocumented by making their lives  and most likely, the lives of legal immigrants and U.S. citizens who happen to look like them  as difficult as possible. In some respects, this approach will arouse even more hostility than a mass-deportation strategy, precisely because it depends on encouraging broad-based suspicion toward Latinos, including those who have broken no laws and have as much of a right to the peaceful enjoyment of life as Trump himself. Combined with Trumps regular statements of support for racial profiling as a law-enforcement tool, a self-deportation strategy could make the United States a very uncomfortable place for nonwhite people, just as it has been so often in the past (you know, those years of greatness Trumps core supporters want to bring back). So does Trump simply lack the courage to come right out and ask for money for the thousands of cattle cars and the vast network of transit camps that hed be focused on if deportation rather than self-deportation was his goal? Thats unclear; maybe he will go there in the future. For now, though, it looks like his immigration blitz is mostly smoke and mirrors, with a nasty undertone of white identity politics."}, {"date": "2017/01/26", "title": "Trump Just Replaced the State Departments Senior Management", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-fires-every-senior-manager-at-the-state-department.html", "text": " Rex Tillerson is one of the many Trump cabinet picks who has no experience in government, but plenty of experience opposing the policies of the department that he has been appointed to lead. But there was a simple answer to any qualms these qualities might inspire: Should the secretary of State have trouble navigating the federal bureaucracy  or resisting the urge to put the interests of Exxons shareholders above those of the American people  the departments senior civil servants would keep him from going astray. And then, on Wednesday, the Trump administration forced out four senior-level management officials at the State Department. Prior to CNNs report, the Washington Posts Josh Rogin had written that the officials may have resigned at their own volition. But a deliberate housecleaning is actually more consistent with Rogins dispatch. All four of the career officers had submitted letters of resignation shortly after Trumps inauguration  a longstanding tradition that empowers the new administration to select its own staff, should it wish to. However, presidents usually do not accept those resignations until successors have been found and confirmed. Trumps hasty housecleaning leaves a void at the department: Combined with the recent retirements of other senior staff, Wednesdays departures leave the State Department with virtually no one experienced at managing its domestic bureaucracy, overseas offices, and staff, according to Rogin. Its the single biggest simultaneous departure of institutional memory that anyone can remember, and thats incredibly difficult to replicate, said David Wade, State Department chief of staff during John Kerrys tenure, told Rogin. Department expertise in security, management, administrative and consular positions in particular are very difficult to replicate and particularly difficult to find in the private sector. The department will not collapse, a senior administration official assured CNN. Everyone has good deputies. Its a huge institutional loss, but the department has excellent subordinates and the career people will step up.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer, responding IRL, said about Nietos cancellation: Well look for a date to schedule something in the future. Well continue to coordinate.

But it appears that, as with other issues from immigration to climate change, President Trump plans to put his federal funding where his mouth is. During his first few days in office, Trump has doubled down on his campaign promises to strip women of their reproductive rights, reinstating the Global Gag Rule that bans federal funding for NGOs that offer abortion services, while the Republican-led House recently passed a bill to ban federal funding for abortions.

As the presidents mouth laid waste to the concept of objective truth  and his pen tore through Obamacare, abortion rights, sanctuary cities, environmental protection, the fragile hopes of refugees, and, quite possibly, the United Nations  liberals stared slack-jawed at their screens, wishing this was all just some nightmarish reality show. And, in a sense, it actually may be. Trump is an expert in spectacle, not governance. Since November 8, he has applied that expertise relentlessly. As president-elect, he cut down on government waste by tweeting angry demands at Lockheed Martin over Twitter  and protected American jobs by presenting corporate-expansion plans drafted before his election as products of his own genius. These moves were fairly easy to identify as acts of theater, not policy. Once Trump started signing leather-bound documents in the White House, however, it was hard to see the presidents actions as mere photo ops  no matter how many cameras had been crammed into the Oval Office. But now, it appears those executive orders may have been all sound and fury  signifying more than nothing, but less than they appeared to. Part of why Trump has been able to dash off executive orders at such a frenetic pace  even as the rest of his transition is woefully behind schedule  is that he has neglected to have them reviewed by relevant cabinet agencies, congressional committees, or legal counsel. Rather, the documents have been drafted with the consultation of virtually no one but Breitbart mastermind Steve Bannon, and his fellow right-wing nationalist Stephen Miller, according to Politico. And as it turns out, governing by Breitbart op-ed has its drawbacks. For example, Trumps executive order on the Keystone XL was drafted without the consultation of the State Department, despite the fact that the company behind the pipeline is suing the U.S. for $15 billion  and aspects of the order could plausibly strengthen the companys case: Among other things, the order requires any company building a pipeline to use materials manufactured domestically  a provision that may contravene various trade treaties that the U.S. is bound by. Meanwhile, Trumps much-ballyhooed order calling for the construction of a border wall  and a tripling of border-enforcement agents  cannot be executed without congressional appropriations that could prove hard to come by. Which is to say, the executive order does not fulfill Trumps campaign promise, but merely reaffirms his commitment to fulfilling it. Further, Trumps order stripping funding from sanctuary cities is a legally tendentious proposition, which the administration seems to have asked zero constitutional lawyers to weigh in on. His order on the Affordable Care Act doesnt appear to make any tangible policy changes, in the view of the Kaiser Family Foundation. And then there are the drafted executive orders that Trump has yet to sign. One of these would reportedly require agencies to reconsider using interrogation techniques that had been banned as torture  an idea that Defense Secretary James Mattis and CIA Director Mike Pompeo were blindsided by, according to Politico. Another would cut U.S. funding to the International Criminal Court by 40 percent  even though the U.S. does not fund the International Criminal Court. Ultimately, though, the president may care less about whether these executive orders are effective in policy terms, than if they play well in theatrical ones. Per Politico: Meanwhile, the congressional GOP is camped out in Philadelphia, waiting for Trump to give them some hint of what his intentions are with regard to actual legislation. The Washington Post reports: There are at least two ways of interpreting all this: Either Trump hopes to strong-arm the federal bureaucracy and Congress into realizing Steve Bannons wildest dreams  or he just wants to execute some well-staged photo-ops while Mike Pence does all that slow boring of hard boards. Which is to say: Either Donald Trump is the president, or he just plays one on TV."}, {"date": "2017/01/26", "title": "In Iraq, Americas Allies  and Its Enemies   Wait for Trumps First Move", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/in-iraq-u-s-allies-and-enemies-wait-for-trumps-first-move.html", "text": " A blindfolded, handcuffed youth in a brown hoodie shuffles into the wardens office at a prison in Kirkuk, Iraq, and sits in a tattered chair. The prisoner, Yasser, is slim and dark-skinned, with wispy facial hair. Hes only 19 years old, but Yasser is a member of the Islamic State. Until recently, he worked as a weapons smuggler, driver, and personal assistant to Khalil Ahmad Ali al-Wais, a.k.a. Abu Wadhah, the ISIS emir in charge of territory the group holds near Kirkuk. When a U.S. coalition airstrike killed Abu Wadhah earlier last month, Yasser was left without a protector, so he tried to flee ISIS. The peshmerga, the Kurdish fighting force in northern Iraq, received intelligence on his movements and arrested him upon his arrival in Kirkuk. The Islamic State says America is our enemy and a country of unbelievers, Yasser says, in a pubescent-sounding voice, when asked about ISISs position on Donald Trump becoming president. Since they first came, they said that their philosophy is to trigger a big conflict between Muslims and America. An American president who goes on television and says he hates Muslims is a good thing for ISIS. They are using this to tell people, Look, the Americans hate Muslims, you must go fight and kill them. The war against ISIS in Iraq received a significant amount of debate during the American presidential race, though Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton spoke about the conflict in notably different terms. Although Clinton expressed her intention to step up an American military presence in the region, she stopped short of advocating for a ground invasion. Her approach, if a bit more hawkish, seemed to largely line up with Barack Obamas slow-burn strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy the brutal Sunni militant group. Today, with Obamas strategy still in place for the moment even though he is out of office, U.S.-supported forces continue to fight to free Mosul, the last major Iraqi city under ISIS control. It has been a slow, steady, and quiet plan; one that has succeeded in shrinking ISISs footprint without alienating any of the key players in Iraq  including the Iraqi army, the Shia militias that fight alongside government troops, and the peshmerga in the north  or turning them against each other. As for Trump, its difficult to divine a coherent Iraq strategy based on statements he made during his campaign and first few days in office, but all indications are that it will involve bringing a lot more drama to a country thats always on the precipice of mass sectarian violence. He has advocated for the deployment of up to 30,000 troops in Iraq and discussed at length his objectively absurd plan to take Iraqs oil as reimbursement for American military efforts  a thought he reiterated as president during his freewheeling speech at CIA headquarters last weekend and again in his interview Wednesday with ABCs David Muir. Trump told Muir that critics who questioned the legality of the move were fools, and said: If we took the oil, you wouldnt have ISIS. Trump has also roundly criticized Obamas strategy in the ongoing battle for Mosul, saying that the U.S. should not have abandoned the element of surprise by publicly announcing the offensive months ahead of time (though military strategists tend to see it as irrelevant to the progress of the battle). In his first press briefing on Monday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer reiterated that Trump will not reveal his military plans for Iraq before undertaking them. So as we enter the Trump administration, any expectations that his bellicose campaign rhetoric about Iraq and ISIS were just bluster seem to be unfounded. In his inaugural speech, Trump spoke of eradicating radical Islamic terrorism from the face of the earth, and creating a plan of attack against ISIS is reportedly among his highest priorities in the coming weeks. The early indications suggest the plan will be aggressive  on James Mattiss first day as secretary of Defense, the U.S. bombed ISIS no fewer than 31 times. The current political and military situation in Iraq is dizzyingly complex and unfamiliar to most Americans, as is the environment that Trump would be sending those 30,000 hypothetical U.S. soldiers into as part of a mission to eradicate ISIS and seize the oil wells under their control (zero, for the record). In an effort to get a better grasp of how the new administrations actions might affect Iraq and the various players in the ongoing, low-grade civil war there, I traveled to northern Iraq last month to speak with fighters on all sides. Some were enthusiastic about Trumps aggressive stance, hoping it would lead to further American involvement in the country. Others were wary of another U.S. invasion and the chaos it might trigger. Based on what Yasser told me, ISIS straddles those two positions: enthusiastic about the new American president precisely because they expect Trump to amplify the violence and bloodshed in Iraq and beyond. At a military base in the town of Makhmur, 30 miles southwest of the Kurdish capital of Erbil, members of a mixed-sect group of militias under the auspices of the Iraqi government are practicing their drills under the hard-eyed gazes of several U.S. special-forces soldiers. The militia members march ostentatiously as thunderous patriotic music blares from speakers across the grounds. They are chaotically out of step, arms flailing as they march  which would be funny if these young men werent headed into battle soon. The Nineveh troops are part of a broad group of mostly Shia militias known as the Popular Mobilization Units, or PMUs, which have been causing ulcers in Washington because of their close ties to Iran as well as reports that theyve been engaging in sectarian violence against Sunnis fleeing liberated ISIS territory. All the PMUs were recently absorbed into the Iraqi military. While some groups, like the Nineveh militias, began training with American forces, the U.S. has refused to provide strictly Shia PMUs with air support, since any coordination with Iran-backed groups would trigger enormous political controversy. According to their leaders and Iraqi army officials overseeing the ceremony, the groups marching today are mixed Sunni, Shia, Christian, and even some Yazidis, the northern ethnic group that was devastated when ISIS spilled into Iraq in 2014. These fighters dont exude the kind of iron discipline displayed by most Iranian-trained military forces, and the American officers appear increasingly horrified at the Nineveh groups fumbling during the drills. But their reaction is not shared by Karim Shwaily, the commander of the Nineveh Hashd al-Shaabi militias. In his office the day after the ceremony, Shwaily is enthusiastic about the coordination with U.S. special forces. I think the operation is going positively, he says. God willing, we will soon take the eastern part of Mosul and all of the city will be under the control of Iraq. Asked how he anticipates U.S. strategy in Iraq will change now that Trump is president, Shwaily seems extremely reluctant to offer his thoughts. We are just fighters, he says sharply. We dont know anything about American politics or the strategies of U.S. presidents. Our mission is clear: to fight for Nineveh and for Iraq. But America will not invade Iraq again. There have been diplomatic agreements made and they have to abide by them  on the other hand, it would be impossible to abandon Iraq at such a crucial point in the fight against Daesh  as ISIS is known in the region. But I think Trumps talk of invading is just rhetoric. Like the Nineveh Hashd al-Shaabi, its not quite clear where the Iraqi army officially stands on Trump, but theyre reportedly quite displeased after his last reference to taking their oil as reimbursement for American military efforts. Though the military may have initially welcomed an American invasion to rid Iraq of ISIS, they seem to be catching on to the fact that this invasion would not be like the others, because it would be led by Donald Trump. A strong American effort to fight ISIS is one thing; a lengthy occupation for the purposes of exploiting Iraqs natural resources is another. But for the moment, the Iraqi army seems to be caught in limbo, waiting to see how this president will treat their vulnerable, war-ravaged country. Shwailys (perhaps misplaced) optimism and caution about saying anything that might provoke the new administration is shared by an Iraqi army general at the ceremony. Coalition forces have been here for seven days, he says. We have two active operations with the Americans: liberating Mosul and now we are preparing for the second operation, which is to train these fighters. There are other bases like this, where U.S. Special Forces are training them and another thousand trainees coming up. The Americans are very helpful in coordinating with us, and we dont see that changing now that the election is over. But an invasion is not their only concern. Trump has been crystal clear that hes not interested in spending American treasure rebuilding or remaking foreign countries. Setting aside the question of immediate military actions, theres also the issue of ongoing support for the fragile regime now in power in Iraq. Another scenario is this: says retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling, an Iraq war veteran and military analyst. Mr. Trump has indicated that hes willing to be more isolationist  If Iraq does succeed soon in Mosul, and it is now time for them to shift toward their own nation-building and we dont provide strategic support, somebody else will We have to [help] rebuild their country under a good central government in Baghdad. If we leave that as a vacuum, it will just fall apart all over again like its done so many times already. Awards from the United States government and military decorate nearly every inch of wall space in the office of Sarhad Qader Mohammad, brigadier general in the Kirkuk police force, a law-enforcement wing of the Kurdistan Regional Government. The general is hearty and mustachioed, brimming with praise for America. While Kurdistan is not quite an independent country, it has been functioning as one since the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. There is no small amount of hope in the region that Trump, with his incautious, no-holds-barred stance on Iraq, will allow Kurdistan to fully separate into a sovereign nation  a centuries-old dream of the Kurdish people, but one that would create massive geopolitical problems in the region and that is staunchly opposed by U.S. ally Turkey. The Americans know how strategically important and sensitive Kirkuk is, so we trust them to help us keep it safe in the future, Mohammad says. Many American soldiers were killed fighting for Kirkuk, and we are thankful for their sacrifice. The U.S. gives us much aid, including training and infrastructure; if I were to spend all day talking about what theyve done for us, I wouldnt be able to finish. Asked if he anticipates that U.S. policy will change under Trump, he smiles confidently. I think Trump will have to live up to what he told his people, Mohammad says. Obamas strategy was to stay distant from the fight, but America was the first one hurt in the war with terrorists during 9/11. We will see what Trumps strategy is, but America is responsible for the safety of the world, and an invasion would help the Kurds, because the peshmerga was the first army fighting Daesh with the Americans. Trump has been quite vocal in his approval of the Kurds. I am a big fan of the Kurdish forces, he pronounced last summer, indicating that he wanted to get Kurdish leaders in a room with Turkish leaders for some negotiations  quite a tall order for anyone who understands the depth of that enmity. In any case, it seems the peshmerga are betting that a hawkish Trump administration will be generous enough to grant them independence after the dust settles in the wake of a potential large-scale American ground offensive. The elderly warden at Yassers prison shares this perspective. I think the entire American strategy is going to change, he croaks gleefully. In my opinion, Trump is better than Hillary Clinton because he likes the Kurds. He will be better for the peshmerga, especially if he invades. Both he and Hillary said they will support us, but Trump will be stronger. But while it might create a great photo op or tweet, the long-term implications of any such generous gesture from Trump could be very serious. The question of Kurdish independence will be another source of friction once the war calms down and Kurds and Iraqi Arabs no longer have a common enemy, says Dr. Jeffrey McCausland, a veteran and professor at the Strategic Studies Institute, U.S. Army War College. Of course, nothing Trump has said so far indicates any plan, much less awareness, of how hell prevent the region from tumbling deeper into chaos after the extremists are eradicated and the oil is taken. In October 2016, ISIS militants set fire to the Qayyarah oil fields, about 35 miles south of Mosul. The inferno has been blazing ever since, with little hope of being extinguished anytime soon, and the village itself exists under a noxious, billowing cloud of dark smoke. At an intersection on the outskirts of town, a charity van pulls up to a mob of filthy children in rags and workers get out and begin distributing food. The children immediately begin to fight over the fruit and bread. A little girl no older than 6 or 7, wearing a shredded pink Minnie Mouse shirt, punches an older boy in the stomach and triumphantly makes off with an orange. A short distance away, at an outpost of the Badr Organization, one of the Iran-linked Shia Hashd al-Shaabi militias that have proven so politically sensitive for the U.S., two fighters sip from little glasses of syrupy black tea. The Badr Organization was born during the 1980s and led uprisings against Saddam Hussein during the 2003 Iraq war. In the aftermath of Saddams ouster, the militia has grown in size and influence, with the help of Iran. The Badr Organization now claims to command between 10,000 and 50,000 men. The group was implicated in reports of sectarian war crimes following the liberation of Fallujah in 2016, though they deny responsibility. Its clear that the Shia militiamen are significantly more apprehensive about a Trump presidency than their peers in the Nineveh Hashd al-Shaabi, Iraqi army, and peshmerga. Given Trumps aggressive rhetoric on Iran, their wariness is understandable. Obama is weak and wasnt hard on the terrorists, says one of them, a thickly bearded man wearing a green beanie. We heard that this president will be stronger, so we know everything will change. But we also know he doesnt distinguish between Daesh and us. He thinks were terrorists because were supposed to be on the side of Iran. The oil wells here are decrepit and damaged, his tall, thin friend adds. I have heard that this President Trump wants to come, rebuild the oil refineries and take our oil. He also says he will fight Iran and Saudi Arabia. In my opinion, one man cannot do something like that, because he will be responsible for destroying the world. The fighter in the green beanie lights a thin Iraqi cigarette and finishes his tea. The peshmerga and the Iraqi army like Trump because they know they will benefit from an invasion, he says, flicking ash into his empty glass. But we know if theres an invasion, were not going to benefit. We will end up in a conflict with America. Its obvious that the Trump administration will be facing some complicated obstacles in Iraq over the upcoming months and years. McCausland of the U.S. Army War College says that the real challenge begins after ISIS is defeated: ensuring that history doesnt repeat itself, that the country doesnt spiral into another sectarian conflict, perhaps leading to the establishment of ISIS 2.0. Defining success as beating ISIS, which seems to be a focal point of the Trump administration and a lot of the folks hes picked for national security offices, isnt good enough, he says. Can he in any way improve what has been the real problem in Iraq, which is continued friction between the Shiites and the Sunnis, in the aftermath of the ISIS occupation? According to Yasser, Trump is one bright spot in what is an otherwise bleak and besieged existence for ISIS at this moment. The 19-year-old shuffles his feet around and fidgets with his handcuffs, looking like a restless kid in math class as he tries to explain the terrorist groups enthusiasm for the new U.S. president. A president like Trump will drive Muslims towards the Islamic State and show them that all the kuffar  the unbelievers  hate them, Yasir says without expression. It makes the Islamic State happy to use him to manipulate the people who want to fight for Islam."}, {"date": "2017/01/26", "title": "Alex Jones Says Hes Been Offered White House Press Credentials", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/alex-jones-says-hes-been-offered-wh-press-credentials.html", "text": " Before Donald Trump became president, the list of reasons why Alex Jones would not be invited into the White House as a credentialed member of the media might have included his promotion of the Sandy Hook conspiracy theory and his suggestion that the government is turning people gay through chemical warfare.

I wanna let  I wanna let the action take place before the talk takes place. What might well turn out over the long run to be the most significant comment in Trumps rambling, fantastical interview with Muir is his insistence that his policies could not possibly generate a backlash in the Muslim world: If it were correct that Muslim anger with the United States has reached its maximal threshold, then there would be no danger in further antagonism. But that is not remotely true. About three-quarters of Muslims worldwide, and four-fifths of Muslims in the United States, believe suicide bombing in defense of their religion is never justified. Trump will make Muslims across the world believe that the United States discriminates against them, is torturing people, and (if they take Trumps own comments seriously, which they might) could already be stealing its oil. Given its conflict with Islamic radicals, it is inevitable that the United States is going to have some policies that meet with less-than-universal approval in the Muslim world. Even George W. Bush talked a good game about wanting harmony with the Muslim world, which is why he fervently denied the torture program his administration undertook. Whether his policies accomplished this goal is another question  they didnt  but he understood that minimizing blowback was a goal. Trump has gone out of his way as a candidate and as a president to depict his policies toward the Muslim world in the most hostile and imperialistic terms, and he literally cannot imagine how this could create problems.

Their discussion did not do much to dispel rumors that Trump is obsessed with both the size of the crowd at his inauguration and his feud with the media. None of Trumps remarks were a departure from what he said on the campaign trail, but it was still odd to see a sitting president insulting a journalist, calling his critics fools for accurately describing international laws, and poring over inauguration photos with the zeal of someone trying to demonstrate the moon landing was fake. Heres a rundown of the most befuddling moments. Trump kicked things off by affirming that he believes there could have been 3 to 5 million illegal votes cast in the 2016 election, and he raised concerns about people who are registered in two states. (Its only illegal to vote in two states, and several of his advisers and family members are on two state voting registers.) As evidence, Trump pointed to a 2012 Pew Survey about inaccurate voter registries. Muir said he had just talked to the author of the report, David Becker, who has repeatedly said that the report wasnt about voter fraud, and that theres no evidence that large numbers of people are casting illegal ballots. Trump accused Becker of groveling. At two points in the interview, Trump insisted that even if millions of people voted illegally, his election is still legitimate because every single one was a Clinton voter. Trump then denied that he said millions of people voted illegally  though he thinks its possible. When Muir read a tweet contradicting that, Trump ignored him and continued explaining how he could have won the popular vote if he wanted to. Trump closed by noting that the investigation he intends to launch wont uncover all the facts about voter fraud in the 2016 election, but the investigation will also uncover all the facts. Referencing Trumps speech in front of a wall honoring fallen CIA officers on Saturday, Muir asked Trump when he would move on and stop bragging about the crowd size at the inauguration. Trump responded by bragging that his CIA speech was a home run. According to ABCs transcript, Trump said he received the biggest standing ovation since Peyton Manning had won the Super Bowl. Its unclear what he was referring to, and the line was cut from the broadcast. This led into another discussion of the crowd size at Trumps inauguration, and the president accusing Muir of having a 17 percent approval rating, which is pretty bad. Its not clear if he was talking about Muir personally, ABC News, or the media in general. On the question of reinstating waterboarding, Trump said he absolutely thinks torture works, but hes going to go with whatever Defense Secretary James Mattis and CIA director Mike Pompeo think. If they dont wanna do, thats fine, he said. If they do wanna do, then I will work for that end. Then Trump doubled down on his statement from over the weekend that the U.S. should have taken Iraqs oil, but maybe well have another chance. He said all the people telling him that would violate international law are fools. Finally, Trump took Muir on a tour of the White House. In the Oval Office, he showed off the new decor, a lengthy letter President Obama left for him, and a paperback book he received from one of the combatants that I fought to get here. Then during a tour of the West Wing, Trump stopped at two separate photos to analyze the size of the crowd at his inauguration. Now the audience was the biggest ever, he said, falsely, before one of the photos. But this crowd was massive. Look how far back it goes. This crowd was massive. And I would actually take that camera and take your time if you want to know the truth."}, {"date": "2017/01/26", "title": "Paul Ryan: U.S. to Front Money for Wall, Devise Plan to Make Mexico Pay Later", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/paul-ryan-u-s-to-front-wall-money-make-mexico-pay-later.html", "text": " President Trump just fulfilled his biggest campaign promise, signing an executive order on Wednesday that orders the immediate construction of a physical wall between the United States and Mexico. Now the Trump administration just needs to work out the massive logistical challenges and figure out how to pay for the wall, which could cost as much as $20 billion. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly said that Mexico would pay for the wall, but in recent weeks he and other Republican leaders began emphasizing that U.S. taxpayers would actually pay for the wall at first, and Mexico would reimburse them. Many noted on Wednesday that despite Trumps order, the government cant spend money that Congress hasnt appropriated. But House Speaker Paul Ryan confirmed in an interview with MSNBCs Greta Van Susteren on Wednesday that Congress is going to find a way to let Trump use U.S. taxpayer money to kick off construction of the wall. First off, were going to pay for it and front the money, Ryan said. He didnt elaborate, but according to CNN, during the Republican lawmakers retreat in Philadelphia this week, Ryan said they could push through a special spending bill dedicated to the wall in the next few months. [Ryan] talked about the supplemental budget coming this spring to push that along. The president said hes going to get reimbursed one way or the other and we accept that, said Representative Chris Collins. Meanwhile, we do have to pay our bills. Its unclear where the funding for that measure would come from, but of course, thats only a temporary concern. Ryan assured Van Susteren that theyd figure out how to make Mexico pay, someday. There are a lot of different ways of getting Mexico to contribute to doing this, he said. There are different ways of defining how exactly they pay for it. During the campaign, Trump suggested that the wall could be paid for by holding hostage the funds that Mexicans living in the U.S. send home until Mexico turns over a a one-time payment of $5 to 10 billion. Some have questioned the legality of that plan, but other options have been floated, such as taxing goods entering the country from Mexico at a rate of 20 percent or increasing fees for visas and border crossings. While Republicans are quickly forging ahead on construction of Trumps wall, they havent elaborated on the strategy theyll use to make Mexico finance it. Ryans remark that there are different ways of defining how Mexico pays suggests Americans may need to broaden their definition of what reimbursement means. Trump echoed this theme in an interview with ABC News David Muir on Wednesday, insisting, We will be in a form reimbursed by Mexico, which Ive always said. Well be reimbursed at a later date from whatever transaction we make from Mexico, Trump continued. Im just telling you there will be a payment. It will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form. In a nationally televised speech on Wednesday night, Mexican president Enrique Pea Nieto said, Mexico does not believe in walls, adding, I have said time and time again, Mexico will not pay for any wall. But he may not have a choice in the matter. If the definition of reimburse is stretched to Mexico transferring money to the U.S. in a complicated form from whatever transaction, Trump can declare hes made good on his promise to make Mexico pay for it, even without its consent."}, {"date": "2017/01/25", "title": "Trump Will Force EPA to Clear Studies With His Appointees Before Publishing Them", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-administration-demands-veto-power-over-epa-studies.html", "text": " The Trump administration has just given itself veto power over all scientific studies produced by the Environmental Protection Agency.

Jeff Greenfield wrote a column in September with the headline: Trump Is Pat Buchanan With Better Timing. The similarities are obvious: Both men spurned the Republican Establishment, rejected GOP economic doctrines from free trade to inclusive immigration laws to entitlement reform, and were hostile to globalism in all its forms. They even shared the same America First slogan, itself a typically Buchananite shout-out to the old-right isolationists who were indifferent (or worse) toward the possibility of Hitler winning World War II. That reflects one difference between the two demagogues, of course: Buchanan has always had an acute if skewed sense of history, while the 45th presidents contact with the subject is probably limited to extremely brief exposure to the History Channel. And they are hardly in lockstep on every policy issue: Buchanan has taken angry exception, for example, to his protgs long-distance love affair with Bibi Netanyahu. But it is the priorities President Trump has revealed in his first days in office that really make one pause to realize how similar he is to Buchanan: canceling TPP and demanding the renegotiation of NAFTA; tossing day one goodies to the anti-abortion movement; ordering a quick start to his beloved border wall while threatening the undocumented; and now, initiating a systematic program of disinvestment in international organizations, especially the U.N. All these are things you might have expected in a Buchanan administration, including the last item: As the Reform Party candidate for president in 2000, Buchanan made withdrawal from the U.N. and expelling the organization from New York a campaign staple. And in 2002, he wrote an entire book attacking liberal immigration policies under the inflammatory title, The Death of the West. Beyond policies, the tone Donald Trump has adopted as president so far is very faithful to the example set by Buchanan, the pol who invented the term culture war, which he regarded as a very good thing. Trumps belligerent inaugural address and manifest determination to bend the GOP to his will nicely reflect Buchanans incessantly combative approach to intra-party and inter-party politics.

They were many times higher than FAKE NEWS @CNN - public is smart! CNN tweeted back that they had matched Fox in Nielsen numbers: Those are the facts. Trumps attacks on CNN may be a response to the networks recent coverage, which Trump views as biased and unfair. But sources say there may also be a personal dimension at play: According to people close to both sides, Trump has told White House staffers that he feels personally betrayed by CNN chief Jeff Zucker. Trump complains that Zucker should be programming CNN more favorably toward him because of their long relationship, which can be traced back to 2004 when Zucker put The Apprentice on NBC. Trump has also said to White House staffers that Zucker owes him because Trump helped get him the job at CNN. According to CNN sources, Trumps claim that he assisted Zucker in landing the top job at the network is false. Trump seems to have gotten the idea because he praised Zucker to Turner Broadcastings then-CEO Phil Kent at a charity dinner in the fall of 2012, a few months before CNN hired Zucker. But CNN sources say Turner had already decided to hire Zucker by that point. This is entirely personal, one CNN high-level source said. Trump thinks just because hes known Jeff that CNN should be covering him like Fox News does. White House press secretary Sean Spicer dismissed the idea that Trump has a personal beef with Zucker. To think hes sitting around worried about Jeff Zucker is a little ridiculous, Spicer said. During an interview last week, Zucker told me his history with Trump had no influence on CNNs coverage. Obviously weve known each other for a long time, he said.

Just as Mexican president Enrique Pea Nieto was getting set for his White House meeting with Donald Trump next week on January 31, the new U.S. president went ahead and signed an executive order for the immediate construction of the border wall with Mexico. Donald Trump has declared that Mexico is going to pay for this wall; Nieto has always replied no. (The initial construction will use funds already set aside for a wall, but the Trump administration insists Mexico will pay one way or another.) Mexican media is now reporting that Nieto may cancel the meeting with Trump. Nieto has not confirmed that he will stand Trump up, but many Mexican leaders and the public are ramping up the pressure to get him to stay away from the White House. Margarita Zavala, a potential presidential candidate and wife of former president Felipe Caldern, wrote on Twitter that Donald Trumps wall announcement ahead of Nietos visit was an offense to Mexico. The Mexican Senate also called on Nieto to cancel the meeting, with one senator calling Trumps actions hostile. Indeed, Trumps executive order united Mexico said El Pas, a Mexican newspaper, adding, an era of hostility has begun. To add insult to injury, a Mexican delegation arrived in D.C. Wednesday to meet with top Trump administration officials, which reportedly included chief of staff Reince Priebus and top advisers Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner. The Mexican diplomats  Foreign Affairs Secretary Luis Videgaray Caso and Economic Minister Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal  had said security, immigration, and trade issues were among the issues to be discussed. Videgaray, who had been the finance minister, had helped to set up Trumps Mexico visit during the GOP candidates campaign; Videgaray resigned amid the backlash soon after. Nieto then named him foreign minister, saying U.S. relations would be his top priority. It seemed to have been something Trump wanted: But given the timing of Trumps announcement, its unclear what the status of those meetings is  they happened, though the White House and Mexico are mum on what went down  or whether the Trump administration actually cares what its Mexican counterparts have to say."}, {"date": "2017/01/25", "title": "Trump Prepares to Radically Reduce American Funding of the United Nations", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-prepares-to-radically-reduce-u-s-funding-of-the-u-n.html", "text": " In the wake of the Second World War, the United States led the effort to establish the United Nations  an institution that would, among other things, promote American values and protect American interests. To this day, the U.S. enjoys the power to unilaterally veto any substantive resolution that comes before the body, and, less officially, to defy the U.N.s understanding of international law whenever it feels like invading a sovereign country. But now, Donald Trump is preparing to decimate this tool of American hegemony  and global peacekeeping and poverty reduction  with a stroke of his pen. The Trump administration has drafted an executive order that would radically reduce American funding of the U.N. and other international organizations. The order would terminate all U.S. funding to any international body that meets any one of a long list of criteria. Among other things, the order would bar American funding of any organization that gives full membership to the Palestinian Authority or Palestine Liberation Organization, supports programs that fund abortion, or that is controlled or substantially influenced by any state that sponsors terrorism. Even if the U.N. agreed to forever abandon Palestinians, women seeking full reproductive autonomy, and every member-state that the U.S. has deemed a supporter of terrorism, the Trump administration would still radically reduce American involvement in the body: Once funding is eliminated to all groups that fit the above criteria, the order would require at least a 40 percent overall decrease in the remaining American funding to international organizations. The New York Timess Max Fisher elaborates on the details of the order, and their potential implications: In other words, in addition to limiting refugees access to the United States, the Trump administration would like to drastically reduce the U.N.s capacity to fund relief efforts for those displaced by war overseas. It is difficult to overstate the sheer madness  and cruelty  of the Trump administrations international agenda. The White House would like to undermine international cooperation on climate change, restrict migration, reduce aid to the global poor, and curtail efforts to grant women reproductive autonomy in the developing world.This reads like a recipe for increasing the number  and mortality rate  of ecologically and economically displaced migrants. But thats not all. The Trump administration has prepared a second order, titled Moratorium on New Multilateral Treaties, which would demand a review of all current and pending treaties between the United States and more than one other other nation  and request recommendations of which treaties the U.S. should exit. The order stipulates that it only applies to treaties that arent directly related to national security, extradition or international trade. But as Fisher notes, its unclear precisely what this means: The Paris climate agreement impacts international trade  does that mean it is exempt from the review? The most optimistic reading of the orders is that theyre too conspicuously ignorant to actually be implemented.

But GOP legislators in Virginia and Minnesota are reviving pre-2016 legislation designed to emulate Maine and Nebraska in awarding Electoral College votes by congressional district rather than statewide vote totals. The ostensible rationale for these proposals is to provide representation in the Electoral College for regions that are outvoted at the state level by urban areas like Northern Virginia. But its really a hobbyhorse for state lawmakers who control states the other party typically carries at the presidential level. Indeed, Virginia toyed with such legislation shortly after the 2012 elections, along with Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. What these states had in common at the time was Republican trifecta control of state governments in states that had voted for Barack Obama over Mitt Romney. Not coincidentally, such a system would have awarded the presidency to Romney, who won 226 House districts against Obamas 209 (Romney also won 28 states to Obamas 22, which under the system Republicans are pushing, would have given statewide winners two bonus EVs). As it happens, the EV-by-CD system would not have reversed the 2016 outcome, but would have, interestingly enough, reduced Trumps electoral vote total from 304 to 293. Thats a product of the unusual number of electoral votes Trump harvested from very close wins in very big states. Thats likely why GOP legislators in some of those same states have not revived the idea so far this year. The lack of strong immediate Republican incentives for a change probably means it wont happen right away. There are now, in any event, Democratic governors in both Virginia and Minnesota sure to veto any such plan in those states if it even makes it that far. But the idea probably will not go away. From a GOP point of view, it would replicate their current advantage in the U.S. House, produced by superior distribution of voters augmented in many places by gerrymandering. For dessert, it would also retain the current systems two-EV bonus for winning a lot of small states. Now its true, as Jonathan Bernstein points out, that few states are likely to be interested in this approach. Large states now considered battlegrounds, for example, might perceive it as reducing their clout. Three-EV states would see no change at all. So only states where one party controls government and the other routinely carries them in presidential elections are going to be tempted to move in this direction. But precisely because there are blue states with Republican state governments, while there are no red states with Democratic state governments, GOPers might be tempted to act where they can. Its not like Democrats can retaliate (unless they somehow managed to push through the National Popular Vote Initiative and effectively abolished the Electoral College altogether). And as we keep discovering, close presidential elections are not as rare as they used to be."}, {"date": "2017/01/25", "title": "Trumps Infrastructure-Project List Features Biggies in NYC", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trumps-infrastructure-project-list-features-biggies-in-nyc.html", "text": " President Donald Trump has vowed to fix Americas crumbling infrastructure  a proposal even Democratic leadership said theyd be willing to work with the administration to get done. On Tuesday, Senate Democrats threw down the gauntlet first, releasing a $1 trillion infrastructure ten-year plan to fix roads, bridges, broadband networks, VA hospitals, and schools. Democratic lawmakers say the plan would create 15 million jobs. Were challenging the president  he talked about it in his campaign  to join us in this and if he does well work with him, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. The Trump administration also appears to have the outlines of a plan, albeit a slightly different one. According to the Kansas City Star, team Trump has put together a list of 50 emergency and national security infrastructure projects across the United States, at a price tag of $137.5 billion, which would likely come in the form of tax credits to developers. The document, passed among congressional and business leaders, indicates that the private sector would fund 50 percent of the costs of these shovel-ready undertakings. The then-Trump transition team also reportedly handed another list  the same except for two projects  to the National Governors Association in December. According to a letter obtained by McClatchy, the NGA had asked governors for feedback on the document, and asked them to submit between three and five state projects that could also be contenders for an infrastructure plan. The letter said that a bipartisan infrastructure commission would do the final vetting on all projects, adding that once Trump took office there would be a more formal process to submit projects for consideration. No. 1 on the Trump list  and its not clear how final this list is  would be a major boon to the New York area. Thats the Gateway Program, which would build a new Hudson River rail tunnel to double the capacity of Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains between New York and New Jersey. It would also provide critical repairs on the century-old existing tunnel that was badly damaged by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The program first came into existence in 2011, after New Jersey Governor Chris Christie nixed a different plan the year before to build a Hudson tunnel. Figuring out how to pay for this massive project has been one of its primary sticking points, but that got a major lift toward the end of the Obama administration, with the federal government pledging to split funding with New York and New Jersey  though its still unclear where all the state money is going to come from, because the cost is huge: as high as $24 billion, and getting more expensive the longer the wait. Trumps list puts the price tag at $12 billion (its apparently just accounting for the federal governments share, or the math is way off), and estimates the program will create 15,000 new, direct jobs. Theres at least bipartisan agreement that this project needs to get done, and fast. Schumer told the Washington Post in October that we have to do it or the economy will collapse. Trumps other top-50 projects include the more than 50-year-old Brent Spence Bridge (No. 2), an out-of-date span that links Ohio and Kentucky and whose upper deck has shed concrete; $8 billion in repairs to 15 structurally deficient bridges on the 1-95 outside Philadelphia (No. 6) that would create 15,800 direct jobs; and a replacement for the nations Air Traffic Control system (No. 8) at the cost of $10 billion. Also on the list, at No. 18: the Second Avenue Subway, specifically Phase 2 (96th to 125th Street) and Phase 3 (63rd to Houston Street). The Trump document lists the cost at $14.2 billion (Phase 1, newly opened, cost about $4.5 billion and took a long time), and says construction would create 16,000 new jobs. (A 16,000 number appears to be an estimate from Congresswoman Carolyn Maloneys office at the start of Phase 1.) Also among the candidates for construction or repairs: dams; airports in St. Louis, Seattle, and Kansas City; station improvements at D.C. and Chicagos Union Stations; a high-speed rail line in Texas; the Atlantic Coast Pipeline; and even a wind-turbine farm in Wyoming. Trump and the Democrats will likely agree on what needs to be fixed, and on job creation. But a likely sticking point is going to be how to pay for all of these projects. The Democrats plan would rely on federal funding  which Senate Republicans have already rejected because its the act of spending government money. Trumps plan would rely heavily on tax credits for developers, the costs of which, his economic advisers say, will be made up in tax revenue from a bolstered economy. Private-public partnerships are commonplace and necessary, but the problems with funding the bulk of an infrastructure plan through this method are myriad  not least of which is that fixing and maintaining rusted-out bridges or deteriorating roads doesnt bring in consistent revenue, unless there are tolls. So this infrastructure battle is just beginning  while highways continue to fall apart."}, {"date": "2017/01/25", "title": "Things Are Looking Up for Donald Trumps U.S. Businesses", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/things-are-looking-up-for-donald-trumps-u-s-businesses.html", "text": " These are chaotic times for America.

Todays news does bring one silver lining, though: All indications suggest that despite all this upheaval, Donald Trumps business empire will be just fine. First comes the news, courtesy of Bloomberg, that President Donald Trumps hotel company aims to eventually triple the number of Trump luxury hotels throughout the United States and will begin opening lower-priced hotels this year as well. There are 26 major metropolitan areas in the U.S., and were in five, Trump Hotels CEO Eric Danziger told Bloomberg. I dont see any reason that we couldnt be in all of them eventually. If all goes as planned, future generations will have convenient access to Trump-owned properties wherever they are in the country. Second, CNBC just reported that the Trump-owned Mar-a-Lago country club will be doubling its initiation fee from $100,000 per year to $200,000 a year. This is a reversal of the move the club made in 2012, when it cut its fee from $200,000 to $100,000. Now, for whatever reason, the club  which Trump will occasionally use as his Winter White House, offering members a chance to mingle with the 45th president, as CNBC put it  feels confident enough in its cachet to have bumped the initiation fee back upward. New members will pay both the new initiation rate and $14,000 a year in dues. Again: Whatever else youre worried about, rest easy. Financially speaking, things look promising for Donald J. Trump in 2017, at least when it comes to his domestic concerns.

For human beings to change the climate of the planet is a monstrously enormous undertaking, Gelernter said. I havent seen convincing evidence of it  Were in Connecticut, so we know about the ice age. The Earths climate oscillates, theres no way to stop it, he said. My first supposition is that if its getting warmer, then its a natural oscillation. In fact, scientists who study this issue are well aware of the ice age and other changes in atmospheric temperature over time. They have considered and rejected the possibility that the link between increased concentrations of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere and rising temperatures is coincidental.

Why do we insist on women in combat but not in the NFL? is Gelernters idea of a knock-down argument.

The Republican Party is a political organization that is committed to redistributing wealth upward, in a time of massive inequality, and legislating sexual morality, in an era of ascendant social liberalism. When the former first tried to commandeer the latter, he was met with fierce resistance. The GOP leadership knew that Trump had little genuine interest in its policy goals; they knew that the mogul did not run for president to keep a conservative majority on the Supreme Court, but to keep his name in the headlines and his face on television. But in the end, it didnt matter that Trump and the Republican Party were driven by different interests, because very few of those interests were in conflict. Sure, some in the GOP were invested in a party-building strategy that forbade naked bigotry, but most were happy to divest from that blueprint the second bigotry won. The ends rationalized the means. Whats more, in many areas, Trumps compulsions and the GOPs desires proved perfectly harmonious. The reality stars unquenchable thirst for applause  and indifference to the concept of truth  enabled him to crowdsource a winning message for his partys agenda, one rally at a time. The presidents Wednesday-morning pledge to launch a major investigation into voter fraud is the latest example of the symbiosis between his voracious ego and the Republican Partys strategic imperatives. Trump did not call for this investigation in response to evidence of voter fraud submitted to him by state-level Republicans. He called for it because Hillary Clintons popular-vote win has made him desperately insecure  and to stifle that insecurity, he has sold a comforting fantasy to himself. This is not conjecture. The presidents aides have described him as dogged by insecurity over the popular vote, in interviews with the Associated Press, Washington Post, New York Times, and other outlets. Back in November Trump tweeted that he had actually won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally. At the time, it seemed likely that Trump was intentionally lying to protect his image in the eyes of his supporters. After all, even as Trump argued that the 2016 election was plagued by voter fraud massive enough to doom Republicans in countless down-ballot races, his lawyers were working to quash Jill Steins proposed recounts, arguing, All available evidence suggests that the 2016 election was not tainted by fraud or mistake. But this week, Trump repeated his claim in a private meeting with congressional leaders  an audience that he has little hope of conning on this subject. And subsequent reporting from the Posts Robert Costa indicates that the president has convinced himself that he really did win more votes (from American citizens) than Hillary Clinton did. If true, then the president of the United States is literally delusional. He is a man capable of believing that millions of people voted illegally when his injured ego demands it  and then of banishing that reality from his mind the moment its implications become inconvenient. But Trumps ability to con himself may prove nearly as useful to the GOP as his capacity to con white working-class voters in Youngstown. The Republican Party does not share the presidents need to mitigate his every narcissistic injury. But it does have a need to protect the more unpopular aspects of its agenda against democratic rebuke. The GOP has won the national popular vote in only one out of the past seven elections. And its standing among the nonvoting population of the U.S.  which is disproportionately poor and nonwhite  is even worse. An uptick in voter participation is one of the gravest threats facing the conservative movement. In this context, having a shameless, delusional president shouting about rigged elections from his bully pulpit is quite useful. If Americans believe that voter fraud is a significant threat to their democracy, it will be easier for the Justice Department to, say, demand voter-roll updates and purges in heavily minority areas  or for state-level Republicans to push for new voter-identification laws that disproportionately burden nonwhite voters. The George W. Bush administration launched a five-year investigation into voter fraud, which turned up no evidence of any organized effort to skew federal elections. The GOP has already tried to justify voting restrictions by collecting facts. Now, their best bet is to do so by disseminating delusions. And the man in the White House couldnt be more qualified for that job."}, {"date": "2017/01/25", "title": "The Fight for the Soul of the Republican Party Has Been Canceled", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/the-fight-for-the-soul-of-the-gop-has-been-canceled.html", "text": " There are hints in the air that the long-predicted ideological schism within the Republican Party between populists and traditional conservatives is breaking open. Donald Trumps unusually populist inaugural address, almost devoid of traditional conservative themes, seemed to break new ideological ground. Unlike most Republicans who try to ape the rhetorical tropes associated with Ronald Reagan, Trump instead tried to recall the stylings of Andrew Jackson. It was an unvarnished declaration of the basic principles of his populist and kind of nationalist movement, chief strategist Steve Bannon told the Washington Post. I dont think weve had a speech like that since Andrew Jackson came to the White House, Bannon said. But you could see it was very Jacksonian. Meanwhile, Trump has hired Julia Hahn, a 25-year-old Breitbart staffer who has savaged Paul Ryan for his past support for immigration reform, alarming allies of the House Speaker. It is certainly true that ideological tensions exist between Trump and the party he has conquered. Trump is surely not a traditional conservative, for the simple reason that conservatism is a set of relatively coherent policy beliefs, and Trump does not have very many coherent policy beliefs. But the beliefs he does have, at least as far as we can tell from his administration and his agenda, overlap heavily with traditional conservatism. That is because the conservative tradition and the populist Jacksonian tradition turn out to be mostly the same thing. The points of difference between Trump and Ryan are smaller than they might appear. Ryan has supported comprehensive immigration reform in the past, and continues to support free trade, while Trump opposes both. Neither disagreement is especially difficult to finesse. The only major new trade agreement on the docket, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, was already moribund before the election. Comprehensive immigration reform died three years ago, and Trump has already backed off his promises to quickly deport Dreamers and is focusing instead on border-security measures that enjoy long-standing Republican support. Meanwhile, the Congressional party is working hand-in-glove with its presidential wing. Every Trump cabinet nominee, even those who are brutally unqualified (like Ben Carson) or laden with serious ethical problems (like Tom Price), seems likely to sail through a Senate that can only afford to lose two Republican votes. And Congress has allowed Trump to conceal his tax returns and maintain his business empire, two violations of norms that would permit massive self-enrichment by the president and his family. Republicans have instead directed the oversight machinery of Congress against Trumps critics and former opponents. Trump and his party are cooperating on a wide range of traditional Republican policies: regressive tax cuts, weakening of labor laws, environmental protections, and regulations on the finance industry, and an assault on the Affordable Care Act. Both Trump and the Congressional GOP have attacked Obamacare for providing too little coverage, and have refrained from writing detailed alternatives because their ideas would provide even less coverage. To the extent that Trump is giving his Congressional wing trouble on health care, it is because he spouts off without understanding the issue. The differences between Trump and his Congressional allies are no wider than those that divided Barack Obama and his party in 2009, or George W. Bush and his party eight years before that, or Bill Clinton and his eight years prior. Tim Phillips, president of the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity, the epitome of the libertarian, pro-business, Paul Ryanesque Republican money wing, has praised Trumps policies. There just isnt much daylight between us, he told Politico recently. What, then, explains the widespread belief that Trump has veered so far from traditional Republican doctrine? One reason is emphasis. Trump simply ignores the traditionally Republican elements of his governing program in his public remarks. Trump devoted most of his inaugural speech to the few elements of his platform that diverge from the Paul Ryan agenda, skipping over the many elements that conform to it. And he compounded the impression, as he has during the campaign, by portraying himself as an enemy of the elite and the political class. But there is another thing that is necessary to grasp about the political tradition Trump represents. Jacksonian populism is conservatism, at least in the modern American form. While nearly two centuries have passed since Andrew Jacksons time, he pioneered almost every recognizable feature of contemporary Republican politics. Jackson built a following by denouncing elites. But he did not mean economic elites, exactly. He meant Easterners, urbanites, and experts, including the ones who argued a national bank was necessary to avoid a financial crisis. (They were right and Jackson was wrong. Jacksons destruction of the bank caused a serious recession.) Jackson did not oppose bankers, per se  he drew support of regional banks that felt threatened by the national bank. Jackson had no program of taxing or regulating the rich. His economic populism was directed entirely against the state. The rich and powerful too often bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes, he wrote. Many people understand that Jacksons reputation has come under harsh scrutiny and revision in recent decades, in part because he owned slaves. Of course, many (though not all) political elites owned slaves before the Civil War. It is not just that Jackson owned slaves but that he followed policies to protect and defend slavery, as opposed to the conflicted positions of other slave-owning politicians who wished to see the practice end eventually. Jacksons conquest of Native American lands  the cruelty of which provoked strong domestic opposition  was carried out for the purpose of expanding slave territory, in order to prevent the slave states from being outnumbered and eventually outvoted (the fear among slave states that led, via the Missouri Compromise, to the Civil War). Jackson banned the mailing of abolitionist literature into the South. As the cast of Americas racial hierarchy has changed over its history, the meaning of the right-wing and left-wing positions on the racial question has evolved. In Jacksons time, his position of expanding land available for slavery and blocking avenues for organizing opposition to it clearly represented the right-wing position. Jacksons resemblance to Trump runs even deeper than Trump or Steve Bannon may realize. Jackson, like Trump, throbbed with resentment at his enemies, a feeling that was channeled into extraordinary personal entitlement. (As Steve Inskeep discovers in Jacksonland, Jackson used his office to enrich himself by speculating in lands whose value he knew would increase as a result of his conquests.) Jackson opposed South Carolinian secession for the same reason he dismissed a hostile Supreme Court ruling  not out of any larger principle, but out of a domineering instinct that made him lash out instinctively at any threat to his authority. That style endeared him to the part of the country that forms the base of the GOP today. Jackson fused the white working class in the South and Appalachia with the interests of the planter elite, expressing their shared interests not through activist government but through militaristic plunder. An aura of progressivism has clung to Jackson for decades, largely due to an accident of history. During the 19th century, the Democratic Party was the conservative, Southern, rabidly white-supremacist, strict constructionist party, while the Whigs, and then the Republicans, favored more activist government and more egalitarian social structure. During the 20th century, those roles reversed. But the Democratic Party retained its Southern and Appalachian base for decades during the transition, and it convinced itself of a narrative (using wildly selective history) that wove Jacksons reactionary presidency into the 20th-century version. Meanwhile, as the Republican Party has grown more uniformly conservative, it has naturally grown more Jacksonian in its style. The cultural populism, anti-intellectualism, paranoia, and crude nationalism of such figures as Joe McCarthy, George Wallace, and Sarah Palin presaged the buffoonish ravings of the current president. Far from being at odds with the agenda of a party allied with entrenched wealth, that populist style is the best way to lend that agenda mass appeal. We should stop seeing Trumpism as a challenge to the GOP and instead understand it as the partys natural historical evolution."}, {"date": "2017/01/25", "title": "Steve Bannon Is Registered to Vote in Two States (Update: So Is Tiffany Trump)", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/steve-bannon-is-registered-to-vote-in-two-states.html", "text": " President Donald Trump, this morning: The Sarasota Herald-Tribunes Chris Anderson, yesterday: The call was coming from inside the White House.

The emerging reality is that with the exception of a few priorities involving trade and immigration, and a few quick payoffs to his partys base (e.g., reinstitution of the Mexico City Rules banning support for international family-planning programs, a treat for right-to-lifers, to be followed next week by a similarly targeted Supreme Court nomination), there may not be any plan. Indeed, the activism conveyed by Trumps initial executive orders is undermined by the self-imposed Day One deadlines he missed, including the big-dog-that-did-not-bark action to revoke Obama deportation deferrals. Two newspaper-of-record accounts of White House disarray, power struggles, and presidential preoccupation with non-substantive matters have come out already this week. They compound earlier reports of limited staffing and sparse policy discussions characterizing the incoming Executive branch leadership. To those discouraging signs we should add a winning presidential campaign that was famously light on policy details, and the attitude of hostility toward the usual Beltway sources of policy advice that was reflected in the Presidents inaugural address. Worse yet, Donald Trumps erratic habits of thinking and communicating  including his notorious tendency to impulsively share his wishes on matters high and low by Twitter  are built-in obstacles to any kind of real planning. Not that long ago, conservative activists and corporate lobbies had ample reason to hope that Trumps apparent lack of interest in and manifest ignorance about most details of governing would enable them to foist upon him their own very detailed and comprehensive plans for reshaping America, particularly in domestic policy. Republicans and Democrats alike wondered if Trump would be the president ber-lobbyist Grover Norquist dreamed of back in 2012: someone with enough working digits to sign the Paul Ryan budget (which has gone through several new iterations since 2012) into law. Conservative columnist Ross Douthat described this possibility as one in which Trump decides that governing isnt worth it and just lets Paul Ryan run the country. Thats not how its looking right now: Trump has already thrown enough monkey wrenches into congressional GOP plans  notably plans to repeal and replace Obamacare, and also plans to cut taxes  to make it clear nobody can plan much of anything without his concurrence. And thats a real problem given the narrow margins of control Republicans have in the Senate, and the intricate mechanisms and precision timing required for avoiding Democratic filibusters by use of the congressional budget process. This problem is especially acute for Trump cabinet appointees who are closely associated with congressional Republican plans, but who have no way of knowing for sure what the Boss is going to decide. And thus in two rounds of confirmation hearings Representative Tom Price, Trumps choice to run the huge federal agency, HHS, that must formulate and implement plans for health-care proposals, has been forced again and again to admit he cannot tell the Senate what the administration will propose to do  even though Price himself has a record a mile long of support for hard-core conservative fiscal and health-care policies. An exchange in the Finance Committee hearing today was especially telling: Pressed by Senator Sherrod Brown to say if Trump was telling the truth about his supposed close work with Price to put together an Obamacare replacement plan, Price responded laconically: It is true the president said that. OMB directordesignate Representative Mick Mulvaney, a Freedom Caucus member who has supported all sorts of radical reforms of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, was reduced at his own confirmation hearing today to suggesting hell tell the president the truth about his belief these programs as constituted are unaffordable. But he could not and cannot tell senators what the administration will actually do, even though Congress has already passed a budget resolution and is poised for action on Obamacare and other priorities. It is natural to suspect pols like Price and Mulvaney are just stonewalling to keep their plans secret. But the more we learn about the White House being a rolling ball of madness, the more it becomes apparent there may not be any plans. For the moment, at least, America is flying blind, and the pilot is worried about crowd estimates. Trump will join congressional Republicans in Philadelphia today for their annual retreat, being billed far and wide as a planning sessions for what GOP flacks are now calling a 200-day plan (a prudent replacement for earlier talk of what they would accomplish in the first 100 days). Perhaps the oracle will speak, and all the mysteries surrounding the party agenda will be dispelled. More likely, the solons will still need to consult Twitter hourly to figure out their maximum leaders wishes."}, {"date": "2017/01/25", "title": "Trump White House Tells EPA to Pull Climate-Change Webpage: Report", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-white-house-tells-epa-to-pull-climate-change-webpage.html", "text": " Despite Ivanka Trumps passionate objections (were assuming), the Trump administration has reportedly ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to remove its website about climate change.

Hes expected to make up for it in the coming days with executive orders that would kick off the construction of a southern border wall, punish sanctuary cities, and temporarily ban most refugees, as well as immigrants from seven Middle Eastern and African nations. The New York Times reports that Trump is also mulling over orders that would resume the CIAs black site detention program and enhance interrogation techniques. Trump is expected to sign the first orders during a visit to the Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday. He teased the event on Twitter: The executive actions on refugees and immigration from terror-prone nations are expected on Thursday. Several sources told the Washington Post that Trumps intention is to show that hes fulfilling campaign promises ahead of his appearance at the GOP retreat in Philadelphia on Thursday. Heres what we know about the policies Trump is expected to enact this week. A Trump administration official told the Post that restrictions on the refugee program had yet to be finalized. One option under discussion is to suspend the admission of all refugees for four months; that would give officials time to determine which nations pose the greatest risk, and implement more aggressive vetting procedures. The AP reported that there would probably be an exception for religious minorities fleeing persecution, which would allow Christians fleeing Muslim-majority nations into the U.S. The admission of Syrian refugees could be suspended indefinitely. The president has the power to halt refugee processing and limit how many refugees can enter the country, and President George W. Bush stopped refugee processing for several months after 9/11. A person familiar with the plan told The Wall Street Journal that when admissions resume, the annual cap would be set at 50,000. (President Obama set the number of refugees to be resettled this fiscal year at 110,000.) By the end of December 2016, 25,000 refugees had been resettled  so if Trump implements this plan, only another 25,000 would be admitted by the end of September. From a legal standpoint, it would be exactly within his legal rights, Stephen Legomsky, the Obama administrations chief counsel for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services told Reuters. But from a policy standpoint, it would be a terrible idea because there is such an urgent humanitarian need right now for refugees. During the campaign, Trump said the U.S. would create safe zones in Syria so refugees wouldnt need to come to the U.S. The Journal reports that that is expected to be part of Trumps package, though its a difficult task that would likely require the use of U.S. ground troops and air power. At one point during the campaign, Trump proposed temporarily banning all Muslims from entering the United States, but later he walked that back, saying there would be no visas for people from nations where adequate screening cannot occur. Trump is said to be considering a temporary ban on issuing visas to people from several Muslim-majority nations  Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen  until new procedures are implemented. (As the Post notes, people from those nations are rarely granted visas as it is.) White House press secretary Sean Spicer said on Tuesday that changes to the vetting process would be worked out after Rex Tillerson, Trumps secretary of state, is in place. Trump has not given specifics on what extreme vetting would entail, but the Journal reports that the new process is expected to ban anyone who has persecuted people of other religions or engaged in so-called honor killing, violence against women, or oppressed a member of one race, gender, or sexual orientation. In addition to telling the State Department to stop issuing visas to people from particular countries, Trump could even instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection not to admit people from those countries who already have visas. Such actions would likely provoke legal challenges, particularly if the only people targeted are from Muslim nations. Earlier this month, it was reported that congressional Republicans believed the president already had the authority to build a southern border wall under the Secure Fence Act of 2006, and theyre hoping to put funding for the project in a spending bill that must pass by April 28. Trump said that while U.S. taxpayers would initially fund the project  which estimates say could cost as much as $20 billion  Mexico would eventually reimburse them. It looks like Trump may be able to get started even sooner. A source told the Journal that congressional leaders pointed out tens of millions of dollars in unspent allocations, which Trump intends to put toward getting started on the wall immediately. The source of the funding is unclear. Building the wall would still be logistically and legally difficult, particularly because Mexico insists it will not pay for it. Some Mexicans are angry that the announcement is expected on Wednesday, the same day top Mexican officials are set to meet with senior Trump advisers to discuss immigration and economic issues. Mexican president Enrique Pea Nieto is scheduled to meet with Trump next week. Trump is also expected to increase the number of border patrol agents by 5,000 and issue an order punishing cities that fail to cooperate with federal immigration agencies. It appears that, for now, those shielded by President Obamas Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program will not be targeted. [Trumps] priority is first and foremost focused on people who pose a threat to people in our country  to criminals, frankly, Press Secretary Spicer said Tuesday. And thats where he wants ICE [the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency] to focus their efforts. The Times reports that Trump is also considering whether to issue orders that would affect Guantnamo Bay and the CIAs secret overseas detention centers. One draft would review whether to reinstate the program of interrogation of high-value alien terrorists to be operated outside the United States, and whether such a program should include the use of detention facilities operated by the C.I.A. The document also states that no one in U.S. custody would be subjected to torture, as defined by U.S. or international law. Another order under consideration would launch a review of the Army Field Manuals to determine whether enhanced interrogation techniques should be allowed. New CIA director Mike Pompeo has said hes open to allowing waterboarding, and he told the Senate he would consider revising the Army Field Manuals if experts found enhanced interrogation techniques are an impediment to gathering important intelligence."}, {"date": "2017/01/24", "title": "The Penn Station Amtrak Departures Board Goes Dark", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/the-penn-station-amtrak-departures-board-goes-dark.html", "text": " Penn Stations big Amtrak departures board is no more.

The House today passed legislation banning the use of federal funds to pay for, or to subsidize via private insurance (as in Obamacare), abortions. This would represent making into permanent law the so-called Hyde Amendment (named after the late Illinois GOP House Member Henry Hyde), an appropriations rider that has been annually extended since 1976. So it would change nothing immediately, but it would make it a lot harder to repeal the underlying policy, and would also head off accidental repeals of Hyde via some failure in the always iffy appropriations process. Thats all in the subjunctive mood because the odds are very high this legislation will succumb to a Democratic filibuster in the Senate, just as it did in 2013 and 2015. Once upon a time, a goodly number of Democrats supported the Hyde Amendment, even if they supported a constitutional right to an abortion. But in the House, procedural votes on the permanent Hyde Amendment bill (the roll call on final passage is not yet available) indicated something pretty close to a party-line vote. So this is just another GOP warning shot that it intends to make abortion illegal, after first making it unaffordable for millions of women who rely on government-provided or -subsidized insurance for their health-care needs. Donald Trumps speedy reinstitution of the so-called Mexico City Rules banning U.S. funding to any international organizations remotely connected to the exercise of abortion rights was another flare sent up.

With a pair of executive orders, the president reversed the Obama administrations decisions on both the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. But the White House did not immediately make the text of the orders available to the public, and its unclear whether Trumps endorsement will be enough to get the oil flowing. For one thing, an executive order signed by George W. Bush in 2004 requires the State Department to lead a broad review of all cross-border pipelines before theyre approved. And its unclear whether Trumps order explicitly alters that rule. According to sources who spoke with Politico, there was little communication between the Trump team and the State Department ahead of the executive order on the Keystone XL, which would carry Canadian tar sands from Alberta to Texas. For another, Trump suggests that his approval of Keystone would be subject to a renegotiation of terms by us  an ostensible reference to his campaign vow to have the U.S. government confiscate 25 percent of the profits the pipeline produces. This would be a tall order, in both legal and political terms. And then theres the considerable opposition to the pipeline among landowners in deep-red Nebraska; the Cornhusker State regulators who need to be won over for the project to proceed; and the environmentalist movement thats itching for a symbolic fight with the climate-change accelerator-in-chief. The latter is also a formidable obstacle to the Dakota Access pipeline (DAPL). A coalition of environmentalists, the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, and Native American rights activists pressured the Obama administration into halting construction of the last leg of DAPL last December, pending further review of the environmental risks posed by the project. The Sioux claim that the pipeline threatens the tribes sacred land and water supply. After the Obama administrations action, thousands of protesters remained camped out near the proposed site of the pipelines construction, in anticipation of a potential reversal. According to The Wall Street Journal, several hundred additional protesters arrived at the main protest campsite last weekend."}, {"date": "2017/01/24", "title": "Trumps SCOTUS Pick Is Due Next Week, With 3 Conservatives Still in the Running", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trumps-scotus-short-list-down-to-3-conservatives.html", "text": " There is immense suspense as to all sorts of policy decisions of the Trump administration, and in many cases, even the timetable according to which such decisions will be made. But it looks like one key move of particular importance to Trumps cultural conservative and corporate backers alike, his choice to replace the late Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia, will occur next week, perhaps immediately following a meeting with GOP congressional leaders. Politico is reporting confidently today that Trumps once-extensive list of jurists under consideration for the Scalia seat (all pre-vetted by the conservative Heritage Foundation and Federalist Society) is now down to three names, all current Court of Appeals judges: Third Circuit judge Thomas Hardiman, Tenth Circuit judge Neil Gorsuch, and Eleventh Circuit judge William Pryor. Other than solid conservative credentials, what the three potential justices have in common is relative youth: Pryor is 54, Hardiman is 51, and Gorsuch is a mere tot for a federal judge, at 49 (by contrast, Barack Obamas nominee for the same position, Merrick Garland, was 63 when appointed and turned 64 while awaiting a confirmation hearing that never happened). This is very important to conservative legal activists who want to minimize exposure of the Court to nominations from future Democratic presidents. While they are all pre-vetted by conservatives and a bit short of the age when they will begin driving with the turn signal on, the short-short-list candidates have some individual differences. Gorsuch has several things going for him: a much-noted similarity to Scalia in constitutional thinking and writing style, and his pedigree as the son of the late Anne Gorsuch, Ronald Reagans first EPA administrator. Hes also been prominent in the conservative cause of expanding religious liberty as grounds for noncompliance with anti-discrimination and other laws, which will please conservative Christians if hes the choice. Like Gorsuch, Hardiman is known as a clear writer, but as Amy Howe notes at SCOTUSblog, the Pittsburgh-based judge inspires comparisons to a different conservative justice: Pryor has long been a lightning rod for liberal criticism thanks to his outspoken hostility to the constitutional right to choose (he once called Roe v. Wade the worst abomination of constitutional law). But Pryors involvement in a 2011 decision protecting transgender folk from workplace discrimination, and his role as Alabama attorney general in the prosecution of state Supreme Court judge Roy Moore (the Ten Commandments Judge who has fought a long battle against separation of church and state), have drawn some religious conservative fire. The buzz is that Pryors star may be fading in the SCOTUS sweepstakes, but he has a very influential ally in Senator and Attorney Generalnominee Jeff Sessions, who definitely has Trumps ear. As should be clear from the extensive lead-in to this choice, Democrats have had zero input, and should they decide to filibuster whomever Trump goes with, theres a good chance Mitch McConnell will pursue a rules change extending Harry Reids nuking of the filibuster for lower-court judicial appointments to SCOTUS. A big strategic question for Senate Democrats is whether they should provoke McConnell now or keep the filibuster in play in case its needed for another Trump SCOTUS appointment in the future, which could reshape the Court for years to come."}, {"date": "2017/01/24", "title": "Who Are the Black Bloc Protesters Who Rioted on Inauguration Weekend?", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/who-are-the-black-bloc-protesters.html", "text": "  Dont worry.

What is noteworthy about this proposal is less the substance than the underlying strategic rationale for it. Democrats are eager to drive a wedge between the new president and congressional Republicans and persuade [President Trump] to adopt ideas that would put him at odds with GOP leaders, reports the Washington Post. A senior Democratic Senate aide, speaking with the Atlantics Michelle Cottle, lays out the partys strategery in more explicit detail: So thats the plan: force Trump into a choice between either failing to uphold his campaign promises or else proving that Democrats, not Republicans, are the ones who can make governing work. Alas, this theory rests upon numerous assumptions that are almost certainly false. 1. It assumes Trump will not really want to sign a huge infrastructure bill. Trump promised a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan during the campaign, but proposed a plan based on tax credits that would mostly confer windfall benefits on existing proposals. Democrats think this is because Trump doesnt really want to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on infrastructure. I suspect otherwise. His chief strategist, Steve Bannon, has made it clear that a massive infrastructure plan is a key, and perhaps the key, element in Trumps plan to cement the loyalty of white working-class Democrats. The notion that Trump would refuse to spend the necessary funds on such a plan because he cares too much about the deficit seems fanciful. Trump also seems to grasp that infrastructure gives him the chance for a high-profile bipartisan deal. Describing his beautiful relationship with leaders of both parties yesterday, Trump boasted, Were about to make a big deal. The infrastructure bill would provide the sweet bipartisan coating to the bitter pill of his otherwise orthodox right-wing agenda. Democrats think theyre calling Trumps bluff, when in all likelihood, Trump is calling theirs. 2. It likewise assumes that congressional Republicans bitterly oppose large-scale infrastructure spending on principle. Were going to challenge [Trump], explains Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer. Break your promise to the blue-collar world, or work with us and split with the right, the Republican establishment, which hates these things. It is true that they stonewalled any such plan during President Obamas tenure. But this is because they understood that a bill with the optics of bipartisan cooperation, and the substance of fiscal stimulus to the economy, would benefit Obama and his party. When Republicans had control of government under George W. Bush, they were very happy to pass debt-financed spending programs. To be sure, it is a slightly awkward messaging task for Republicans to immediately abandon their eight years of debt hysteria the moment a Republican moves into the White House. A bit of time will be required to reprogram the Fox News and talk-radio audience. From this standpoint, Democratic support for the bill provides Republicans with an added benefit: They can posture virtuously against the bill, and later decry it as a cause of the increase in deficits that is coming, while Democrats supply the votes to pass it. 3. The Democrats most deeply mistaken premise is their belief that the voters will make specific judgments about which congressional party is more effective. That is simply not how voters think. They make judgments about the state of the country, and hold the president and his party accountable. They do not separate their judgments about the congressional party from the president  indeed, they are so single-minded in their focus on the president that voters actually base their vote for state legislature on their assessment of the president. In theory, it might make sense for the public to conclude that Democrats are doing a better job than Republicans of helping Trump govern. In reality, that is not how they think at all. If Trump passes a bipartisan bill, it will make Trump more popular, and thus Trumps party more popular. Democrats success in the next two elections will be determined by Trumps approval ratings. The lower his ratings, the better Democrats will do. Voters are not going to reward Democrats for proving they can get stuff done with Trump. To be sure, it would be awkward for Democrats to openly oppose infrastructure spending after having supported it for years before. The easy way out for them would be to follow Arizona Representative Ruben Gallegos proposal to deny support for any infrastructure bill unless Trump releases his taxes to prove he would not personally benefit. Trump might get away with unprecedented corruption in office, but why not make Republicans in Congress bear the sole responsibility for this destruction of long-standing norms? Why should Democrats participate? But Senate Democrats have not imposed any such condition on their infrastructure plan. Matt House, a spokesman for Schumer, told me, Our position is that the president should make his returns public, that he shouldnt earn any money off of this bill, and that he should support the legislation. In other words, Democrats will not require any mechanism to ensure that Trump and his family do not profit off the bill as a condition for supporting a bill. That means they are willing not only to give Trump the political win he craves but also to tacitly cooperate with his obliteration of long-standing norms. Now, perhaps Democrats are so passionate about the cause of public infrastructure they are willing to sacrifice their vulnerable members and reduce their chance of picking up seats in order to secure progress on this vital issue. And perhaps they care about it so deeply they are willing to give Trump the boost in approval ratings, by demonstrating his ability to work with both parties. But if we take Democrats at their word, they are not proposing to sacrifice their own self-interest for the sake of building infrastructure. They instead appear to believe they have devised a clever plan to advance their own interests. In that case, they are badly deluded."}, {"date": "2017/01/24", "title": "Trump to Keep James Comey As FBI Director", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-to-keep-james-comey-on-as-fbi-director.html", "text": " Two days before he was elected president, Donald Trump accused James Comey of rigging the FBIs investigation into Hillary Clintons email server. Right now, she is being protected by a rigged system. Its a totally rigged system, the GOP nominee told supporters in Michigan, following Comeys announcement that the emails the FBI had discovered on Anthony Weiners laptop had no bearing on Clintons case. You cant review 650,000 new emails in eight days. You cant do it, folks. Trump lamented the possibility that Comeys last-minute announcement had taken [victory] away from us. And then, the opposite proved true. Polling  both public and internal  suggested that Comeys previous letter had tilted the playing field dramatically rightward. That missive  which broke with long-standing Justice Department precedents against commenting on ongoing investigations and making significant announcements in close proximity to an election  alerted the world that FBI agents had discovered new, ostensibly Clinton-related emails on Weiners laptop. (Comey had not yet read these emails, but decided he had a public duty to disclose the hypothetical significance of his new discovery.) Irresponsible headlines and Trumpian hyperbole ensued. Many of Clintons marginal supporters decided to let someone else vote for the corrupt, career politician, who was going to win anyway. In hindsight, all that Comeys last-minute exoneration accomplished was to provide voters with one last reminder that the most important thing to know about Hillary Clinton is that she cant send an email without getting embroiled in a scandal. And that isnt all that weve learned about Comeys conduct since November 8: Even as the FBI director was telegraphing new developments in the Clinton case, he was pressuring journalists not to report on the existence of the bureaus investigation into the Trump campaign. Last week, New York Times public editor Liz Spayd revealed that the paper had gotten word that the FBI was investigating possible collusion between the Russian government and members of the Trump campaign back in September  but with doubts about the material and with the F.B.I. discouraging publication, editors decided to hold their fire. All this has rendered James Comey one of the most widely reviled public servants in all of blue America. It has also secured him a vote of confidence and bro-hug from the new president of the United States. Last week Comey informed the FBIs senior staff that Trump has decided to retain him for the new administration, the New York Times reported Tuesday.

Or so Donald Trumps aides keep confiding to the nearest available reporter. On Sunday, one of the presidents confidantes told Politico that his staffers have to control information that may infuriate him, a task made difficult by the fact that the leader of the free world gets bored and likes to watch TV. That same day, some Trump aides provided the New York Times with a portrait of the president as a moody adolescent. The lack of discipline troubled even senior members of Mr. Trumps circle, the paper wrote, some of whom had urged him not to indulge his simmering resentment at what he saw as unfair news coverage. And then, on Monday night, Trumps staffers whispered an even more vivid account of his rough weekend to the Washington Post. The Posts story is chock-full of remarkable details. To list just a few: 1. After forcing Spicer to baldly lie to the White House press corps about the size of his inauguration crowd, the president fumed that his press secretarys performance was not forceful enough. According to Axios, Trump was also incensed by Spicers poor taste in suits, and is already considering treating the former RNC staffer to his signature catchphrase. 2. Trump already feels demoralized that the publics perception of his presidency so far does not necessarily align with his own sense of accomplishment. 3. Some Trump aides think Kellyanne Conway is trying to undermine Spicer so as to steal his job. 4. Jared Kushner tried to prevent Conway from being invited into the White House at all, because he viewed her as a possible threat to his role as Trumps chief consigliere.5. Ultimately, though, the most astounding sentence in the Posts write-up might be the following: Nearly a dozen of Trumps closest confidantes helped plant an embarrassing news story about how their boss cant handle embarrassing news stories. Which is to say: A president who prizes loyalty in his subordinates has already been betrayed by a huge swath of his inner circle. It isnt hard to understand why Trumps aides would want to distance themselves from the moguls decision to begin his presidency by shouting self-aggrandizing delusions at CIA employees, congressional leaders, and the Fourth Estate. But we arent in the late days of a losing campaign, when its normal for advisers to start leaking dirt on the boss to save their reputations.

May has said she wants to start the U.K.s leave from the EU by March 31 of this year, leaving her two months to secure votes for such legislation in Parliament The Supreme Courts decision will not stop the Brexit process.

The Supreme Court did rule that the British government wont need the approval of regional legislatures in Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales, which is a win for the May government. Still the Scottish National Party (which doesnt want to leave the E.U.) has vowed to put forward 50 amendments to the Brexit bill, and has already called for another independence referendum saying it was not being heard within the United Kingdom.

Gerald Ford had been inaugurated three months earlier as Richard Nixon resigned and had within weeks pardoned his predecessor. The new president was well along toward establishing his reputation as an ill-spoken bumbler. As the story opens, hes giving a speech at Mesa College, in Colorado, and mispronounces its name (meesa), then tries to recover with a lame joke. And, then, as Reeves writes: This was a relatively outr cover for its time, but New York  then only six years old  had established itself as a highly irreverent magazine that took pokes at the powerful, and especially at Nixon, when theyd earned it. Saturation coverage of the president was very different in the 1970s, Reeves explains today, and the press had a different role: The boys on the bus are a long time ago. There were hundreds of us, and print was still dominant  television only became dominant during the Carter campaign, through Sam Donaldson. We totally controlled the agenda. Nobody questioned that the press controlled the agenda. Now the press doesnt control anything. He laughs. Theyve outlasted us, the bastards! That said, he admits that this feature isnt his proudest moment. Its not a story that should be immortalized. At the time, hes quick to add, its exactly what I felt was happening. The man couldnt pronounce a word  it was one blunder after another. But, he continues, years later, I wrote a book about him. And when I talked to him in that period, he said that, after he pardoned Nixon, he thought the government couldnt function if Nixon was being dragged from courtroom to courtroom, both civil and criminal cases. I laughed at that at the time, and I think a lot of other people did. But what made me think he was probably right and I was probably wrong was the O.J. case. It was one of the first times you could see that an individual case could immobilize the country. I even wrote a piece for American Heritage  this was years later  apologizing to Ford for that part of it. The headline was IM SORRY, MR. PRESIDENT. Part of his affection for Ford, of course, is relative. Now I think were really in trouble. Gerald Ford was not a dangerous man. He was the nicest guy in the world  never shouldve been president, really, got there by accident. He wasnt the most competent man in the world  there was a bit of Rick Perry about him, particularly on the thing about whether Poland was a communist country. But he was this outgoing, generous, maybe-not-always-knowledgeable human being, especially compared to this, Trump, who seems to be looking for revenge. He was at heart a good man, and I dont think Trump is. I just watched him at some donors dinner.

His first run for public office had been in 2012; by conventional standards, he had no business speaking up in the Senate, much less running for president. He had alienated an awful lot of important people in his party with his grandstanding and irresponsible behavior in the midst of multiple fiscal crises. He had been especially damned for doing something that violated every rule of Washington: crossing the impermeable barrier between the two chambers of Congress to foment rebellion among House conservatives. But Cruz was a man with a plan: Aside from his formidable fundraising and organizational skills, he was sure that a bitter mood among Republican base voters would reward his insubordination and lack of experience and outflank his many Establishment Republican rivals. He was absolutely right about the mood of primary voters, but didnt count on someone less conventional than himself catching fire. Even after Donald Trump rained on Cruzs parade, the Texan (nearly a quarter-century younger than his vanquisher) looked to have a very bright future in the presumed ruins of the GOP after the inevitable general-election defeat. He worked hard to position himself as the principled conservative who finally put on the party yoke out of loyalty to the Troops late in the campaign season. He probably expected to greet the day on November 9 as the early front-runner for the Republican nomination in 2020, a year when Democrats would have thoroughly worn out their welcome. Like so many other people in American politics, however, Cruz didnt count on the unfathomable possibility that Trump would actually win. As Tim Alberta explains in Politico Magazine, now Cruz has to deal with the narrower horizons of a back-bench senator who needs to work to be reelected. Cruz has shut down his putative 2020 campaign operation and bent his efforts toward mending fences in the Senate and in a rapidly expanding Trumpland. Alberta tells us that team player is the watchword of all his friends and allies. His performance as the new administrations attack dog in Jeff Sessionss Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings was an unmistakable sign that the man the 45th president memorably called Lying Ted would now become a Trump loyalist, and hope for the best. Beyond Cruzs own future, what his saga could illustrate is that the movement conservative wing of the GOP is in the process of unconditionally surrendering to Trumps nationalist populism, or whatever it is. After all, there are not two more stolid orthodox conservatives in Washington than Cruz and Vice-President Mike Pence. Both understand that the base activists their movement relies on are deeply in love with Trump, at the moment at least. If, just to cite a very real possibility, Cruz and Pence wind up being the two chief aspirants to the role of Trumps political heir in 2024, will there really be any space for a real conservative? Will the term even many anything by then, other than loyalty to the mogul? Its entirely possible it wont, and the right end of the political landscape will be crowded with people like Ted Cruz, who will pretend they never even heard of #NeverTrump."}, {"date": "2017/01/24", "title": "Mike Pompeo Confirmed, Sworn in As CIA Director", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/mike-pompeo-confirmed-sworn-in-as-cia-director.html", "text": " On Monday evening, Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas was confirmed by the Senate as director of the CIA, despite Democrats concerns about his view on domestic surveillance and torture, and previous claims that Muslims are not doing enough to stand up to terrorism. Pompeo was sworn in by Vice-President Mike Pence several hours later. The vote was 66-32, with Rand Paul and more than half of the Democrats voting against Pompeo. Several prominent Democrats voted to confirm, including Chuck Schumer, Tim Kaine, and Dianne Feinstein. Democrat Ron Wyden led the opposition, grilling Pompeo for more than an hour during his hearing. In summer 2015 Congress let the collection of Americans phone data in bulk lapse, but as a member of the House Intelligence Committee, Pompeo argued it should be reinstated in expanded. Congress should pass a law re-establishing collection of all metadata, and combining it with publicly available financial and lifestyle information into a comprehensive, searchable database, Pompeo said in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published a year ago. Pompeo has said hes open to reinstating waterboarding, which was banned in the Army Field Manual under President Obama, and Trump said on the campaign trail that he would allow much worse. Pompeo told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he would not authorize any enhanced interrogation techniques that fall outside the Army Field Manual. However, he also said he would consider rewriting the rules if experts say banning waterboarding is an impediment to gathering vital intelligence. His record reveals extreme positions, including enthusiasm for sweeping new surveillance programs targeting Americans and an openness to sending our country backward with regard to torture, Wyden said in a statement. Furthermore, his views on intelligence assessments on Russian interference in our election shifted along with the presidents, raising questions about the nominees objectivity. Pompeo said during his hearing that he considers the U.S. spy agencies conclusion that Russia meddled with the U.S. election sound. He said he would continue investigating the issue, even if it caused problems for the president. I promise you I will pursue the facts wherever they take us  with respect to this issue and with respect to every other issue, he said. Other Democrats said they were voting against Pompeo due to his troubling remarks about Muslims. In 2013, Pompeo told Congress that Muslim leaders in the U.S. arent doing enough to combat terrorism and their silence is deafening. He added that Muslim leaders who fail to condemn terror attacks committed by those with radical Islamic beliefs are potentially complicit in these acts, and more importantly still, in those that may well follow. Republicans wanted Pompeo confirmed on Friday, arguing that no more debate was needed, and its dangerous not to have a permanent CIA director in place. This is a man who understands exactly what it takes to keep America safe, said Republican senator Tom Cotton. Pompeo was voted into Congress in 2010 as part of the tea-party wave. He graduated at the top of his class at West Point, then earned a law degree from Harvard. He is the third member of Trumps cabinet to be confirmed."}, {"date": "2017/01/24", "title": "Kellyanne Conway Reportedly Punched a Man at an Inaugural Ball", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/kellyanne-conway-reportedly-punched-a-man-at-inaugural-ball.html", "text": " This is how intense the news has been for the past four days: One of President Trumps top advisers reportedly got into a fist fight at an inaugural ball, and no one noticed.

After having his press secretary falsely insist that his inauguration crowd was bigger than Obamas, now Trump himself is repeating a lie about why he lost the popular vote  and displaying his knack for dragging out an unflattering story into multiple news cycles. The Washington Post reports that during a closed-door meeting with congressional leaders on Monday night, Trump insisted that he only lost the popular vote because between 3 million and 5 million people voted illegally. According to the New York Times, the Huffington Post, and NBC News, Trump said the votes were cast by illegal immigrants, but other reports suggest he wasnt that specific. Either way, theres nothing to back up that claim. Analysis of the November election found almost no instances of voter fraud, and there is no evidence that millions of people cast their ballots illegally. Trump won the presidency by securing 304 electoral votes, but nationwide, Hillary Clinton received 2,864,974 more votes than Trump. The presidents argument was thoroughly debunked when he tweeted back in November: I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally. When asked for evidence, Trump spokesperson Jason Miller pointed to a study thats been discredited. PolitiFact found that the conspiracy website InfoWars was spreading a report that 3 million votes were cast by illegal aliens. The source for the story was a nonexistent report from VoteFraud.org, and two tweets from a man named Gregg Phillips, who refused to say how he came to that conclusion. Trump reportedly spent about ten minutes rehashing his win during the reception in the State Dining Room. Democratic Representative Steny Hoyer said Trump also bragged about the size of the crowd at his inauguration. It was a huge crowd, a magnificent crowd. I havent seen such a crowd as big as this, Hoyer told CNN, quoting Trump. He said the president did not spend a lot of time on that, but it was clear that it was still on his mind. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn confirmed to Politico that Trump repeated his voter-fraud claim on Monday, but he suggested Republican lawmakers will be sticking to their plan of ignoring Trumps wild declarations. I didnt pay a lot of attention to it, Cornyn said. I was ready to move onto some policy issues. I didnt anticipate that discussion. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy tried to downplay Trumps false claim as well, but his explanation made little sense. We talked about different electoral college, popular votes, going through the different ones, McCarthy said. Well, we talked about going back through past elections. Everyone in there goes through elections and stuff, so everybodys giving their different histories of different parts. None of the Republicans who commented on the meeting stressed that theres no reason to think millions of votes were cast illegally, though spreading such claims can have serious consequences that go well beyond distracting from the presidents agenda. As The Atlantic pointed out in November: During his confirmation hearing, Senator Jeff Sessions admitted that he and Trump never discussed the millions of alleged illegal votes, though as attorney general, it would fall on Sessions to prosecute and protect the integrity of U.S. elections. If Trump really thinks he was robbed of a popular-vote win, why isnt his administration looking for evidence to prove it, and trying to stop it?

That is, until the spokesperson for that U.S. coalition shot down the Russian ministrys statement, calling it propaganda and rubbish. The Pentagon, now under the helm of General James Mattis  who has expressed skepticism about Putin and his motives  also denied the Russian claims.

Its unclear, exactly, how this alternative fact of joint cooperation surfaced. The United States and Russia maintain a line of communication to avoid any incidents in the airspace above Syria. Turkey, a NATO member, did cooperate and carry out joint airstrikes with Russia in al-Bab against ISIS for the first time last week, which is a pretty significant development. According to Al Jazeera, its the closest the two historic adversaries have worked together in Syria.

While Trump can be expected to continue his corporate horse-trading, calling it miniature may have been premature. In a meeting with a dozen or so CEOs today, Trump seemed to be trying to take this strategy to scale by offering a meta-deal to relieve businesses of all those nettlesome regulations (and much of their taxes, too!) in exchange for agreements to keep operations and jobs stateside. Thats the carrot. The stick would be the tariffs or border tax Trump has threatened to impose, along with whatever damage the administration can inflict on an individual companys or industrys stock by bad-mouthing them. It is impossible to avoid the impression that Trump is offering at a national level the kind of grand bargain with job creators that Republican (and some Democratic) governors so love: Give us jobs, and we will keep the cost of providing those jobs  whether its taxes or minimum-wage laws or collective bargaining requirements or workforce or environmental regulations  as low as is possible. For the potential employees of companies taking advantage of this bargain, the implicit message is simple: You will have jobs  even if they may be crappy jobs with low wages, few benefits, and no labor or workforce protections. Now to be sure, following his habit of throwing something self-contradictory into every statement, Trump isnt admitting theres any value in all the discarded regulations and reduced taxes: This should be interpreted alongside Trumps promises to repeal Obamacare but offer something even more terrific at a fraction of the cost: Its just noise until proved otherwise. From Donald Trumps point of view, there are two really good things about this national race-to-the-bottom strategy. First, it sets up employment figures as an economic metric that  excuse the phrase  trumps more qualitative measurements of economic well-being. Since slashing business costs will also boost corporate profits, GDP might temporarily benefit as well. Everything could look like its coming up roses, if you dont look very closely. Second, it involves a philosophy and set of policies that are much, much more consistent with standard conservative orthodoxy than is Trumps company-by-company meddling. So long as taxes go down and regulations go away, the across-the-board nature of these concessions will insulate them in conservative thinking from any attribution of corporate welfare, even though they will together represent a massive public subsidy to private wealth. So what could go wrong with this strategy, aside from the fact that among its victims will be millions of members of the white working class that did so much to put Donald Trump in office?"}, {"date": "2017/01/23", "title": "A Massive $2.2 Billion Dome Now Covers the Chernobyl Reactor", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/a-massive-dome-now-covers-the-chernobyl-reactor.html", "text": "  Dont worry.

But it was the topic of crowd size at last Fridays inauguration that brought out the most animation in Spicer, who went on an extended and emotive explanation about how demoralizing and frustrating it is for Trump and his supporters to fend off constant criticism. The narrative and the default narrative is always negative, Spicer said in response to a question from CNNs Jim Acosta, the reporter Trump famously sparred with at his last press conference. Acosta asked why Spicer and Trump felt it necessary to address the subject of crowd size on Saturday. Spicer described how difficult it is to have doubters and critics trying to undercut the enormous support [Trump] has. Its unbelievably frustrating, he said. But its worth noting that this diatribe about negativity and complaints about undermining came from a man who works for Trump, who spent years trying to argue that President Obama was born in Kenya and thus not a legitimate president. And the desperate pleas for an attaboy when Trump succeeds brought to mind for some on social media the kind of person the presidents biggest fans would dub a snowflake: The discussion of inaugural crowds also involved Spicer reasserting his claims that Trumps was the most-watched inauguration of all time. Its unquestionable, he said, referring to Nielsen ratings and livestreams. He also tried to recast a statement he made Saturday, when he said, This was the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration  period  both in person and around the globe. While that sure sounds like hes saying it was the largest audience in person as well as the largest audience around the globe, Spicer suggested he was combining those two audiences to come up with the largest combined viewership. Asked if he always intends to tell the truth in the briefing room, Spicer said that he does, adding that the truth is not easy to agree on. I think sometimes we can disagree with the facts, he said. If we make a mistake, well correct them. Spicer was given an opportunity to do that when asked about Trumps speech at the CIA Saturday, where the president blamed the media for creating a rift between him and the intelligence community. Thats clearly false and evidence for it is right there on Trumps Twitter feed. But instead of walking that back, Spicer deflected and began talking about agents hooting and hollering during the presidents visit to CIA headquarters to prove that he had support in the agency. Asked about a CBS report that said the cheering came from about 40 people who came with Trump and sat in the first three rows, Spicer said it wasnt true. He said around ten people traveled with the president to Langley and none of them sat in the first three rows. On policy questions, Spicer moved quickly and told many reporters hed have to get back to them with answers. Among his notable statements, though, was that no decision has been made on plans to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Regarding Trumps remarks Saturday that the U.S. may get another chance at Iraqs oil, Spicer said Trump wont take options off the table.

Hahn is an interesting example of the kind of people whose careers have prospered by association with the more radical strain of populist conservatism Trump represents. Just a couple of years ago, she was a producer for Laura Ingraham, the talk-show gabber who played a big role in Dave Brats upset primary win over thenHouse Majority Leader (and Speaker-in-waiting) Eric Cantor. Hahn became Brats press secretary, and just seven months later left to work for Breitbart. There she became conspicuous for angry takes on the supposed indifference of the GOP Establishment (and particularly new House Speaker Paul Ryan) to current policies that allow Muslim refugees to enter the country. And by conspicuous, I mean she managed to draw a personal attack from prominent tea party congressman Raul Labrador after penning an article lashing the House Freedom Caucus for failing to force Ryan to delete refugee resettlement funds in the gigantic omnibus appropriations bill that kept the federal government open toward the end of 2015: Labradors explosion at Hahn drew a rebuke from her boss: 120 percent is a lot. But Bannon soon showed his solidarity with Hahn by co-writing with her an amazing attack on Paul Ryan which viewed that self-same gigantic appropriations bill strictly from the point of view of how it affected immigration and refugee policy and concluded Ryan was guilty of a total and complete sell-out of the American people masquerading as an appropriations bill. In case Breitbart readers were not sufficiently aware of their betrayal, Hahn followed up two days later with a piece again treating the massive appropriations measure as nothing more than a sinister plot to let in more Muslim refugees and expose an unsuspecting country to Sharia law and suggesting that Ryan was opening the floodgates to the wholesale conquest of America by Sharia law and female genital mutilation. (For what its worth, when yours truly wrote a column lightly mocking Hahns extraordinary tunnel-vision and floodgates logic, I was treated to a new and very, very lengthy Hahn piece accusing me of being, like Paul Ryan, an apologist for female genital mutiliation.) Hahn repeatedly returned to the theme of Paul Ryans perfidy during the campaign season, culminating in an October 21 article accusing Ryan of not-so-secretly working for Hillary Clintons election because of his slavish submission to the interests of big corporations and foreign nationalists. Heres a sample from that remarkable piece of invective: So you have to wonder what kind of message Hahns hiring might send with respect to the rather delicate and extremely important relationship between the 45th president of the United States and the Speaker of the House. Keep in mind that Ryans budget handiwork over the years (which, pace Hahn, touches on a few thousand issues other than immigration policy) is the foundation for everything congressional Republicans want to accomplish over the next few years. It seems likely that last shots have not been fired in the Bannon vs. Ryan feud."}, {"date": "2017/01/23", "title": "The Billionaires (and Mega-Millionaires) Trump Wants in His Cabinet", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/billionaires-millionaires-trump-cabinet.html", "text": " In his bid to build a staff of the greatest people, the most incredible people, Trump has nominated, in the main, plutocrats and those who hold their interests closest to heart. Net Worth: At least $166 million and as much as $500 million (including $3.2 million in profits he collected from Bernie Madoff shortly before Madoffs Ponzi scheme was exposed). Business Experience: After 17 years at Goldman Sachs, where his father was a legendary bulk trader and Mnuchin fils rose to become an executive vice-president, he left in the early aughts to create a series of hedge funds. During the financial crisis, Mnuchin became the perfect image of a robber baron who benefited from people losing their homes, collecting $13 billion in government subsidies to stabilize troubled assets for his bank OneWest  the bank profited to the tune of $3 billion and racked up another $2.4 billion in government fees for its foreclosures. And OneWest was notoriously ruthless with its clients; it once locked a Minnesota woman out of her home during a blizzard. Outlook: Mnuchin says hell urge Congress to eliminate parts of Dodd-Frank, i.e., the meager protections passed in 2010 to stop banks from repeating the reckless lending practices that brought on the 2008 market crash (and his windfall). Bonus: Mnuchins grandfather founded a yacht club in the Hamptons, and his father retired from Goldman to become a major art dealer. Mnuchin himself owns a stake in a $14.7 million de Kooning painting, Untitled III. He has also financed many movies, including Avatar and Mad Max: Fury Road. He failed to disclose $100 million in assets before his confirmation hearing (too much paperwork). Net Worth: Around $2.5 billion, which includes an art collection (featuring 25 paintings by Ren Magritte) that he values at $50 million (others say its closer to $150 million). He also owns a Palm Beach villa down the road from Mar-a-Lago. Business Experience: Ross has been described as the king of bankruptcy, a bottom-feeder, a vulture, and one of the profiteers of the great foreclosure machine. According to Reuters, hes also responsible for offshoring 2,700 jobs since 2004. An abridged list of potential conflicts of interest: Hes an investor in a shipping company with a Chinese sovereign-wealth fund and in a state-owned Chinese power generator run by the son of the former prime minister; sits alongside Russian oligarchs on the board of the Bank of Cyprus; and holds a stake in, and sits on the board of, ArcelorMittal, the biggest steel producer in the world (Commerce monitors the steel market). Outlook: If confirmed, Ross would be in charge of implementing some of Trumps more ambitious (i.e., preposterous) promises, like adding 25 million new jobs in the next decade and achieving annual 3.5 percent economic growth. But he might not be too stressed about it: I think you have to listen to campaign pitches more as symbolic, more as metaphors. Bonus: He once volunteered to be camouflaged in paint for a piece by Chinese contemporary artist Liu Bolin, then was painted to blend in with a mural of $100 bills. With Carl Icahn in 1991, he helped structure a deal that allowed Donald Trump to maintain control of his Atlantic City casino through bankruptcy. Net Worth: $45 million (at least). Business Experience: Puzder is CEO of a fast-food group that includes Hardees and Carls Jr.  a company that has repeatedly been sued for worker mistreatment (according to Bloomberg, Department of Labor investigations into the groups restaurants found wage violations 60 percent of the time). The restaurant group has also been sued for failing to provide breaks; forcing managers to be on call 24 hours a day without overtime pay; discriminating against an applicant with a disability; failing to provide sufficient safety gear; and tolerating sexual harassment in the workplace. Outlook: His book, Job Creation: How It Really Works and Why Government Doesnt Understand It, has been called a deregulatory manifesto, so it should come as no surprise that Puzder, appointed to lead the department charged with protecting workers rights, is a firm believer that government (and union) oversight of working conditions is a hindrance. He opposes raising the federal minimum wage and expanding overtime pay. Bonus: Last March, Puzder said hed like to try automating a few Carls Jr. restaurants  You order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person. He told Business Insider hed favor machines because [t]heyre always polite, they always upsell, they never take a vacation, they never show up late, theres never a slip-and-fall, or an age, sex, or race discrimination case. His ex-wife once appeared on Oprah in disguise as a victim of domestic violence (she has recently retracted those allegations). Net Worth: $24 million. Chaos father founded a shipping company with branches in the Marshall Islands and whose ships fly the Liberian flag (one of which was once discovered with 40 kilograms of cocaine while docked in Colombia). In 2012, the family made a $40 million donation to Harvard Business School. Business Experience: She spent eight years as the head of George W. Bushs Labor Department. Under Chaos leadership, Labors Wage and Hour Division essentially stopped fielding wage-theft complaints. Federal employees threw a good riddance party for her when she left. Outlook: When the Obama administration announced the transportation stimulus in 2009, Chao bemoaned the same old tax-and-spend crowd  that will turn our country into Europe. Chao hasnt said much about Trumps promised $1 trillion infrastructure investment, but expect her to steer plenty of it to the private sector, probably via tax credits to builders. Bonus: Oh, shes married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and during her confirmation hearing, she sounded like a true swamp drainee when she quipped, I will be working to lock in the majority leaders support tonight over dinner. (The man who introduced the couple once described Chao as a tiger wife.) Chao is also a commentator on Fox News and sat on the board of News Corp. Before entering public life, she worked at Bank of America and Citicorp; after leaving the Bush administration, she joined the board of Wells Fargo. Net Worth: $325 million, including $240 million in Exxon stock and a multimillion-dollar Texas horse ranch. Business Experience: As chief executive of ExxonMobil, Tillerson ran a company that essentially operated as a sovereign state serving the interests of its shareholders (in fact, to an autocratic country like Chad, a deal with Exxon could be more valuable than its relationship with the State Department). Under Tillerson, Exxon did business through a European subsidiary with countries like Iran, Sudan, and Syria, which were all under State Department sanctions for state-sponsored terrorism. Outlook: As secretary of State, Tillerson will certainly have Trumps ear when it comes to economic sanctions, which hes said to oppose almost universally (perhaps in part because lifting Russian sanctions would deliver a windfall to ExxonMobil shareholders). Bonus: Three years ago, Tillerson joined a suit to stop construction of a water tower that would help a nearby fracking project  the trucks and heavy traffic, the suit alleged, would disturb his ranch. He and his wife withdrew from the suit after the media got wind of the story: the most powerful oil executive in the world fighting a project similar to the ones ExxonMobil has throughout the globe. At his confirmation hearing, he claimed Exxon had not, to his knowledge, lobbied against Russian sanctions, then said the company had opposed the sanctions but only after theyd been imposed. He also did not rule out a national Muslim registry. Net Worth: $1.25 billion, with family wealth adding up to $3.85 billion more. Shes currently a member of three yacht clubs, three golf clubs, and one premier private business and social club. Business Experience: None to speak of, actually. But it was DeVos, with no background in education, who orchestrated Michigans school choice movement 20 years ago. DeVos has vehemently fought regulations on charter-school operators that other states have implemented, like a ban on for-profit schools and conflicts of interest, choosing instead to unrepentantly push a free-market ideology that, as she once said, can advance Gods kingdom. For 20 years, the lobby her family bankrolls has propped up the billion-dollar charter-school industry and insulated it from common-sense oversight, even as charter schools repeatedly failed to deliver on their promises to parents and children, reported the Detroit Free Press. Outlook: DeVos hasnt ruled out an attempt to privatize the entire Department of Education. Bonus: Her brother, Erik Prince, founded Blackwater, the private army made rich and infamous during the Iraq War. During her confirmation hearings  well, where do we begin? She did not seem to understand the difference between proficiency standards and growth standards for testing; claimed that student debt had ballooned 980 percent in the last eight years, a figure that is only 862 percentage points off; and suggested guns might be useful in schools to protect against grizzly-bear attacks."}, {"date": "2017/01/23", "title": "Potential Trump Science Adviser Says 90 Percent of U.S. Colleges Will Disappear", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/potential-trump-science-adviser-9-in-10-colleges-will-fail.html", "text": " Last week, Donald Trump met with Yales David Gelernter, a computer scientist who once called Barack Obama a third-rate tyrant, as he seeks to fill the position of White House science adviser.

As Gelernter writes in The Wall Street Journal Monday, Over 90 percent of U.S. colleges will be gone within the next generation, as the higher-education world inevitably flips over and sinks. In Gelernters view, the future of higher education will involve a focus on STEM subjects while throwing out the arts and humanities. Online courses will become commonplace, but not without evolving, and students will need a digital guides or mentors to carry them through online education. Degrees themselves will become a thing of the past, Gelernter writes as theyre gradually be replaced by certified transcripts. Rather than a university conferring the degree, a transcript  that is, coursework showing that a student has successfully learned a given set of material  will be vouched for by a trusted institution like a think tank, newspaper, museum, or research lab.

Monday, after weeks of publicly voiced skepticism, the Florida senator pledged to back Rex Tillerson as secretary of State. Rubios announcement  explained in a lengthy Facebook post  essentially guarantees the former Exxon CEOs confirmation, as Rubio was the last Republican holdout in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who were also both on the fence, said over the weekend that they, too, would support the presidents nominee. Rubio criticized Tillerson for some of his positions, but he justified jumping on the party bandwagon by saying that he must balance  concerns with his extensive experience and success in international commerce, and my belief that the president is entitled to significant deference when it comes to his choices for the cabinet, Rubio wrote. Given the uncertainty that exists both at home and abroad about the direction of our foreign policy, it would be against our national interests to have this confirmation unnecessarily delayed or embroiled in controversy. Heres the full post: McCain and Graham also gave similar explanations for backing Tillerson. Though we still have concerns about his past dealings with the Russian government and President Vladimir Putin, we believe that Mr. Tillerson can be an effective advocate for U.S. interests, the two senators said in a joint statement. The views that Mr. Tillerson has expressed, both privately and publicly during the confirmation process, give us confidence that he will be a champion for a strong and engaged role for America in the world. The Trump team appears to have lobbied hard to win over the skeptical GOPers. Rubio reportedly talked with Tillerson in a private, 90-minute meeting last week, which Vice-President Mike Pence and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus joined, says the Washington Post. The Democratic National Committee responded to Rubios agonized decision to support Tillerson for the job as top diplomat by reviving one of Trumps favorite campaign talking points, though they got the spelling wrong."}, {"date": "2017/01/23", "title": "Trumps First Monday: Ending TPP and Renegotiating NAFTA", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trumps-first-monday-ending-tpp-and-renegotiating-nafta.html", "text": " President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Great thing for the American worker, what we just did, Trump said as he showed the document to reporters cameras. During the campaign, Trump regularly railed against the TPP, which he called a disaster. The 12-country pact, which would have been one of President Obamas major second-term achievements, called for the unification of the U.S. and 11 Pacific Rim nations in the worlds largest free-trade agreement. Proponents, including Obama, argued it would have strengthened the economies of the partner nations while checking the growing economic strength of China. But it would also have resulted in too many American jobs leaving the country, Trump said. In June, Trump said the TPP is another disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country  just a continuing rape of our country. Its a harsh word, but its true. Trump, on Monday, will also reportedly begin the process of potentially ending NAFTA. He is planning to meet soon with Mexican president Enrique Pea Nieto and Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. We will be starting negotiations having to do with NAFTA, he said Sunday. The new White House website provides some insight into those negotiations and what Trump will do if they dont go how he hopes. If our partners refuse a renegotiation that gives American workers a fair deal, then the President will give notice of the United States intent to withdraw from NAFTA, it says. In addition to the executive order regarding the TPP, Trump took action to freeze hiring of non-military federal workers and to ban U.S. government funding to NGOs that promote abortion."}, {"date": "2017/01/23", "title": "Trumps Presidency Is the Twilight Zone Episode About a Terrifying 6-Year-Old", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-is-twilight-zone-episode-about-terrifying-6-year-old.html", "text": " If there was some lingering hope among Republican professionals that Donald Trump would somehow, as the old clich has it, grow into the office, his first 48 hours as president dispelled it immediately. The White House is already jittery with fright at the unpredictability of a childlike figure who has been handed terrifying powers, like the famous Twilight Zone episode about a 6-year-old-boy with magical abilities. The evidence for Trumps unfitness for office comes from Republicans themselves, who discuss the president in the most patronizing terms. The managerial catastrophe begins with the fact that Trump knows extremely little about public policy. Because he knows so little about government, Trump gives incoherent or contradictory statements that leave even his allies confused about his beliefs. Senior Congressional Republicans have privately told several people that Trump seems to have no clarity on where he stands on many issues, reported Maggie Haberman recently. Many of them simply dismiss his statements as empty puffery. After Trump said he would cut regulation by 75 percent, one Republican member of Congress told John Harwood, [T]hats Trump just making a large number. There is little prospect this will change, because Trump lacks the attention span to read anything of substance. Something as long as a book is out of the question. Even memos strain his mental capacity. Trump is committed to reading as little as possible. This is not an insult. As little as possible is Trumps own account of his reading habits. I like bullets or I like as little as possible. I dont need, you know, 200-page reports on something that can be handled on a page, he tells Axios. Trumps inability to read anything of length has unfortunately freed him up for hours of channel surfing. But his addiction to television reinforces other character weaknesses: his wild mood swings and irritability. One person who frequently talks to Trump said aides have to push back privately against his worst impulses in the White House, like the news conference idea, and have to control information that may infuriate him, reports Josh Dawsey. He gets bored and likes to watch TV, this person said, so it is important to minimize that. Trump reportedly instructed his press secretary to read a comically dishonest boast about the size of the crowds at his Inaugural address after being irritated by photos showing a much more sparse crowd than he had predicted. Read this account from the New York Times and try to keep in mind that this is not a troubled teen but the president of the United States: That day, Saturday, Trump visited the Central Intelligence Agency. He began his remarks on the appropriate theme of thanking the staff there and vaguely promising to work together in a shared mission. Eventually, he rambled through a discursive series of themes, boasting of his own intelligence (Im like a smart person, a claim he supported with his favorite evidence, an uncle who taught at MIT.) Eventually Trump came round to the issue that was vexing him that morning, the medias alleged lies about his allegedly enormous crowd: This, again, was not a political rally but a speech to CIA officers. He used the occasion to tell rambling fantasies about his crowds because he could not contain the massive wound to his ego. Oliver Wendell Holmes famously summed up Franklin Roosevelt as a second-class intellect but a first-class temperament. Trump has a third-class intellect and a third-class temperament. The frightening surreality of what has happened to the United States has only begun to sink in."}, {"date": "2017/01/23", "title": "Team Trump Is Launching a Frontal Assault on the EPA", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/team-trump-is-launching-a-frontal-assault-on-the-epa.html", "text": " Anyone laboring under the impression that the new Trump administration will be all bark and no bite when it comes to overturning long-established bipartisan policies should watch Team Trumps assault on the Environmental Protection Agency closely. Aside from appointing Scott Pruitt, who is mainly familiar with EPA as a hated adversary in court, to be in charge of that agency, plans for an initial regulatory wave and budgetary policies amount to a 180-degree turn in environmental enforcement, as reported today by Axios. They include the complete elimination of climate-change programs; a half-billion-dollars in funding cuts for EPA grants to state and local governments; an immediate halt to Clean Air Act regulations affecting new and existing power plants; an about-face on auto emissions standards; and a general defanging of EPAs crucial ability to overrule federal and state regulations that pose environmental dangers. Thats probably just the beginning, because these plans were formulated by Trumps EPA transition director, Myron Ebell, mostly famous as a climate-change skeptic, but more generally active as a policy wonk at a very prominent libertarian-ish think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute, financed mostly by a rogues gallery of fossil-fuel industries and right-wing foundations. Ebell was among the first of the transition team agency leaders to be announced, and had even been discussed as a possible EPA director. So its not surprising he is placing his stamp on initial environmental policies even as Pruitt makes his way through the confirmation process. And his reputation as an enemy of environmentalism in all its forms is long-standing. Back in 2001 the Clean Air Trust named Ebell its clean air villain of the month after leading a ferocious lobbying charge to persuade President Bush to reverse his campaign pledge to control electric utility emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas linked to global warming. He hasnt mellowed with age. Here was Ebells take on Pope Francis 2015 encyclical on climate change: It tells you everything you need to know about Ebells sense of humility that he considered himself qualified to second-guess Francis theological chops. It is very unlikely he will suffer from any inhibitions in promoting the evisceration of EPA and its policies."}, {"date": "2017/01/23", "title": "New York City Is Bracing for a Powerful Noreaster", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/new-york-city-is-bracing-for-a-powerful-noreaster.html", "text": " A noreaster is about to slam New York, dumping at least two inches of rain and blasting the region with wind gusts up to 60 miles per hour. Whats starting out as a drizzly, gray, and blustery Monday is going to turn into something a bit more treacherous by this afternoon, with hazardous conditions stretching overnight into Tuesday. Mild temperatures will likely keep the city snow-free, but the fierce winds  the close-to-hurricane-force gusts combined with sustained winds of 30 to 40 miles per hour  will push wind chills into the 20s and low 30s, so it will feel as if its below freezing later this afternoon. These winds have the potential to be destructive, downing trees and causing power outages. Rains, torrential at times, will start pouring late Monday and really ramp up just in time for whats sure to be a very, very messy evening commute. Rainfall totals approaching four inches are possible, says the National Weather Service, especially near the shoreline. A flood watch is in effect from 1 p.m. Monday until late tonight for the five boroughs, Long Island, and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut. The brutal combo of powerful winds and high tides also means a coastal flood advisory is in place from 3 p.m. to 9 p.m., including low-lying areas along New York Harbor and the East River. This powerful storm is churning up the Atlantic seaboard and will drench the region through Tuesday afternoon, finally clearing out at night and leaving the tri-state area with mild (for January) temperatures and partly sunny skies. But these next 24 hours are going to be brutal, especially along the coast. This noreaster is part of a deadly system that ravaged the south this weekend.

The restaurant, which bills itself as the opulent steakhouse that Midtown deserves, makes a point of saying on its website that it appeals to both men and women, and on a night in December, the place was packed with what looked like exaggerated caricatures of both genders. Women in high heels curled unseasonably bare arms around stout, red-faced men in suits, all of them looking as tight and shiny as unopened Christmas presents. Frank Sinatra was booming about New York over the sound system, and the scene had a festive, anticipatory quality, which one got the sense had as much to do with the results of the recent election as with the impending holidays. Its been great, everybodys kissing Anthonys ass now because of Trump, Nelson Braff, one of the restaurants owners, told a table of customers back in the mirrored dining room. He was talking about Anthony Scaramucci, one of his partners in the restaurant. A money manager and business-news talking head, Scaramucci has been a fixture in New York finance circles since 2010, when he stood up at a town-hall meeting and asked President Obama, When are we going to stop whacking at the Wall Street piata? With his Harvard Law School education and Long Island accent, the Mooch, as he is affectionately called, is known more for his charismatic personality and relentless self-promotion than the middling performance of his company, SkyBridge Capital, a fund of funds, which invests in other hedge funds for a fee. His unflagging need to charm every single person he comes into contact with has given him many fans, and his SALT Conference, an annual schmoozefest he hosts in Las Vegas, reliably attracts a Whos Who of Wall Street, entertainment, and politics, people who find themselves mingling confusedly under salamis and other dcor inspired by Scaramuccis Italian-American heritage. But though he is well liked, the Mooch, like the Fonz, has never been taken particularly seriously. Certainly, few took it seriously when he signed on to Donald Trumps economic-advisory council last May, since the Mooch, lately off the campaigns of Scott Walker and Jeb Bush, had recently called Trump a hack politician. But Scaramucci took to the campaigns talking points like a duck to water, seamlessly mixing the campaigns cherry-picked statistics with vignettes from his childhood in Port Washington and impressing the campaign with his ability to do things like somehow make a Department of Labor rule that requires financial advisers to work in the best interests of the people whose money they are investing sound like the primary cause for the decimation of the middle class. The Department of Labor under Secretary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren wants to put the financial-service advisers basically out of business, he told a crowd at an event in October, moving along to unrelated facts about lower economic growth and the plight of blue-collar workers as though it were all very closely connected. So the life that I had as a kid, with the Schwinn bicycles and the Sears Toughskins and the air conditioners going in and out of the windows, that is not happening, he finished. When, to everyones disbelief, Donald Trump actually won the presidency and became someone to take seriously, so did Scaramucci. Since the election, Moochs stock has been way up: Yahoo Finance named him its Wall Streeter of the Year, despite the fact that his flagship fund had been performing poorly over the past two years. He has been a constant presence at Trump Tower, squiring bigwigs to meetings with the president-in-waiting. When I found him mixing a margarita for himself in an empty bar downstairs at the Hunt and Fish Club, his face still waxen with makeup after a day on TV, he told me its about to go even higher. Scaramucci, Exploring Government Post, Weighs Sale of SkyBridge, he said triumphantly, reading a headline from Bloomberg off his iPhone. Then he launched into a sequence of stories about the first time he saw The Godfather (he was 8) and his uncle Orlandos Perry Como impression, before returning to the subject of his new position. So I said to Vice-President Pence, who was here tonight, he went on, I said, Ill do whatever the hell you guys want. I know you probably think thats, like, me being passive-aggressive, he said to me, but its not, its me being even-keeled. My best service to him is acting as a fair broker for the situation, because what happens in Washington is they will stab you right in the chest with a smile on their face. Its like the Game of Thrones and the Hunger Games screenwriters got together with the writers of House of Cards and they made a story. And the other thing I have learned about these people in Washington, Nelson, he said, turning to his partner, who had settled in at the bar, is they have no money. So what happens when they have no fucking money is they write about what seat they are in and what the title is. Fucking congressmen act like that. They are fucking jackasses. Do you know how many congressional liaisons we are going to have? I dont either, but I told Pence, it should be four times whatever Obama had. I dont know how many he had, but Im telling you that didnt work out. Im telling him if you want to decrease the government, you gotta increase it in certain ways. Pence was great, right, you met him, Nelson, he was great. He suddenly stopped and squinted at me. How old are you? he asked. You look good. No lines on your face. What are you, a Sagittarius? I told him Im a Leo. Scaramucci nodded approvingly. Fucking king of the jungle! he said, lifting his drink. It is not strictly true that there is no money in Congress. But theres going to be a lot more in Washington now. Despite Candidate Trumps jeremiads about hedge funds getting away with murder, during the transition the president-elect stacked his administration with a murderers row of financiers, mostly loyalists and donors who, like Scaramucci, saw in the improbable candidate the opportunity for the deal of a lifetime. Its a classic contrarian bet, said James Grant, the bow-tied conservative behind the classic contrarian-investing newsletter Grants Interest Rate Observer. Hillary was collecting all this money from all these people on Wall Street. What were your chances of getting into that? Comparatively, Trump looked like a low-risk, high-reward political entity. The early bulls on Donald Trump, they saw two things, Grant went on. One, there was something there, and it was something that not a lot of people were seeing. When I looked at Donald Trump, I saw the man I knew from the late 80s, somebody without a sense of proportion, a braggart, a really lousy CEO. But they saw it differently. They saw the value proposition. They saw the risk-reward ratio. For the amount of money that a heavy-hitting donor might spend for a couple of lunches with Hillary Clinton and 50 other people, went this reasoning, a Trump supporter could have a ringside seat. Sure, they might lose  they would probably lose. But for billionaires like Robert Mercer, the founder of secretive algorithm-only hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, and Steven Feinberg, the mustachioed gun-rights activist behind Cerberus Capital Management, and housing-market short-seller John Paulson and Gawker slayer Peter Thiel, the amount of money was trifling. A lot of them lose a lot more than that in a bad day at the market. It would at least be an interesting show. The downside is being associated with a losing candidate, said Grant. But they thought, Well, I was with Mitt Romney, so whats the diff? The upside is being one of a tiny band of visionaries, contrarians, bloody-minded Trumpites  whatever the moniker is going to be  who saw what others didnt see, and to have a voice, somewhat of an entre, to influence the policies of the greatest country on the face of the Earth. The risk-reward proposition must have been almost irresistible. Obviously, it wasnt irresistible for everyone. Despite its image as a lair of fat cats, Wall Street has a culture that has, in recent years, tilted Democratic, in part because the party shares with finance a faith in the technocratic future. But also because as banks and other financial institutions have gotten larger, they have also gotten more socially progressive, engineering outreach programs to minorities and women and the LGBTQ community. To be a big-deal person at a major Wall Street firm and publicly align oneself with a candidate who calls for the building of walls and the rounding up of immigrants, a notorious womanizer who slut-shames beauty-pageant contestants and once joked about dating his own daughter, would take what the genteel Grant called a certain kind of moral courage. Or, in the more common parlance of the industry: Balls. Which is why the Wall Street denizens Trump attracted  who are now being appointed to various positions of influence and power  are on the whole mostly outliers, established iconoclasts with enormous appetites for risk, a huge amount of fuck-everyone money, and the nihilistic confidence to not only stare into the abyss but to let off a wild, Roarkian cackle while doing so. A value person is someone who revels in adversity, pointed out Grant. Because adversity constitutes the backdrop for value. Wilbur Ross saw it. Trumps nominee to lead the Commerce Department, he had made billions investing in distressed companies and has an estimated $150 million collection of mostly Surrealist art because, as he once told a newspaper, he likes things that are a little bit strange, a little bit skewed or out of order. Seeing value in what others dismiss as garbage, liking something even though it hurts your brain a little, that was his thing. Then theres Carl Icahn, the legendary corporate raider said to be one model for Gordon Gekko, who loves nothing more than a deal  literally, according to Mark Stevens, who spent two years with him reporting King Icahn: The Biography of a Renegade Capitalist. He doesnt love anyone, Stevens told me, which is a weirdly specific charge to make about a person, made weirder by the fact that he wasnt the only one to say the exact same thing to me about Icahn. He doesnt love people, he went on. I have never heard him talk once about America or about capitalism. He only loves deals. Which sounds  familiar. Icahn and Ross go way back when it comes to investing in the undervalued entity that was Donald Trump: Both vulture investors found themselves circling him at the same time back in the 90s, after Trumps Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City missed a payment to bondholders. We could have foreclosed and he would have been gone, Ross told the New York Post last year. But Trump was apparently so winning, in his blustering, blond, inarticulate way, and was such a weirdly popular figure among the people of Atlantic City  Even then, they were cheering him, Icahn told the Post  they decided to make a deal with him instead, one that gave bondholders (including Icahn) 50 percent ownership of the casino but allowed Trump to remain the face of it. This is not to say Icahn necessarily respects Trump: Theres nobody that Carl likes to imitate more and make fun of more, in a gentle way, than Donald Trump, Stevens said. He used to tell me, in his inimitable way, I cant talk to him in his helicopter. I have to push all the big tits away just so I can see his face. But backing that man for president of the United States? Thats a deal that could really pay off for Icahn, and it seems it will, especially now that Trump has named the notoriously combative and allegedly heartless investor (and notorious anti-regulation agitator) his special adviser on regulatory reform, which means that he will have a hand in guiding the actions of the SEC and the EPA, entities that Icahn, who is worth in the neighborhood of $17 billion, has accused of strangling his companies profits with their unbelievable regulations. Theres going to be battles on every front, predicted Stevens, who had little doubt as to who would end up the victor. Do you know what a Rhodesian Ridgeback is? They like to jump on the backs of lions, and rip their throats out. Thats Carl. Almost universally they give in, he wins. To recap: Does Carl Icahn give a flying fuck about Grab Em by the Pussy? No, he does not. These guys dont care about the social stuff at all, a female acquaintance of Ross told me tiredly. They dont even think about it. Last month, I asked John Paulson, who helped throw a $50,000-a-head dinner for Trump at Le Cirque this past summer, about the then-president-elects recent tweeting. Unbalanced? he repeated. I dont think hes doing anything unbalanced, he said. I would say his goals are you know, economic goals, less government regulation and increased prosperity, he added smoothly before excusing himself, saying he needed to find his wife, who was clearly not there. So far, Trump as an investment is working out pretty good for Paulson, too. His company hasnt had a big score since 2008, when it made billions off buying mortgage-backed securities. Over the last several years, it has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars unsuccessfully lobbying for the Treasury to revert profits from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have been going to pay off the bailout, back to shareholders, of which Paulson & Co. is a big one. Now shares in the company have doubled on the expectations that Trump  who happens to be a Paulson & Co. client (there are lots of tentacles in the swamp)  will do just that. The motivations of Steven Mnuchin, the incoming secretary of the Treasury, are less transparent. More than one financier I spoke to referred to him as a cipher. Mnuchin started out on the straight and narrow at Goldman Sachs, where his father, Robert Mnuchin, was a legendary trader, but Stevens appetite for risk apparently exceeded the boundaries of the firm. After the company went public, he left to start his own hedge fund and, at the rock bottom of the 2008 financial crisis, put together a consortium to scoop up the failing California lender IndyMac Bancorp, which was rebranded as OneWest Bank and sold for $3.4 billion in 2015. A partnership producing movies with Ryan Kavanaugh, the charismatic head of Relativity Media, flamed out in accusations of fraud and eventual bankruptcy, but Mnuchin made it out okay, funneling $50 million from Relativity to OneWest on his way out the door and leaving town with a new wife  an actress 20 years younger. Still, he must have felt something was missing, because when Trump, with whom hed been involved in an investment deal years earlier, sent him a last-minute invite to his victory party after winning the New York primary, Mnuchin showed up and was convinced enough by what he saw to go all-in. He signed on, the very next day, to be Trumps national finance chairman, shocking his liberal Hollywood friends and also, it seems, his father, who donated $2,700 to Hillary Clinton. (I love my son and Im proud of him and I will leave it at that, Robert told me. Its his world, and Im not a part of it.) But the younger Mnuchin made his quite-mercenary goals clear to Businessweek last summer: Nobodys going to be like, Well, why did he do this? if I end up in the administration. Why not take a gamble when it could mean having your name printed on actual money? Scaramucci came onboard a month later, in May. In a lot of ways, he didnt fit the profile of the bloody-minded Trumpites. Hes a momentum guy, said Grant. He saw it was working and he hopped on. Though at the time he told Vanity Fair that Trump was not my first choice or my second choice, the Mooch warmed to his role, insisting then and now that Trump is secretly a measured and thoughtful individual whose disregard for large segments of the population he governs is merely an act aimed at serving those who elected him. He knows what his base is, he said back at the Hunt and Fish Club. His base is a guy who bought his pants for $7 at the shop. Hes got a pickup truck. He lifted the tires and made a hydraulic whip on the truck, hes got shotguns in the rack on the truck, and hes wearing plaid. And hes in the truck. And hes having a hard time making his bills. And hes upset about the global elites who are out there, and hes like, What are you guys doing? Right, the elites. Back in his office, gentlemanly Grant marveled at the campaigns ugliness, especially toward the end of the campaign, especially toward Alicia Machado. All that stuff he said. One horror to the next. But it didnt matter! If I had been a better analyst of this situation  well, Im not sure I could have stood it, because I really cant stand the guy. But you have to admit, it was a pretty good trade. Since the election, much of the rest of Wall Street has come around to Trump, thanks to the rising stock market and the ascension of so many of their own. What he is doing on the business side makes sense, said Marc Lasry, a longtime Hillary Clinton supporter who will not be taking a role in this administration. Wilbur will do a good job. Hes made a lot of money, now he wants to serve his country, do something different. Carl is a pure business guy, so hes going to recommend things that are good for him. Anthony is going to be there explaining things. Like others, Lasry had been heartened by the appointment of Gary Cohn, until recently the president at Goldman Sachs, to head the National Economic Council. A Democrat close to Trumps son-in-law, Jared Kushner, Cohn is regarded to be, at the very least, smart, sane, and rational. Garys not going to do anything to screw up his reputation, said a colleague from his old firm. Although there are aspects of said reputation that make him a good fit for this particular Island of Misfit Toys. A six-foot-three former commodities trader known for being physically and verbally intimidating (Cohns signature move was reportedly hiking a leg up on employees desk and addressing the person, as the Wall Street blog Dealbreaker memorably called it, on a Grundle-to-Face Basis), Cohn was the second-in-command to CEO Lloyd Blankfein, the Tonto to his Lone Ranger, as one former Goldman employee put it. Over the years, his frustration with his bosss refusal to cede him the top spot became well known. Its a pretty interesting transition for Gary, because now he can spin it a little bit differently in his own mind, said the former colleague. Now he can say its more of a call of duty thing than I didnt get the job I wanted. As news about the work of the Treasury landing team has not been particularly encouraging  one official there told me early on the department was asked if it was possible to abolish the Office of Management and Budget  it seems the fate of the world economy may now rest on Cohns grundle. Since the election, the share price of Goldman stock is up 20 percent; this plus the administrations appointment of at least six figures with the firm on their rsums (among them Scaramucci, who was in his own words capital-F fired in 1991, then rehired, and left again in 1996,* and Breitbart Svengali Steve Bannon, who did a stint in the late 80s) has led to inevitable allegations about Government Sachs, but although people at the firm talked up the companys rich history of public service  former Treasury secretaries from the Clinton and Bush administrations  they made it clear that this set of Goldman alums is not quite like the others. Look at the cast of characters, said the Goldman executive. Gary wanted the big job; he didnt get it. His relationship with Lloyd was pretty strained at the end. The guys who replaced him he doesnt get along with. Bannon is a nutcase. Scaramucci was laid off. Mnuchin, he doesnt have any love for the place; his brother didnt make partner, he was always in his fathers shadow. None of these people were superstars that someone pulled away. Every one of them was dysfunctional. The only person who seems guaranteed to benefit from the Donald Trump administration, everyone seemed to agree, is Donald Trump. The Trump kleptocracy could be incredible, said a hedge-fund manager, who, like many others, asked to remain anonymous because he feared retribution from a president who has already displayed a taste for it. He could turn out at some point to be the wealthiest man in the country from all of this. But I think that all of the people who surround him are going to be disappointed, because Trump is not loyal to anybody but himself. He pointed to Chris Christie and Mitt Romney, whose heads the president-elect might as well have spiked at the entrance to Trump Tower. I dont think you get back with him what you think you are getting. For now, at least, the people on the inside seem like they are having a great time. Back at the Hunt and Fish Club, Scaramucci drained his margarita. Dont say I was drinking, he said. A few weeks later, once he is officially appointed to be the Trump administrations director of the Office of Public Liaison and Intergovernmental Affairs, defending Donald Trump would be his full-time job. And just before the inauguration, hed be the lone representative from Trump Tower at the World Economic Forum in Davos (where hed be one of the biggest salamis in a crowd of world leaders and billionaires and would announce the sale of SkyBridge Capital to a Chinese consortium, citing conflicts-of-interest standards). What do you really want to do? he asked me on his way out the door. You wanna work in the Trump Organization? Ill bring you up there! Come up to the tower! He dodged a woman in a fur coat, a dead ringer for Zsa Zsa Gabor, on his way up the stairs. It will be fucking great! Behind him, Nelson Braff stood up from the bar, surveying the room. This place would do well in Washington, he said. *This article appears in the January 23, 2017, issue of New York Magazine. *This article has been updated to correct the year Anthony Scaramucci was laid off from Goldman Sachs."}, {"date": "2017/01/23", "title": "Watchdog Group to Sue Trump Over Foreign Business Profits", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/watchdog-group-to-sue-trump-over-foreign-business-profits.html", "text": " Questions about how to interpret the Emoluments Clause, an obscure provision in the Constitution, surged after Donald Trump was elected president. On Monday, a watchdog group plans to file a lawsuit against Trump in Manhattan federal court alleging that hes violating the clause, so we may finally find out if its unconstitutional for the presidents businesses to accept payments from foreign governments. The Emoluments Clause states that no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under [the United States], shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington argues that this applies to rent, room rentals, and other fees at Trump properties. According to the New York Times, the suit will not seek monetary damages, but will ask the court to order Trump to stop taking such payments from foreign governments. Politico reports that the suit will focus on Trump Tower leases held by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, a state-run bank, and the Abu Dhabi Tourism and Culture Authority, which is part of the United Arab Emirates government. At his press conference earlier this month, Sheri Dillon, Trumps lawyer, argued that the Emoluments Clause does not apply if the foreign entity is paying the fair-market value, like the standard hotel-room fee. No one would have thought when the Constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an emolument, Dillon said. Eric Trump, who will run his fathers business with his brother during Donald Trumps presidency, told the Times that the Trump Organization has gone beyond whats required by law by promising to donate profits collected from foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury. This is purely harassment for political gain, and, frankly, I find it very, very sad, he said of the lawsuit. A copy of the legal complaint provided to the Washington Post counters that the clause is no relic of a bygone era, but rather an expression of insight into the nature of the human condition and the preconditions of self-governance. And applied to Donald J. Trumps diverse dealings, the text and purpose of the Foreign Emoluments Clause speak as one: this cannot be allowed. The group filing the suit includes Harvard constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe, Obama administration ethics lawyer Norman Eisen, George W. Bush administration ethics counsel Richard Painter, and Fordham University law professor Zephyr Teachout, among others. One question that could derail the case before it gets started is whether the ethics watchdog has standing to sue. The plaintiffs plan to argue that Trump has caused them specific harm because his vast business conflicts are a distraction from their primary mission as an ethics organization. CREWs whole purpose is about combating corruption in the federal government, Painter told the Post. So up until this point, the two major causes of corruption in the government were the revolving door in Washington and campaign finance. The vast majority of resources were spent on that. It was a two-front war, and now this opens up a third front. Even if the suit isnt successful, it could shed more light on the presidents business dealings. Eisen said they hope the suit will allow them to obtain a copy of Trumps tax returns, which could reveal which countries he does business with, and the money he may owe them  with no leaking required."}, {"date": "2017/01/23", "title": "U.S. Investigated National Security Adviser Michael Flynns Russia Ties", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/u-s-probed-national-security-adviser-flynns-russia-ties.html", "text": " Just hours after retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn was sworn in as Donald Trumps national security adviser on Sunday, The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. counterintelligence agents have investigated Flynns communication with Russian officials. McClatchy reported last week that the FBI, CIA, NSA, the Justice Department, the Treasury Department, and the office of the director of National Intelligence have been collaborating for months on an investigation into Russias alleged attempts influence the U.S. election. The probe looked at intercepted communications and financial transactions from several former Trump campaign aides, including Paul Manafort, Carter Page, and Roger Stone, according to the New York Times. Flynn is the first person working in the Trump White House to be linked to the probe. The Journal notes that its unclear if the investigation into Flynn produced any incriminating evidence, when it began, or if its continuing. A key point is said to be phone calls Flynn placed to Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the U.S., on December 29, the same day President Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats and imposed other sanctions in retaliation for Russias election hacking. As the Washington Posts David Ignatius reported, the calls could constitute a violation of the Logan Act of 1799, which bars U.S. citizens from attempting to influence a foreign government involved in disputes with the U.S. (though the law is never enforced). White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said earlier this month that Flynn was speaking with Kislyak because they were trying to arrange a conversation between Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin. On Sunday night, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, We have absolutely no knowledge of any investigation or even a basis for such an investigation."}, {"date": "2017/01/23", "title": "Becoming an American in the Age of Trump", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/andrew-sullivan-becoming-american-in-age-of-trump.html", "text": " By the time the court opened, there were around two dozen of us in line, nervously fiddling with our official papers. I was recovering from a brief but brutal stomach flu, which meant I hadnt eaten in two days and had split open my lip in a mad, half-asleep rush to the bathroom two nights before. Ashen-white, I looked like Id just been punched in the face. They gave us all a number, handed us a packet, and instructed us not to take photographs after the judge walked in. A man in a shiny suit proceeded to entertain us intermittently for half an hour with some almost-funny jokes. And then, at long last, the judge walked in, we all stood up, and it began. Judge Mehta told us this was his favorite part of the job, and that he had immigrated to the U.S. from India as a child. A few weeks before, my naturalization interview had been with a man with an Arabic last name  and a Redskins helmet on his cabinet. Standing around me now, my fellow newbie Americans came from all over the world: Iran, Honduras, Ethiopia, and Canada, among other countries. Only two of us, as I recall, were white. I had waited 32 years for this moment. My own immigration journey had been long and gradual and winding  and this day, I hoped, would be a day to savor, an emotional upswelling, a final untying of so many knots of feelings that had crowded my psyche since Id first arrived here. But it was also December 1, 2016. A few weeks before, an election had taken place that had capped more than a year of gnawing, deepening anxiety in my gut. To become a citizen now was, for me, a final act of faith; but it was also like stepping into an elevator expecting to go up and then suddenly sinking. There was joy here, shot through with nausea. My number was called, and I found myself walking shakily up to the bench to receive my Certificate of Naturalization. It came with a little flag, which I waved at my husband and friends as I walked back to my seat. Then came the oath. Suddenly, this modern, multicultural scene reverted right back to the nations founding. I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen  And then the other peculiar oath, which Id always heard but never uttered, let alone memorized. I placed my right hand on my left lapel and recited from a card: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. There was a reception  with a promise of tequila!  but I had to get home to bed. After a little soup, I curled up under the covers and passed out. I remember the strange moment when my infatuation with America began. Having just turned 21 years old, I was grappling with the first weeks of graduate school in a new country, and on the subway in Boston. Simply a chaotic afternoon ride, crammed into a tram car, hurtling through a labyrinth of confusing stations. Around me was a world far away from the spires of Oxford University, from which Id graduated a few months before. A sea of different-colored faces surrounded me amid what seemed near-tropical heat and humidity: a squalling baby, giggling schoolgirls, and a seated construction worker with concrete-dusted boots, his red, grizzled Irish face staring out the window into the brick blackness. I was on my way to buy a rug for my new dorm room and getting more than a little lost. But the lostness, it came to me, now had something of a thrill to it. No one here knew me or anything about me. Nothing had followed me from my small-town home or my provincial English high school or my grooming for the British elite at Oxford. Thrown into a crowd of old and young, black and Asian and Latin and Irish and Italian, I found myself in a new world entirely, an ocean of polyglot anonymity, with a chance to leave everything behind. My heart swelled. More, please. Take me away. People talk about the American Dream all the time, usually as a story of increased prosperity generation after generation. But the original dream  the dream of the first generation  is often simply of an escape from the past into a country addicted to the future. Most nations, especially the England I knew, are defined by history, saturated in its remnants, places where one is never far from the echoes of those who have come before. Nostalgia is almost a national characteristic, the task of regaining previous greatness a Sisyphean ordeal. In Britain, growing up, we were constantly reminded that the supreme national moment was in the past  the finest hour of 1940. But here, in this new place, I felt none of that. Here, there was no going back. I saw everywhere a restlessness for what the future could bring, a jumble of crowded, jostling aspirants for a dream directed aggressively forward. And it was infectious. My reaction shocked me. Growing up, Id never been entranced by America and had long been a romantic about Britain. I was a young Tory, a conservative dedicated to the upholding of tradition and orthodoxy. I harbored every single prejudice a European could have about the place: that it was vulgar and brash, uncouth and anti-intellectual, a country where you were always at risk of being randomly shot and where people died on the street because they had no access to health care. My previous idea of escape was from my home to college, a medieval and Georgian version of Hogwarts, with cloisters and a sublime tower from the top of which, each May Day, the summer would be sung in as the entire town gathered at dawn below, as had happened for centuries. I applied for a place at an American graduate school simply because it was one of those things the most ambitious British students used to beef up their rsums. Like the Rhodes Scholarship in reverse, it was a step up the careerist ladder in the British Establishment. It was only for two years. What did I have to lose? I never expected to fall in love with the place, to find its newness so intoxicating. It didnt hurt that I arrived after the Los Angeles Olympics and before Ronald Reagans Morning in America  a moment of peak, and slightly frenetic, optimism, a heady time of economic growth when the country was about to give its incumbent president a 49-state landslide in his reelection. Not that it was easy to adjust at first. Among my first surprises, for example, was everyones persistent solicitude about my mood. It took a while before I realized that How are you doing? didnt actually demand any answer but Great! How about you? For the first few months, by the time Id begun to unpack my particular mixture of emotions that day, Id find that my new acquaintance had already walked past me halfway down the street. I marveled, for that matter, at a habitual American response to a simple request: Sure! There really was no equivalent in England. An Okay or an All right or Why would you want to do that? was the best youd usually pry out of some miserable punter. But in this new world, the tempo had quickened and the future filled with a sudden, if intermittently delusional, conviction that whatever I was asking was going to be welcomed  even embraced. What strange new superficial joy was this? And then the real liberation: No one asked the loaded questions that had bedeviled me at college in England. What high school are you from? What does your father do? All of these were not-so-subtle inquiries into your past, which is to say, into class. Most of the time, of course, my privileged, privately educated peers didnt even have to ask about my origins because my accent gave me away with the pinpoint accuracy of a socioeconomic GPS. Yet, in America, none of that mattered at all! Where you had come from was nowhere near as interesting as where you were going. The only accent I had was English  and no one had the slightest clue if it was from the East End or minor royalty. In time, the accent became an irritating distraction, and I found myself lengthening the vowels ever so slowly, softening the consonants, bringing words out of the back of my mouth  if only to be understood more easily. Then I realized I was half-consciously, even deliberately, unwinding the way I spoke. I didnt want to become that fixture of the culture: the Brit in America. I wanted to be fully part of an American world. This is probably partially why I came to find identity politics so hard to grasp  that concern with what makes Americans different from each other, what separates them, what oppresses or privileges them because of their fixed membership in a group. I didnt want to separate; I wanted to join. Identity politics is now the overpowering obsession of much of American higher education and the dominant ideology of the American left. But it reminded me of the way Europeans defined themselves by what they were rather than what they could become. When you come here from elsewhere, you are not, of course, immune to all the isms oppression can impose. You encounter prejudice, as you do in all human society. But your difficulties can be powerfully eclipsed, especially in the first generation, by the psychic thrill of the freshness of a new nation, especially one as diverse as America. I wanted no group identity. I wanted  and I was utterly unconflicted and unembarrassed about this  assimilation. This was not a rejection of my homeland, which I loved and still do, with passion. But there was an exhilaration in knowing that, in this unforgivingly individualistic culture, Id have to earn my unique Americanness, to blend in as best I could, to lose my old self in search of a new one. My mother, worried that I would be overwhelmed, wrote me a long letter encouraging me not to give up. It was still a time when real distance separated the two continents, when telephone calls were impossibly expensive luxuries and when the only contact you had with the old country was perusing the days-old newspapers that piled up in a few boutique kiosks. So I wrote my reply in ink, in cursive, as I was only beginning to master this new thing called a word processor. I know its an odd thing to say, I recall writing back. And I know its only been a few weeks. But I really feel as if I have finally found my home. I didnt know it at the time, but I was part of a massive new wave of immigrants who would transform the country  and eventually its politics  over the next few decades. A little over 14 million immigrants lived in the U.S. in 1980; by 2014, that number had grown to more than 42 million. There is simply no precedent in history for the sheer number of human beings who have recently come, legally and illegally, into America. As a percentage of the entire population, immigrants are now very close to the peak of 14.8 percent set in 1890. At the same time, the composition of the wave has shifted profoundly. The 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act abolished the system of national-origin quotas in force since the 1920s and opened the country up to immigrants from many more countries around the world. The result was a stunning demographic and cultural shift. In 1960, 84 percent of immigrants came from Europe or Canada; by 2014, that had declined to 13.6 percent. In 1960, 6 percent came from Mexico; by 2014, that had risen to 27.7 percent, along with 23.9 percent from other Latin American countries. More than a quarter of new immigrants also came from South and East Asia. I was entering an America on the verge of a demographic revolution, as a white-majority country began its transition to becoming a white-minority one. Anyone surprised that immigration has become one of the defining political questions of our time should reflect on the numbers and the cultural change. Its hard to imagine an instance when any other country in human history accepted and then integrated such a massive group of new immigrants from such a spectacular array of cultures in such a short span of time. To see todays reaction to this as purely a function of crude nativism and foul racism is to miss the much more obvious fact: how well the country has managed to absorb these new immigrants, especially during a period when the easy growth of the postwar years receded to the levels of the past few decades. No other country does this so consistently. No other country could. My sudden sense of coming home was partly because my own temperament  independent, pushy, outspoken  seemed no longer an impediment, as it sometimes had in Britain, but an asset. But this sense was also deepened by the extraordinary embrace most Americans extended to me. I had, of course, a big advantage in this respect. I was white and English and embedded in one of the finest and most tolerant universities on the planet. But what I never witnessed there or throughout America over the coming decades was what any immigrant to, say, a European country or Japan or China would at some point encounter  a lingering nativist suspicion, a sense among those I met that I was somehow interloping, an alien, a threat. I recognize not every immigrant here feels as welcomed, but I suspect they would be greeted with more hostility nearly anywhere else. In a country created by immigrants, my foreignness didnt define me; it formed an introduction. An immigrant, in some way, was more American than the native-born, our experience a replica of how this country came to be in the first place. I duly progressed from visa to visa  and applied for and, to my surprise, won an internship and then a junior editorial position at The New Republic, the one magazine in America that, in its humor and quirkiness, reminded me of English ones. And so before too long I was immersed in the kind of institution no one had ever prepared me for: overwhelmingly Jewish, staggeringly smart, immensely funny and yet deadly serious. The magazine was not without its petty rivalries and feuds (indeed, it was famous for them), but it also shone with the American Enlightenment conviction that ideas matter, that robust, even occasionally bitter debate was not about winning the audience with a British quip or witty put-down but a way to flush out something Americans still believed in: the truth. The First Amendment, I came to realize, was first for a reason. And in the fight over the American idea, my colleagues saw the future of humankind. I was offered the job of editor when I was 28. The trust in me  the sheer American recklessness of it  beggared belief. Like many love affairs, my own with America began with the usual inclination to see only what I wanted to see and to ignore the gigantic contradictions that have always defined it. I was, for example, struck that when I first entered the U.S. as a student, I was asked whether I was either a communist or a homosexual. The former was an easy call; the latter somewhat more complicated. I entered America a virgin and would remain so for some time. I certainly didnt identify myself as gay, even as my welling needs were pushing me inexorably in that direction. But what a question for a government to ask! I thought as I swiftly moved on. I later learned that the ban on aliens afflicted with  sexual deviation had been formally put in place by that same 1965 immigration act, and that it had been in force under different language since 1917. It would remain in the law until 1990, when Representative Barney Frank successfully fought to remove it. But if America theoretically barred sexually deviant immigrants, it was in practice a place, at least in a few enclaves, of extraordinary liberation for gay people, unlike almost anywhere else on the planet. Many gay men from small towns venture into cities to find a new environment and the courage to be themselves. I came from a small town in a small country to a continent 4,000 miles away. And as I began to date and fall in love and explore my own body for the first time as something more than a mere vessel for my brain, America also began to become associated in my psyche and my soul with a deeper freedom. So many fears and embedded stereotypes began to fall away, and the sense emerged, at long last, of a future that wasnt simply destined for a lonely and empty old age or consigned to an isolated marginalization of shame and fear. This too became my America, vivid and unafraid and pioneering and gay. It provoked an adrenaline-fueled faith that allowed me to write, in 1989, an article that imagined a future in which gay couples could get married, just as straight people did. As I look back, it was a shockingly nave argument, one that was blind to the deeply homophobic attitudes that had defined so much of the country. It was also written as the plague of AIDS was darkening every prospect for gay advancement. I wonder now whether Id ever have been so bold as to make such a case if I hadnt been a new immigrant, besotted with my own new beginning; if Id grown up in an America that had so often bullied and terrified gay men and boys. The boldness rested on a new immigrants near-blind faith that an argument could be heard in its own right and for its own sake, as if prejudice could somehow be magically spirited away by reason alone. This proud Tory had suddenly found the stirrings of Jefferson within. And what I came to learn about the American democracy Jefferson had helped craft was a revelation. Britain was pretty close to an elected dictatorship, where prime ministers (Thatcher among them) could easily enforce their will through solid parliamentary majorities, with little expectation of pushback. In America, by contrast, the dispersal of power was almost pathological  at least from a European point of view. Budgets took forever to be passed (and sometimes werent); the Supreme Court routinely checked the other branches and its nominees might be rejected in return  sometimes, as with the nomination of Robert Bork, brutally so; the mainstream press was far more high-minded and tedious but just as adversarial as in Britain; the states retained huge authority  and the smaller, rural ones were given absurdly disproportionate power in the Senate and Electoral College. Filibusters stymied simple legislative functions; excruciating compromises  so much rarer in Britain  were hashed out in public and private; and a majority of the popular vote, bizarrely, did not necessarily win you the presidency, thanks to the elaborate compromise of the Electoral College. At the same time, the system that seemed designed to get nothing done was constantly jolted by radical elements, such as the mobilization of the religious right or the supercharged activism of ACT-UP in the 1980s and 90s. Politically conservative by design, America was at the same time culturally rebellious and remarkably open to drastic change. And I began to see how these two things interacted, how the constantly shifting balance kept the ship on a relatively even keel: The stability and conservatism of its Constitution allowed cultural experimentation to flourish without the threat of sudden destabilization. American government could even try out new ideas in the states before elevating them to the federal level  something close to impossible in England. This country was deeply conservative and yet equally radical. And I found myself increasingly entranced by the synthesis. The politics were chaotic to a European, but, after a while, you learned to see the fractured wisdom. The system was built on contempt for the idea that a supreme leader alone could fix everything, on a suspicion of concentrated power, and on a deference to nothing that smacked of the royal prerogatives that America had been founded to resist. One simple thing stands out in my mind: On the Mall, that sacred place of American iconography, there were no signs telling you not to walk on the grass; no fences or orderly lines as in the royal parks of London; no perfect lawn. In fact, Americans walked casually all over the place, played Frisbee where Europeans would fear to tread, set down picnics, rubbed the grass raw with their games, and generally acted as if it were their front yard. I saw people clamber up onto the lap of Lincoln in the Memorial! And slowly it dawned on me that this was indeed what democracy meant: A monument belonged, quite simply, to the people. And no one else. My first summer, a British friend of mine joined me for an epic journey across the country. We kicked off in Miami and for several weeks drove all the way through the Deep South to Southern California and then up the coast to Seattle, via San Francisco, then back through Glacier National Park and the Dakotas to Chicago and, ultimately, Boston. St. Elmos Fire was on the radio, along with Wham!s Freedom, and both songs still immediately evoke the electronic energy of that era in pop and the mind-blowing scale of the place as we traveled through it. This was not like a European country. It was a world. And what you realized by physically traversing from the Atlantic to the Pacific and back was that the freedom of America was intensely related to its sheer size; that if you failed in one part you could simply move somewhere else. Escape was ever available, not only to America from the Old World but from one America to another. Parts of my English family had lived and died in the same small village for centuries, and everyone in my immediate family still lives within an hour of where I grew up. But this country, if you could really call it that, had abolished that sense of settlement. It was a great, unfolding drama of unsettlement. Every room had an emergency exit. There was, you couldnt help but notice, a flip side to this. To a Brit, so many places had an unfinished, impermanent feel, stripped of the coherence and distinct charm of European settlements that had had centuries to mature and marinate and cohere. The strip malls, the fast-food joints, the Motel 6s we often stayed in gave off the soul-sedating sameness of a capitalist culture that never rested and mended but forged on and simply built again. So much of this throwaway landscape seemed not to care for us  or anyone  at all. Over the years, I came to accept and appreciate much of its unbounded strangeness. The obsession with gun ownership, for example, especially in southern and rural America. I could see the point of being armed in this vast and once-lawless place. I could grasp the inheritance of a revolutionary suspicion of a governments monopoly on violence. I valued the tradition behind it. But the frenzied obsession with it, the way in which it defined many peoples worldview, despite a constitutional amendment the Supreme Court only strengthened in the years I lived here, confused me. It was a freedom Americans cherished as constitutive of their culture even as they somehow also believed, against all evidence, that it was always on the brink of being taken away. You could no more take the love of guns out of America, I eventually came to understand, than you could excise the passion for gardening among the English. As the years passed, other paradoxes emerged. Take marijuana. It seemed a rite of passage for so many American college students, and in popular culture it was always the occasion for giggling, for an easy gag about the munchies or a Cheech & Chong reference. I smelled it all over the country, from the South to the Northwest. And yet this humorous, harmless pastime for some young whites remained a target of extraordinary police zeal when it came to African-Americans, with arrests and incarceration soaring as my time in America passed by. It was part of the War on Drugs that increased the number of human beings in jails and prisons tenfold. In some instances  such as the massive disparity between sentences for cocaine and crack  it seemed literally designed to target black America. The land of the free, I began to understand, was also the world leader in imprisonment, just as the first country to embed inalienable human freedom in its Constitution was also founded on the brutal enslavement of an entire race. America was, I realized, an idea, but it was also, in many ways, a contradiction that was somehow compelled to try to resolve itself again and again. This was a country of profound newness, and yet it has repeatedly failed to replace the dollar bill with a coin. It was a place of staggering wealth, yet it contained scenes of public destitution and poverty and decrepitude Id never seen in Europe. It pioneered space travel, but its trains seemed relics of the early-20th century. It was a country made possible by the automobile, yet it could barely tax gas. In the cradle of modernity, it was still common to hear the phrases Yes, sir! or Yes, maam!  which sound, to a modern Brit, like something from the 19th century. It had a Congress, but no one seemed actually to debate there. It had a capital city, but its inhabitants had no voting power in Congress. Its founding, murderous racism  encoded in its very DNA  still segregated and marginalized so many, but it had also paradoxically created some of the most sublime moral movements in human history. Prejudices, I found, went both ways. There were dinner parties in Manhattan where I heard people who would never consider themselves bigots casually dismiss vast, generalized swaths of humanity living between the coasts. And the baldly racist sentiments I occasionally encountered over the years also brought me up short. Its hard to forget the time I heard a stranger mutter the phrase worthless niggers in front of me. Yet so many white Southerners I met were among the warmest and most generous people Id ever encountered, and the Evangelicals I often did rhetorical battle with on gay issues almost always treated me with respect and even affection  at the same time as some gay activists viewed me with increasingly personal contempt. This was a country of individualism, but also of tribes. Its religious freedom, diversity, and energy also enthralled. Id grown up as an English Catholic, a member of a minority whose defeat and persecution for centuries had helped define the national identity as Protestant. The stigma still endured  even as modernity had blanketed so much English faith with a soft, secular suffocation. In America, by contrast, being Catholic, especially in Boston, needed no excuse, and I breathed freely. My faith finally seemed fully welcome here. And it remained a kind of universal home for me. In time, I saw the extraordinary paradox that the largely secular Constitution, a product of the Enlightenment, had enshrined religious freedom; that a group of Founders who barely believed in God started a country of constant religious revival and fervor. There was no established church here to support social order, and yet I discovered a more vibrant, primary-colored religious landscape than any I had seen before. Behind all of these contradictions was the convulsive consequence of a nation constantly remaking itself, immigrant by immigrant, representing so many different colors and nationalities, religions, and cultures. How else to account for why a vast country, surrounded by the two greatest oceans on the planet, with no neighboring enemies, would be seized from time to time with the kind of crippling paranoia one would expect from a small European nation? Americas history featured not only massive surges of immigration but ugly backlashes of nativist panic. In the 1920s, after the last immigration boom, new laws were enacted specifically to restrict Jews and newcomers from Southern Europe, along with existing bans on immigration from Asia. In the 1950s, the infamous Operation Wetback deported more than a million illegal Mexican immigrants. The home of the brave could also be a cauldron of crippling fear. Sure enough, as I found my own sense of community in the burgeoning gay enclaves in the major metropolitan cities, the arrival of AIDS seemed to tap into this deep strain of xenophobic and homophobic panic. I began to get a deeper sense of what lay beneath the liberal-democratic veneer: visceral racial and sexual terror, spasms of moral puritanism in the face of changing mores, outbursts of violence and presidential assassinations of a kind much, much rarer in the Old World, and a deepening, darkening divide between that part of America at ease with multicultural modernity and the part that felt increasingly besieged and even mocked by it. As my first work visa was due to expire, my lawyer recommended an indefinitely renewable O visa  for which I qualified  as long as I retained, year by year, a record of outstanding or extraordinary achievement in my line of work. That pressure to perform or lose status was an incentive to keep working hard and also a classic immigrant tale. I began to understand in my bones just how strained the lives of so many immigrants can be and how invisible that strain can be to everyone else. As an immigrant with no permanent status, you are often cherished by employers or communities, you live in a state of apparent normality, you keep your head down, and yet you also know that one mistake on a complicated form can mean a sudden, unexpected detour abroad or, in the worst cases, the end of everything. I had so many more resources than most  the best lawyers, a prominent job, a great education. But that only opened my eyes more widely to the experience that others confront as they try to navigate an impenetrable thicket of rules and laws and forms. I had publicly declared my HIV status, which caused considerable complications. If Americans welcomed me warmly, their government was often a contrast. Anyone who thinks its easy to become a legal immigrant in America has never tried to become one. This is a reason undocumented immigrants are less likely to be criminals: The last thing on earth they want is contact with the law. Legal or illegal, you become aware that you have nothing like the rights of a citizen, no solid legal defenses against a random bureaucratic judgment (or a simple lapse in judgment). And so you live from day to day, week to week, year to year, proving yourself, working harder than those in more secure situations, but with a particular psychological twist: The longer you stay, the deeper your roots  the more intense the fear of one day losing it all. If you came here to escape, the thought of being sent back home can be psychologically traumatizing. And as the years passed, and the 1996 immigration act stripped immigrants of more rights, and as 9/11 made entrance and exit from the United States an even more fraught experience for everyone, that trauma increased. I found myself responding by doubling down on the promise of America. I left The New Republic and became a nearly full-time advocate for marriage equality. In 1995, I wrote a book that made the best case I could, and I joined forces with Evan Wolfson to try to convince a highly skeptical gay Establishment that this was the cause of our time. I testified before Congress against the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996  only to lose badly, because in a democracy the majority rules and we didnt yet have popular opinion on our side. But we also won, because a liberal democracy gives a minority the chance to make its case, and for the first time in history, abetted by an unwitting Republican Congress, what had until then been regarded as a utopian joke now had some shade of mainstream legitimacy. We had a foot in the door, and I could feel it opening. And yet I could also feel, subtly at first and then unmistakably, the door closing on the bright, open America I fell for three decades earlier. When I had arrived, a thriving American conservatism embraced not only free markets and a free society but also, as Reagan had once called for, open borders and amnesty for illegal immigrants  a rebuke to the barbed wire and restricted travel of the communist East. It was an era when conservatives believed in tearing down walls rather than building them. To me, America truly represented the free-market, free-trade, international-interventionist, and small-government ideology I had adopted in my youth. My convictions had deepened as the American economy rebounded and, more remarkably, the Soviet Union imploded. To witness in the 1990s the spread of this market conservatism to the entire globe  to see Eastern Europe, Russia, China, and India become embedded in a global capitalist economy, and to see it co-opted by the left in the era of Clinton and Blair  was so mesmerizing I didnt recognize how this success was actually laying the groundwork for its failure. Many American conservatives didnt see this: They embraced the virtues of this global, hypercapitalist churning without recognizing its social and cultural costs, especially its brutal impact on working-class jobs and on the very stability of the American middle class. Conservatives also came to assume that intervening abroad was almost always a triumph. What greater victory than Reagans in the Cold War? The first Bushs liberation of Kuwait and Clintons successful Balkan intervention only confirmed the consensus. And so neoconservative arguments began to calcify into a hubristic ideology as rigid as the lefts had once been  and as blind to its own consequences. Hence the rush to war in Afghanistan and Iraq (which I supported), places where the limits of ideology became impossible to ignore. Even worse, the moral stature of the U.S. was stained by government-sanctioned torture of prisoners  a practice Reagan had viewed as the key marker of the evil he sought to defeat. This was a very different America from the one I had first entered. Perhaps something changed deep in its soul on that sunny day in September 2001 when outsiders, fueled with religious zeal, violated this once-safe harbor from the darkness of the Old World. As an immigrant, my sense of this place as an eternal escape from danger disappeared that day. And in the convulsions that followed, this country first united and then split apart. The fear that had always haunted it gained new potency. The country responded in time with the astonishing emergence of Barack Obama, a reminder that America can surprise as much by its hope as by its bouts of ugliness. The tragedy is that Obamas promise of a pragmatic, centrist liberalism to get past the deep divide in America was eviscerated by a Republican partisanship that by the end of his two terms had become a pernicious pathology tinged by racism. He was a graceful moderate president deemed an unreconstructed radical, managing the fallout of conservatisms devastating success but ultimately foiled in his hope of transformation beyond it. But the same could have been said of the Republican Party. Still addicted to the Reaganite template, it could not grapple with the catastrophe of Iraq or the causes of the Great Recession, it still promised tax cuts and deregulation as panaceas, and it had no real response to the heartlands heartache apart from exploiting it with cultural warfare or cable-news propaganda. Both parties were unwittingly making possible the emergence of a dangerous populism, one that would turn Americas embrace of immigrants into something much darker and that would come, almost out of the blue, to threaten the existence of liberal democracy itself. There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America, Bill Clinton once said. Its a good line, but when he first said it, I remember feeling that it was too glib, too pat, for the real world. In the years since, Ive learned its complicated truth. As the country palpably darkened in the new millennium, it also, in many places, flickered with promise. An elite that had precipitated an economic collapse was able, after glimpsing the abyss, to draw slowly back from it. Unemployment dropped by more than half from its previous peak, manufacturing rebounded, the stock market doubled, millions gained affordable health insurance and coverage for the first time, and marijuana became fully legal in several states. Countless white Americans helped elect and then reelect an African-American president. More amazingly, the cause I had committed to, marriage equality, slowly won over a majority of Americans. State by state, debate by debate, vote by vote, a once-quixotic idea became reality. And so, in 2007, I was able to marry the man I had fallen in love with, on the beach in Provincetown, Massachusetts. A year later, President Bush signed legislation that removed the ban on HIV-positive immigrants. In 2013, my marriage was recognized by the federal government. In 2015, the freedom to marry was guaranteed in all 50 states. A mature patriotism is different from a blind infatuation. I now loved this country not despite but because of its flaws, and I saw how inextricable they were from its virtues. I applied for a green card in 2010, and I remember vividly the day the approval came through. I happened to be in Los Angeles, and when I saw the email from my lawyer with the words Congrats! in the content line, I couldnt bring myself to open it. I read another, trivial email first. But then, as the news hit me like a sonic wave, I rode a bicycle on the beach path from Santa Monica to Venice Beach, where I stopped at the skate park. It remains one of my favorite places in America  because it never stops flowing with skaters of all races and colors, and they somehow, through subtle, mainly wordless communication, rarely collide. I love it for its spontaneous order, its sense of expansive, unpredictable freedom as the Pacific shimmers in the background. Five years later, last spring  the mandatory waiting period for a green-card holder  I applied for citizenship. I did so with even fewer illusions and far deeper fears. I saw in Donald Trumps candidacy a unique threat to the America I loved, a dangerous turn in the tumultuous history of this experiment in self-government. There was a reason for his arrival, of course: a sense of desperation, often understandable, in the face of modernitys ruthless dislocation of much of America, a profound unease at bewildering social and economic change that the elites of neither party saw clearly. But there was also unmistakably the American paranoia that had always unnerved me: a suspicion of immigrants, a longing for a strongman, rhetoric that scapegoated minorities, xenophobia that saw outsiders as a threat, and a religious bigotry that tried to tar an entire faith with the murderous misdeeds of a few. For good measure, Trump threw in a celebration of torture, an affinity for foreign despots over democratic allies, and an abiding hatred of Jeffersons beloved free press. This was not the America I cherished; it was that part of America that I had learned to fear the most, poised to be empowered by an extremely talented demagogue, with every branch of government at his partys disposal. If I were to fight against what I feared would unfold, I had to be all-in. It took months for my citizenship interview to take place  too long to allow me to vote, as I had hoped  but I passed the test. Later that same day, like some omen, FBI director James Comey informed Congress that the investigation into Hillary Clintons emails was being renewed. By the time Id been naturalized, there was a new president-elect. It became a constant refrain from everyone: Congratulations. Great timing, though! You sure you wanna do this now? They were joking, of course. But beneath the joke, I heard something else. And as I said the Oath of Allegiance in that lofty courtroom, I found the following words more than a little poignant: I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same. Foreign and domestic. There are times when becoming a citizen of this country means simply finding a final home. And there are times when it demands, even commands, something more. We may be about to enter one of the darkest periods in American history, when an unstable and often unhinged leader tests the fabric of liberal democracy and the very idea of self-government in America. And in the weeks after my naturalization, I found myself sinking into a deep and crippling depression  even despair  about the fate of what is now my country, delivered as its been into the hands of someone who uses the word freedom so rarely it seems like a concept alien to his very soul. I can only remember, as some kind of reassurance, what I learned in my own pilgrimage to this moment: that America, a model of constitutional caution, is also capable of great recklessness. It takes remarkable chances  like the one on an untested young black senator only eight years ago. And it makes terrible mistakes, as I fear it has just done. It is a place of radicalism and of equally potent reaction, and it has never quite resolved that abiding contradiction. America, in other words, is the country of both Obama and Trump, of the very best and the very worst, and its future is never settled but constantly remade, in often shocking and terrifying ways. What has saved it so far is what created it: a Constitution that was prepared for the worst and yet still managed to hope for the best. Its still there. Liberals might see that this conservative document is their first line of defense against populist excess. And this, of course, is what a new citizen swears to support and defend: not a president but a Constitution designed to protect us from tyranny. Even as I now find myself racked with dread, I therefore have no mixed feelings. I took the oath, as it asks, with no mental reservations. Im here now, like everyone else. And the defense of this countrys persistent greatness and the defeat of its eternal demons lies, as it always has, with us. *This article appears in the January 23, 2017, issue of New York Magazine."}, {"date": "2017/01/23", "title": "Lessons From Putins Russia for Living in Trumps\nAmerica", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/lessons-from-putins-russia-for-living-in-trumps-america.html", "text": " On one of my first reporting trips to Vladmir Putins Russia  of which thered be so many that theyd blend into residence  my friend Alex and I got stuck in Moscow traffic a few cars ahead of an EMT van. The siren wailed, the lights whirled, but no one would budge: The ambulance crawled along at the same pace as the rest of us. When I noted this, Alex scoffed. Everyone knows that ambulance drivers make money on the side selling VIP airport rides, he said. Who knows whos in that van right now? Fuck em. What struck me most, at that moment, was how little difference it made whether his allegation was true, an urban legend, or something that had occurred only once or twice. All you needed for it to matter was for it to be plausible. The moment you lived in a society where someone could conceive of an EMT van used as an ber-Uber, you lived in a society where ambulances no longer received the right of way. One tends to imagine life in an autocratic regime as dominated by fear and oppression: armed men in the street, total surveillance, chanted slogans, and whispered secrets. It is probably a version of that picture that has been flitting lately through the nightmares of American liberals fretting about the damage a potential autocrat might do to an open society. But residents of a hybrid regime such as Russias  that is, an autocratic one that retains the faade of a democracy  know the Orwellian notion is needlessly romantic. Russian life, I soon found out, was marked less by fear than by cynicism: the all-pervasive idea that no institution is to be trusted, because no institution is bigger than the avarice of the person in charge. This cynicism, coupled with endless conspiracy theories about everything, was at its core defensive (its hard to be disappointed if you expect the worst). But it amounted to defeatism. And, interestingly, the higher up the food chain you moved, the more you encountered it. Now that Russia has begun to export this Weltanschauung around the world, in the form of nationalist populism embodied here by Donald Trump, I am increasingly tempted to look at my years there for pointers on what to expect in America. Having been born in the then-USSR but having spent most of my life in New York, I moved to Moscow in 2011, ostensibly to edit the local edition of GQ but also to be closer to the fascinating protests that had engulfed the capital in the wake of a crooked parliamentary election. After years of political catatonia, the people hit the streets, in numbers that swelled in a head-spinning progression (7,000 on December 5; 50,000 on December 10; 100,000 on December 24). Whats more, this time the leaders of the protest did not come from the permanent political class; they were people much like me  novelists, bloggers  some of whom I personally knew. It was the year of Tahrir and Occupy; I didnt quite expect, or even want, my friends to gallop into the Kremlin with guns blazing, but I half-expected the Kremlin to meet them halfway. That didnt happen. When Vladimir Putin was elected for the third time, in 2012, he quickly moved to suppress the protests; since the opposition had never settled on a platform or a leader, it wasnt hard to do. By 2013, life returned to normal. On the surface, the Moscow crowd with which I ran was part of the emergent global liberal class: cosmopolitan, English-speaking, and worshipful of New York the same way their New York counterparts used to idolize Paris and now do Berlin. An outsider might imagine these free spirits living in some kind of perpetual combat with the regime, especially as the latter began to embrace Russian societys most backward strains: clericalism, homophobia, anti-Americanism. But no such thing transpired. Instead, ingeniously, the particular structure of the regime (and its particular corruptions and enticements) allowed Moscows elites to build for themselves a kind of scale model of an idealized Western society atop Moscows rough basis  what one friend of mine had termed Copenhagen in the middle of Karachi. This scale model is what you see every time a Western publication goes gaga over the urbanist wonders of the renovated Gorky Park, profiles the latest batch of Russian fashions It girls, or applauds Moscows restaurant renaissance. As long as I picked the right routes and stuck to them, it was possible to keep up a near-complete facsimile of my New York life. In fact, many Muscovites lived like this: ate and drank in places owned by friends (the highest praise for a Moscow restaurant being This doesnt feel at all like Moscow), shared cleaners and babysitters among friends (or used cool apps developed by friends), rode the new bike lanes across the citys few model neighborhoods, pointedly used Facebook instead of its more populist local clone VKontakte, watched American movies in the few theaters progressive enough for subtitles, and filled the rest of their time with Netflix. It was a comfortable illusion. But it fell apart as soon as anyone needed anything from the state or encountered it in any way  especially in the form of the police, who became the practical face of the problem. A traffic stop, a lost passport, even an altercation with a konsierzhka (Russias doormen, traditionally elderly women endowed with the superpowers of snooping and snitching): Any of this could feel like swallowing the red pill and waking up outside the Matrix. Suddenly, you were in the world of institutionalized sadism alleviated only by bribery. When you needed to solve a problem involving the state, you used the same ruchnoe upravlenie (manual control) as Putin exercised over the country itself: You asked friends of friends. When the director of photography on a TV show I had written suffered a brutal street attack that put him in a coma, the assault was suddenly refiled as a minor misdemeanor 24 hours later: The attacker had evidently paid off the police. Racing against time, his film-industry friends found a personal connection to a higher-ranking officer  and, just like that, the case was re-refiled. Another friend had an apartment stolen from her through a phony sale facilitated by a crooked bank employee; the police would be useless had she not found someone to call the daughter of the banks CEO. Moscow, in that sense, was a very small town. But what about the Russians more than a handshake removed from generals and bank CEOs  that is, most of them? And what about someone who dared step over the line? Even if you set aside the conspicuously unsolved assassinations of reporter Anna Politkovskaya and opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, it was clear which way the system leaned. I didnt have to go far for examples. Oleg Kashin, a leading journalist who contributed to the political blog I established at GQ, was beaten within an inch of his life in 2010; the detectives on the case began by asking his friends, Well, did he use his head when writing [about politics]? (Even a public promise of manual control by Dmitry Medvedev, the president at the time, didnt help convict the ultimate culprits, believed to be working for Andrei Turchak, a regional governor whom Kashin had offended in a blog post). My friend Andrew Ryvkin, who wrote for the same blog, was also attacked  in broad daylight, by two well-known pro-Kremlin writers, for a Twitter slight; his attempt to report the case ended when the detective told him, Come on. Theyre famous guys. You must understand. That last sentence was telling. There is a Russian word, ponyatiya, which literally means things that are understood  i.e., unwritten rules. Like many phenomena of modern Russian life, it comes from prison culture. And to live by the ponyatiya means not only to stay within the lines but also not to acknowledge the lines existence out loud: a version of the wrestling worlds kayfabe. And, just like with wrestling, this pretense takes as much effort, if not more, as the real thing. This, perhaps, was why the Muscovites around me were furiously building as many intermediaries between themselves and the state as they could, effectively privatizing government functions but only for their own benefit. Media managers established private medical clinics; frustrated university students, disgusted with ever-worsening official education, organized private student circles, online lecture courses, and educational start-ups. Tidy, modern, for-profit document centers proliferated, offering the functions of, say, the DMV without the rudeness and corruption (though, ironically, the only way they could function was by moving this corruption up a few levels). I was beginning to understand why so many Russians who called themselves liberal were, in fact, anarcho-libertarians in the Western sense, distrusting the government to perform even the simplest jobs. Even the protest leader Alexei Navalny, whose quixotic campaign for the mayor of Moscow in 2013 briefly regalvanized the movement, ran on a promise to, among other things, privatize the police force. In that sense, the Russian anti-Putinists and Donald Trump have more in common than either side would care to admit (though there are many, many things Trump would privatize before the police forces that helped elect him). There was, however, one thing from which no creature comfort could shield you: the general breakdown of trust. Wealth may or may not trickle down, but normalized corruption certainly does. Each day of the three years I spent in Russia nibbled away at my archetypal Brooklyn do-gooder instincts. First, of course, I stopped recycling. Waste-sorting bins occasionally appear here and there in Moscow  but, naturally, no one trusts them (Its a PR stunt to create a green image for the Moscow government, declared Greenpeace Russia in response to the latest campaign), and carefully sorted recyclables are generally assumed to end up in the same landfill as toxic waste. So why try? After years of unsuccessful attempts to sign freelance contracts as an American citizen (which would mean a huge tax liability for my Russian clients), I began accepting cash. I also began handing it out  to traffic cops. That was the genius of the system. It didnt need a giant security apparatus. It needed only you, the citizen, to be implicated just enough to have something to lose but not desperate enough that youd be tempted to lose it. In 2011, reform-minded Russians faced this dilemma head-on, realized no one was ready to actually storm the Kremlin or even protect the opposition leader from unlawful arrest, and backed down  and were legislatively and legally beaten into submission. That process continues to this day, aided by Russias ever-shrinking civic life. Now people may get arrested for single-man pickets where, five years ago, 100,000-person marches were fine. The new restrictive laws  such as the gay propaganda one, or the notorious Article 282 that reinterprets hate speech as anything anyone can take offense at  are shoddily written and full of holes on purpose; their true message is that anyone can be found guilty at any time. This moves justice fully into the realm of ponyatiya and obliterates all need for mass repression: One or two show trials, such as the Pussy Riot ordeal and the fabricated cases against the protesters of May 6, 2012, ensured that everyone else got the message. That message? Again, it wasnt to operate in totalitarian fear. More like: Sit quietly, enjoy your new bike lanes, or face a carefully randomized punishment. Living in Moscow meant a constant background calculation as to how much this or that transgression against the ponyatiya would cost you, whether it would be worth it or not. Probably not jail. Just your career. Your name on a stop list. Maybe. No one has seen these lists. But how much would you be willing to bet that they dont exist? The accommodations I made were often quite small. The first time I was asked for an interview by Russia Today, the Kremlins notorious English-language propaganda channel, I debated whether to go. Swept up in the excitement of the rallies, I justified going by pinning the white protest ribbon to my chest. The cameraman simply framed me from the shoulders up. After the Russian legislators rubber-stamped the vile law against gay propaganda, the magazines in-house lawyer suggested we delete the words love and family from a review of the Liberace biopic Behind the Candelabra (the logic: Gay people can have sex all they want, but calling it love creates false equivalence between traditional and nontraditional lifestyles). I threw a fit, threatened to quit, and we published the review. Somehow, the system weathered the blow. These meaningless little gestures belied an overall acquiescence. All they did was make me feel temporarily better about myself. Activism offered less and less of that kind of comfort. After the protests failed, the Russian liberals turned their resentment on themselves, with all solidarity vanishing down the rabbit hole of intramural recriminations. Charges flew, of collaborationism and selling out; almost no one was willing to face the idea that these terms simply didnt apply to a system where even the opposition newspapers, TV channels, and radio stations were on an indirect hook (the independent TV Rain lost nearly all its advertisers at a snap of Kremlin fingers). Some cocooned themselves in the state of so-called internal emigration, a natural M.O. for the Russian intelligentsia since czarist times. Some packed up and left for real. Yet others developed their own version of ponyatiya, circling the wagons in a mirror image of how the Kremlin operated. When a teacher at one of Moscows few progressive schools, where the liberal elite sent their children, was revealed to have conducted affairs with students, many parents heaped outrage not on him but on the whistle-blower: Dont you understand that youre giving them ammunition to demonize us even more? And, of course, every time the opposition attacked itself, corruption won. Every time an exhausted artist or scientist asked for asylum abroad, corruption won. Every time a young person declared all politics equally dirty and all governments corrupt, corruption won. The regime could just sit back and keep winning, in a self-propelling loop of triumph  because everyone else had lost this battle long ago, perhaps when they forked over their first 1,000 rubles at a traffic stop. These days, I am writing for Russian movies but doing it from Berlin, where glass is recycled according to color. With Germany being the last global bastion of liberal democracy (now, theres a sentence I never imagined Id write), the ethical compromises Im involved with are much more familiar ones  the ones Id internalized long before I moved to Russia. The truth is, there is absolutely nothing unique about my Russian experience. To live a privileged life in the West also means to engage in daily hypocrisy and selective blindness, no matter whos in charge. It means not thinking too hard about the kind of regimes our elected representatives prop up, the kinds of deals they strike, and the kind of strikes they deal. We know, though we often pretend not to, that things like democracy, liberty, and corruption exist on a continuum: Russias direct presidential elections are by definition more democratic than our Electoral College, for instance, but bribery in America is still, in most cases, a risky proposition. Yet corruption gradually shades into a culture of lobbyists and expediters and so on. Trust, on the other hand, is trust. Its either there or it isnt. Regardless of how strict or liberal a societys rule book is, the people either agree to Tinkerbell it into existence or they do not. A wailing ambulance contains either someone who needs help or someone taking you for a sucker. Post-Soviet Russia is a spectacular modern case of what happens when that basic trust between the individual and the institution, any institution, breaks down. And it may now  we shall see  provide some useful lessons for the brave new world the U.S. has just entered. *This article appears in the January 23, 2017, issue of New York Magazine."}, {"date": "2017/01/23", "title": "The Republicans Own Obamacare Now. How Many People\nWill They Let Suffer?", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/the-republicans-own-obamacare-now.html", "text": " The expanded health-care coverage created by the Affordable Care Act has been in place for just three years, and already its effects are measurable. Hospital-acquired conditions have dropped by 21 percent, saving more than 125,000 lives, in response to better incentives. (Before Obamacare, if hospitals had lots of infections, affected patients would return for more treatment, increasing hospital revenue.) Diagnoses of certain chronic conditions among low-income patients have risen. Access to routine checkups has increased, and people are now in less danger of falling into debt because of illness. Medical inflation has dropped to its lowest level in decades. As Donald Trumps Republican-controlled government assumes power, it has made its first task the dismantling of the law that has produced these gains. If we were watching a developing country consciously set about reversing its own social progress  shutting down its electrical grid, tearing out its indoor-plumbing system to revert to well water  we would find it baffling. The extent of the damage Republicans inflict remains to be seen, but one way to calculate it, should the dismantling occur, will be in American lives lost. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that 18 million Americans would immediately lose their insurance, a number that would increase to 32 million by 2026. A study of mortality rates in Massachusetts before and after that state enacted reforms similar to Obamacare found that one life was saved for every 830 adults who gained insurance coverage. Eighteen million divided by 830 equals almost 22,000 lives at stake, plus untold suffering from millions who would be denied access to regular medical care. The fact that Republicans are embarking on such a cruel, self-destructive project at all speaks to the pathology that has engulfed the new governing party. Trump has insisted throughout the campaign that he will take care of everybody, that his plan would be much less expensive and much better and is very much formulated down to the final strokes. We havent put it in quite yet, but were going to be doing it soon. This boast created some initial confusion within party ranks; Republican health-care adviser Yuval Levin reported that the conservative health-care universe, including some people on Trumps own team, quickly concluded that the separate administration plan he described was entirely a figment of Trumps imagination. Trump is employing the same technique he used to enthrall conservatives about the birther conspiracy, only in reverse: Rather than pretending that a real document (Barack Obamas birth certificate) was fake, he insisted an imaginary document (the much cheaper, much better Trumpcare plan) was real. He is hardly alone in this. Trumps lie was merely a less careful version of the same fantasy that Republicans have repeated for eight years. Since the health-care debate began in 2009, they have been promising that if Democrats scrapped their plan, Republicans could provide cheaper, better coverage to the uninsured. Indeed, even as far back as 1994, Republicans promised that if the Clinton health-care plan was defeated, they would start over and pass something terrific instead. They never did. If Obamacare had been defeated in 2010, health-care reform would rank as high on Trumps agenda today as it did on George W. Bushs from 2001 to 2008: last. Instead, Republicans are caught having to follow through on their impossible promises. The GOP health-care plan is the teenage nerds mythical girlfriend who lives in Canada  the one nobody has ever seen. Republicans do have ideas on health care. The catch is that those ideas are resoundingly unpopular. They want to force Americans to make do with much cheaper plans that cover much less care. The party has refused to grapple with any of the trade-offs inherent in the issue. Two-thirds of all health spending is consumed by 10 percent of the public. The only way to cover the cost of their care is to make other people pay for it. Republicans denounce any such mechanism. They also denounce Obamacares regulations, proposing instead to let anybody buy the kind of insurance they want. But all those regulations serve the purpose of spreading the costs from the sick to the healthy. If healthy people can buy cheaper insurance that doesnt cover expensive treatments they dont need, then the cost of those treatments will be borne entirely by people with expensive medical needs. You could fund those treatments through taxes instead  but, of course, Republicans hate taxes even more than they hate regulations. At his confirmation hearing, Tom Price, Trumps nominee to run the Department of Health and Human Services, promised, Our goal would be to go from what we see as a Democrat health-care system to an American health-care system. He bashed Obamacare for its high deductibles, just as House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have done repeatedly. But Prices own plan would feature much higher deductibles than Obamacare, as would most Republican proposals. Price has previously written a plan that would give people a tax credit ranging from $1,200 to $3,000 a year. Thats only enough to pay for about one-third of the cost of an inexpensive individual plan on the market today. He would also let insurers charge higher rates to people with preexisting conditions, unless they manage the difficult task of maintaining continuous coverage. As an article in the New England Journal of Medicine explained, Prices plan would be likely to lead low-income and even middle-class healthy people to forgo seeking coverage until a serious health problem develops. There are alternative Republican plans floating around that provide more-generous coverage, but the catch, as the Washington Post reported, is that nobody seems to know how to pay for it. No wonder Republicans have carefully sequenced their legislative strategy in order to prevent any direct comparison between their ideas and Obamacare. If they believed Trumpcare might compare favorably with Obamacare, they would simply put it to a vote. Instead, their plan calls for separate votes  first to repeal Obamacare and then, in a later vote, to replace it with something terrific. Their only hope of success lies in first destroying the status quo and then using the threat of the disaster they created to somehow put pressure on Democrats, or even recalcitrant Republicans, to vote to put something, anything, in its place. The party has taken its fastidious secrecy about its health-care intentions to absurd lengths. In the lead-up to his confirmation hearings, Price has been kept out of the Trump transition teams efforts to craft an Obamacare replacement plan, CNN reported. According to a senior transition official, the incoming administration wants Price to be inoculated from questions about what Trumps alternative to the Affordable Care Act looks like. Trumps advisers would rather delay the process of devising their own plan than risk exposing their ideas to the public. Republicans certainly arent pursuing their repeal-and-delay plan because its popular. Various polls have found that 20 percent of the public favors a repeal vote that doesnt include a replacement plan. They are doing so because, now that they enjoy almost total control of the federal government, they are stuck. Republicans have been catastrophically successful at convincing their supporters that Obamacare is pure evil, devoid of any virtues whatsoever, and thus that it can easily be replaced with an alternative that is superior in every dimension. How far they will go to maintain their lie is a question on which millions of lives now depend. *This article appears in the January 23, 2017, issue of New York Magazine."}, {"date": "2017/01/22", "title": "Trump Says U.S. Should Have Stolen Iraqs Oil, Maybe Well Have Another Chance", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-u-s-may-get-another-chance-to-take-iraqi-oil.html", "text": " While addressing the CIA on Saturday, President Donald Trump took a break from lambasting the media to remind everyone that he thinks the U.S. should have stolen Iraqs oil. He also suggested that the U.S. might get another chance to violate international law. Now I said it for economic reasons, Trump said while introducing Representative Mike Pompeo, his pick to lead the agency. But if you think about it, Mike, if we kept the oil, you probably wouldnt have ISIS because thats where they made their money in the first place, so we should have kept the oil. But, okay, maybe well have another chance. National Review has noted that Trumps odd fixation with taking Iraqs oil dates back to at least 2011. He made the argument numerous times on the campaign trail, suggesting that the U.S. could take Iraqs oil while fighting ISIS. When PolitiFact examined the claim in September, numerous experts said trying to seize Iraqi oil would not be legal, feasible, or desirable. The idea is so out of step with any plausible interpretation of U.S. history or international law that they should be dismissed out of hand by anyone with even a rudimentary understanding of world affairs, said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. Its not clear what Trump meant by maybe well have another chance, but when youre president, people take even offhand remarks about violating international law pretty seriously. BuzzFeed spoke with several Iraqis on the front lines of the battle against ISIS, and they said they were prepared to take up arms against Americans if they attempted to take their countrys natural resources. I participated in the attack against the Americans by attacking them with mortars and roadside bombs, and Im ready to do it again, said Abu Luay, an Iraqi security official using a nom de guerre, who is currently fighting the terrorist group in northwest Iraq. We kept our ammunition and weapons from the time the Americans left for fighting ISIS. But once ISIS is gone we will save our weapons for the Americans. Several other people at a base for Popular Mobilization Units, a new branch of Iraqs armed forces consisting of former militiamen and volunteers fighting against ISIS, said the move would be counterproductive. Iraq recently took out a $5.3 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, in part to help pay for the fight against ISIS. Theres no way Trump could take the oil unless he launched a new military front and it be a new world war, said Kareem Kashekh, a photographer who works for the Popular Mobilization Units."}, {"date": "2017/01/22", "title": "Conway Says Trump Is Officially Never Releasing His Tax Returns", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/conway-says-trump-is-officially-never-releasing-tax-returns.html", "text": " The Whitehouse.gov petition demanding that President Donald Trump finally release his tax returns is now well past the 100,000 signatures needed to prompt a response from the White House (per the rules of the We the People platform, which was created by the Obama administration). In a Sunday morning appearance on This Week, Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway addressed the matter, saying, perhaps unsurprisingly, that her boss is simply never going to make his tax returns public, despite his repeated promises to do so after the completion of a routine audit. The White House response is that hes not going to release his tax returns. We litigated this all through the election. People didnt care, Conway told George Stephanopoulous. They voted for him, and let me make this very clear: Most Americans are very focused on what their tax returns will look like while President Trump is in office, not what his look like. Meanwhile, a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll said that 74 percent of Americans want to see the tax returns. Conway also appeared on Meet the Press, where host Chuck Todd pressed her on the Saturday briefing during which Press Secretary Sean Spicer blatantly lied about the number of people who attended Trumps Inauguration. Why put [Spicer] out there for the very first time in front of that podium to utter a provable falsehood? Todd asked. After a minute of attempting to change the subject, Conway finally instructed Todd to stop being so overly dramatic about it. Youre saying its a falsehood, she said. But, actually, Spicer was just offering what she called alternative facts, which is probably a term you should get used to hearing: Upon realizing that Trump has no intention of releasing his tax returns, WikiLeaks put out another call for someone to leak the documents. They noted that Trump breaking a decades-old tradition by refusing to release documents that could shed light on his vast business interests and potential conflicts of interest is even more egregious that Hillary Clinton failing to share the full text of speeches she made to some bankers. This post has been updated to include WikiLeaks response. This post originally stated that Kellyanne Conway discussed the tax returns on Meet the Press; it was on ABCs This Week.

Actually, he tweeted two responses  and they were pretty different from one another. The first tweet was about what youd expect from Trump: (Of course, many of these people did vote, which is why Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million.)

Shortly after noon on Day 2 of the Trump Era, I found myself standing at the intersection of Third Avenue and East 48th Street, waiting for the signal to start shuffling along a prescribed route with the rest of the Womens March. Eventually, we gave in and started moving westward down an unauthorized block, flowing around suddenly stranded cars. A cabbie abandoned his taxi midstream, leaving the OFF DUTY light on, just in case anyone decided to climb in. A little boy scrambled onto the roof of the family minivan and started leading protest chants. A woman pulled her SUV out of an underground garage, only to discover that she wouldnt be going anywhere for hours. At Lexington Avenue, drivers honked madly, and the crowd echoed the horns, turning a mechanical snarl of protest into a joyous song. Across the world, marchers commandeered traffic arteries, bridges, highways, squares, and streets, offering a glimpse of what cities could be if they were permanently retrofitted for pedestrians. The Womens March was also a de-facto Metropolitan March, a global act of resistance to the new administrations profoundly anti-urban philosophy. Cities  not just on Americas coasts, but in the Rust Belt, the South, and the heartland, and even in Finland, France, and Nigeria  came out in force because they are havens for the openness and hybridization that Trump detests. One of this political moments innumerable ironies is that a dyed-in-the-wool New York kid should grow up to be so unsympathetic to urban culture. The metropolitan energy expressed on this one day didnt die when the marchers went home. It has profound implications, because a global network of cities can tackle shared problems more nimbly than sluggish national governments can. While Trump erects walls and tariffs and invokes the fascistic slogan America First, city leaders know they need each other. The mayors of Paris (Anne Hidalgo), L.A. (Eric Garcetti), Bogot (Enrique Pealosa), and Seoul (Park Won-soon) belong to an international cohort of city wonks who swap war stories and wisdom. While they all have to dance around different political obstacles, they often sound interchangeable when they talk about climate change, inequality, transit, and civil rights. If mayors can link arms across oceans, its because city dwellers everywhere are more similar to each other than to the small-town relatives theyve left behind. The scenes from Cape Town, Rome, and Erbil all looked inspiringly similar: the same knit pussy hats, the same smart signs and wide smiles, the same projected confidence in a future of equal rights.

Early Saturday evening, Trump press secretary Sean Spicer walked into the White House briefing room, berated reporters for their unpatriotic lies, then left without answering a single question. The lie that most concerned Spicer was, in fact, the objective and unmistakable fact that Donald Trumps inauguration drew a smaller audience to the National Mall than Barack Obamas had, in 2009 and 2013. It is neither surprising, nor (especially) telling that Trumps crowd was smaller than his predecessors. Washington, D.C. is a majority African-American city, and the first black president won its vote overwhelmingly. Trump, by contrast, received a mere 4 percent of the districts ballots. Thus, Spicer could have chalked up the discrepancy to home-field advantage, and kindly asked the press to note this context in its reporting. Or, better still, he could have refused to defend the presidents ego against the slings and arrows of outrageous reality, and ignored the subject entirely. Instead, he explained that journalists had intentionally framed side-by-side photographs to minimize the enormous support that had gathered on the National Mall. This was the first time in our nations history that floor coverings have been used to protect the grass on the mall, Spicer explained. That had the effect of highlighting any areas where people were not standing. Spicer then claimed that, when Trump took the Oath of Office, the crowd extended all the way back to the Washington Monument, which is a demonstrable lie. The White House press secretary further bolstered his case by claiming that 420,000 people rode the D.C. Metro on Trumps Inauguration Day, compared to 317,000 on Obamas four years ago. This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, Spicer declared. The D.C. Metro Authoritys initial estimates tell a different story. As does the authoritys final estimate, per the Washington Post: Spicer then informed the press that Trump had attracted a packed crowd to CIA Headquarters, when he visited earlier in the day. There, Trump described reporters as the most dishonest human beings on earth, and accused them of lying about the size of his inauguration crowd. They gave him a five-minute standing ovation at the end, Spicer said, before noting what a shame it is that Senate Democrats still havent confirmed Trumps nominee for CIA director, Mike Pompeo.

In early December, news broke that the American intelligence community believed that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election with the intention of aiding Trumps candidacy. Shortly after such reports surfaced, the then-president-elect began vilifying the American spy state. Trump argued that the CIA was full of the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction; accused intelligence officials  the quotation marks, his own  of pursuing a political witch hunt meant to undermine his presidency; lambasted the intelligence agencies for spreading fake news in a manner akin to Nazi Germany; and suggested that the former director of the CIA, John Brennan, might be personally responsible for disseminating propaganda. But on Saturday, the president informed the CIA that all of those statements were, themselves, fake news propagated by the dishonest media. They sort of made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community, Trump said, referring to the press. I just want to let you know, the reason youre the number one stop is it is exactly the opposite. Trump went on to describe how overwhelmed the CIA would soon be by his support. There is nobody that feels stronger about the intelligence community and the CIA than Donald Trump, the president said. I am so behind you. I know maybe sometimes you havent gotten the backing that youve wanted and youre going to get so much backing. Maybe youre going to say, Please, dont give us so much backing. Mr. President, please, we dont need so much backing. But his true feelings about the CIA werent the only things that the media had lied about. On Friday, many news outlets took note of the fact that the crowd at Trumps inauguration appeared considerably smaller than those Barack Obama had attracted in 2013 and 2009. The president remembered things differently. I get up this morning and I turn on one of the networks and they show an empty field, Trump said. I said wait a minute, I made a speech, I looked out, the field was, it looked like a million, a million and a half people  it went all the way back to the Washington Monument. So, we caught the media, Trump said, and we caught them in beauty. And I think theyre going to pay a big price. After describing the million-member crowd that only he could see, the president informed the intelligence analysts that God, himself, was among those in attendance. It was almost raining  the rain should have scared them away  but God looked down and he said we are not going to let it rain on your speech  and then it poured right after I left, Trump said. In fact, a light rain fell through the first few minutes of Trumps speech, and no downpour followed its conclusion. At other points, Trump criticized the Senate for holding up his confirmation picks, reiterated his belief that the United States should have confiscated Iraqs oil, and pledged to win the war against ISIS. But a different conflict seemed closer to the front of the presidents mind. I have a running war with the media, the commander-in-chief said. They are among the most dishonest human beings on earth, right?

For nearly five decades, many legal scholars had assumed that such a hire was barred by federal law: Troubled by President Kennedys appointment of his brother Robert as attorney general, Congress passed an anti-nepotism law in 1967 that prohibited presidents from appointing their relatives to federal agencies. But Kushners lawyers concluded that this was no obstacle to the appointment of Ivankas husband, because the White House is not a federal agency. On Saturday, the Justice Department said that this story checks out. In a 14-page opinion drafted by the departments Office of Legal Counsel, government lawyers argue that a law passed by Congress in 1978, which gave the president broad authority to appoint White House officials, overrides the anti-nepotism legislation passed 11 years earlier. We believe that the Presidents special hiring authority  permits him to make appointments to the White House Office that the anti-nepotism statute might otherwise forbid, the opinion reads. Ultimately, Kushners appointment may be a fortunate development for those skeptical of the Trump teams ethics. Had Kushner remained an informal adviser, he would have escaped the reach of conflict-of-interest laws. Now, he will be required to file a financial-disclosure report detailing his finances, and to divest from any assets that could generate a conflict of interest. Kushner is expected to advise the president on public-private partnerships, trade issues, and the Israel-Palestine conflict, according to the New York Times. On that last matter, Trump couldnt have more faith in his son-in-laws expertise. If you cant produce peace in the Middle East, nobody can, Trump shouted to Jared, at a candlelit dinner for donors in Washington Thursday night. So, sure, Kushner may look like a nepotism hire  but can you think of anyone more qualified to broker a two-state solution than a 36-year-old real estate developer from New Jersey?"}, {"date": "2017/01/21", "title": "Dont Let Anybody Tell You the Marches Didnt Matter", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/dont-let-anybody-tell-you-the-marches-didnt-matter.html", "text": " Of the many reasons a man like Donald Trump managed to win the presidential election, ranging from the 22nd Amendment to James Comey, an important one was the imbalance in political passion between the two sides. Not only did many Democrats distrust or dislike Hillary Clinton, but eight years of Democratic control of the White House had created complacency (as it did in 2000). Republicans were starving for power and willing to overlook their candidates glaring, grotesque flaws. A number of Democrats would not forgive Clintons smaller ones. The events of the last two days have made clear that Trumps victory wiped those conditions away overnight. It matters that Trump drew a sparse crowd to inaugural festivities that he had billed beforehand as a historic, Jacksonian uprising of the People. And it matters much more that millions of Americans came out on a Saturday to register their protest. It is not only catharsis; though, catharsis is better than depression. The message has been heard by the political class, Republican and Democratic alike. It might be easy to assume that Trump and his allies feel insulated from accountability. It is not quite so simple. Republicans in Congress have thus far given Trump near-total cooperation of the assumption that they could move quickly and with little resistance to implement their agenda. Democrats did not really wake up from their late-Clinton slumber until the middle of Bushs term, after which a lot of legislation had already passed. Republicans assuming they could rush through Paul Ryans agenda, while allowing Trump to obliterate long-standing governing norms, will rethink. The kind of backlash Democrats eventually mounted against Bush, which drove landslide victories in the 2006 midterm and the 2008 election, is a plausible possibility. In those elections, many seemingly safe red states turned blue. One of the great weaknesses of American liberalism is a congenital tendency toward depression when their party holds power. The demobilization of the Democratic base is over. The prospect of a Democratic wave may not stop Republicans, and it may not even give them pause. But the governing party had probably assumed the clock would not start for months on the liberal backlash.

In Washington, D.C., the Womens March brought a larger crowd to the National Mall than Trumps inauguration had the day before. The consensus of such photos was confirmed by the Washington Metro, which struggled to accommodate the hoards of marchers in pink pussyhats.

With the aid of Google Maps, Los Angeles Times reporter Matt Pearce found that it would take 19 minutes to walk from one end of the march to the other. By early Saturday afternoon, the organizers of the D.C. march told the Washington Post that they now expected as many as a half-million participants, after preparing for less than half that number.In New York City, an early estimate from Manhattan borough president Gale Brewer put the number of marchers at roughly 200,000. In Los Angeles, the marchers were 500,000 strong, by the LAPDs estimates  and 750,000 by those of the organizers. So many Chicagoans turned out to express their solidarity with those whose rights are threatened by Trumps election, organizers were forced to cancel their plan to march through the citys downtown, due to public-safety concerns. Tens of thousands of protesters made their presence felt in Denver. And the marches extended across the Atlantic. Less than 24 hours after the new presidents belligerently nationalistic speech, marchers in Paris, London, Lisbon, Tokyo, and countless other cities affirmed the value of collective, international struggle. Even Antarctica made its solidarity known. Its early days for the anti-Trump resistance. Mass demonstrations are no guarantee of sustained organization and engagement. But the organizers of the Womens March have articulated a broad vision of the society they wish to struggle for  one that would guarantee greater freedom and security not only for women, but for all those who suffer from disadvantages based in their race, sexuality, gender identity, immigration status, or class. That vision  and the millions that it helped mobilize  offers some hope to all who fear the journey our country has just embarked on."}, {"date": "2017/01/21", "title": "Trumps Pick to Enforce Civil Rights Is an Expert at Defending GOP Voting Laws", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trumps-top-civil-rights-pick-has-bad-record-on-civil-rights.html", "text": " Donald Trump spent much of his campaign cheering on violent attacks against African-American protestors, defending military torture, arguing that our elections are plagued by widespread voter fraud, praising authoritarian rulers for acts of extrajudicial killing, and calling for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. So, from the moment the Rust Belt turned red on November 8, it was clear that the next four years werent going to be a stellar time for civil-rights enforcement in the United States. But the outlook has grown even more dire in the weeks since. First, and most critically, Trump named Jeff Sessions  a longtime critic of federal civil-rights enforcement, who once prosecuted three African-American get-out-the-vote activists on dubious charges of voter fraud  as his pick to lead the Justice Department. Then, moments after Trump was sworn in, a Standing Up for Our Law Enforcement Community page was added to the White Houses official website. The page decries the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in the United States, and declares, Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the rioter, the looter, or the violent disrupter. Of course, steadfast enforcement of civil rights law does not require the federal government to supply looters with free pillow-top mattresses, wooly slippers, or ergonomic chairs. But since no one thinks the governments job is literally to make rioters more comfortable, it seems likely that what the Trump administration really means is, Our job is not to investigate local police departments that have been accused of systemic civil-rights violations. Over the past few years, Justice Department investigations into the police departments of Ferguson, Baltimore, and Chicago all turned up evidence of routine racial discrimination and use of excessive force. During his confirmation hearing, Sessions suggested that such investigations contribute to the anti-police atmosphere that the Trump administration has vowed to dispel. Still, before the inauguration, the top civil-rights-enforcement position in the DOJ  deputy assistant attorney general to the Civil Rights Division  lay open. And so, it was still possible for the terminally optimistic to imagine that Trump would place someone with a modicum of credibility on civil-rights issues in that position. But late Friday, Above the Law reported that John M. Gore, a partner at the law firm Jones Day, would be assuming that position. (The firm had posted an announcement of the appointment to its website). Gore does boast some expertise in civil-rights litigation  specifically, he has considerable experience defending the Republican Party against allegations that its voting laws violate civil rights. As BuzzFeed notes, Gore defended controversial redistricting plans pushed by Republicans in Florida, New York, and South Carolina in 2012. He also defended Florida governor Rick Scotts attempt to purge his states voting rolls of non-citizens, shortly before the 2012 election. A federal court later ruled that Scotts measure had violated the National Voter Registration Act, as it purged many legal voters from the rolls, most of whom happened to belong to left-leaning constituencies. As Zachary Roth wrote for MSNBC: In his most recent, high-profile civil-rights case, Gore defended the University of North Carolina in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU challenging the states infamous, anti-transgender bathroom bill. That may look a tad more damning to progressive eyes than it actually is: Unlike the states Republican leadership, UNC did not defend the law on its merits. Rather, the university argued that it had made no effort to enforce the discriminatory law, and was thus, not a proper target for a legal challenge to the legislation. The UNC case is ongoing, and Gore withdrew from it earlier this week. At first glance, theres nothing in Gores record thats as outrageous as the darkest chapters of Sessionss history. Nonetheless, he appears far better prepared to rationalize the GOPs state-level voting restrictions than to contest them. And that impression was only reinforced by one of the Justice Departments first actions under Trump.

At the Freedom Ball and the Liberty Ball, which were both held in the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, guests got to see the acts Trump claims he prefers to the A-list talent who snubbed him. There were performances from the Rockettes, the kid band Pelican 212, and Michael Flatleys Lord of the Dance troupe. Twitter was not impressed, particularly when the Piano Guys did an instrumental cover of Rachel Plattens Fight Song, the unofficial anthem of Hillary Clintons campaign. Platten objected on Twitter: The first couple showed up to the Liberty Ball shortly after 9:30 p.m. Trump started with a brief speech describing his win. Today we had a great day, he continued. People that werent so nice to me were saying that we did a really good job today. They hated to do it, but they did it. Though it started raining just as Trump began delivering his inaugural speech, he claimed that drops only began to fall after he finished his address. It was like God was looking down on us, I will tell you, he said. Then they danced to a cover of Frank Sinatras My Way, with the president mouthing the words at parts. They were joined by Vice-President Mike Pence, his wife Karen Pence, and the two couples adult children. Trump delivered similar remarks upon arriving at the Freedom Ball, but this time, he asked the crowd if he should keep the Twitter going or not? The crowd cheered that he should. The enemies keep saying, Oh, thats terrible, Trump said, but its a way of bypassing dishonest media, right? The last stop was the Armed Services Ball at the National Building Museum, where about half of the guests were members of the military. I like you for a lot of reasons. Also I like the fact that you all voted for me, Trump said. He also spoke to troops in Afghanistan via satellite link, and took the opportunity to criticize the press again. I like them much better than I like the media, he said, referring to the troops. These are much nicer people, finer people. Melania Trump delivered her first remarks since becoming First Lady, then the couple danced to a cover of I Will Always Love You. Thank you all for your service, she said. Im honored to be your First Lady. We will fight, we will win, we will make America great again. Then the Trumps and Pences ended their night by cutting a huge red, white, and blue cake with a saber. But there was still time for one more controversy. Pastry chef Duff Goldman of Charm City Cakes suggested on Twitter that someone copied the cake he made for the Commander-in-Chief Ball in 2013 without his permission. Questions of cake plagiarism aside, it could have been worse."}, {"date": "2017/01/21", "title": "Trump Signs Vague Order to Begin Dismantling Obamacare", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-signs-vague-order-to-begin-dismantling-obamacare.html", "text": " Shortly after his inaugural parade on Friday, President Donald Trump signed his first executive order, directing federal agencies to ease the burden of Obamacare. The order is vague, and has no immediate effect on the health-care system. But it paves the way for the weakening of the Affordable Care Act, and signals that Trump will fulfill his campaign promise to make dismantling the health law one of his administrations top priorities. The order says that until Congress can repeal Obamacare fully, the Trump administration will take all actions consistent with law to minimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens of the ACA and prepare to afford the States more flexibility and control to create a more free and open healthcare market. It goes on to direct the heads of all executive departments and agencies exercise all authority and discretion available to them to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation provisions in the ACA that would impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications. The Trump administration declined to explain what that means, and as the Washington Post notes, In general, federal rules cannot be undone with a penstroke but require a new rule-making process to replace or delete them. But the order means that federal agencies could try to ease enforcement or penalties pertaining to certain aspects of the law, such as the individual and employer mandates, or requirements that insurers include certain benefits in health plans. Medicaid is not mentioned specifically, but providing the states greater flexibility could mean that rules will be loosened for states that expanded the program to cover low-income Americans. This order doesnt in and of itself do anything tangible, Larry Levitt, vice-president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told Vox. But, it directs federal agencies to start taking steps to use their administrative authority to unwind the ACA in all sorts of ways. This is a signal that the Trump administration is not waiting for Congress to start making big changes. Trump signed the order while seated at the Resolute Desk, flanked by Vice-President Mike Pence and senior aides Steve Bannon, Jared Kushner, and Reince Priebus. Trump also signed the commissions for Defense Secretary James Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, who were confirmed by the Senate on Friday. Mattis and Kelly were then sworn in by Pence during a separate ceremony. Priebus, Trumps chief of staff, also issued an executive memorandum freezing pending regulations to give the new administration an opportunity to review them. Obama enacted a similar freeze after he was sworn in in 2009. The memo could prevent new Energy Department efficiency standards from going into effect. Trumps first executive action of the day was to block a move by the Obama administration that would have reduced the cost of mortgages for millions of home buyers. The Department of Housing and Urban Development issues a letter suspending a 0.25 percentage point premium-rate cut for Federal Housing Administrationbacked loans, USA Today reports. Republicans say the cut  which would have saved homeowners $29 a month on a $200,000 mortgage  threatened the stability of the system, but Democrats questioned the Trump administrations priorities: The Oval Office also saw some cosmetic changes on Friday. There was a brief replay of the controversy from 2009, when President Obama moved a bust of Winston Churchill from the Oval Office to the White House residence to make room for a bust of Martin Luther King, Jr. Reporters spotted the Churchill bust back in the Oval Office on Friday, and initially thought that MLK bust had been removed. Later journalists confirmed that both the Churchill and MLK busts are in Trumps Oval Office."}, {"date": "2017/01/21", "title": "Protests Turned Violent at a Demonstration Before the Inaugural Parade", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/protests-turned-violent-prior-to-trumps-inaugural-parade.html", "text": "  Dont worry.

He came to the podium and simply read the Beatitudes from Jesus Sermon on the Mount: Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are the meek: for they shall possess the land. Blessed are they who mourn: for they shall be comforted. Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after justice: for they shall have their fill.

Thats because language in the lease between the Trump company that is leasing the hotel and the General Services Administration, the agency that manages government-owned properties, explicitly states that No  elected official of the Government of the United States  shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom[.] The reasoning behind this clause, and why its particularly applicable to a case in which the elected official in question is the president, is simple. Since the property is owned by the federal government and managed by the GSA, for Trump to simultaneously be president and profit off the lease is a casebook example of both the appearance of a significant conflict of interest and an intolerable intermingling of an elected officials governmental duties and his familys personal financial interests, as two experts on legal issues pertaining to the GSA put it in a Government Executive article back in November. That is, Trump, given that the president chooses the head of the GSA, would get to both rent a building and be his landlords boss. The authors argued the GSA should immediately breach, or do whatever it takes, to end, the contract. (The watchdog group Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility argued similarly in a complaint it filed today.) That didnt happen, of course. Between Trumps election and today, the GSA had been mostly mum on this issue, insisting it didnt have enough information about how Trump was going to handle his business to make any sort of determination about the hotel lease, and suggesting it didnt want to before Trump took office and became an elected official, anyway. Yesterday, though, an agency spokeswoman indicated to Daily Intelligencer via email that the agency would be issuing a statement about the situation today, and confirmed I was on the list of recipients. But nothing was ever sent out, and now a source at the GSA tells me that there is no statement forthcoming, instead pointing me to a January 11 blog post, which simply reiterates the point that the GSA was, at that time, seeking more information about Trumps business plans before coming to any sort of conclusion. In an email, one of the co-authors of the Government Executive piece, the George Washington University law professor Steven Schooner, a procurement expert who is a former Office of Management and Budget staffer, argued that the GSA has not handled this issue well: It will be very interesting to keep an eye on the interactions between Trump and the GSA going forward, but its hard to argue with Schooners conclusion that untangling this problem got much more complicated shortly after noon today."}, {"date": "2017/01/20", "title": "Inauguration Day in Washington Is Like a Nightmare Twitter Thread", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/inauguration-day-in-d-c-is-like-a-nightmare-twitter-thread.html", "text": " Im standing at the corner of 10th and E, one block from the Trump International Hotel in Washington, one hour after the sky started to cry when Donald Trump checked his hair swoop and put his hands on the Bible to become our 45th president, and I realize where I really am: deep inside an internet comments board. Or maybe a long @reply thread on a public figures Twitter account. Technically, Im standing outside of a checkpoint for Trump supporters to go watch his parade. Anti-Trump protesters are congregated in this spot since it offers consistent access to their target audience. It feels as if, after months of shouting to one another online, what every American who schlepped here to witness history really wanted was the chance to shout at ideological enemies in person. When was America great? Then why does your hat say that? Shut up, communist. FASCISM. ASSHOLE. I came down on the train this morning, sitting across from a boomer on her way to the Womens March with an I Voted sticker on her iPhone. Resistance is fertile, she says, laughing and Instagramming her train ticket, while telling her daughter in Austin on the phone that shed just learned about pink pussy hats from some 90-year-old woman the day before. I feel so out of it, she said. Maybe she should: Within the first five minutes of entering Union Station, I saw a patrician man of about 70 sporting one in a Starbucks. Almost everyone here has hats, or scarves, or T-shirts declaring their allegiance for one side or the other. The thought crosses my mind that perhaps T-shirt culture created identity-politics culture, rather than the reverse. Nasty Woman is a big theme. I spot a backpack decorated by a homemade pink triangle with the words No More Walls. Then there are the ubiquitous red (or occasionally camo) Make America Great Again hats. I see them on enough children and teens, including a punk crowd with acne and skateboards, to make my heart ache. A vendor sees me, my pale Midwestern face peering out, and tries to sell me a Trump beanie. Registering my surprise, he tells me to come back tomorrow. Ill have stuff for the Womens March. Im leaning more your side, you know. Hes black. Most people here either resisting or supporting the president are white, including the entire group of college-age kids standing proudly for a photo-op with a banner that reads, What will we do today to dismantle white supremacy? Shake Shack at the train station has bathrooms and a TV, so I stop to watch the ceremony here. My sister texts me to be careful and remember her instructions about keeping water or milk on me in case of tear gas, since there are anarchists downtown smashing car windows. I fail to tell her my intrepid reporting has taken me as far as the second floor of a cozy Danny Meyer chain establishment, where two blonde women in jeans and sneakers are the only people applauding as Trump speaks; everyone else is quiet. An elderly couple is sitting close to the screen, silently filming the television, which has the sound off. I wonder why theyve come all the way here to watch it this way, screens on screens, and then realize it might be the most authentic way to experience our first reality-TV president: through mediated media, with an appropriate remove of unreality. Just as Mike Pence takes the oath of office, protesters walk through Union Station chanting, filling up the hall with noise. Cops run toward the noise, as do fast-food employees, holding up iPhones to film things, just in case. I hold up mine too; nothing much happens. But here we are, confirming to ourselves with the video button that were inside the spectacle. On the Metro, I sit near some Trump supporters making friends with one another. A man with a square jaw and an expensive-looking overcoat greets a cowboy-hat-wearing couple. They talk about how the protests have been inflated by the media and how piddling their attendance is compared with the number of people whove come for the inauguration itself. Theyre Trump supporters, but they dont know it yet. A man with black-rimmed glasses and Converse, an emissary from Portlandias America, comes up and aggressively asks the cowboy-hat wearer what policies of Donald Trumps he supports. All of them, is the reply, to which he is rewarded with a lecture on whats good about Obamacare. Its all surprisingly polite. I found an old photo this week Id taken on the Mall at Barack Obamas first inauguration. It was a shot of a sign held by one of the few protesters there. Warning: Baby killing women, porno freaks, sports nuts, drunks, homos, Jesus Mockers, Mormons; Judgment Coming. I was giddy that day; I think I found it funny that hate was so on the ropes that it was relying on Judgment Day for a victory. This time around, protesters are everywhere I look. This time, a block from the checkpoint, the signs say Love Trumps Hate; Id Say Piss on Trump But Hed Probably Enjoy It. Fucking assholes are blocking businesses, says a guy in a MAGA hat. There are the usual chants: hey hey, ho ho; a he-said-she-said duet of Our bodies our choice/Their bodies their choice. Plus some Trump specials, like Hands too small cant build a wall. Theres a group of kids passing a joint. Fuck Donald Trump, says one of them, a girl with a skateboard, with a voice full of joy. A group thats gone all-out comes by, dressed as Russian soldiers, draped in red flags with a hammer and sickle, with a speaker playing the Russian national anthem and carrying signs that read things like KGB to Trump: We Made You, We March With You. Everyone cracks up, and we elbow each other for a good photo angle. Last night, clips of the concert on the Mall, with its military music and ominous-seeming fireworks had frightened me: Washington in all its low-slung beige and red and white and blue seemed authoritarian, our patriotic traditions revealed as fascistic in their kitschier versions. Here, away from my screen, amid all the yelling, theres nothing that feels authoritarian. I check my email, and theres one from a friend saying simply, Im so sad.

This may turn out to be the most significant line in his speech, signifying the entry of the Trump-led United States into an anti-Islamic international alliance based in white Christian identity. The key word in the passage above is civilized as a modifier for world, as opposed to the traditional free. The alt-right in the United States, and right-wing populist parties in Europe, frame the conflict against Islamic terrorism in civilizational terms, broadening rather than narrowing the scope of the conflict. Rather than defining their own side as democracies, they include Putins Russia, and Putin has held himself forward as a leader of the Christian forces against Islamic terrorists. Marine Le Pen has openly proposed an alliance led by the troika of Putin, Trump, and herself. Putin has aided La Pens campaign, just as he intervened to help Trump defeat Clinton. As Josh Rogin reported recently, Trumps chief strategist Steve Bannon is interested in connecting the Trump apparatus to leaders of populist movements around the world, especially in Europe.

Since taking the oath of office, he delivered a dark speech, did a little work, and dined in the Capitol. The parade is next. The spectators had, earlier, trickled in along the route. Their numbers are steadily building, but the unbelievable crowds dont appear to have shown up. The tight security may have delayed some of the arrivals, as many faced long lines to get through the checkpoints. A source told CBS News that some of the VIPs didnt make it because the Congressional luncheon ran late and the Secret Service and D.C. Metro police barricaded five times as many streets as in the past, which prevented some people on Capitol Hill from making it to the route and getting to their seats. The atmosphere became more lively as the motorcade neared Pennsylvania Avenue. Crowds cheered Trump! Trump! Trump! as a black car drove very slowly toward the White House. Employees at Trump International Hotel, which is down the block from Trumps new home, got in on the action. But boos from the protesters sometimes punctured the celebratory shouts. President Trump and First Lady Melania exited the motorcade right near the Department of Justice building. They took a very short walk, pausing right before Trumps hotel. The Trumps waved at the crowd, and got right back into the car. Some boos also came from Trump supporters, who jeered the media as the reporting crews passed behind the president. A few blocks from the parade route, anti-Trump protesters gathered en masse. Protesters set a parked limo on fire, and police moved in with pepper spray and tried to disperse the crowds. The Trumps exited The Beast  the nickname of the presidential state car  once again before reaching the White House and exiting out on to the reviewing stand. From there, the president and his family got to watch the rest of the parade roll in, which included plenty of hometown bands and some tractors. Trump wanted tanks and missiles too, but the military denied that request. The VIP reviewing stand was pretty packed, though there were a few empty seats  because the parade ran overtime, some people reportedly cut out early to get ready for the Inaugural balls. The reviews of the people were mixed. President Trump called Inauguration Day unbelievable. His supporters remain as enthusiastic as ever.

Im going to play a little Donald tonight, he said, shaking two thumbs-ups in the air. The gesture was joke enough for the crowd, because no one hated Wayne Barrett as much as Donald Trump did. A few weeks before it was reissued in 2016, Trump: The Deals and the Downfall, Barretts extremely unauthorized 1992 book investigating Donald Trumps earliest Dumpster fires, was going for $150 per copy on Amazon. Last year, the basement of Barretts house in Windsor Terrace became a point of pilgrimage for reporters investigating the candidate. In a few months, more than 60 writers came through to flip through stacks of curled yellow legal pads piled into archive boxes, a body of research that began in 1979 with a two-part Village Voice cover story, Like Father, Like Son: Anatomy of a Young Power Broker. Wayne Barrett died on Thursday after a long battle with interstitial lung disease and lung cancer. He was Americas greatest living investigative reporter, in part because he rooted facts out like a hound but also because he unleashed those facts in a torrent of unflinching fortitude, making New Yorks most powerful people face the corruption of their own back rooms. In Wayne Barretts writing, you could always smell the disgust. Even at age 71, he always seemed to have more work ahead. Last night, his longtime friend and Voice colleague Tom Robbins wrote on Twitter, On the drive to the hospital where he breathed his last, Wayne Barrett was still doing interviews for a big, tough story on Donald Trump. He wrote a column for the Village Voice for 37 years. His books about Ed Koch, Rudolph Giuliani, and Donald Trump are unrelenting, thick with facts, portraits of villains accused, tried, and proven undoubtedly guilty by the last paragraph. His career can be best judged by the men who despised him: Giuliani, New York Citys most adversarial mayor; Roger Stone, the Republican Partys favorite double-crossing operative; Senator Al DAmato, a friend to mobsters and lobbyists alike. Talking politics with Wayne Barrett was like flipping through the index of New Yorks underbelly, his memory a truck-tire-size Rolodex of misdeeds, with pattern recognition coded to political networks. Wayne could play Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon with any political figure or corruption scheme of the past 40 years, constructing a web of bad guys out of his head. And they were almost always guys, hed say, smiling. It was a surprise, then, that he was passionately kind. He took in young journalists like a den mother, and sent them back out into the field as professional investigators. He readily shared his illustrious byline with his interns, one of whom was me. His rat pack of research assistants can be found at work around the globe: Matt Taibbi was a Barrett intern; so was William Bastone; Waynes protgs ran the Cambodia Daily for years. I have a degree from journalism school that taught me far less in four years than Wayne Barrett did in one. He sketched bad guys in language I knew only from comic books; scumbags and bagmen and crooked wiseguys. He would call into the office via speakerphone, his voice a rasp long before the lung disease set in, and he would eviscerate the scoundrels. A hero for Gotham, and remarkably, one who listened when New Yorkers called for help. Tips came into Waynes line at the Voice all day: someone whispering half a clue, You may want to look into how Reverend Al is actually spending that money, or telling a terrible story of stolen paychecks and a dirty boss. Waynes phone served as a citywide checks-and-balances system. He was an equal-opportunity exposer, relishing a story of widespread gubernatorial corruption as much as a takedown of one evil slumlord. After the deadlines had passed, Wayne would sit back and tell stories of what happens when you dig deep. In the mid-80s, when he was on the trail of a corrupt city-council member named Ramon Velez, the politician (who was a 300-pound man) tried to strangle him in Puerto Rico. Following Donald Trump around Atlantic City in 1991, Barrett was arrested, charged with defiant trespass, and chained by the arm to a cell mate who masturbated all night. Another time, when he came to question a few men in a parking garage, they held his face inches from the revved-up tire of a car because he was investigating their boss. Roger Stone, once a protg of Roy Cohn and now a Trump adviser, wrote this tweet after Wayne Barrett died: Wayne Barrett was a piece of human excrement posing as a human being. Rot in hell, you prick. In his memoir, Senator Al DAmato called Wayne a viper. He drove Donald Trump crazy. All the bad guys hated him, which is how you knew he was a hero. It is hard to imagine the Trump administration without Wayne to diagram the webs of corruption that bad guys (and theyre almost all guys) will undoubtedly knit behind closed doors. Just as the president-elect was perfecting a rhetoric that makes the truth feel obtuse, we lost a man steadfast about truth-telling. The man who so effectively got under Trumps skin departed just as we need to create that itch most."}, {"date": "2017/01/20", "title": "Trumps Speech Gave Us America the Ugly.

Today: Trumps inauguration.Many Americans surely held out hope, despite themselves, that Donald Trump wouldve used his inaugural address to accomplish what he could have done with his transition: demonstrate an understanding of the gravity of the office, allow suspicions of his campaign (and his associates) to be allayed by honest investigations, search for reconciliation with those who doubt him. The past few weeks have shown that Trump had different ideas for his transition. What do you think he achieved with this address? Not to put too fine a point on it, but in a word: Nothing. It was a recycled Trump campaign speech sporadically retrofitted with ersatz poetry (the windswept plains of Nebraska, yet) and boilerplate stabs at unity (We are one nation!) and inclusion (there is no room for prejudice), but otherwise characteristically nationalistic, populist, and apocalyptic in its view of America. According to our new president, our country is a Valhalla of rusted-out factories and schools that leave students deprived of all knowledge. The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes. Our communities are blighted by the crime and the gangs and the drugs. If you werent eager to take some of those drugs at the moment he was sworn in, you certainly were by the time his scowling account of America the Ugly was done. Earlier in the week, Trumps press spokesman, Sean Spicer, previewed the speech with a burst of ecstasy: It is a Trump draft. It is written by him. It is edited by him. We were treated to a photo of the president-elect posing with pad and Sharpie while penning his masterpiece, apparently (we were later to learn) while sitting at a concierges desk at Mar-a-Lago. There were some typical Trumpian declarations in the text (America will start winning again, winning like never before), but most of it was pure Stephen Bannon. The language was violent and angry  This American carnage stops right here  reeking of animosity, if not outright hatred, of the Establishment. The tone was one of retribution and revenge. The contempt for Washington, including the Republican Partys current leadership, was omnipresent: Its not just John Lewis but the many officeholders onstage during the inaugural ceremony who were condemned for being all talk and no action. Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell continue to live in a dreamland if they think their collaborationist accommodation of Trump will spare them from the auto-da-f. I guess I live in that proverbial bubble because, almost without exception, most people I know were determined not to watch today. They made the right call. Trump didnt attempt to win anyone over from what he calls the other side, even with disingenuous efforts. The inauguration boycotters also spared themselves the nauseating spectacle of network talking-heads mindlessly parroting the supposedly reassuring clichs of the hour (the peaceful transfer of power) and, at the stroke of noon, succumbing to the herd mentality of grading on a curve. On CNN, the historian Douglas Brinkley declared the inaugural address not only presidential but solid and well-written and the best speech Trump has made in his life. Trump ascends to the height of American power with a historically low approval rating from his fellow citizens and an administration largely staffed thus far  to the extent it has been staffed  by billionaires, strident ideologues, and incompetents. His kitchen cabinet is led by his son-in-law. He took the oath of office to a virtually monochromatic sea of white faces. His biggest political ally  and arguably the key clandestine player in his electoral victory  is a Russian strongman who could be found this week testifying that our new president did not avail himself of prostitutes when visiting Moscow but that if he had, he would have been serviced by women who are undoubtedly the best in the world. But you know all that. What stood out about Trumps inaugural address was his one bedrock conviction, the one core belief he never reverses  that the country he will now try to lead is an unmitigated disaster. The great task before us is to stop him from taking down with him all that remains good about America, before his reign comes to its inevitable bad end."}, {"date": "2017/01/20", "title": "The White House Website Removes Mentions of Climate Change", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/whitehouse-gov-removes-climate-change-and-lgbt-pages.html", "text": " Just as Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, the official White House website was updated with his portrait and his policies, which include many changes from what the site had said earlier this morning. Among the first changes noted was the elimination of all mentions of climate change and the posting of Trumps America First Energy Plan. The plan calls for rolling back regulations, including harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule. The Climate Action Plan was Barack Obamas set of policies aimed at combatting the causes of global warming. The plan further says President Trump will tap domestic energy sources while refocusing the EPA on its essential mission of protecting our air and water. Like Trumps energy plan, his foreign-policy page on WhiteHouse.gov is labeled America First. The page promises a foreign policy focused on American interests and American national security. That includes building more ships for the Navy while embracing diplomacy. Russia also gets a subtle shout-out. The websites sections on LGBT, civil rights, and health-care are nowhere to be found. That doesnt necessarily mean theyre never coming back though. The website for the Domestic Policy Council is also down and we know its going to live on in under Trump. Hes already appointed someone to lead it. Trump White House officials said more information will be added to the site in the coming day and weeks. The transition of the site is in progress as updates are made, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told the Huffington Post. Anyway, why speculate on what may be left off the site, when theres already so much bad stuff on it? For example, it declares the Trump administration a law-and-order administration, but misstates crime stats about Washington, D.C. The Standing Up for Our Law Enforcement Community section also says the Trump administration will end the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in America and casts dissenters as rioters, looters, and violent disruptors. Bios for Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence, and their wives have also been added to the site. Those for the Pences and the First Lady are standard fare, although Melania Trumps bio does promote her jewelry line by name. Trumps, on the other hand, is a bit much.

The inaugural festivities began this morning, with then-President-elect Trump and then-President Barack Obama driving together to the Capitol for the swearing-in. They got into the motorcade for the short ride to the ceremony. Obama left the White House as commander-in-chief for the very last time. Obama aide Valerie Jarrett even turned out (some) of the lights: The motorcade is on its way! The Obamas greeted Trump and his wife, Melania, at the White House to have a little coffee/tea before the main event. Melania also gave Michelle a gift from one of their local neighborhood businesses: As Washington waited for the Trumps and Obamas to arrive, the inauguration guests arrived at the Capitol. Some were probably thrilled: Others probably imagined the day a little differently: As anti-Trump protests rage in D.C., the crowd appears to be pretty sparse in the back of the Mall. Which led to a few visual comparisons to Obamas historic 2009 inauguration. The numbers also confirm that the turnout wasnt as unbelievable, perhaps record-setting as Trump had suggested: Waiting for the ceremony to begin: Getting closer: Obama and Vice-President Joe Biden walk out onto the dais: Cheers of Trump! Trump! Trump! boomed briefly from the crowd as the president-elect prepared for his entrance: Ladies and Gentlemen, the president-elect of the United States, Donald John Trump. Missouri Senator Roy Blunt delivers introductory remarks. New Yorks Cardinal Timothy Dolan prays for us. Senator Chuck Schumer, in his address, reads a letter of Union solider Sullivan Ballou, an acknowledgment of the countrys divisions, and a call to greater unity. Vice-President-elect Michael Richard Pence becomes Vice-President Pence. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas administers the oath of office. Donald John Trump is sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. Cheers, trumpets, and the blast of cannons. And the peaceful transfer of the Twitter account: Protesters, close to the stage and wearing shirts that spelled out RESIST, tried to interrupt the oath. Authorities quickly intervened. They shouted USA! USA! as they were pulled away from the area, says the Washington Post. Here comes the speech. And the rain. Daily Intelligencer will have more coverage and analysis on Trumps inaugural address throughout the day. In his speech, he pledged a new vision for America. He vowed to make America great again, and safe again, and wealthy again  campaign promises that are now those of the president. His picture of America was also one borrowed from the trail, an ominous one of rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; of the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives. This American carnage, Trump said, stops right here and stops right now. A salve to a divided nation it was not. Though unity, he said, would make America unstoppable. Trump lambasted a sizable chunk of his guests. He repeated his campaign promise: America First. America will start winning again, Trump vowed. Winning like never before. Together we will make America great again, Trump said, signing off. And then, it was really time to say farewell to the Obamas: The former president delivered some final remarks at Andrews Air Force Base, before heading out to his California vacation. Michelle and I, weve really been milking this good-bye thing, he joked. So it behooves me to be very brief. Meanwhile, Trump got his hands back on a phone. The new president also got to work. One of the first orders of business: Signing the waiver so General James Mattis can serve as the Secretary of Defense. Also, giving America a holiday we totally dont have already. He also started learning a little about the Trump administration, which he picked. Inauguration attendees, lawmakers, and the person who once thought she might be the guest of honor gathered in the Capitol for the inaugural luncheon. Senator Schumer unveiled Trumps official inauguration photo. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan toasted Pence. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell toasted Trump. Trump honored and applauded Hillary Clinton. Honestly, theres nothing more I can say because I have a lot of respect for those two people, Trump said about his opponent and former President Bill Clinton. The Trump era starts. Now-ish. This is a breaking-news post, and will be continuously updated."}, {"date": "2017/01/20", "title": "Trumps Dark, Weird, Inaugural Campaign Speech", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trumps-dark-weird-inaugural-campaign-speech.html", "text": " Those familiar with Donald Trumps inaugural address before he delivered it advised us it would be Jacksonian. By that I suppose they meant belligerent, nationalist, and populist. But if you look at the address Andrew Jackson himself delivered at his first inauguration, after a bitter campaign, it could not have been more different. Heres how Jackson referred to his predecessors in office (including the man he defeated, John Quincy Adams): Trump began (after a brief thank-you to Barack Obama for cooperating during the transition) by attacking all his recent predecessors, as, well, self-interested betrayers of the public trust: That set the tone for his address, an angry screed of a campaign speech. Ive been watching and listening to inaugural addresses since John F. Kennedys, in 1960. Ive never heard anything like this one in terms of its divisive content and complete lack of uplift. Even its call for the blessings of the Almighty was to a nationalist God Trump seemed to be charging with protecting the country  if and only if our military and police forces failed. And absent any admission of his own fallibility, his appeal to unity sounded more like a threat of repression than a call for mutual understanding and bipartisanship. He accused Washington of deliberately abandoning factories and their workers, deliberately robbing Americans of their income and wantonly spending it on foreign countries, and deliberately refusing to hear the cries of an aggrieved, impoverished, and powerless citizenry. And having painted this dark picture of a horrific status quo, he proceeded to set out literally impossible goals for his own presidency. The American carnage of crime and gangs and drugs stops right here and stops right now. Really? And as for radical Islamic terrorism? He plainly promised that we will eradicate [it] from the face of the Earth. Seriously. And: We will bring back our jobs  our borders  our wealth. Gee, will the rest of the world cooperate to make that happen? By the time Trump got to the climax of the address, a secular doxology of the national greatness he would achieve (wealthy! strong! safe!), the hope of so many people, especially those who fear him, that the 45th president would rise to the moment and make a graceful, civic-minded speech, had long been dashed. Trump can, of course, eventually transcend this moment. But it was an ominous beginning for a presidency that was so hard to envision as normal, and that made Old Hickory look like a prophet of peace."}, {"date": "2017/01/20", "title": "The System Has Failed and a Con Artist Has Won", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/the-system-has-failed-and-a-con-artist-has-won.html", "text": " This guy is a con artist. Hes always making things up. No one holds him accountable for it. Marco Rubio Its called a confidence game. Why? Because you give me your confidence? No. Because I give you mine. House of Games Presidential inaugurations are occasion for repeating certain pieties. As Thanksgiving is to gratitude, and New Years for hope, the quadrennial 20th of January is for paeans to the peaceful transfer of power. But Donald Trumps inauguration is not evidence the system worked. Trump is president because the system failed. Barack Obama governed wisely and honestly, and presided over peace and prosperity, and was rewarded with an approval rating of 60 percent. He is being replaced by a swindler who has been consistently opposed by a clear majority of the public. This happened because of a combination of oddities and systemic abuses: an Electoral College system that allows the second-place candidate to win if his supporters happen to be distributed more optimally; the dramatic intervention of the FBI on behalf of the Republican challenger; the Twenty-second Amendment, which prevents the popular incumbent from running again. All these factors in combination have produced a dramatic transfer of power from a president who has the support of a clear majority of the country to one who does not. Conservatives have made a series of attempts to convey democratic legitimacy upon Trump by depicting him as a tribune of the People rather than the elites. Progressives are doing Mr. Trump the great favor of displaying their contempt for not only him but his voters, writes conservative apparatchik Heather Higgins in The Wall Street Journal, in a typical example of this kind of doggerel. That will make it easier for him to be the Peoples President. The more successful he is, the more the left will try to distract with attacks on him and his legitimacy. The system did work in the most minimal fashion. Power was transferred nonviolently in accordance with the law, and the result was openly accepted by the opposing candidate and the incumbent president. But this small comfort is smaller than it might appear. Trump has consistently expressed the belief that a process that does not end in his chosen fashion is illegitimate. When it appeared briefly in 2012 that Obama would lose the popular vote while winning reelection, he called for revolt. When he lost primaries to other Republicans, he called them rigged. He invented voting-fraud conspiracies in the fall, telling wild lies about millions of fraudulent votes for his opponent. The system appears to be working because the candidate who refuses to accept defeat was not defeated. But this merely postpones rather than answers the test of American democracy. In his presidential announcement speech in 2015, Trump hired actors to pretend to be supporters, and then, characteristically, refused to pay them. He boasted this week that he was writing his inauguration speech, even displaying a photo of himself purportedly working in Mar-a-Lago. (In a touch that could have come straight from a David Mamet film, the backdrop to Trumps speechwriting scene turns out to be a corridor, the desk belongs to an administrative staffer.) Trump is a con artist, and a very good one. It requires enormous talent of a kind to successfully identify and exploit new marks, for decades, without their catching on to you. Constantly luring new contractors, partners, and customers to place their faith in Trump so he can exploit them is a difficult ruse to sustain. The gall of Trumps populism is astonishing. For too long, a small group in our nations capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost, he announced, shamelessly. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered, but the jobs left and the factories closed. This from the first president in decades to refuse to disclose his tax returns, and the first in centuries to use the presidency to enrich himself and his family! The presidency raises the stakes of Trumps con game to a completely new level. In his inaugural address, Trump declared his fealty to the People, promising to unleash untold wealth to them that was being held by elites in Washington and by foreigners. We will bring back our jobs, he said. We will bring back our wealth. He promised to quash crime and eradicate Islamic terrorism from the face of the Earth. The grandiosity of these promises is necessary to get even the minority of the electorate that can tolerate Trump to overlook his overt grossness and corruption. The methods of a skilled con artist have worked just barely well enough to deliver the presidency to Trump. But what happens when his grandiose promises fail to materialize? And when the aspects of his program that he never mentioned in his speech  tax cuts for the rich, stripping away health insurance from millions, massive graft  do take place? A con artist who always escaped his old victims and found new ones has reached the maximal limits of his strategy. What happens when the marks are demanding that the promises he made be redeemed, and there is nowhere for him to go, and he commands the powers of the state?"}, {"date": "2017/01/20", "title": "Anti-Trump Protesters and Police Clash in the Streets As Trump Is Sworn In", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/anti-trump-protesters-and-police-clash-in-the-streets.html", "text": " Protesters clogged the streets of Washington, D.C., early Friday morning in an attempt to block access to the National Mall.

The latter functioned both as a protest and a dance party where protesters were waving rainbow flags, blasting music, dancing, waving homemade signs, and sprinkling glitter in their wake, ThinkProgress reports. Daily Intelligencer captured some of the action: Protesters and Trump supporters appeared to remain largely civil. There were exceptions though, including one top-hat-related altercation. Some chained themselves together in front of Trump supporters including Ohios Michael Henning, who told the Washington Post that hed be happy if they just dropped a bomb on the demonstrators. As the morning went on and the National Mall filled with those prepared to celebrate, protests in the streets around the Capitol intensified. At around 10:30, the Post reports, crowds dressed in black, with their faces covered, began smashing windows and throwing garbage cans into the streets. At one point, a Starbucks full of employees and customers had its windows broken. The Bank of America next door suffered the same fate. Branches of Wells Fargo and United Banks were also smashed, along with a McDonalds and various car windows. Reporters on the street amid the protests said these actions drew a swift response from police, who pepper-sprayed protesters and set off flash-bang grenades while pushing everyone together into a group. The group was then detained as media and others not involved in the protest were moved behind police tape. Eventually, police began leading protesters away in zip ties. One, however, was taken away on a stretcher."}, {"date": "2017/01/20", "title": "How Obama Changed Perceptions of Black Americans Around the World", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/what-obama-meant-to-me-as-a-black-american-expat.html", "text": " If so-and-so wins, Im leaving the country, is often what you hear after an election. A hollowed refrain, rarely followed up on, and Canada is probably the better for it. But five months after January 20, 2009  a day as frigid as an angry mothers stare, when I stood on the Washington Mall amid the warmth of a million other people, questioning Ms. Aretha Franklins hat choice and watching our first black president put his hand on the Lincoln Bible, holding my breath when the Chief Justice made a minor flub  I did, in fact, leave the country. I left not because I feared what Obama would do to America, but because America had a new visual power to show to the world, and miraculously, he resembled me. The impact of that can never be stressed enough. In my earlier travels, in many places their only exposure to black Americans was sports, music, or movie stars on TV. But once President Obama was elected, the canvas widened; I wanted to see just how far the new landscape might extend. I moved to China in 2009 for two art residencies and decided to stay. Many of my Chinese friends felt optimistic about President Obama. He represented the unimaginable, and infinite possibilities, something not always felt in their land of Communist Party strong control. Though Id always been warned (in a racist way) about how racist the Chinese are, I never experienced that while in China. It seemed to be based more on a perception (also racist) in the States about Chinese people. Rather than hearing screams of Will Smith, as had often happened in my earlier travels, now Id hear Obama tossed at me, with a welcoming smile and an accompanying peace or thumbs-up sign. That was change. When President Obama visited Fudan University in Shanghai in November 2009, many Chinese were surprised that he took questions from the students. The notion of a town-hall meeting was completely foreign to them. No one questions the president. Do all American presidents do this or is it just because he is Obama? a friend asked. Yes, they all do, I said, Just not as well. Yes. He is cool. Yes. At one point, during the bustle of an apartment move, I lost my passport. I had to go to the U.S. embassy to report it and apply for a replacement. On the grounds, a Jeff Koons Tulips is forever in bloom. Hundreds of Chinese citizens were standing in line, hoping for a visa, the prospect of America. Citizens are quickly ushered through. After clearing security, I saw a large photograph of President Obama. I knew all of those waiting to get in would see it, too. Its a small thing, but it pleased me. But some things hadnt changed, despite Obama, when it came to being a black American living abroad. Even after years out of this country, I never came to consider myself a Westerner or an expat. I realized those terms, regardless of who was in the seat of power back home, still meant white, both to foreigners and to my fellow countrymen. Many times while in Beijing, I questioned whether I was becoming racist. Not toward the Chinese, but toward white Americans. In America, or the West in general, I know the history, how to navigate our stained story, of which I am a part. That was not so easily done thousands of miles away. Many white Americans abroad might have taken pride in having Obama as their president in a way that they didnt with Bush II and wont with Trump I. But often, whether passing me on the street or sitting on a bar stool next to me, those same white Americans went out of their way not to see me, which, in a city of 21 million Chinese people, was hard to do. Black people, from any country, always gave a passing nod, an acknowledgement that we are few, in a foreign place. The nod says, I see you. When it came to white Americans, I often felt as if my presence irritated them. I snapped them out of their pure, exotic experience with China, because as a black American, I was exotic too, just in the wrong locale. When in foreign lands, I was always aware that I was representing my country, blackness, and, in that, perhaps, even my president. I wasnt the most powerful man in the world, but I, too, was a visual. But white people didnt seem to feel the need to represent anything. History told them, no matter where, they could just be. When President Xi Jinping came into power in 2013, there was a feeling among many Chinese that Obamas presence on the world stage would encourage the new Communist Party leader to loosen the governmental leash. He did not. After four-and-a-half years, I knew it was time to leave. Id gone to Tunisia to work on an art project shortly after the Jasmine Revolution, which began when a fruit vendor set himself on fire after being humiliated by police, and kicked off the Arab Spring. There was a sense of great possibility in Tunis, even levity. Theyd overthrown their president and were getting their first glimpse of freedom. Id met some artists and through them I secured an art residency. There are very few Americans in this North African country of 11 million, nestled between Algeria and Libya. Unlike the Chinese, who tend to curb their talk of politics, the Tunisians, now free, were quick to speak. Eventually, a friend told me everyone in the village I lived in, El Marsa, just north of downtown, thought I was a spy. Why else, of all places, would a black American decide to come to Tunisia? I had been in China. Check. Now Tunisia. Check. Black president. Check. Spy. Often, when it pertains to blackness there has to be a reason why you are in a certain place, which has little to do with me, or even our president. Its because of how we are all initially viewed. Suspect. Yet ironically, my blackness also kept me safe in Tunis in some ways. Tunisians were not very happy with American policies toward North Africa and the Middle East. The war in Syria and the conflict in neighboring Libya had a direct impact on their lives. Though everyone now had to walk through airport-like security simply to enter the nearest supermarket, I never felt any anti-American sentiment toward me. Because you are black, said a friend. At the same time my Americanness spared me much of the racism that other blacks in Tunisia felt every day. Despite living in a North African country, many Tunisians didnt consider themselves African, because African means black. We are racist, yes, more than ever because more blacks  from countries like Ivory Coast and Nigeria  are coming in, a Tunisian friend told me. But it is different for you here. You are American. There was nothing President Obama could do to change perceptions like that, just as it was becoming clear that there was little he could do to change many Americans fraudulent parsing of his identity. America is a young and hopeful nation. For many places, steeped in centuries of cultural norms and the mental toll rooted therein, hope seems nave. I could be down to my last pack of ramen noodles, not knowing when the next would come, but when things werent going well for my friends in China or Tunisia, Id try to encourage them by saying, Itll work out. In response, theyd often look at me, eyes clearly saying, like three pitying pats on the shoulder, Oh, you Americans and your hope. In those moments, even I had to recognize my American entitlement. I returned to New York six months ago with the same two duffel bags Id left with seven years ago. I was pleased to be home and curious about the ongoing political changes in America. Like many people, I was disheartened by the results of November 8. And like many people, I was not surprised. Once it jelled, I felt what was almost a sense of freedom: familiar and foreign simultaneously. When you are Other, you just go about the business of moving forward. Its those, for the first time, realizing they are Other, and trying to figure out where they belong now who are more likely to be shocked by what is clearly a hard transition. Visuals do matter, whether here or abroad, and President Obama was a strong visual. After the election, a Tunisian friend sent me an SMS: Americans are amazing. They can elect a black as easily as they can an orange."}, {"date": "2017/01/20", "title": "Fear Not, America: Davos Thinks President Trump Is Going to Be Just Fine", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/fear-not-america-davos-thinks-trump-is-going-to-be-fine.html", "text": " This morning, Americas top military officers showed Donald Trump how to launch a nuclear missile. By this afternoon, he will have the authority to fire the whole arsenal. If you had told the conscious capitalists who assembled in Davos one year ago today, that Trump would not only maintain his lead in the GOP primary polls, but win the Republican nomination, and then the presidency  while pledging to bring back confiscatory tariffs, abandon NATO, and take on the cabal of international bankers who had robbed our working class  most would have considered your tale a perfect, if unrealistic, horror story. After all, nearly everyone at last years World Economic Forum supported Hillary Clinton or a mainstream Republican, and viewed Trumps campaign as little more than a filthy joke. But now that the joke has turned deadly serious, the global economic elite is learning to stop worrying and love right-wing populism  or, at least, the pecuniary opportunities that Trumps brand of it presents. Per Bloomberg: True, even those who smile on Trumps supply-side approach to working-class uplift have lingering concerns about the  quirks  of the moguls persona. But according to the plutocrats who spoke with Quartz, the presidency is likely to bring out the real, sober Donald Trump. There are two Donalds  the one that you see in private, and the one you see in public, Ross Perot Jr., the Texas billionaire, assured the news site. (The Donald you see in private has been accused of having little-to-no attention span, verbally abusing his subordinates, and serial sexual assault.) And even if the incoming president continues to behave recklessly, some Davos attendees see ways to monetize that recklessness. Hes pontificated a lot on what deals he thinks should go through and should not go through, Canyon Capital Advisers co-CEO Mitch Julis told Bloomberg Television, referring to Trumps habit of swinging the stock market by opining about various corporate mergers and government contracts, over cocktails or on Twitter. So arb spreads are one area where you can actually lay bets, he explains, referring to trades that harness the discrepancy between a shares offer price and its current value. Much of the Davos set is even making their peace with Trumps rejection of globalism. The basic message is to be more national, dont just be global, Richard Edelman, CEO of the communications marketing firm Edelman, told Reuters. Lets try and pre-empt that tweet by having a long-term discussion about the supply chain. General Motors echoed that message at the WEF Tuesday, when it announced that it would add nearly 2,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs, because it wants to build where we sell. Granted, GMs expansion seems to have been planned well before Trumps election. But that just goes to show how painless the transition to an America first corporate strategy will be. Meanwhile, some service-sector enterprises see an upside to rising nationalism. The irony is that when more walls show up it is a good opportunity for services companies to help do business across those walls, Vishal Sikka, chief executive of Infosys, an IT services company, told Reuters. Still, not all Davos attendees have recovered from their Trump-phobia. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers told Bloomberg Television that he was very troubled by the mood on Magic Mountain. People who, two, three months ago, were saying he was a man theyd never do business with, are today hailing him as a great economic statesman, he said. I see a very disturbing tendency to enable whatever the instinct of this new administration is. Thats something that over time the business community may very much come to regret. But for the now, the view at the top is mostly sanguine: Its the end of the world as weve known it  and the cabal of international bankers feels fine."}, {"date": "2017/01/20", "title": "A Subway Fare Hike Is Likely Coming Soon", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/a-subway-fare-hike-is-likely-coming-soon.html", "text": " Its that time again: Subway-fare hikes are coming.

On numerous occasions, Trump has laid out exactly what he plans to do on his first day as president. The problem is it would be impossible for him to fulfill all of these campaign promises immediately after taking office, even if he were to skip the pomp of inauguration day and immediately head to the Oval Office. Trump, like many presidential candidates, was fond of promising to take various actions on Day One, but during the campaign he used the phrase far too liberally. By September, Hillary Clinton had promised to undertake three tasks on her first day in office, while Trump had pledged to take on 21, according to Mother Jones. This included designating China as a currency manipulator, abolishing gun-free zones, announcing the renegotiation of NAFTA, announcing the U.S. withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, fixing the Department of Veterans Affairs, directing his generals to come up with a new plan to defeat ISIS, beginning work on his southern border wall, and repealing all of Obamas unconstitutional executive orders. In October, Trump unveiled a more organized plan for his first 100 days during a speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Trumps Contract with the American Voter lists 18 actions he will take on day one, including starting work on selecting a new Supreme Court justice, beginning the removal of more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants, and suspending immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. After the election, Trump shared a much shorter list of executive actions we can take on Day One in a YouTube video. Suddenly, ordering the development of a plan to protect Americas vital infrastructure from cyberattacks, and all other form of attacks was a day-one priority. Now that Trump can finally start acting on those promises, he and his team have offered conflicting definitions of what Day One really means. Earlier this month, Vice President-elect Mike Pence said Trumps executive actions would literally begin on Day One. But the president-elect said this week that he considers Monday the first day of his presidency. Incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer tried to find a happy medium. He is committed to not just Day One, but Day Two, Day Three, of enacting an agenda of real change, Spicer said on Thursday. And I think that youre going to see that in the days and weeks to come. Spicer said that Trump would only sign four or five executive actions on Friday, mainly having to do with administrative tasks like formally nominating cabinet secretaries and establishing a presidential records policy. But at a luncheon in his Washington, D.C. hotel on Thursday, Trump proclaimed, We will be signing some papers that will be very meaningful tomorrow right after the speech to get the show going. The Trump team has been tight-lipped about what actions hell take in the first days of his presidency, but theyve dropped a few hints. Spicer said repealing Obamacare, immigration, and battling ISIS are key issues likely to come up sooner rather than later. He also said he thinks renegotiating NAFTA and pulling out of TPP will happen very shortly. Trump advisors told the Washington Post that his focus during his first days in office will be reversing policies implemented by Obama rather than enacting his own vision. They said that includes rolling back regulations, including those that restrict energy production, and undoing parts of Obamacare. The strategy for repealing Obamacare is expected to be hashed out more fully when Trump and Pence attend the GOP retreat in Philadelphia late next week. One health-related policy is likely to be reversed before that. The Mexico City policy, which prevents groups receiving U.S. foreign aid from performing or promoting abortion services, has been reinstated or repealed by each new president since it was implemented by Ronald Reagan. On immigration, Reuters reports that Trump is expected to sign executive actions to begin the construction of a southern border wall and limit Latin American asylum-seekers from entering the country. As for the undocumented immigrants already here, Trump is expected to direct the government to deport the 2 million with criminal records. But there probably wont be any immediate effort to round up those brought to the country illegally as children. Sources close to the transition said Trump would rescind Obamas Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, letting the two-year authorizations that allowed more than 700,000 people to stay in the country expire. Trump said in his Times of London interview this week that he will ban immigration from nations that have lots of terrorism problems during his first days in office, and promised that there will be extreme vetting. He suggested that could include parts of Europe. We dont want people coming in from Syria who we dont know who they are, he said. You know theres no way of vetting these people. I dont want to do what Germany did. Changes that now appear less likely in the early days of the Trump administration are labeling China a currency manipulator (an issue Trump cabinet nominees said theyd have to study), and dismantling the Iran nuclear deal. According to Foreign Policy, the Trump team is looking at ways to undermine the deal without scrapping it entirely. While Spicer indicated that Trumps schedule for enacting various policy measures is still in flux, its safe to assume that like his predecessors, hell try to unilaterally enact several bold measures in the coming days to show he wont be slowed by the usual Washington gridlock. Id say to America, Buckle your seat belt. This is going to be a very quick start out of the gate, Representative Chris Collins, a member of Trumps transition, told McClatchy. Its going to be fast-paced. Mr. Trump is not someone to dillydally."}, {"date": "2017/01/20", "title": "Watch: Anti-Trump Protesters Clash With Police a Day Before Trumps Inauguration", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/an-anti-trump-protest-escalated-outside-the-deploraball.html", "text": "  Dont worry.

He is, after all, an Oklahoma attorney general who has helped mobilize other Republican AGs to sue EPA 14 times, mostly because he thinks EPA has exceeded its statutory authority in displacing the states as regulators of fossil fuel and agricultural industries. But as is the case with many conservative states rights enthusiasts, its an open question as to whether Pruitts determination to let states go their own way will extend to those who prefer tougher regulations than the feds require. The answer to that question was by no means resolved by Pruitts confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. The flashpoint for Democratic senators questioning Pruitt was whether he intended to renew the decades-old EPA waiver that has allowed California  followed by 13 other states  to impose more stringent emissions standards on automobiles sold in the Golden State. Californias leadership on this issue, which has had the effect of forcing major pollution-reducing technologies into the national assembly lines of automakers, actually predates EPA (and the Clean Air Act) itself and can be traced back to the smog crisis in California cities in the 1960s. The states ability to exceed national standards in this area really came into question after California enacted a plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles in 2004. The Bush administration actually denied Sacramento a waiver for this purpose in 2008, but fortunately for California policymakers, the new Obama administration gave them and their counterparts in other states a green light in 2009. What will EPA do now with Californias annual request to extend that waiver, and more importantly, what will its general posture be toward states that want to be more aggressive than the Trump administration about climate change and other environmental challenges? Pruitt did nothing at his hearing to assuage state concerns. Given Pruitts coziness with the fossil-fuel industry and its advocates in the past, environmentalists are not optimistic about where EPA will land on this subject. But beyond the urgent issue of automobiles and climate change, how Pruitts EPA deals with states that want to do things the GOPs business constituencies dont like is part of the broader question as to whether blue states can survive the Trump administration by going their own way and taking advantage of the Republican Partys often-stated commitment to federalism. If Trumps federal regulators take a hard line against state regulators, then national political change may become the only option for those Americans who (knowingly or not) prefer policies significantly different from those of the regime that takes power in Washington on Friday."}, {"date": "2017/01/19", "title": "New York Draws 10 National Magazine Award Nominations", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/new-york-leads-magazine-award-nominations-with-10.html", "text": " The American Society of Magazine Editors has nominated New York for 10 Ellie awards this year, including in the top categories of Magazine of the Year and General Excellence.

It seems like as good a time as ever to roast him. But first, the tan suit. It was Easter Sunday in 2014 and President Barack Obama was photographed both entering and leaving church wearing a tan suit. To some, this was seen as the opposite of presidential  mainly by those who pride themselves in the heralded tradition of sartorial unexceptionalism  to others, the truest proof that our president was one of the flyest men the United States of America has ever seen. Both camps were wrong. On this day, after six years in the White House, Barack Obama, husband of Michelle, father of Natasha and Malia, finally did something cool. I say this, because Barack Obama is not cool. You think Barack Obama is cool, because hes cool for someone who is president of the United States. You think hes cool, the same way it is said that black people are cool. Thats also not true, its just that the extraordinary black people you know of are often cool, compared to all the other people that you actually know, who are not. This seems annoyingly contrarian, but trust me when I say Im correct. This isnt a theory, it is a fact. Yes, there is a corner of the internet dedicated to the coolness of Barack Obama  youve read it, youve shared it, you may have even helped add to it. Oh, how numerous are the lists and slideshows. You know the greatest hits, we all do. The mic drop. The jump shots. The fist bumps. Between Two Ferns and Slow Jam the News. The Spotify playlists. These were all very cool things, timeless moments, and things that further made all of us, myself included, love Barack Obama. And they are moments that made his victory lap and this final day even more sobering, with the understanding that were never going to see this again. But dont get it wrong  even at their most candid, these are all productions, starring Barack Obama. The White House between 2008 and 2016 has been one of the greatest creative agencies in the history of the world. But the same way Nikes are simply Reeboks in the right hands, Barack Obama is just a really smart black dad that can be molded like clay to be anything he needs to be. Anything. Some hard truths: Barack Obama loves to dance, but Barack Obama cannot dance. Barack Obama loves to sing, but Barack Obama cannot sing. Basketball? Dont even start with me. The Barack Obama non-suit casual collection? God save the Republic. Which brings us back to that magical moment with the Easter suit. There is no collection of experts on this Earth that could make Barack Obama rock the Easter suit better than he did on that Sunday. For once, this was all Barack. The ultimate proof of this was when he wore a tan suit a second time. You see, this was not cool. He looked basically the same, but it was not the same. This was the Easter suit is a hit, do it again  that unexpected No. 1 single, followed by a second song that tries to ride the wave by sounding exactly like the first. He looked cool, but tan suit round two was just another reminder of my favorite truth: that Barack Obama is not cool. This may sound like an unnecessary pile on in these terrifying final hours, but theres actually a gigantic compliment hiding in this. Saying Barack Obama is cool diminishes all that he actually is. Whats true: Barack Obama is one of the most capable public figures that the United States has ever seen. In some ways, he is the greatest actor of the past eight years. He can bury himself in a role like Daniel Day-Lewis. He can orate and inspire like Martin Luther King Jr. He can ease a crowd with a laugh and a smile like Denzel Washington. He can nerd out like Neil deGrasse Tyson. And when he wants to, he can strut like Jeff Goldblum struts at the end of Independence Day. Hes Harvey Dent  you know, before the gasoline. Hes what we all want to be: good at everything. Youre warned throughout life of the risks of being a jack-of-all-trades, master of none, and the advice is sound. But then you see Obama, a true outlier  someone who is a master of all trades, the end. And in that, you briefly convince yourself that you were cheated out of a life path, that you could have been like Barack Obama if properly steered in that direction. But you couldnt. None of us could. Only Barack Obama would have come out on the other side of these eight years, not just in one piece, but still thought of as cool  or perhaps cooler. Years ago, I sat in a room with him, as Air Force One began its descent into Selma, Alabama. It was a turbulent landing, with everyone seated in the room bouncing around while securing the items on the table so they didnt slide off. One member of his detail clutched the presidents things, while another clutched the president. All while this is happening  a chaotic moment in my eyes  Barack Obama continued answering a question from New York Times columnist Charles Blow. While the rest of us looked like bobbleheads, Obamas still body and unflappable concentration seemed to exist in a different plane. Not only did he continue answering the complex, multipart question, but when we landed  the unofficial moment for question time to end  he said he needed a few more minutes, because he wasnt finished answering Blow. So he finished. And then he walked out. And less than two hours later, he delivered a speech on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, commemorating the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday. This sounds like yet another story clearly outlining how fly Barack Obama is, but its not. Because Barack Obama is not cool. Barack Obama is fucking remarkable."}, {"date": "2017/01/19", "title": "U.S. Strikes ISIS Camps in Libya, Killing 80 Militants", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/u-s-strikes-isis-camps-in-libya-killing-80-militants.html", "text": " Dozens of ISIS fighters are dead after President Obama authorized B-2 bombers to strike two training camps in the Libyan desert late Wednesday night, in what was likely Obamas final act as commander-in-chief. The 80 militants killed at the camp were actively plotting operations in Europe and may also have been connected to attacks that have already occurred in Europe, Defense Secretary Ash Carter told reporters Thursday. Carter added that the fighters were on the run from the coastal city of Sirte, a former ISIS stronghold that was taken back after a five-month campaign that ended in December. CNN reports that the U.S. surveillance aircraft have spent weeks monitoring the camps, which were about 28 miles southwest of Sirte. Despite retreating to a remote part of the desert, the fighters remained clearly visible because they were out in the open. The airstrikes began with 108 precision-guided bombs dropped from B-2 aircraft that took off from Missouri. Those were followed by Hellfire missiles launched by unmanned drones. The assault was undertaken at the request of Libyas Government of National Accord, the U.N.-backed government hoping to rule the country, Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook said. And to demonstrate that the target was what he said it was, Cook showed reporters video of men, described as ISIS members, moving weapons in the area where the bombs were dropped. This certainly dealt a significant blow to ISILs presence in Libya, Cook said. Was it a death knell for them in Libya?

Tam, a lawsuit stemming from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Offices decision to deny an Asian-American rock bands request to register its name, the Slants. The name may be disparaging, USPTO said, and would therefore violate the Lanham Act of 1946. Band founder Simon Tam argued to the contrary. Hes reclaiming the name for Asian-Americans, he said. The case has received far more attention for the Slants than a band billing itself as Chinatown Dance Rock would ever expect and thats because of its implications for the Washington Redskins. In 2014, the NFL teams trademark was revoked under the Lanham Act. At the time, USPTO said the teams name is disparaging to Native Americans, making it against federal law. Should the court rule in favor of the Slants, the Redskins would keep their trademark. If the decision swings the other way, the team would lose  meaning that while they could retain their name, it would be more vulnerable to copycats. The team, unsurprisingly, disagrees. Owner Daniel Snyder has argued that the name celebrates, rather than denigrates Native Americans, and in an amicus brief filed with the court, the team made the same argument the band is putting forward: The anti-disparagement clause of the Lanham Act runs afoul of the First Amendment. According to several reports from the Supreme Court yesterday, justices appeared to side with the Slants. Justice Elena Kagan, for one, argued that allowing positive speech in trademarks and banning negative is a fairly classic case of viewpoint discrimination, which is unconstitutional. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg raised the issue of intent and asked, Does it not count at all that everyone knows that the Slants [are] using this term not at all to disparage, but simply to describe? Deputy solicitor general Malcolm Stewart argued that the Slants can call themselves whatever they want, but the government doesnt have to endorse it by granting a trademark. Justices pointed out that copyright law has no such restrictions and bristled at the laws uneven application. Referring to lists of phrases that have been granted and rejected for trademarks, Justice Ginsburg noted that the word heeb appeared on both sides. But the justices werent fully onboard with the anything-goes argument made by the bands lawyer either. You want us to say that trademark law is just like a public park  the public park, a public forum, the classic example of where you can say anything you want? Justice Anthony Kennedy asked. The Slants lawyer said yes. Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed out that some restrictions are necessary. She asked the Slants lawyer if someone trademarked the phrase Trump is a thief and it was later ruled libelous, would the trademark still be valid? He said yes. That makes no sense, she shot back. In the end, it appeared as if the justices were cold to the idea that the trademark office should be deciding what is and is not disparaging. But they also did not believe that the office should rubber-stamp every phrase put in front of it. A final ruling on the case will arrive in June, but those watching closely Wednesday seem to think that court will side with the Slants, and by extension, the Redskins."}, {"date": "2017/01/19", "title": "Mnuchins Hearing Sparks Arguments About Tax Havens, Foreclosures, and Valium", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/mnuchins-hearing-sparks-arguments-about-tax-havens-valium.html", "text": " On Thursday, the Senate Finance Committee held a confirmation hearing for our populist president-elects pick for Treasury Secretary: A multimillionaire whose rsum includes a diploma from Yale, several years at Goldman Sachs, a stint running a bank that specialized in foreclosures, and experience running a Cayman Islandsbased hedge fund that was named after the sand dunes outside his house in the Hamptons. Steven Mnuchin neglected to mention that last enterprise in the financial-disclosure form he submitted shortly after his nomination last year. And, as one might lose track of spare change left in an old coat pocket, Mnuchin also forgot all about the $95 million in real-estate assets that hed left lying across the North American continent. So, the Democratic members of the Finance Committee had a lot of material to work with on Thursday. And Oregon senator Ron Wyden had his indignation level set to 11 from the very start. After decrying the truly disgusting inequity and abuse of Americas tax laws, Wyden declared. Theres no clearer example than Mr. Mnuchins hedge fund setting up outposts in Anguilla and the Cayman Islands, an action that can be explained only by the islands zero percent tax rate  Millions of dollars in profits from Hollywood exports like the movie Avatar were funneled to an offshore web of entities and investors. Wyden went on to savage Mnuchins use of a dynasty trust to shield tens of millions of dollars from taxes, as well as his funding of a tax-exempt foundation that pushed for the the approval of a bank merger he stood to profit from. Mnuchin argued that his decision to incorporate Dune Capital in the Cayman Islands was merely an accommodation to pension funds and nonprofit institutions and a small number of foreign investors who would benefit from that arrangement. He then promised that, as Treasury Secretary, he would scrutinize the rules that incentivized him to base his business in a foreign tax shelter. Once Wydens jeremiad was through, Republican senator Pat Roberts turned to him and said, Ive got a Valium pill here that you might want to take before the second round. Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown was apoplectic that Roberts would say such a thing to a distinguished committee member. Roberts then suggested that no man was too distinguished to need a Valium once in a while, saying that he had once offered the benzodiazepine to the president of the United States. Later, Mnuchin defended himself against the charge that the bank he helped found had deployed abusive and/or illegal tactics to foreclose on embattled homeowners. It has been said that I ran a foreclosure machine, Mnuchin said. This is not true. On the contrary, I was committed to loan modifications intended to stop foreclosures. I ran a loan-modification machine. Its true that Mnuchin was not responsible for the suffering of many of the people his bank foreclosed on. By the time he and his partners purchased the California mortgage giant IndyMac, it had already distributed countless so-called liar loans to borrowers who would never be able to repay them. When Mnuchin renamed the institution OneWest, 178,000 foreclosures were already in the pipeline. We invested $1.6 billion into a failing institution when most investors were running for the hills, Mnuchin told the Senate Finance Committee, arguing that without his intervention, the outcome for consumers could have been much bleaker. And at the behest of the FDIC, OneWest lowered monthly mortgage payments for nearly 102,000 homeowners by 2013, according to Politico. But an investigation by the California Attorney Generals office alleged that OneWest also committed widespread acts of misconduct in its handling of foreclosures, including illegally backdating documents to expedite the foreclosure process and, essentially, gaming foreclosure auctions. These practices produced plenty of stories no political figure would want to be associated with: In one instance, the bank locked a homeowner out of her house in the midst of a Minnesota blizzard; in another, it foreclosed on a 90-year-old woman whose payment came in 27 cents short. At a congressional hearing organized by Elizabeth Warren Wednesday, four women told similarly harrowing tales of their experiences with OneWest. (Democrats had hoped to feature the homeowners as witnesses at Mnuchins confirmation hearing, but Finance Committee chair Orrin Hatch felt that would be bad idea). At other points in his hearing, Mnuchin distanced himself from the GOPs most Wall Street-friendly ambitions. While the president-elect has vowed to dismantle the financial regulations contained in Dodd-Frank, Mnuchin offered his support for a key piece of that legislation. The concept of proprietary trading does not belong in banks with FDIC insurance, Mnuchin said, by way of endorsing the so-called Volker Rule, which restricts the ability of federally insured banks to make speculative investments that do not benefit their customers. Mnuchin also claimed to support the existence of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  an agency that the GOP has been trying to kill from the moment Elizabeth Warren dreamed it up. However, Mnuchin did say that he believes the agency should not be funded by the Federal Reserve, as it currently is, but by congressional apropriation, instead.And saying that you support the CFPB  but want the House GOP to control its budget  is a bit like saying youre pro-henhouse, but think the fox should guard it. When Democrats tired of attacking Mnuchins record, they asked him to account for that of the president-elect. And Trumps former finance chair proved considerably more amenable to acknowledging his bosss various liabilities, than he was about owning up to his own. Isnt it true that a lot of [Trumps] debt is held by foreign interests? Missouri Democrat Claire McCaskill asked Mnuchin. I dont know, Mnuchin said, before conceding, Ive just read it in the papers. Do you think you should know that, as someone who runs the committee on foreign investments, if were talking about the commander-in-chief? I think you have a valid point, the would-be Treasury Secretary said."}, {"date": "2017/01/19", "title": "Donald Trump Goes to D.C. on Inauguration Eve, Will Spend It at the Blair House", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/donald-trump-will-spend-inauguration-eve-at-the-blair-house.html", "text": " Donald Trump, whos been known to buck a convention or two, is following through with presidential tradition on Inauguration Eve and staying at the Blair House, the guest residence across from the White House.

Its three agencies of government when I get there that are gone  Commerce, Education, and the, um, whats the third one there? Lets see, Perry infamously said, before settling on the Bureau of Oops. At the time, Perrys failure to remember his plan to gut the DOE seemed like the biggest mistake of his political career. But on Thursday, Trumps nominee for secretary of Energy suggested that a bigger mistake was dreaming up that plan in the first place. My past statements made over five years ago about abolishing the Department of Energy do not reflect my current thinking, Perry said at the opening of his confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. In fact, after being briefed on so many of the vital functions of the Department of Energy, I regret recommending its elimination. Those vital functions include maintaining and protecting Americas nuclear stockpile, discouraging nuclear proliferation by foreign governments, and overseeing the nations leading government laboratories. Perry has approximately no relevant experience in managing these activities, leading some to suspect that both he and Donald Trump were unaware of the Energy Departments core mission when they agreed on his nomination to lead it. If you asked him on that first day he said yes, he would have said, I want to be an advocate for energy, Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist who advised Mr. Perrys 2016 presidential bid, told the New York Times this week. If you asked him now, hed say, Im serious about the challenges facing the nuclear complex. Its been a learning curve. However, Perry did tell Politico that he looked forward to learning more about safeguarding Americas nuclear arsenal on the day he was officially named as Trumps nominee to head DOE. Later in his opening remarks, Perry conceded that climate change is real and that some of it is caused by manmade activity. The question, is how we address it in a thoughtful way that doesnt compromise economic growth, Perry explained. The answer, per the former Texas governor, involves, among other things, waiting for some genius scientist to invent a way of burning coal that is clean, friendly, and appropriate. Still, Perry has shown some interest in renewable energy. During his time as governor, Texas became the leading consumer of wind energy in the United States. And during his hearing, Perry reiterated his interest in an all of the above energy strategy. He may want to bring up that commitment to his boss: On the morning of Perrys hearing, the Hill reported that Trumps transition team is preparing to eliminate the Energy Department programs dedicated to promoting energy efficiency, renewable energy, and technologies that reduce carbon emissions."}, {"date": "2017/01/19", "title": "Donald Trump Is Reportedly Thinking About Going to Mars", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/donald-trump-is-reportedly-thinking-about-going-to-mars.html", "text": " During the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump mentioned NASA little. His most illuminating remark on the subject was the nonanswer he gave a 10-year-old who asked for his position on the space agency. You know, in the old days, it was great. Right now, we have bigger problems  you understand that? Weve got to fix our potholes. You know, we dont exactly have a lot of money, Trump said. He added, Space is terrific. In the more than two months since his election, the president-elects position hasnt become much clearer. But historian Douglas Brinkley, who discussed the Apollo program with, says that could change as soon as Friday. Trump wont be specific about his space plans in his inaugural address, Brinkley told the Washington Post, but he might say something vague and morale-building about the moonshot. Brinkley added that Trump sees value in a space mission beyond the scientific. In their conversation, Trump commended the Apollo program for uniting the country and capturing the spirit of the American people, Brinkley said. Just where Trump will want to travel in the solar system remains a mystery. The Post says he has discussed Mars with Elon Musk, who has a plan to colonize the red planet. And Trump has been pushed by Peter Thiel, a friend and business associate of Musks, to turn toward commercial space companies. But there could be another voice in Trumps ear whispering about space exploration  Newt Gingrich. The failed presidential candidate and Trump ally made headlines in 2012 when, during one of his bids to win the GOPs nomination, he promised a completed moon colony by 2020. It was met with ridicule  even mild-mannered Mitt made fun of him  because of its ambition and the out-of-this-world price tag it would command. And that brings us back to Trump and his potential skyward ambitions. Would a Republican Party really sign off on the massive expenditure required to go to space in the face mounting national debt? As long as its another Republicans idea, the answer is yes."}, {"date": "2017/01/19", "title": "Report: Trump Team Preparing $10.5 Trillion in Budget Cuts", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/report-trump-team-preparing-usd10-trillion-in-budget-cuts.html", "text": " Donald Trump campaigned as an unconventional Republican  one who championed universal health care, massive infrastructure spending, the protection of entitlements, the rejection of new trade deals, and, on occasion, sexual assault, religious discrimination, deliberate war crimes, the National Enquirers reputation for investigative reporting, etc, etc Those first few heresies earned Trump the antipathy of the far-right think tank the Heritage Foundation, which initially branded the GOP front-runner as a big-government liberal in conservatives clothing. But then Trump won the Republican nomination, and picked Mike Pence as his running mate. And the GOP nominee started talking a bit more about the evils of financial regulation and the estate tax. And former Heritage Foundation staffers started migrating onto Trumps team. After the mogul won it all on November 8, Heritage played a leading role in picking the new administrations personnel. And now, it seems to be picking which government programs and agencies the new administration will abolish. In recent days, two members of the Trump transition team  Russ Vought and John Gray  have met with career staff at the White House to outline their plan for bleeding $10.5 trillion out of the federal government, the Hill reported Thursday. That plan is tightly modeled on a blueprint drafted by Heritage last year. The proposed cuts are so draconian and far-reaching, they encompass nearly every government function that liberals care about. At the Department of Justice, the plan would eliminate programs that aim to prevent violence against women, encourage community-oriented policing, and provide legal aid to the indigent. It would also drastically reduce funding the DOJs Civil Rights and Environment and Natural Resources divisions. At the Energy Department, the plan would eliminate the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and Office of Fossil Energy, which develops technologies to reduce carbon emissions. Two of the top State Department programs focused on climate-change prevention are marked for elimination. The Minority Business Development Agency, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the National Endowment for the Humanities are all headed for the scrap heap. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting would be privatized. Per the Hill, its unclear whether the plan cuts Medicare or Social Security  measures that would violate a campaign promise to maintain entitlement spending that Trump has reiterated in recent days. However, without significant cuts to those programs, and to Medicaid, its difficult to see how Trump could cut $10.5 trillion over 10 years out of the federal budget, which is the goal of his transition teams budget blueprint, according to the Hill. Its also unclear whether Vought and Grays budget blueprint has the unequivocal support of the president-elect himself, who has devoted little rhetorical energy to touting plans for radically downsizing the civil service. Even if Trump approves of the cuts, he may not be able to get them through Congress. When a similarly draconian budget came up for a vote in the GOP-controlled House in 2015, it was rejected by a vote of 132 to 294. Among those who voted in favor was Trumps nominee to head the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney."}, {"date": "2017/01/19", "title": "Up to 30 People Missing After Avalanche Destroys Hotel in Italy", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/30-people-missing-after-avalanche-destroys-hotel-in-italy.html", "text": " An avalanche, triggered by a series of earthquakes in central Italy, buried a four-star hotel in the Abruzzo region on Wednesday night.

The idea was that Congress would briskly repeal all or virtually all of the substructure of Obamacare, but the effective date of the repeal provisions would be put off until well into the future, in order (a) to reduce the immediate substantive and political impact of disrupting the existing system, and (b) to build pressure on Democrats to provide both congressional votes and cover for an Obamacare replacement. This strategy also gave Republicans a lot more time to reach agreement internally on a replacement plan. Gradually, though, this strategy began to raise concerns among Republicans. For one thing, it slowly sank in that once Obamacare was repealed, insurers and providers might begin bailing out even if the repeals effective date was delayed. At the same time, conservatives began to worry that their base voters would view a delayed effective day for the repeal of Obamacare as a betrayal. Plus, giving their weak-kneed GOP colleagues an excuse for not implementing a rigorous new system until maana might put off that fateful day indefinitely. So the strategy of repealing and replacing Obamacare on separate tracks was already beginning to spring leaks. Then President-elect Donald Trump seemed to blow it up altogether, insisting in tweets, interviews, and his only post-election press conference that the repeal and replacement of Obamacare would be enacted simultaneously, or very nearly so. Emboldened by these comments, more and more GOP senators began expressing opposition to the strategy. It looked like the whole plan was in disarray, even though congressional leaders managed to keep every Republican except for Rand Paul in line for a mostly symbolic Senate vote last week. It was more than a bit of a surprise, then, that in Wednesdays confirmation hearing for incoming HHS secretary Tom Price, GOP Senator Lamar Alexander and Price twice chitchatted genially about a smooth transition to the new era as though we all understood that a simultaneous repeal and replacement meant simultaneous effective dates, not simultaneous action in Congress, as Trump and others had suggested. Simultaneous effective dates, somewhere down the road, were the essence of the original strategy before Trump intervened. So what is happening here? Did Trump misspeak or change his mind about how this, the most important first step of his presidency, is going to go down? Are Alexander and Price pulling a fast one? None of those questions were answered in this rushed hearing, with Democrats mostly focused on new evidence about Prices potential violation of insider-trading laws. But a new and exhaustive piece by distinguished conservative health-care wonk Yuval Levin provides a peek beneath the hood of Republican planning. It appears that walking back Trumps impulsive comments has been in the works practically from the moment the words appeared on his Twitter account. The overall impression you get from reading Levins account of the development of GOP health-care policy is that the expressed views of the president-elect are not a big factor in what actually happens (indeed, he calls Trumps assertion that his own administration is quietly cooking up its own health-care bill a figment of his imagination). So perhaps the original strategy is, in fact, back on track. Theres something else Levin says repeatedly that should raise eyebrows everywhere: He claims Republicans are convinced they can do much of whats essential to an Obamacare replacement plan via the budget reconciliation process  specifically, the 2018 budget bill, on tap for the spring and the summer. If thats true, there are two very important implications for the Obamacare repeal-and-replacement schedule: First, the replacement could be enacted this year (albeit not simultaneously with repeal), rather than two or three or four years down the road. Second, if the replacement is handled through reconciliation, there will be no need for any Democratic votes. Thats a very big deal. And if Trump and everyone else is finally on the same page, Republicans could move pretty quickly to kill and replace Obamacare, even if the day when it all comes down on America is delayed for long enough to mitigate the political damage."}, {"date": "2017/01/19", "title": "The Times May Have Launched a False Rumor About Rick Perry", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/the-times-may-have-launched-a-false-rumor-about-rick-perry.html", "text": " Yesterday, the New York Times posted a story by Coral Davenport and David Sanger about Donald Trumps energy secretary nominee, former Texas governor Rick Perry, that quickly went viral. Thats because the article, posted under the headline Learning Curve As Rick Perry Pursues a Job He Initially Misunderstood, made a rather astounding claim: that at the time he was tapped to head the department, Perry didnt even understand that one of its primary purposes is to maintain the security of Americas nuclear weapons and facilities. Journalists everywhere, myself included, tweeted out the story as just another bright-red data point about Donald Trumps lack of fitness to govern. But since the story went online, a bunch of (mostly) conservative critics and outlets has argued that the story falsely impugns Perry. They make a very convincing case. The specifics of how the Times story was structured and phrased, and the critiques that have been leveled at it, are really important here, so here are the first four paragraphs: Two things jump out: First, nothing in the first three paragraphs  the part of the story communicating the headline assertion that Perry fundamentally misunderstood the job  has any attribution, which is fairly unusual for this style of news story. Usually, youd expect an according to sources close to  type of clause in there somewhere. Second, the clearest plain reading of the second paragraph  no such thing paired with in fact  really does suggest that Perry misunderstood not only the specifics of the job, but rather its basic mission, and it would be difficult to interpret it otherwise. But that claim is almost certainly false. Critics of the story have offered two pieces of evidence. First, the Daily Caller posted a story supposedly debunking the Times account which hinged on the fact that former transition official, Michael McKenna, told The Daily Caller Wednesday that the Times misinterpreted him and Perry of course understood that a key role of the Department of Energy is caring for the nations nuclear arsenal. That criticism relies on a specific reading of those ambiguous top four paragraphs: that the source for the first three was McKenna, who is introduced in the fourth. While thats a plausible interpretation given that no other attribution is provided, theres just no way to know for sure that this is the case given the total lack of attribution (the Times story desperately needs some editing to clear up where that claim came from). Much more convincing is the statement Perry himself released made to Politico on December 14, the day he was named to head the Department of Energy by Trumps transition team, as tweeted by T. Becket Adams of the Washington Examiner: Since said in his statement that he looked forward to safeguarding our nuclear arsenal the same day his nomination was announced, its very hard to square this with the Times claim that [i]n the days after being named, Perry discovered that he would  become the steward of a vast national security complex. None of this, of course, changes the fact that it makes zero sense to tap someone as unqualified as Perry to a position that has, as the Times story points out, in the recent past been held by experts with deep knowledge of nuclear energy and security  it really could be dangerous. And it may well be that Perry misunderstood many of the responsibilities of the job he may soon be stepping into, believing them to have a lot more to do with oil and natural gas than they really do. But criticisms of Trumps appointees should rest on supported claims, and this one seems flimsy. Update: Erik Wemple tweeted out a statement from the Times standing by the story: This doesnt really clear anything up. The importance of attribution is one of the most basic norms in news writing, and those top three grafs are still sitting there without any. A single clause along the lines of Multiple people close to Perry  connected specifically to the claim that he didnt know the Department of Energy oversaw nuclear-weapon security would have gone a long way toward clarifying things, and could have prevented the confusion over whether that claim came from McKenna. As things stand, McKenna denies being the source of that claim, and the Times statement is ambiguous enough that its not clear whether the multiple, high-level sources in question were the source of that particular claim, or perhaps some of the storys other, less sexy ones. Alex Griswold, a reporter at Mediaite, asked the right question in his response to Wemples tweet: The Times should update the language at the top of the online version of the piece to better explain exactly where that eye-popping claim came from, plain and simple."}, {"date": "2017/01/19", "title": "Study: Claim That Fake News Swung Election Is Fake", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/study-claim-that-fake-news-swung-election-is-fake.html", "text": " The long list of reasons why Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton last November should not include the rash of false stories spread largely through social media, commonly referred to as fake news, according to a study to be published Monday.

Only a small fraction of Americans saw the stories, the paper says, and an even smaller group actually believed them. The study, which relied on web-browsing data and a post-election survey of 1,200 people, also found that the impact of social media in general tends to be overstated. In fact, wire services and local TV news remain a more popular source of information than partisan cable-news networks and websites that conjure their stories out of thin air. In short, no matter how much social media seemed to be driving the conversation during the 2016 election, the report says, TV was more important by a large margin."}, {"date": "2017/01/19", "title": "6 Books That Explain How the GOP Went Crazy", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/6-books-that-explain-how-the-gop-went-crazy.html", "text": " Not long ago, another magazine asked me to recommend six books that explain something important about American politics. I chose six of my favorites that help elucidate the most important development of the last half-century in American politics: the Republican Partys embrace of movement conservative ideology. No other major party in the advanced world rejects on principle any proposed tax-revenue increase, or denies the legitimacy of climate science, or opposes universal health care. For reasons Ill explain below, the magazine turned down this list after I submitted it. But first, here is what I sent them: To Make Men Free: A History of the Republican Party, by Heather Cox Richardson. To trace the story of how the Republican Party began as a progressive and even radical force for social and economic egalitarianism, and evolved into a reactionary faction advocating ideas it once loathed, start at the beginning, like Richardson does here. She tells the story from Lincoln to the partys rightward turn, its halting moves back to the center under such figures as Theodore Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower, and then its final reactionary lurch in the present era. Social Darwinism in American Thought, by Richard Hofstadter. Still the most astute critic of modern conservatism, Hofstadters 1944 classic identifies and scathingly dispatches a powerful right-wing idea that was destined to endure: the notion that the free market is a perfectly just mechanism for rewarding value and punishing failure. Invisible Hands: The Businessmens Crusade Against the New Deal, by Kimberly Phillips-Fein. The major accounts of the New Deal describe the winners, but Phillips-Fein tells the story of the opposition, because its ideas would live on, too. How the Social Darwinists fought back against Franklin Roosevelt would set the stage for the rights comeback decades later. Why the Right Went Wrong: Conservatism  From Goldwater to the Tea Party, by E.J. Dionne. The conservative movement, which rejected the New Deal and its seemingly permanent role in American life, set in motion ideological and political changes that led to the party as it exists today. Rule and Ruin: The Downfall of Moderation and the Destruction of the Republican Party, From Eisenhower to the Tea Party, by Geoffrey Kabaservice.A moderate Republican, unlike the other (more liberal) authors listed here, Kabaservice tells the same story as Dionne, from the opposite end: focusing on the long, tragic decline of the GOPs once-powerful moderate tradition. Peddling Prosperity: Economic Sense and Nonsense in an Age of Diminished Expectations, by Paul Krugman.This book, intended as a kind of explainer, wound up producing a powerful critique of supply-side economics, the dominant theory of the GOP, which Krugman aptly dispatches as simply crankery lacking any grounding in serious economic theory. I was told my list could not be published because it was too partisan  to be suitable for publication, I would have to swap out some of the books I chose, and substitute some that made the case that the Democratic Party had also gone off the rails, for the sake of balance. I replied that I could not make this change because I dont believe that the Democratic Party, in its current historical period, has gone off the rails. That doesnt mean I consider the Democrats flawless, just that they are a normal party with normal problems. It contains a broad range of interest groups and politicians. Sometimes one interest group or another gains too much influence over a particular policy, and sometimes its leading politicians get greedy or make bad political decisions. The GOP right now is an abnormal party. It does not resemble the major right-of-center parties found in other industrialized democracies. The most glaring manifestation of this is Donald Trump, the flamboyantly ignorant, authoritarian Republican president-elect. But for all his gross unsuitability for public office, Trump also grows out of longstanding trends within his party, which has previously elevated such anti-intellectual figures as George W. Bush and Sarah Palin as plausible leaders of the free world not despite but because of their disdain for empiricism. And it had grown increasingly suspicious of democracy even before a reality television star with a longstanding admiration for strongmen from Russia to Tiananmen Square came upon the scene  which is why the mainstream Paul Ryan wing has so willingly suborned Trumps ongoing violations of governing norms. It is still fashionable to regard the two parties today as broadly symmetrical to each other  as, indeed, they once were for many decades. But that quaint notion has blinded many of us to the radical turn the Republican Party has taken, and which has brought the American political system to a dangerous point."}, {"date": "2017/01/19", "title": "New York Times: Energy Secretary Nominee Rick Perry Didnt Understand the Job", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/rick-perry-might-have-misunderstood-job-of-energy-secretary.html", "text": " Though hes started wearing trendy glasses, Rick Perry is still haunted by the suggestion that hes not that smart, mainly because he forgot that the Department of Energy was the third federal agency hed like to abolish.

While Spicer claimed on Wednesday that the Trump transition will become the gold standard going forward, others say the incoming administration is poorly prepared for the business of running the government, with many positions still vacant, disorganization among the teams that are in place, and confusion over contradictory messages from Trump and other top advisers. Ive never seen anything like this, a career government official told Foreign Policy. The Trump transition has been dogged by reports of chaos from the start. Much of the blame was put on Chris Christie, who was reportedly fired for mismanaging pre-election transition planning. (The governor has denied this, and suggested hes not taking a White House role because his wife didnt want to move.) Trump sources told Politico that while they got a late start, things are now going smoothly, with written action plans prepared for each major agency. There is a robust transition operation in place that is ensuring that all teams are prepared and ready for Day One, said Trump spokeswoman Lindsay Walters. We look forward to serving our great country. Yet Trumps selection for the final member of his cabinet was just unveiled on Thursday, and many of his other picks spent the last few days in difficult confirmation hearings. CNN reports that Republicans in Congress are pressing Democrats to confirm a handful of Trumps nominees after the swearing-in on Friday, but theyre resisting. The last two presidents had seven cabinet nominees confirmed on their first day in office. Trump has only nominated 28 of the 690 federal government positions that require Senate confirmation, according to the Partnership for Public Service, which is advising the Trump transition, as it did for the Obama transition. Foreign Policy reports that many top management and policy posts have yet to be filled, including those that oversee diplomacy, counterterrorism, and nuclear weapons. Some Defense Department positions have reportedly been left vacant due to a feud between Trump advisers and retired General James Mattis, incoming Defense Secretary. Some Obama officials have been asked to stay on for a few weeks, and others are unclear on what their status will be after Friday. Theres a lot of uncertainty, and if the transition team has a plan for maintaining continuity in key roles, they havent made that widely known, a senior administration official told Foreign Policy. The Trump transition has put together landing teams to visit agencies and collect information, but theyve reportedly been plagued by miscommunication, both amongst themselves and with the Obama administration. Major decisions are made in New York, and sometimes D.C. Trump aides appear to be out of the loop. Sources said that in some departments, after one landing team was briefed, another showed up asking for the same information. The landing teams going into the federal agencies have been uneven, Max Stier, the CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, told Politico. Not all of the landing teams have had much connectivity with the agency. In other instances, Trump staffers have stepped down or been fired, such as Monica Crowley, who withdrew from a communications position at the National Security Council following revelations of plagiarism. Weve briefed at least 10 people, but theyve all gotten fired by the transition after we trained them, one Obama administration official told the Daily Beast. Interactions between the Obama and Trump teams have been polite, and President Obama has said he wants the transition to be as smooth as possible. Yet there is said mistrust behind the scenes. The New York Times reports that the Obama administration wrote 275 briefing papers for Trump officials on national security threats around the world, but they have no idea if anyone read them. Trump officials are wary of sharing too much information after several transition documents leaked  including one in which the Department of Energy was asked to name employees who worked on climate change. Still, transition sources insist that theyre ready to get down to business. Beachhead teams of aides who do not require Senate confirmation have been instructed to skip the inauguration and begin working as soon as Trump takes the oath at noon  though they may want to double-check that instruction.

The selection confirms that despite pressure to add more diversity to his team, Trumps cabinet will be the first that does not have a Latino member since Ronald Reagan selected Lauro Cavazos to head the Education Department in 1988. Perdue, 70, will be the first Southerner to lead the department in more than two decades. In the 70s he earned a doctorate in veterinary medicine from the University of Georgia before a stint in the U.S. Air Force, where he rose to the rank of captain. He spent much of his career in the agriculture business, then was elected state senator in the 90s. While serving as governor from 2003 to 2011, Perdue promoted trade commerce between Georgia and China, opening the states first international trade office in Beijing. He also moved the state office that issues agricultural permits from Atlanta to rural Georgia and adopted new food-safety regulation following a salmonella outbreak traced to peanut butter made in the state. During his tenure, Perdue held a referendum to replace Georgias state flag. Under Perdues predecessor, the state flag featuring the Confederate battle emblem had been replaced with an unpopular design. The 2004 referendum let voters select a new design, but some were angered that Confederate symbols were not an option. Perdue is also known for holding a rally at the State Capitol to publicly pray for rain during a drought in 2007. He campaigned heavily for Trump in the final months of the election and was one of the first people interviewed for the agriculture position. He said in December that the president-elect lit up as he discussed his experience with agricultural commodities, trading domestically and internationally. Trump went on to audition six other people for the position amid complaints about the lack of diversity on his cabinet, including two Latino candidates and Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp. Some of these options reportedly riled top Trump supporters, and agriculture groups and lawmakers from farm states became concerned that he had yet to make a decision. When asked about the lack of Latinos on Trumps team, incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said on Wednesday that the president-elect was still seeking out the best and the brightest to fill his cabinet. He urged the press to look at the diversity of Trumps senior White House staffers, but the Washington Post notes that so far there are no Latinos in those positions either."}, {"date": "2017/01/18", "title": "A Mystery Buyer Is About to Purchase Donald Trumps Childhood Home", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/mystery-buyer-is-about-to-own-donald-trumps-childhood-home.html", "text": " Someone is about to be the proud new owner of the house where Donald Trump lived until he was 4 years old.

His administration has brought more prosecutions against whistle-blowers and leakers than all its predecessors combined. His Justice Department has spied on reporters and attempted to compel the New York Times James Risen to divulge his confidential sources via the threat of imprisonment. In two days, Donald Trump will inherit these precedents. But in his final press conference Wednesday, the president drew attention to the other, more Fourth Estatefriendly precedents he will bestow on his successor. Obama addressed reporters in the close confines of the White House briefing room  a location aides selected over the more spacious State Dining Room, so as to symbolically affirm the presss right to be in immediate proximity to those in power. That right had recently come into question, as Esquire reported that Donald Trumps team was considering moving journalists out of the West Wing, thereby limiting their opportunities to question senior staffers. In his opening remarks, Obama made his desire to defend the presss prerogatives against his successors whims explicit. Youre not supposed to be sycophants  youre supposed to be skeptics, Obama said.

Obama went on to say that, while he plans to take a break from politics, he would not hesitate to enter the fray if our democracys other needs were in jeopardy. Theres a difference between that normal functioning of politics and certain issues or certain moments where I think our core values may be at stake, the president said. I put in that category if I saw systematic discrimination being ratified in some fashion. I put in that category explicit or functional obstacles to people being able to vote, to exercise their franchise. I put in that category institutional efforts to silence dissent or the press. And for me at least, I would put in that category efforts to round up kids who have grown up here and for all practical purposes are American kids and send them somewhere else, when they love this country. The president spent much of his last press conference defending his administrations final decisions. Responding to criticisms of his commutation of Chelsea Mannings 35-year sentence for leaking classified documents, Obama said, First of all, lets be clear  Chelsea Manning has served a tough prison sentence. So the notion that the average person who was thinking about disclosing vital classified information would think that it goes unpunished, I dont think would get that impression from the sentence that Chelsea Manning has served. Defending his decision to allow the United Nations to condemn the expansion of Israeli settlements, the president argued that the two-state solution is the only acceptable resolution to the Israeli-Palestine conflict  and ongoing settlement expansion is creating a reality on the ground that increasingly will make a two-state solution impossible. Obama conceded that the president-elects nominee for ambassador to Israel has a very different view, and that Trump has the prerogative to take policy in the Middle East  or anywhere else  in a new direction. It is appropriate for him to go forward with his vision and his values, Obama said of his successor. And I dont expect that theres going to be enormous overlap. But to the extent that Trumps vision and values involve ratifying systemic discrimination, or violating the freedom of the press, or undermining the security of undocumented children, the president suggested that he would not hesitate to speak out. And his voice remains a resonant one. The latest Washington Post-ABC News poll puts Obamas approval rating at 60 percent  20 points lower than it was just before his inauguration in 2008, and 20 points higher than Trumps is today."}, {"date": "2017/01/18", "title": "Wilbur Ross Fired an Undocumented Household Worker Before Confirmation Hearing", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/wilbur-ross-fired-an-undocumented-household-worker.html", "text": " Before billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, Donald Trumps pick for commerce secretary, arrived on Capitol Hill for a confirmation hearing Wednesday, he fired a member of his household staff because the person was undocumented. Ross admitted to the Senate Commerce Committee that he re-checked the documentation of the dozen or so household workers hes had over the years and all but one provided the necessary paperwork to prove he or she was legally able to work in the U.S. That employee was immediately terminated, Ross said.

Thats why Ross has enough household employees to field a full-court basketball game, with coaches. In addition to hired help, Ross spoke on the issues of trade and tariffs during the hearing. His top priority should he be confirmed, and theres no reason to think he wont, will be renegotiating NAFTA, Ross said. I am not anti-trade. I am pro-trade, he said. But I am pro-sensible trade, not pro-trade that is to the disadvantage of the American worker and the American manufacturing community. On China, Ross talked tough, calling the nation the most protectionist country of very large countries. He also said that those countries refusing to play by the rules when it comes to trade should get punished  and severely. Ross may have been as strong on China as his new boss, but he didnt quite get behind Trumps stance on tariffs. The president-elect has threatened a 35 percent tariff on companies that move jobs to Mexico. Most recently, he warned BMW that if it plans to make cars in Mexico and sell them in the U.S., it will be hit with a 35 percent tax. Ross said there should be higher priorities. I think the pro-growth thing is stimulating exports, much more than just curtailing imports, he said. Ross went on to downplay the threat of a 35 percent tariff, which he implied was less of a warning of an actual policy change than a good way to let other countries know that change is coming."}, {"date": "2017/01/18", "title": "Chelsea Manning and the False Logic of Harsh Prison Sentences", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/chelsea-manning-and-the-false-logic-of-harsh-sentencing.html", "text": " While working as an Army intelligence analyst in 2010, Chelsea Manning leaked a wide array of American military and diplomatic secrets. Some of these leaked materials exposed war crimes; others served no apparent public interest, even as they (allegedly) disrupted Americas capacity to conduct diplomacy. As punishment for violating the Armys trust, Manning spent the next six years of her life moving in and out of solitary confinement, at a series of military prisons. Before her trial, she was held under conditions that the United Nations deemed cruel and inhumane. After her trial, she was held at a mens prison, despite her status as a transgender woman. While there, she tried to kill herself multiple times. On Tuesday, Barack Obama offered Manning his mercy. While the president did not pardon Manning for her crime, he chose to commute her sentence. Now, she will leave Fort Leavenworth this May, instead of some time in 2045. Predictably, the move has inspired a fierce right-wing backlash. But because mainstream conservatives are often shy about arguing for vengeance as an end in itself, theyve framed their aversion to mercy in pragmatic terms  the commutation will undermine our capacity to deter future leakers. Paul Ryan said in a statement that the commutation now leaves in place a dangerous precedent that those who compromise our national security wont be held accountable for their crimes. The plain meaning of the speakers statement is that the years Manning has already served do not constitute accountability  and thus, her premature release will embolden future leakers.Conservative foreign-policy analyst Max Boot echoed Ryans sentiment. In an editorial titled, Leniency for a Traitor, the (ostensibly liberal) New York Daily News wrote that, whether or not the 35-year term Manning was handed down in 2013 was correct, a mere seven years, a fifth of the sentence, is unjustifiably lenient. The paper goes on to argue that the pernicious interference of WikiLeaks in the 2016 election illustrates the necessity of the American justice system being especially sensitive to such crimes.In the Spectator, Douglass Murray wrote: Significantly, Murray misrepresents Obamas action  he did not pardon Manning, but merely commuted her sentence. A pardon constitutes official forgiveness for an offense; a commutation does not. In concrete terms, then, Murrays argument, like all the others cited here, is that abridging Mannings sentence will encourage would-be traitors.This may sound reasonable on its face. The notion that lengthy sentences are necessary to deter serious crimes is a central principle of the American justice system. But when one applies this premise to Mannings case, its irrationality becomes apparent. The question asked by those concerned about deterrence becomes self-answering: If the only punishment for leaking American secrets is more than six years in prison  including many months of being held under conditions that international law regards as torture  then what will stop other intelligence analysts from following in Mannings footsteps? Ostensibly, Paul Ryan believes that there are many people in the American military who would be willing to leak secrets if the punishment were nearly seven years in confinement  but would never dream of doing so if the penalty were 35 years. It seems to me that the kind of person who would gladly accept the former punishment would not be deterred by the latter. But we dont need to rely on intuition. Criminological research suggests that draconian sentencing is not effective in deterring crime. According to the 2014 findings of the National Research Council, applying a mandatory minimum to a given offense does not reduce its prevalence. Severity of punishment upon conviction is simply far less important for deterrence than certainty of apprehension  people become much more likely to commit crimes when they have a reasonable expectation of getting away with them. By contrast, precisely how many years of life one can expect to lose  based on a careful reading of precedent and statute  has little influence on a would-be offenders calculus. But Americas criminal code assumes the opposite. In fact, the primary reason for our nations exceptionally high incarceration rate is our singular fondness for long prison sentences. As Michael Tonry, a leading authority on criminal-justice policy, has written, American prison sentences are vastly harsher than in any other country to which the United States would ordinarily be compared. And this isnt just the product of our punitive attitude toward drug crimes: In other parts of the world, life sentences for murder are the exception; in the United States, they are the rule. To create a more rational and humane criminal justice system, Americans will need to recognize that decades-long sentences are not a prerequisite for deterring serious offenses. If you are a conservative who deplores both Mannings crime and mass incarceration, please consider the possibility that mercy is not incompatible with law and order."}, {"date": "2017/01/18", "title": "George H.W.

Going into the hearing, the position of the Trump transition office was that Prices stockbroker made the purchase without his knowledge.

On one hand, its good to nail down that climate change is real, but another piece of news today makes Pruitts squishiness on the human role in the warming pretty unsettling: For the third consecutive year, the world notched its highest temperatures, making 2016 the hottest year ever recorded. It crushed 2015, the previous titleholder; 2014 is the now the second runner-up. A single warm year is something of a curiosity, Deke Arndt, who monitors global climate for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told the New York Times. Its really the trend, and the fact that were punching at the ceiling every year now, that is the real indicator that were undergoing big changes. Last years surface temperatures ticked .07 degrees Fahrenheit higher than 2015, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, The average land and ocean temperature was 58.69 degrees Fahrenheit in 2016, well above the 20th-century average of 57 degrees. Recordkeeping on this data began in 1880, so Earth is breaking more-than-century-old records. Scientists do believe that the weather phenomenon El Nio, which began in 2015 and was expected to be one of the strongest in years, contributed to the temperature upticks. So its unlikely well see a four-peat in 2017. Even so, according to NASA  which backed up NOAAs findings  the planet has sweated through 16 of the 17 hottest years on record since 2001. NOAAs and NASAs findings (which use different methodologies, but came to the same conclusions) come on the heels of some other disturbing climate indicators.

The sea-ice extent near Antarctica hit a record low in November, though it may be an anomaly.

In an interview with the Washington Posts Karen Tumulty, Trump discussed how he came up with and quickly trademarked the MAGA slogan back in 2012. His lawyers actually fired off cease-and-desist letters whenever GOP rivals used the phrase in speeches. The president-elect, a man whose convictions about the value of branding are clearer than those he possesses about almost any other topic, is undoubtedly convinced his alleged origination and fierce flogging of MAGA was key to his political success. And perhaps he is right: Its plainly reactionary, yet policy-flexible nature made it a lot more compelling than the straddling stances on the past and present all his opponents assumed. That definitely included Hillary Clinton, who could never overcome the sense she was running for a third term for her husband or for Barack Obama, or both. And it put the Trump campaign in touch with an important strain of right-wing sentiment that is not strictly about limited government  viz. the efforts of David Brooks and William Kristol to promote something they called National Greatness Conservatism just before the turn of the millennium. In any event, the shelf life of MAGA is limited, and as this remarkable moment in the interview with Tumulty shows, Donald Trump is thinking ahead: Its news indeed that a few days before he becomes president Trump is already thinking about his reelection. And theres an obvious logic to KAG. But it doesnt quite pull on the heartstrings like the simultaneously nostalgic and optimistic MAGA. And it puts Trump on the hook for, you know, actually accomplishing something great. Trump seems to understand that. After some scary talk suggesting that greatness has a lot to do with military displays (That military may come marching down Pennsylvania Avenue. That military may be flying over New York City and Washington, D.C., for parades. I mean, were going to be showing our military), he told Tumulty he needed some steak to go with the sizzle: Taking office with the lowest approval ratings ever for an incoming president, while possessing a campaign platform based on magic and Big Man posturing, and facing a common fate with congressional allies he plainly mistrusts, its not clear how Trump thinks he will produce the results. Quite possibly, he thinks that as a marketing genius he can convince voters in 2020  and earlier, when his administration gets its first public feedback in off-year and midterm elections  that life is better through sheer rhetorical enchantment.

Hes the Legacy of Anti-Obamaism.", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trumps-the-legacy-of-anti-obamaism-not-obama.html", "text": " President Obamas critics spent eight years dismissing his accomplishments as wildly overambitious, or insignificant. (Some of the very same people who accused him of the former, and warned his socialist agenda would lead to devastation, switched to the latter when their doomsday predictions failed to take hold.) Since November, the indictment has come to focus on the election of Donald Trump, an event Obamas critics on both the left and right see as a kind of divine justice, both negating his agenda and ultimately defining it. It is more than a bit odd to define a presidency by its successor. Most historians regard Abraham Lincoln as the greatest president in American history, despite the fact that he was immediately followed by the president most of them consider the worst, Andrew Johnson. Yet few people consider Johnson to be a central part of Lincolns legacy (even though Lincoln single-handedly enabled Johnson to get the job, by dumping his anti-slavery vice-president, Hannibal Hamlin, and adding the Southern, pro-slavery Johnson to the ticket to help secure his reelection.) Whether Trump manages to reverse many of Obamas major accomplishments remains to be seen. Trumps bid to repeal Obamacare has run into a series of immediate obstacles, beginning with the fact that both the 20 million people who get health care through the law and the doctors, hospitals, and insurers who sell it to them are raising bloody hell about snatching it away. Trump will slow down the green-energy revolution Obama started, but he wont halt it; the economic logic of affordable clean energy displacing expensive coal, and the diplomatic logic of international cooperation to ratchet down emissions, have taken on a momentum of their own. And the bold actions Obama took to prevent a depression  the stimulus, the bank stress test, and the auto bailout  cannot be undone by definition. The fashion for blaming Trump on Obama has less to do with any programmatic analysis of the 44th president, though. It is a tic adopted by Obamas critics  especially those who dislike Trump but wish to vindicate their fervent opposition to Obama. Former Bush administration staffer Peter Wehner argues in the New York Times that Obama not only failed to produce a sufficiently prosperous economy, he failed in his major domestic policy goal: These are familiar grounds on which to prosecute the case against Obamacare. Yes, the website didnt work for a few weeks, until they fixed it quickly enough so as not to impact the initial enrollment period. The promise of lower insurance costs for families and taxpayers has been resoundingly kept; since Obamacare began, health-care inflation has fallen to its lowest level in half a century. The cost to the taxpayers has come in well below projected levels and has been revised downward repeatedly. As an S&P analysis found, premiums in the exchanges were initially set too low, but have since stabilized. The federal government is now spending less than it was expected to spend before Obamacare passed, but is covering 20 million more people. It is true that Obama overpromised that everybody could keep their plan. The architects of the Affordable Care Act considered the non-group market a disaster, rife with plans that cherry-picked healthy customers, denying usable coverage to anybody with a preexisting condition. Their goal was to overhaul that market while keeping the employer-based system intact. Obama made this promise in the context of Republican attempts to frighten people into thinking his reforms would take away their employer-sponsored insurance, like in this 2010 speech: Yes, sometimes Obama omitted the qualifiers and context. And it is true that his reforms eliminated existing plans in the non-group market. That meant young, healthy individuals who were able to buy cheap insurance  because they didnt have to pool risks with older or sicker people  lost that ability under Obamacare. Obama should have been more precise with his promise. Yet conservatives have fetishized his misleading use of the phrase keep your plan to the degree that they have convinced themselves it is the defining quality of Obamacare  as if the achievements of giving millions of people access to medical care, and bending the cost curve, were dwarfed by a misleading, oversimplified catchphrase. Wehner concludes his column by charging that Obamas alleged failures create[d] the conditions that allowed a cynical demagogue to rise up and succeed him, one who will undo the achievements he most prizes. Now, think about this for a minute. Wehner served loyally under George W. Bush and refuses to acknowledge that administrations catastrophic failures. This is an administration that sold an entire war on false premises, pressuring the intelligence community to bend its findings to support the claims the president and vice-president were determined to press from the outset of their presidency. Bush then presided over a historically weak recovery that produced no wage gains  a charge Wehner, falsely, levels against the Obama recovery  and relied upon a massive housing bubble. The collapse of the Bush bubble created the greatest economic crisis in three-quarters of a century, and an economic gulf so deep it took years to recover. This is not to mention the widespread incompetence, scandals, and hackery that permeated everything Bush touched. And yet here is a veteran of the Bush administration arguing in all apparent sincerity that Trumps rise was fueled by economic weakness and presidential incompetence and dishonesty of a previous president, and that president is Barack Obama. Trump does say something important about the Obama years. But what he says is something very different. Republicans have spent eight years insisting Obama holds some or even all the blame for their refusal to negotiate with his policies. Why would a party that once advocated Keynesian stimulus and an individual mandate and cap and trade come to denounce all those ideas as ruinous socialism? The explanation offered by conservatives, and taken seriously by many fair-minded observers, held that the party had undertaken a serious process of ideological self-evaluation. Republicans had simply embraced deep-seated beliefs in stringent fiscal conservatism, Constitutional absolutism, and the principles of limited government. The rise of Trump shows how false that explanation rings. Here is a candidate who makes a mockery of all those alleged principles. Trump reveals that the backlash against Obama was exactly what liberals said it was, racialized hysteria against social change, and that no negotiating strategy or policy concessions could have calmed the rage on the right. Obama produced a tremendous amount of progress in spite of a backlash he could do nothing to stop. And he will leave the White House with peace and prosperity and an approval rating hovering around 60 percent. Trump belongs to the right. He is a product of the backlash against Obamaism, and the personal and ideological antithesis of the urbane, intellectual, sober, empirically minded 44th president. Trump is related to Obama only in that he is the perfect incarnation of the rage, bigotry, and ignorance that defined his opposition."}, {"date": "2017/01/18", "title": "Former President George H.W.

Democrats on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee complained a lot about the brevity of the hearing, which reduced the time DeVos had to bob and weave her way through potentially perilous questions. I look forward to working with you on that issue was her most frequent answer. DeVos still had to put up with acerbic comments about her vast wealth, her incomplete ethics paperwork, and her potential conflicts of interest. She was pressed to explain aspects of her educational philosophy (and Trumps) in areas where they are not widely known. She labored to sidestep or minimize highly controversial issues like Common Core education standards. Elizabeth Warren mentioned Trumps fake university and suggested crooks and swindlers would do back-flips at DeVoss intention to review regulations disliked by for-profit higher-education institutions. Patty Murray brought up Trumps Access Hollywood comments, and DeVos was challenged on her own commitment to fight sexual assault on college campuses. While there were many of these contentious exchanges, the nominee managed to keep her composure. DeVoss big challenge, however, was to defend her long-time advocacy for the use of public funds for private schools with a minimum of accountability. And despite the best efforts of several Democrats and even some Republicans (notably Lisa Murkowski) to get a clear commitment from her with respect to accountability, she kept returning to vague assertions. DeVoss prepared opening statement to the committee provided an important clue that her idea of accountability is not one most policy-makers would share. She continually embraced the principle that public-education policy should be all about what parents want, with occasional kibitzing from teachers and school administrators. That is very clear. And if it is not, theres this conclusory statement: For me, its simple: I trust parents, and I believe in our children. Whos left out in a publicly financed education system in which individual moms and dads call all the shots? The people financing that system, the public itself. Yes, many of them are moms and dads, too  but in their capacity as taxpayers and as allegedly self-governing voters they should have the right to ensure that public dollars benefit the public as a whole via a system that offers equal access and train a well-educated citizenry. And this is the very idea that separates DeVos from actual defenders of public education, including many who support public-school choice and public charter schools (privately operated public schools that are free, that offer equal access, and that are accountable to public authorities via a specific performance agreement, a.k.a. a charter). DeVos and her husband have devoted themselves and much of their vast wealth to severing any link between public-education funding and public accountability, championing the idea that parents, with zero accountability to anyone, should be the sole distributors of taxpayer dollars. Thats why they have supported attaching funds to the individual child, to follow them wherever their parents choose. And thats why in addition to supporting the use of public funds at private or religious schools  or for religiously motivated home-schooling  the DeVoses have fought to make charter public schools in their own state of Michigan as unaccountable as possible  contradicting the very idea of the charter. Is it possible parents handed a public subsidy and total freedom to use it however they want could make a poor education decision for their kids or their community? Of course they could, particularly if they are being advised by their spiritual leaders to steer those public dollars to the Academy of the Vengeful God, where boys are taught to be servant-leaders to their submissive homemaking wives. (LGBT folk need not apply!) Asked back in 2001 if she disagreed with the idea that private schools should rely on private dollars for their support, DeVos said this: It is perfectly possible for a secretary of Education to serve her or his God and the American people simultaneously. Using public schools to place the latter in submission to the former without their consent is to betray the public trust. Unfortunately, there wasnt time for such deep questions at Tuesdays hearing. The committee is set to vote on DeVoss confirmation next week, probably on more-or-less a party-line basis.

She doesnt come from within the education Establishment. But honestly, I believe that today thats one of the most important qualifications you could have for this job, he said. We need a change agent. However, Democrats had many issues with DeVos, beginning with the hearing itself. They initially complained that there should be no hearing since the Office of Government Ethics has not finished reviewing DeVoss ethics and financial disclosures for potential conflicts of interest. Then Senator Lamar Alexander, the committees chairman, limited each senator to just five minutes of questioning, which Democratic senators said was insufficient time, especially considering DeVoss wealth and controversial views on education. In the time they did have, Democrats grilled DeVos on potential conflicts of interest related to her familys contributions to conservative religious organizations, her qualifications, and her advocacy for policies that they say would take funding away from public schools.

A vote on DeVoss nomination is set for next Tuesday, but Alexander said it will be rescheduled if her ethics review is not completed by the end of the week. Senator Patty Murray asked DeVos if she would promise not to privatize public schools or cut funding from public education. DeVos said, Not all schools are working for the students, and she hopes to work with Murray to find ways to empower parents to make choices on behalf of their children that are right for them. I take that as not be willing to commit to not privatizing public schools or cutting money from education, Murray responded. When Senator Al Franken asked DeVos to give her opinion on whether schools should be judged by students proficiency or growth, DeVos seemed unfamiliar with the terms. Franken explained that the question of which metric should be used in federal education policy has been a subject of debate for years. It surprises me you dont know this issue, Franken said. Senator Bernie Sanders asked DeVos if shed work with him to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. She called Sanderss proposal a really interesting idea, but added, We have to consider the fact that theres nothing in life that is truly free. Somebody will pay for it. DeVos said that while her moms heart has really piqued on the issue, committing to uphold 2011 regulations that require colleges to investigate sexual assault more thoroughly would be premature. The guidelines now require schools to use a lower standard of evidence  a preponderance of evidence rather than beyond a reasonable doubt  in administrative disciplinary hearings on sexual assault. Senator Bob Casey noted that DeVos has donated to a group that sued the Department of Education over the new standard, saying it denies the accused their due process. Later, Senator Murray asked if DeVos would consider unwanted kissing and groping, like the behavior described by Trump on the Access Hollywood video, to be sexual assault. She said yes. When Senator Tim Kaine asked if all taxpayer-funded schools should be required to comply with the federal Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, DeVos said, I think that is a matter best left to the states. Are you saying that some states might be good to kids with disabilities, and some states might not be so good, and then people can just move around the country if they dont like the way their kids are being treated? Kaine asked. Later, DeVos walked back her remarks, saying she does think schools that accept federal funding must comply with federal law. When Senator Maggie Hassan asked if she was unaware of the federal law protecting students with disabilities, DeVos said, I may have confused it. DeVos told Senator Christopher Murphy  who represents Newtown, Connecticut  that she thinks the issue of whether guns should be allowed in schools is best left to locales and states to decide. Referencing an earlier remark from Wyoming Senator Mike Enzi about a school in his state that is threatened by bear attacks, DeVos said, Theres probably a gun in the school to protect from potential grizzlies."}, {"date": "2017/01/18", "title": "Obama Granted 212 Pardons, and More Commutations Than Any Other U.S. President", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/obama-granted-more-commutations-than-any-other-us-president.html", "text": " In addition to freeing Chelsea Manning, President Obama granted 208 other commutations and 64 pardons Tuesday  among them General James Cartwright.

In total, the president has pardoned 212 individuals, most in the waning days of his administration. On Tuesday, Obama also pardoned baseball hall-of-famer Willie McCovey for a 1995 tax-evasion charge and Studio 54 co-founder Ian Schrager, who served 12 months for a 1980 tax-evasion conviction. Obama still has a few more days left in his administration, and according to CBS News he will dole out more commutations before he leaves the White House for good.

But full emancipation, of course, did not occur until the Thirteenth Amendment  one of those Reconstruction Amendments latter-day constitutional conservatives tend to forget about when they praise the infallible work of the Founders  was enacted and ratified. And as German Lopez points out, Grant could not have fought against Jim Crow because Jim Crow was established after the military reconstruction Grant tried to enforce was dismantled.

Its uncommon for lawmakers to boycott the inauguration for political purposes, but a day earlier about two dozen Democrats said they would not attend. Many said the final straw was Trumps feud with Representative John Lewis over the holiday weekend. Lewis said he does not consider Trump a legitimate president because he believes the Russians helped get him elected, prompting the president-elect to attack the civil-rights icon on Twitter. The Post has the full list of lawmakers skipping the event (including some who claim they just happen to be busy on January 20). Here are some of the latest additions: Trump might have done little to stem the protest, refusing to drop the issue and attacking Representative Lewis again on Twitter Tuesday. This time, the president-elect challenged the civil-rights leader on his statement that Trumps inauguration would be the first he missed since joining Congress in 1987. But, on this, Trump is right. Lewis did skip George W. Bushs inauguration in 2001, telling the Washington Post at the time that he planned to stay in Atlanta because he did not believe Bush is the true elected president. Lewiss office acknowledged that the congressman missed Bushs swearing-in. His absence at that time was also a form of dissent, spokeswoman Brenda Jones told USA Today. He did not believe the outcome of that election, including the controversies around the results in Florida and the unprecedented intervention of the U.S. Supreme Court, reflected a free, fair and open democratic process. Outside of Twitter, the Trump transition team spun the boycott into an opportunity for some to get a premium-seat upgrade. Obviously wed love for every member of Congress to attend, future White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said, But if they dont, thats some great seats that other folks can hopefully partake in. Its a shame that these folks dont want to be part of the peaceful transfer of power, Spider added, but its within their right. He maintained that enthusiasm for the inauguration remained high, and there would be plenty of crowds, regardless of the protest. The celebration some Democrats are now missing out on appears to be far more low-key than expected. While Trump himself said there was once talk of a parade up Fifth Avenue or a helicopter ride from New York to D.C., Boris Epshteyn, communications director for the Presidential Inaugural Committee, tells the Post that the event will be workmanlike. While some inaugural parades have taken more than four hours, Trump is expected to spend just 90 minutes walking down Pennsylvania Avenue. The only announced performers are the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, the Radio City Rockettes, and singer Jackie Evancho. While the last three presidents attended eight or more balls on the night they were inaugurated, Trump is expected to appear at just three. This is not a coronation, Epshteyn said. And youve seen some inaugurals in the past that maybe did seem like a coronation. Again, its every presidents choice. This president wants to get to work. But Trumps inauguration may not be as Spartan as Epshteyn suggests. The inaugural committee has raised more than $90 million for the celebrations, while Obama brought in $53 million in 2009. Seven-figure donors will reportedly receive tickets to a candlelight dinner featuring special appearances by the new First Family. The committee has also ordered customized thermal blankets that will be distributed to those on the dais (though its expected to be in the 50s on Friday). Otherwise, its unclear where the money is going. With a pared-down inaugural, I dont know what they could possibly use $90 million on, Steve Kerrigan, a top organizer for both of Obamas inaugurations, told the Post. Trump may find some way to burn off the extra money over the weekend. Sure he wants to get to work, but who does business on Saturday and Sunday?"}, {"date": "2017/01/17", "title": "Putin Defends Trump, Extols Russias Sex Workers As Best in the World", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/putin-defends-trump-extols-russias-sex-workers.html", "text": " Russian president Vladimir Putin says allegations that Donald Trump may have met with prostitutes and done some unhygienic things in a Russian hotel suite are utter nonsense. People who order fakes of the type now circulating against the U.S. president-elect, who concoct them and use them in a political battle, are worse than prostitutes because they dont have any moral boundaries at all, Putin fired off on Russian state television Tuesday. It highlights a significant degree of degradation of political elites in the West, including in the United States. Putin also pointed the finger at the Obama administration for trying to undermine Trump, and for fomenting doubt about the legitimacy of the U.S. election results  which is, incidentally, the exact same thing the U.S. intelligence community has accused Russia of doing. Putin had additional reasons, beyond Americas moral turpitude, for why those claims made in that leaked memo arent likely be true. When Trump came to Moscow, he was not a political figure, we were not even aware of his political ambitions, Putin said, likely referring to Trumps 2013 visit for the Miss Universe contest, even though Trump had flirted with a presidential run in 2012 and some other times before that. Does somebody think that our secret services are chasing every American billionaire? Of course not. It is utter nonsense. The Russia leader also questioned whether it was believable that Trump would have hired sex workers. [He is] someone who has been involved with beauty contests for many years and has met the most beautiful women in the world, Putin explained.

Whatever one thinks of the president-elects business record, he sure has convinced a lot of people that its terrific. So even if liberals arent worried about Trump becoming the greatest jobs president God ever created, many are concerned that he could successfully market himself as such. After all, Trumps first attempt at theatrical job creation  his much-publicized deal to keep one of Carriers HVAC factories from being relocated to Mexico  was met with positive reviews. And in the weeks since, the president-elect has repeatedly generated flattering headlines by claiming responsibility for various corporations plans to expand their American workforces. The success of these gambits led political scientist Lee Drutman to warn that Trump could make himself a popular president even if he fails to spur genuine economic improvement. But a new Washington Post-ABC News poll suggests the opposite possibility: Trump could remain an unpopular president, even if he presides over a genuinely strong economy. Like every other opinion poll taken since Trumps victory, the Post survey finds that Trump is the most unpopular president-elect on record. At this point in 2009, nearly 80 percent of Americans had a positive view of Barack Obama. In 2017, only 40 percent say the same about Trump. Meanwhile, 54 percent have a negative view of the president-elect, and 41 percent claim a strongly unfavorable opinion of him. Whats more, only 44 percent consider Trump qualified for the office hes about to assume. Notably, the publics dim view of the president-elect extends to his chosen cabinet, with only 4 in 10 saying they approve of most of the personnel choices Trump has made  for both President Bushes and for Bill Clinton, that figure was roughly 6 in 10. These are remarkably poor numbers. But, as mentioned, they mostly reiterate the findings of previous polls. What makes the Posts survey interesting is the tension it reveals between the publics disapproval of Trump and its confidence in his capacity to improve the economy. These figures suggest that Trumps various attempts to brand himself as a job creator have been successful, but also, potentially irrelevant: There are a significant number of voters who think Trump will improve the economy, but still dont want a hateful reality star to be their president. Trump may be able to use a combination of real and imaginary economic improvement to retain the 46 percent support he won in November. But the Posts poll suggests that the rest of the electorate holds an antipathy for the president-elect so personal and profound, he may have trouble growing his share of the vote in 2020, even if he presides over reasonably strong job growth. Or, perhaps, the poll merely suggests that all public-opinion data is rigged.

The latest signs are not good for a smoothly operating GOP trifecta government. To say that Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, Donald Trump, and Tom Price, Trumps Health and Human Services appointee, are not on the same page about how to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act is a massive understatement. Looking beyond the Obamacare thicket, everybodys plans on Capitol Hill for 2017 involve major reforms of corporate and individual taxes and also quite possibly undertaking a version of entitlement reform that would functionally wipe out the whole Great Society legacy of anti-poverty programs. Though no one knows exactly where Trump will come out on these broader budget goals, its no secret that the agenda his campaign suggests are about 180 degrees away from the debt-and-deficit-shrinking rhetoric so many congressional Republicans have deployed so often in the recent past. Yes, there are ample grounds for the cynical observation that congressional Republicans only care about budget deficits when a Democrat is in the White House. But there is no question that conservatives really do want to pursue the decimation of liberal spending programs as an end in itself, and will agitate the air about debt and deficits to increase the pressure to do so, even if its opposed by a Republican administration. So how can the new Trump regime avoid this conflict early in its tenure? Trumps friend and adviser Newt Gingrich has a solution: Change the score by abolishing the only independent scorekeeper, the Congressional Budget Office. That is how Gingrich describes the Republican-controlled congressional budget arm. And there is every reason to suspect the problem he (and other Trump allies) perceives with CBO has nothing to do with liberalism and everything to do with inconvenient budget math. CBO may have painted a big bulls-eye on itself with a December report about options for reducing the budget deficit that defied the Trump claim that its possible to slash high-end taxes and boost defense spending while not doing anything to offend Republican or swing voters. As one MarketWatch columnist put it: Thus, the CBO is providing a bright-yellow-line guide for Tea Partystyle fiscal hawks centered in the House Freedom Caucus to throw a monkey wrench into Trumps plans. As Gingrich accurately says, the quickest way to put the monkey wrench back into the toolbox is to abolish the CBO, leaving Trumps Office of Management and Budget as the sole official arbiter of spending, revenue, deficit, and debt estimates. As budget expert Stan Collender notes, this would represent a staggering abdication of congressional independence: It is indeed extraordinary that a former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives is advocating this step. But it is highly consistent with Trumps more general effort to delegitimize any sources of public information that he or his hirelings do not control. And for precisely that reason, theres a good chance that Gingrich really is speaking for the 45th president in demanding unilateral budget disarmament by Congress. And if theres any doubt about the inconvenience CBOs honesty represents for the GOP at this moment, it was probably resolved today when the agency reported that the repeal of Obamacare as it was enacted by Republicans in 2015s dry run bill (vetoed by Obama) would result in 32 million people losing health insurance and would double the price of insurance premiums within a decade.

We do not seek to adopt a model already enjoyed by other countries, May said, We do not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave. Heres what the vision of a clean break means in practical terms: Britain will most certainly leave the single market. The United Kingdom wants to regain control over immigration  a major sticking point among those who supported the Brexit referendum last year. But thats incompatible with the E.U.s central tenets of the four freedoms, May explained: Let me be clear, May declared, what I am proposing cannot mean remaining in the single market. Instead, May said, Britain would negotiate a bold and ambitious new trade agreement that would give Britain access to the European single market  though she did not mention many details on how that might play out. May, however, explicitly said that a no Brexit deal was better than a bad deal for Britain, and warned Europe against any punitive measures it might take during its exit. May tried to add a little muscle to the threat, saying if the European Union did not negotiate a favorable trade deal, or tried to block access to the single market, Britain would set the competitive tax rates and embrace the policies that would attract the worlds best companies  essentially transforming itself into a tax haven, according to the harsh criticism from Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn: Brexiters likely found a lot to like in Mays speech; its opponents, including many in the Labour Party, not so much.

Then, thanks to BuzzFeed, we learned that the alleged compromising information included a video tape of Trump doing something involving sex workers, urine, and a bed the Obamas once slept in. Its not clear who leaked word of these salacious allegations. The dossier that BuzzFeed published had been commissioned by Trumps opponents during the 2016 campaign, and had been circulating among journalists and political operatives  as well as intelligence officials  for months. It is possible that CNN would have needed an intelligence-community source to report that our spy agencies had briefed Trump on the dossier. But the list of people who could have sent the documents themselves to BuzzFeed extends well into the private sector. Nonetheless, Donald Trump decided to pin the blame on the intelligence agencies he will soon rely upon  and in the most incendiary possible terms. These remarks did not endear the president-elect to outgoing CIA director John Brennan. And in an interview with Fox News Sunday, Brennan did not mince words when assessing the incoming presidents command of geopolitics. I dont think he has a full understanding of Russian capabilities and the actions they are taking on the world, the CIA director said. Mr. Trump has to understand that absolving Russia is a road that he needs to be very, very careful about moving down. Brennan also decried Trumps assumption that the intelligence community was leaking or releasing this information, arguing that it had been circulating for many months, and thus, was already out there. Trump responded by observing that several bad things happened in the world while Brennan was running the CIA  and that this (somehow) amounted to evidence that Brennan was the mystery leaker. The CIA director then turned his indignation up to 11, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. Tell the families of those 117 CIA officers who are forever memorialized on our wall of honor that their loved ones who gave their lives were akin to Nazis, Brennan said, referring to Trumps days-old tweet. Tell the CIA officers who are serving in harms way right now and their families who are worried about them that they are akin to Nazi Germany. I found that to be very repugnant, and I will forever stand up for the integrity and patriotism of my officers who have done much over the years to sacrifice for their fellow citizens. This is all remarkable for a number of reasons. Most obviously, the outgoing CIA director and incoming president are publicly describing each other as repugnant and incompetent, on the one hand, and ineffectual and Nazi-esque, on the other. While Trump wont need to rely on Brennan in the coming years, hell presumably need to rely on some of the old directors loyalists. That Trump is choosing to further heighten tensions with the CIA, days before he takes office, seems inauspicious  both for his relationship with the intelligence community, and for the prospects of the next commander-in-chief responding rationally to attacks on his ego. But Trump isnt the only one who made some curious remarks during this exchange. Brennan claims that the information in the dossier was already out there, and so theres no reason to suspect the intelligence community was involved in its publication. But as Marcy Wheeler notes, the last report in the dossier is dated December 13, 2016  many months after the FBI first got wind of the documents. Which is to say: The iteration of the dossier that leaked was a newly updated one, a fact that shrinks the pool of people who could have leaked it. Further, in his interview with the Journal, Brennan claimed that he hasnt even read the dossier. Which is odd, if true, for reasons Wheeler aptly summarizes: Whatever Brennans intentions, the whole situation is deeply weird. So weird, you almost have to wonder whether were living in Nazi Germany  if youre the incoming leader of the free world, anyway."}, {"date": "2017/01/17", "title": "Trump Health Plan Is So Top Secret HHS Pick Reportedly Doesnt Know Whats in It", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-hhs-pick-doesnt-know-whats-in-his-secret-health-plan.html", "text": " Over the weekend, Donald Trump revealed that he has an Obamacare replacement plan that will provide insurance for everybody.

Republicans have denounced the law for shortcomings that their own plans would all exacerbate, and have taken advantage of widespread confusion about what the law does and whom it benefits  a posture that works only as long as Republicans can avoid responsibility for the status quo. Democrats have the chance to defend and safeguard Obamacares successes if they leverage this Republican vulnerability. In fact, they have four chances. The next phase of the fight over American health care will be confusing. It will unfold over numerous votes and many months (or, more likely, years). But every strategy involves using the GOPs political weakness against it with the goal of getting the best possible outcome for the people helped by Obamacare. 1. Defeat repeal and delay. Republicans have a two-step plan. First, they will vote to defund Obamacare through a budget-reconciliation bill that cant be filibustered. Then their replacement plan will be voted on later. The repeal vote is the easiest step in the Republican plan, but its still not very easy. Republicans will repeal the law and delay the effects of the repeal for a long period (the most current reporting suggests three years). A vote to repeal Obamacare without clarity about its replacement will threaten massive chaos in the health-care market. Not only will millions of Americans lose their access to medical care but, even worse (from a Republican perspective), doctors, hospitals, and insurers will face the risk of massive losses. Several Republicans have threatened to oppose a bill that repeals Obamacare without simultaneously replacing it, and the party can only afford to lose two votes. Last week, Senate Republicans started bleeding votes, as some half-dozen of their members indicated deep reservations about repeal-and-delay. GOP leaders yanked them back into line on a procedural vote by promising that the deadline for the real repeal vote could be extended. But there remains a real chance the repeal strategy could collapse at step one. 2. Negotiate for minimal changes. Republicans hope that defunding Obamacare on a delay will pressure Democrats into giving them cover for the kinds of unpopular changes Republicans want to make to the system  which means letting insurers sell skimpy plans, with lower subsidies, creating sky-high premiums and deductibles that leave medical coverage far less affordable to people who are either poor or sick. The expiration of the phase-out will be a cliff. Trump has said that he thinks he can force at least eight Democrats, which is the number his party needs to write a new health-care bill, to support his plan by convincing voters to blame them if Obamacare ends. But this is preposterous. Voters always hold the governing party accountable for bad outcomes. Remember, many of the people who would lose their care voted for Trump and expect him to protect or even strengthen their insurance. Assuming repeal-and-delay passes, Democrats should treat it as if the Republican government has set off a time bomb that would blow up its majority. Of course, expiration of Obamacare without any plan to replace it would create a humanitarian catastrophe as well. So if Republicans want to agree to some package of small fixes that preserves the laws main accomplishments, Democrats might take such a deal. Then, basically, Obamacare will have been rebranded as Trumpcare. A handful of hard-core anti-government ideologues on the right would howl. But, given that vanishingly few Republicans have any idea what Obamacare does, they could easily be convinced that Trumpcare is amazing, even if it is 95 percent the same as Obamacare. 3. Push for extension. Assuming steps one and two fail, and no deal can be struck, at some point, the deadline for Obamacare extension will approach, perhaps at the end of 2019. Republicans will not want to head into the 2020 elections having presided over a catastrophic failure, with news coverage of suffering, death, and failing hospitals and insurers. Trump would have broken his promise to replace Obamacare with a terrific alternative that takes care of everybody. Lobbyists for insurers, doctors, and hospitals will exert overwhelming pressure to simply extend Obamacares deadline, which could be done by the same majority vote that repealed the law. The extensions would continue until Trump leaves office. 4. Repeal the repeal. If all the above steps fail, there is one final recourse. Assume Obamacare is repealed and no replacement emerges. (Or perhaps the replacement is a handful of hoary Republican measures, like Health Savings Accounts, that do little or nothing to cover people who cant afford insurance.) Either way, Democrats will have a clear path forward to undoing whatever Republicans do to their system. The disaster of repeal-without-replace could easily be broad enough to power the kind of anti-incumbent wave that produced the last Democratic majority, in 2006 and 2008. Possibly, Democrats will have to wait longer than until 2020 to regain their control of government. But the legislative dynamic will have changed for good. Its important to recall that the filibuster is the reason health-care reform was out of reach for decades. Democrats could have passed health-care reform under Bill Clinton, or possibly earlier, if not for the Senates 60-vote requirement. They finally overcame that threshold in 2009 by mustering 60 Senate votes. Republicans might defund their bill with 50 votes, but they wont have 60 votes to eliminate the insurance regulations it created. That means Democrats can pass reform again with only 50 Senate votes. That opportunity will come. And if Trumps government screws up badly enough, it will probably arrive sooner rather than later. 4 Different Ways Democrats Can Save Obamacare"}, {"date": "2017/01/16", "title": "Tom Price Introduced Bill to Help Company After Buying Stock", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/tom-price-introduced-bill-to-help-company-after-buying-stock.html", "text": " Georgia Congressman Tom Price is proving that when it comes to flouting conflicts of interest, he and Donald Trump have a lot in common.

Later, the companys PAC donated to Price, CNN reports. The company is Zimmer Biomet, a leading producer of hip- and knee-replacements. In March of 2016, Price bought between $1,001 to $15,000 worth of stock in the Indiana-based company, according to CNN. Then, before the month was over, he introduced the HIP Act, which would have delayed changes sure to affect the bottom line of Zimmer Biomet. It clearly has the appearance of using your influence as a congressman to your financial benefit, Larry Noble of Campaign Legal Center told CNN. If he believed in the bill, he should not have purchased the stock. Appearances only got worse as 2016 went on and Zimmer Biomets PAC cut Price a check for $1,000. The Trump transition team defended Price on Monday evening. Spokesman Phillip Blando told the New York Times that a broker bought the stock and Price had no knowledge or input. Blando also issued a statement saying Any effort to connect the introduction of bipartisan legislation by Dr Price to any campaign contribution is demonstrably false. Nevertheless, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for an investigation by the Office of Congressional Ethics into whether Price might have violated a law that bars members of Congress from engaging in insider trading.

On Twitter alone, Trump has 20 million followers, compared to the 13.5 million on the @POTUS account. Just for kicks, lets check in on @BarackObama. Oh, he has four times as many as Trump. Ouch.

If theyd only held off by a few hours, they would have realized theres no reason to fear that millions of people will lose their health coverage, as Donald Trump has almost completed his secret plan to provide insurance for everybody. Its been nearly seven years since Republicans came up with the phrase repeal and replace, and while Congress just began the repeal process, theyve never coalesced around a replacement plan. Trump has said surprisingly little about how he wants to overhaul the law he frequently calls a disaster. Ahead of last weeks vote, Senator Bob Corker had to ask the president-elect to consider tweeting it out very clearly whether or not hes in favor of repealing and replacing the law simultaneously. Now Trump has revealed to the Washington Post that he not only has a plan, but its solved conundrums that have long vexed health-care experts. Trump said his health-care strategy offers lower numbers, much lower deductibles. And it will be affordable. There was a philosophy in some circles that if you cant pay for it, you dont get it. Thats not going to happen with us, he said. But specifically, what will Trumpcare look like? Its unclear, but those covered under the new law can expect to have great health care. It will be in a much simplified form. Much less expensive and much better, Trump explained. He cautioned, however, that even if you like your plan under the Affordable Care Act, you cant keep it. Itll be another plan. But theyll be beautifully covered. I dont want single-payer. What I do want is to be able to take care of people, he said. As he mentioned in his press conference last week, Trump thinks lowering drug prices is key to reducing health-care costs nationwide. When asked to explain how hed persuade drug companies to go along, he said it would be just like on the airplane, referring to factually incorrect tweets about canceling a nonexistent order for a new Air Force One jet. Trump did not say how his plan differs from the proposal put forward by House Republicans last year, but he said hed unveil his strategy alongside House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Hes just waiting for the confirmation of his Health and Human Services secretary (whose Senate hearing hasnt been scheduled yet). While some may be skeptical that Trump actually came up with a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare, which took 15 months to implement, in a matter of weeks, he assured the Post that its very much formulated down to the final strokes. And Republican lawmakers better be ready to get onboard. I think we will get approval. I wont tell you how, but we will get approval, Trump declared. You see whats happened in the House in recent weeks, he added, referring to the backlash against the GOPs effort to gut the House ethics office earlier this month, which may have been influenced by a Trump tweet. So to sum up, Trumps Obamacare replacement is definitely not imaginary, it will allow every American to be beautifully covered, and presidential Twitter bullying will be key to its implementation. Trump must be confident that all of this will come to pass. If not, why tie himself to the arduous Obamacare reform effort with a memorable promise like insurance for everybody?"}, {"date": "2017/01/16", "title": "After Trumps Feud With Lewis, More Democratic Lawmakers Boycott Inauguration", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/after-trump-lewis-feud-more-democrats-boycott-inauguration.html", "text": " For weeks the controversy surrounding Donald Trumps inauguration has mostly focused on the performers who refuse to participate, but now a sizable number of lawmakers are skipping the event too.

Lewis started the feud in an interview released Friday, telling Meet the Press that he doesnt consider Trump a legitimate president. I think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected. And they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton, Lewis said. Lewis also said that he would be skipping the inauguration for the first time in his three-decade congressional career.

Representative Mike Coffman, who co-wrote an op-ed in the Denver Post championing the full repeal of Obamacare on Friday, was overwhelmed by constituents at his own constituent-event in the town of Aurora on Saturday, so much so that he ultimately opted to sneak out of the event early rather than face the as many as 100 disgruntled people still waiting to speak with him. Many of the constituents had come to the meeting to voice their concerns to Coffman over the likely repeal of the ACA. Because the congressman and his staff opted to meet with people in small groups, rather than all at once, scores were stuck waiting in the lobby of the Aurora Public Library, where Coffmans office had reserved a room for the meeting. According to local media reports, Coffman met constituents in groups of only four people, instead of everyone all at once using a town-hall-style meeting. His chief of staff later insisted that was by design, as the congressman has typically used the regularly scheduled meetings to meet individually with constituents. But whatever number of constituents Coffman was expecting, a lot more  as many as 200 people  showed up to meet with him in the community room his staff had reserved. While Coffmans staff say they met with 70 people before running out of time, many more seem to have been stranded in the library lobby, where they chanted and sang as they waited  cell-phone cameras running  and some gave interviews to a crew from 9NEWS Denver, who reported on the event. The resulting news segment is unlikely to make Coffmans highlight reel, particularly because they recorded him leaving the event, six minutes before its scheduled end, rushing to a running car through a side door, which local police had apparently blocked off with crime-scene tape. It was not a profile in political courage by any measure: Coffmans staff says they only booked the room at the library for a typically-sufficient 90 minutes, and were frustrated they didnt have more time to meet with everyone. They invited those constituents who went unheard to attend future meetings, which Coffmans staff will book extra time for. Many constituents were nonetheless angry that the congressman didnt speak with everyone together once he realized how many people had come to the event. At the heart of the scathing 9NEWS segment, which you can watch in full here, was an emotional interview with a woman named Berthie Ruoff. Ruoff, who was unable to meet with Coffman, said she had come to express her fears that she would lose her insurance once Obamacare was repealed, noting that she had a preexisting condition, being a breast-cancer survivor, and that her spouse who had health insurance had passed away. Whats going to happen to me? she asks in the interview. What am I supposed to do? Republicans in the House and Senate have already begun moving to repeal the ACA, but while Trump and GOP lawmakers have insisted they will also replace the law, they dont seem to have actually figured out, or at least agreed, what to replace Obamacare with. Coffman represents an emerging swing district in Colorado, and he ran an ad in August vowing to stand up to Donald Trump should Trump be elected, then remarked after the election that I am excited about the next two years and look forward to working with the president. Though Coffmans run-in with constituents on Saturday was only one small event in one congressional district, and its not clear if similar popular backlash will strike other proponents of Obamacares repeal, its important to recall that the backlash to Obamacare originally took shape, and eventually became the Tea Party movement, when conservatives overwhelmed Democratic lawmakers at constituent town halls in 2009. That political wave helped deliver the House back into the hands of Republicans in 2010 and paved the way to the populist political movement that made Donald Trump a presidential nominee. Its not at all clear if progressive organizers will be able to duplicate that scale of success, should they want to and try to, but if President-elect Trump and the GOP repeal the ACA without an adequate replacement, or muck up an attempt at entitlement or tax reform, it might provide a populist spark for Democrats and their allies."}, {"date": "2017/01/15", "title": "Trump May Kick the White House Press Corps Out of the White House", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-may-evict-the-press-corps-from-the-white-house.html", "text": " Three senior Trump officials have told Esquire that the incoming administration is seriously considering a plan to evict the White House press corps from the White House press briefing room, where its been housed since the Nixon administration. Under the plan, the press corps would apparently be moved to an adjacent facility like the White House Conference Center or the Old Executive Office Building. Trumps press secretary, Sean Spicer, told Esquire that though the plan hasnt been decided on yet, the potential move was motivated by a desire to accommodate the outsized interest in Trump, allowing more members of media to attend press conferences. Meanwhile, another (unnamed) Trump official told the magazine that the potential relocation was in fact motivated by the new administration wanting to take back the press room because the media is no longer neutral and has instead become the opposition party on account of how hostile they have been to Trump. I want em out of the building, the official said. Trumps White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, however, echoed Spicers rationale when asked about the possible plan on Sundays Meet the Press, saying that the move would be about quadrupling the amount of reporters that can cover our press conferences. He also argued that the media wouldnt actually be removed from the White House since they would still be on White House property, just not in the physical White House itself. Last month, Priebus had told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that Team Trump might reject long-standing traditions regarding how the administration will interact with the press. Current White House media practices are not legally required, but simply a norm that administrations have long respected (and Trump has yet to encounter a norm he has shown any interest in respecting). The White House Correspondents Association is, unsurprisingly, less than pleased with the potential plan: Its not clear what would happen with the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House if the Trump administration evicts the press, but CNN reports that Trump officials are saying that the Press Corps may be able to keep their West Wing basement workstations and broadcast journalists would still be able to shoot segments on the White Houses North Lawn. Of course, the Trump campaign and the president-elect have been infamously hostile toward the press for virtually all of Trumps campaign and transition period. Just last week, Trump disparaged and dismissed two news organizations, CNN and Buzzfeed, during a press conference because they had published articles about an unverified dossier alleging that Russian intelligence officials have successfully compromised Trump in order to blackmail him. After CNNs Jim Acosta tried to ask a question several times only to be repeatedly rebuffed by Trump  who called CNN a fake news organization  Spicer reportedly threatened Acosta and said he would be removed from the press conference if he didnt keep quiet. That was Trumps first press conference in 167 days, and joining the press in the room were Trump staffers  who acted as a cheering section for Trump after some of his statements. Following that line of thinking, its possible that the Trump administrations stated desire to house more members of the media at press conferences might in fact mean they want the ability to include more members of the Trump-friendly media, which Spicers official statement to CNN on Sunday would seem to hint at, in that he said the administration was looking to have additional capacity to accommodate members of media including talk radio, bloggers and others. Its also worth remembering that excluding the media was a regular feature of the Trump campaign, as journalists and news organizations were routinely blacklisted by Trumps staff from getting credentials for campaign events and restricted to an isolated area when they were allowed in. In addition, Trump himself regularly called out and disparaged members of his press pool during campaign appearances, and even threatened lawsuits and  should he become president  executive action, over stories he deemed as false and unfair.

Trump, who indicated helping us would include something like cooperation with the U.S. in the war on terrorism, also insisted that the sanctions, which President Obama imposed in retaliation for Russias alleged interference in the U.S. presidential election, would remain in place at least for a period of time. Trump also noted that he would be willing to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin soon after taking office, remarking, I understand that they would like to meet, and thats absolutely fine with me. Indeed, The Sunday Times reported on Saturday that according to British officials, the Trump transition team and the Kremlin have already been planning a summit, to happen within weeks of Trump taking office. According to the Times sources, the plan was to have Trumps first foreign trip as president be to Iceland to meet with Putin in order to reset U.S.-Russia relations  though that was later rejected as false by both the Kremlin and Trump aides. Trumps sanctions comments to the Journal follow his first-ever admission, during a press conference on Wednesday, that he agreed with the assessment of the U.S. intelligence community that Russia was indeed behind the hacks of the Democratic Party and its operatives over the last few years. Up until Wednesday, the president-elect had repeatedly cast doubt on Russias involvement in the hacks and regularly disparaged the U.S. intelligence community for saying otherwise  at least until he attended a recent briefing to hear their findings. In other Russia-related news, Senator Richard Burr, the Republican chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, announced late on Friday that his committee will now investigate possible contact between the Trump campaign and Russia, just a day after saying his opposed such an investigation. The investigation will look into counterintelligence concerns related to Russia and the 2016 U.S. election, including any intelligence regarding links between Russia and individuals associated with political campaigns. The ranking Democrat on the committee, Senator Mark Warner, joined Burr in a statement announcing the probe, which could lead to subpoenas of officials in the Trump campaign and Obama administration, as well as private or open hearings. Burr had previously said the investigation should be left to the FBI. The bipartisan announcement of the probe follows a classified briefing on Friday between members of Congress and embattled FBI director James Comey, during which Comey apparently refused to confirm whether or not the FBI was in fact investigating the possible links between Moscow and members of the Trump team, enraging Democrats. Democratic lawmakers in the House and Senate have also been calling for an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate Russian interference in the election, but those calls have been rebuffed by the GOP thus far. On Friday, Congressman John Lewis publicly rejected Trumps legitimacy as president, with the influential Georgia Democrat insisting to NBC News that, I think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected. And they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. Trump subsequently struck back on Twitter, claiming Lewis was failing his constituents and dismissing the civil-rights icon as All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. As it turns out, the Senate Intelligence Committee, and possibly the FBI, arent the only organizations looking into possible links between the Trump team and Russia. BuzzFeed, which controversially published an unverified dossier alleging that the Russian intelligence community has collected compromising information about President-elect Trump in order to blackmail him, reported on Friday that Israel and at least one Western European country are looking into the allegations of ties between Trump and Moscow as well. According to a British intelligence source who spoke with the Sunday Times, the U.K. is treading carefully as well. Until we have established whether Trump and senior members of his team can be trusted, were going to hold back, they said. Putting it bluntly, we cant risk betraying sources and methods to the Russians. News also broke on Friday that Donald Trumps national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, has been in regular contact with Russias ambassador to the U.S. over the past several weeks, including multiple calls conducted on the day President Obama imposed the new sanctions on Russia. There may have been as many as five calls between Flynn and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak on that day, though the Trump transition team would only confirm one, and they insisted the exchange had nothing to do with the newly imposed sanctions. Contact between an incoming White House administration and foreign diplomats is not unusual, of course, but whats curious and/or worrisome about the calls is that Putin quickly decided against retaliating over the new sanctions, a response which President-elect Trump then praised, adding that, I always knew [Putin] was very smart! Trumps national security advisor, Flynn, has previously faced accusations of being too close to the Kremlin, on account of having once been paid to give a speech by the RT news network, a state-run Russian news organization and propaganda outlet on which Flynn has made multiple appearances. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, thousands of U.S. troops arrived in Europe this week, including 4,000 deployed to Poland, a move the U.S. is promoting as an indication of its unequivocal support for NATO, as well a deterrent against Russian aggression in the region. Some 82 percent of American adults, including 84 percent of Democrats and 82 percent of Republicans, consider Russia to pose a threat to America, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll.

That water landing was deftly handled by the planes heroic captain, Chesley Sully Sullenberger, and as a result, none of the 155 people onboard the Airbus A320 were injured in the crash. The dramatic event became known as the Miracle on the Hudson, and was eventually turned into a major film starring Tom Hanks. But while all the humans, and most film critics, emerged from the incident unscathed, an Associated Press investigation has calculated the enormous avian death toll since Captain Sullys miracle on January 15, 2009. Following the crash, both Newark and LaGuardia  where Flight 1549 had just taken off from  subsequently ramped up their bird-killing programs in an effort to prevent future tragedies. As for Kennedy Airport, their total kill count has actually ticked down, but they already had, in the APs words, a robust slaughter program prior to the US Airways crash since the airport sits on a major bird-migration route. Possibly as a result of increased awareness about the bird-collision threat, bird-strike reports nearly doubled at LaGuardia and Newark in the six years following the crash  to nearly 300 a year. They went up at JFK, too, but most important, there have been no additional bird-related crashes since the Miracle. The price of that safety, however, has been some 28,000 seagulls, 16,800 European starlings, 6,000 brown-headed cowbirds, 4,500 mourning doves, and 1,830 Canada geese, as well as other species. Unsurprisingly, its the larger bird species that typically represent the biggest threats to planes, such as the Canada geese that took down Flight 1549: Most of the 70,000 birds were killed using shooting and trapping programs, but there are nonlethal ways of controlling bird populations, as well. New York airports make use of trap and relocation schemes, habitat modification, pyrotechnics, and even lasers to drive the birds away, and bird advocates are also pushing for improved radar systems to help mitigate the need for lethal programs, but aviation officials seem understandably content prioritizing human safety, regardless of the animal cost."}, {"date": "2017/01/13", "title": "David Brock Is Ready to Monetize the Resistance", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/david-brock-is-ready-to-monetize-the-resistance.html", "text": " David Brock has decided to lead the part of the #Resistance that involves throwing parties for tech billionaires.

The summit is intended to mirror the one the billionaire oilmen held in January 2009, when all the pundits were pretty sure that America would never elect a charismatic but incompetent conservative again.

Brock acknowledges that there already is a network of liberal megarich people who imagine themselves as a countervailing force to the Kochs called the Democracy Alliance. But, per Brock, Democracy Matters is different in one key way. The DA has veered away from politics, Brock told BuzzFeed. This conference is openly political. At this point, you may be thinking, In what sense is a donor network that gives to progressive political groups around the country not openly political? The answer seems to be that Brock has a very narrow definition of politics, and intends his organization to focus entirely on electoral politics, rather than issue-based movement building. At next weeks summit, donors will receive insights into how Democrats can begin their march back to power in 2018 from such cutting-edge progressive thinkers as former congressman Harold Ford Jr., some guy who works at Third Way (a centrist think tank that scientists once believed to have gone extinct in the early Obama period), the Republican who advised George W.

From now on, anything Republicans in Congress do to the Affordable Care Act will involve actual changes in law and budgeting, not vague and non-binding spending targets and abstract instructions to look for savings. It must also come to grips with all the huge problems associated with ending one massive health-care program and creating another. These range from what to do about purchasing exchanges, purchasing subsidies, provider subsidies, and the problems of people with preexisting health conditions, to sorting out the interests of states that did and did not accept the ACA Medicaid expansion, to deciding how to cope with the taxes and fees that paid for the whole thing and might be useful in paying for a replacement. Sure, Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell could get around some of their Obamacare replacement problems by taking other must-pass legislation hostage, such as reauthorization of the Childrens Health Insurance Program (CHIP). But that would involve trading one set of headaches for another. Republicans can no longer paper over divisions by punting decisions on down the road. In part, thats because Congress now has to deal with Donald J. Trump in direct and concrete negotiations aimed at securing his signature on the final product, with, it is assumed, his warring staffers and cabinet in concurrence since this could be the most important thing the administration does this or any year. So there probably should not be a lot of celebrating at this first step being completed without bloodshed. The path ahead for Republicans is enough of a minefield that they may privately wish they had lost the election and could go back to casting votes without consequences."}, {"date": "2017/01/13", "title": "Comey Wont Tell House Dems Whether the FBI Is Investigating Trumps Russia Ties", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/comey-wont-tell-house-dems-about-trump-russia-investigation.html", "text": " During an appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier this week, James Comey was asked whether the FBI was investigating Donald Trumps ties to the Russian government. I would never comment on investigations  whether we have one or not  in an open forum like this, Comey said. So I really cant answer one way or another. Which led every Democrat in hearing distance to think, Ah, thats right, James. You would never do that. If theres one thing I know about James Comey, its that he never comments on the existence of investigations in open forums. Even kids know that. In fact, I often ask my many small children, Hey, sweet babies, whats the one thing James Comey never does? And they all immediately shout in unison, Comment on da existins of investigasions in open fowums!  BECAUSE MY ENTIRE FAMILY CAUGHT MEMENTO DISEASE IN MID-OCTOBER AND HAVE NO RECOLLECTION OF THAT TIME YOU SWUNG AN ELECTION TO AN AUTHORITARIAN INSULT COMIC.  But Democrats bit their tongues, took several deep breaths, and contented themselves with the thought that Comey would at least open up at a confidential briefing on Russian hacking this Friday. And then, per the Guardian, this happened: The Guardian reports that Comey was asked over and over to clarify his standards for acknowledging the existence of an FBI investigation, and that the FBI director repeatedly refused. Democrats left the meeting spitting with rage. I was nonjudgmental until the last 15 minutes. I no longer have that confidence in him, Minnesota Democrat Tim Walz told the Hill. Im extremely concerned  extremely, Marylands Elijah Cummings told the outlet. Ill just  Im very angry, added Mark Takano of California. Georgia congressman John Lewis went several steps further in an interview with NBC News, saying,  I dont see this president-elect as a legitimate president  I think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected. And they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. Earlier this week, the inspector general of the Justice Department announced an investigation into the FBIs handling of its inquiry into Hillary Clintons private email server  including Comeys infamous, late-October letter about all the irrelevant emails he found on Anthony Weiners laptop.

(A full recounting of the case can be found here.) In the story, I relate the impression  shared by many in New Jersey politics  that Kushner was targeted because of his high profile as a major donor to Democratic candidates, especially New Jerseys governor at the time, Jim McGreevey. The elder Kushner first became a prominent player in New Jersey politics in 1997, when he backed McGreevey  then a relative unknown  as he made a surprisingly strong challenge to an incumbent Republican governor, Christine Todd Whitman. Four years later, McGreevey won the office, and appointed Charles Kushner to serve as a board member of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Shortly afterward, he nominated Kushner to serve as the bistate agencys chairman. But Kushners relationship to the governor soon attracted the attention of newspapers, political opponents in the state legislature, and the United States Attorney for New Jersey at the time, Chris Christie. The worst thing in the world is a prosecutor with political ambitions, Richard Codey, a state senator and former governor who is close with Kushner told me. In the article, I write that to many seasoned practitioners of politics in New Jersey, Kushners flaw was his craving for a public role. This morning, Governor McGreevey, who ultimately resigned shortly after Kushners arrest, wrote the editor of this magazine, Adam Moss, to say that the article did not accurately reflect the Charlie Kushner he knows, for whom he still expresses great affection.

Three are historic Civil Rightsera spots in the South; the other two sites are actually expansions of existing monuments in California and Oregon. Two of the honored locations are in Alabama. The first is a section of downtown Birmingham that includes the 16th Street Baptist Church, which the KKK bombed in 1963, and the A.G. Gaston Motel, where Martin Luther King Jr. organized protests in the same year, reports the Associated Press. The Greyhound Bus Station in Anniston, Alabama, where civil-rights activists were attacked in 1961, is now part of the Freedom Riders National Monument. Beaufort, South Carolina, is home to the third new monument, a postbellum church for freed slaves now called the Reconstruction Era National Monument. It is the first such national monument commemorating that period in Americas history. Obama also expanded the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument, originally designated by Bill Clinton, by protecting 48,000 additional acres in Oregon and part of Northern California. The president affixed six new sites along, and on small islands off, the Pacific Coast as part of the California Coastal Monument, which builds on an additional monument Obama designated in 2014. The president has added a record-breaking number of acres  more than 550 million, including at sea  to Americas national monuments. But his actions are also a broader part of Obamas larger presidential legacy. His monuments  like Stonewall Inn in New York City  honor moments of social struggle in American history. I have sought to build a more inclusive National Park System, Obama said in a statement about the new monuments, and ensure that our national parks, monuments and public lands are fully reflective of our nations diverse history and culture. Obama, however, has angered Republicans by his many monument designations, mostly for setting aside huge swaths of land in the West, which makes drilling, farming, logging, and most other commercial activity either very, very limited or prohibited. Protecting America  both its natural treasures and historic sites  had previously been a pretty bipartisan endeavor. Theodore Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act of 1906, which gives presidents the monument-making power; George W. Bush set aside the Marianas Trench in the Pacific Ocean and World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument, which includes the U.S.S. Arizona in Pearl Harbor. (George H.W. Bush, Ronald Reagan, and Richard Nixon, all Republicans, are the only three presidents who never designated monuments.) But under Obama, this executive power became something of a sticking point for the GOP: The 2016 Republican platform included provisions to essentially curb the Antiquities Act and require congressional approval for all new national monuments, and to transfer some public lands back to states. Future President Trump, not surprisingly, has criticized Obama on this issue. He used Obamas designation of a monument in Maine as a rallying point at a campaign stop there. He reportedly said recently he was open to repealing Bears Ears National Monument, a site in Utah that Obama carved out in December. And if that happens, add it to the list of Trumpian precedents: No president has ever repealed a national monument established by a previous administration. Which also makes this a bit of a legal gray area. Some argue what is created by executive action can be undone by one. In 1938, U.S. Attorney General Homer Cummings, a Democrat, wrote an opinion that said presidents couldnt use an executive order to remove a monument designation, but as the San Jose Mercury News points out, the issue has never reached the courts. It might, then, take an act of Congress. At least for now, the votes are probably there, meaning one of Americas greatest domestic achievements  its preservation and protection of its natural resources  could also be trampled under Trump. That, or just get ready for the Big, Beautiful Border Wall National Monument."}, {"date": "2017/01/13", "title": "Is This Trump-Friendly Democratic Senator Fooling Republicans  or Himself?", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/is-trump-friendly-dem-senator-fooling-gop-or-himself.html", "text": " Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia is a Democrat that Republicans look at with an odd combination of friendly and malicious feelings. Theyd love his support to give the GOPs current right-wing agenda the patina of bipartisanship. But what theyd like even more is to take away his seat in 2018. So as Manchin and Republicans in Congress and in the White House continue to make billing and cooing noises at each other on Obamacare and other subjects, theres unquestionably some unsentimental maneuvering underway, on both sides. Can Republicans make use of Manchins vulnerable position back home as a Democrat in a state that went for Donald Trump last November by a shocking 6826 margin? Or can Manchin use bipartisan gestures to strengthen his position back home without doing a lot that materially helps the GOP reach its objectives? Late last year, the former West Virginia governor took the latter fork in the road twice, playing with  before finally rejecting  overtures to change parties and to join the Trump administration as secretary of Energy. In the new year hes kept to the same pattern: He accepted an invitation to join Chuck Schumers Democratic leadership team in the Senate  but he refused to attend a Democrats-only Senate meeting with outgoing President Obama. And he joined other Democrats in a party-line vote against the budget resolution that represented the first step toward the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (a law passed before he entered the Senate, but that he subsequently claimed he would have opposed). At about the same time he was publicly talking about helping the GOP enact an Obamacare replacement plan that would require eight Democratic votes  but was framing that offer as an effort to preserve whats good about the existing system. So far, in other words, Manchin has given Republicans no more than lip service. And perhaps his plan is to keep it that way. After all, he can talk all day long about helping with an Obamacare replacement plan so long as an insufficient number of Democratic colleagues join him to make that a real option. And being open to this or that theoretical bipartisan initiative doesnt sacrifice his ability to sadly deem GOP initiatives (some of which wont poll well back home) inadequate and vote against them just like Bernie Sanders. His role model could well be former senator Olympia Snowe, the Republican moderate who drove the Obama administration crazy with hints and feints about her interest in finding a way to vote for the Affordable Care Act  before voting against it like every other Republican, having banked the impression that she was not a stone partisan like her colleagues. Now if Republicans really wanted to make Manchin a reliable dance partner theyd call off the dogs in West Virginia and give him a more manageable reelection contest in 2018. But there are at least two U.S. House members and a statewide elected official eyeing his seat with bad intent. His approval-rating numbers from his constituents have been pretty solid, and West Virginia, where Jim Justice held on to the governors office for Democrats in November despite the Trump landslide, may be the last redoubt of ticket-splitters. What Manchin must avoid is the fate of Joe Lieberman, who during the George W. Bush administration found himself (in an apt description by Jeffrey Toobin) serving simultaneously as a punching bag and a cheerleader for the Bush White House. So he may soon have to pick sides and live with the consequences."}, {"date": "2017/01/13", "title": "Rex Tillerson Basically Promised the Senate That He Would Start a War With China", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/tillersons-south-china-sea-pledge-would-mean-war.html", "text": " Earlier this week, while national attention was focused on the possibility that Donald Trump has a pee fetish, the likely next secretary of State promised to block Chinas access to its disputed islands in the South China Sea  an action that would almost certainly entail a military confrontation between the worlds two greatest powers. Were going to have to send China a clear signal that, first, the island-building stops, Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Wednesday, likening Chinas activities in the South China Sea to Russias annexation of Crimea. And second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed. China claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea  and thus, most of the 11 billion barrels of oil and 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas that lie beneath it. Vietnam and the Philippines are pretty sure that they actually have a rightful claim to much of that water and untapped energy. And international law, as clarified by a ruling handed down last year, largely agrees. The Obama administration has declined to take a side in these sovereignty disputes, focusing instead on asserting Americas right to move through those waters by sailing warships past Chinas islands in so-called freedom of navigation exercises. Meanwhile, China has sought to solidify its claims by constructing new islands throughout the sea and filling them with radar stations and runways capable of providing safe landing to jumbo jets. So, Beijing is pretty serious about controlling those waters  it is not going to forfeit access to its islands because Rex Tillerson asked Xi Jinping super nicely. Experts who spoke with the Guardian all agreed that Trump could only fulfill Tillersons vow via a significant show of military force. And Chinese state media has offered the same assessment. Unless Washington plans to wage a large-scale war in the South China Sea, any other approaches to prevent Chinese access to the islands will be foolish, the Communist Partycontrolled Global Times wrote in an editorial Friday. If Trumps diplomatic team shapes future Sino-U.S. ties as it is doing now, the two sides had better prepare for a military clash. The implications of Tillersons statement lead the paper to suspect that he merely wanted to curry favor from senators and increase his chances of being confirmed by intentionally showing a tough stance toward China. And that seems like the safe-money bet. Especially since, at other points, Tillerson stressed the importance of Americas economic ties with China and praised it as a a valuable ally in curtailing elements of radical Islam. Whats more, incoming Defense Secretary James Mattis told the Senate Thursday that the U.S. will have to manage the competition between us and China because our military is not, presently, strong enough for us to dominate them. That said, Trump has been nothing but belligerent toward Beijing since becoming president-elect. Beyond threatening to slap massive tariffs on Chinas exports and revoke Americas support for the One China policy, Trump has also staffed his administration with multiple China hard-liners, including Peter Navarro, who has described the nation as a despicable, parasitic, brutal, brass-knuckled, crass, callous, amoral, ruthless and totally totalitarian imperialist power. And as the New York Times notes  if Tillerson feels any residual loyalty to his former employer  hell have significant incentive to play hardball on Chinas sovereignty claims: In 2009, ExxonMobil signed an agreement with the Vietnamese-government-owned firm to drill for oil and gas in parts of the South China Sea that Beijing claims as its own. If America were to pursue a foreign policy dictated by the interests of Exxons shareholders, it would involve softening relations with Russia and confronting China in its disputed waters. A significant faction of Trumps advisers appear interested in such a policy."}, {"date": "2017/01/13", "title": "DOJ Report Rips Chicago Police for Poor Training, Excessive Force, Racial Bias", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/doj-report-rips-chicago-police.html", "text": " For years, Chicago police have violated the civil rights of the citys residents through widespread bias against blacks and repeated use of excessive force, the Justice Department announced on Friday. The conclusions are part of a 164-page report, the result of a 13-month investigation that found a pattern of poorly trained police officers relying too much on the use of force, sometimes deadly, while facing few consequences for their actions. The investigation was launched in the aftermath of the police shooting of teenager Laquan McDonald, who was walking away from the police when he was killed. At the federal courthouse in Chicago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel and federal Attorney General Loretta Lynch said a plan was in the works to fix the problems in Chicago. Lynch, who reportedly hurried to finish the investigation before the end of the Obama administration, said the process of reforming the CPD would continue regardless of who sits atop the Justice Department. But Senator Jeff Sessions, Donald Trumps pick to replace Lynch and a vocal opponent of consent decrees, might have something to say about that. The CPD has used forced nearly ten times more often against blacks than whites. But the problems, the report says, start long before the use of force. Training, both before and during an officers career, is lacking. One use-of-force training video the DOJ reviewed was made decades ago and is not in compliance with current laws or the departments own policies. In interviewing recent graduates of the police academy in Chicago, the DOJ found only one in six came close to properly articulating the legal standard for use of force. Even when the CPD has taken steps to stem the tide of deadly force, it did so ineffectively. The departments supply of Tasers, for example, was expanded last year to provide an option for nonlethal force. But officers failed to use them after they were trained too quickly and without proper curriculum, staff, or equipment. This left many officers who completed the training uncomfortable with how to use Tasers effectively as a less-lethal force option  the very skill the training was supposed to teach, the report says."}, {"date": "2017/01/13", "title": "Watch: Meet the International Space Stations First African-American Crew Member", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/jeanette-epps-the-isss-first-african-american-crew-member.html", "text": "  Dont worry.

But the GOP nominee won the presidency, anyway, because the nonvoting population is large and left-leaning, and because our founding fathers decided that picking presidents by national popular vote would unfairly deny Southern states the right to leverage their slaves into disproportionate political power. And so Trump is headed to the White House, having secured the support of roughly 25 percent of all registered voters, many of whom claimed to dislike him even as they marked his name on their ballots. This, combined with the Republican Partys success at party-building (and gerrymandering) at the state level, leaves us in an odd circumstance: The American electorate has just given the president-elect and his party full control of government, even as a majority of voters disdains them both. A new poll from Politico and the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health illustrates one of the many implications of this strange state of affairs: Trump voters and the general public would like to see the president-elect prioritize very different parts of his platform. Among the president-elects backers, 85 percent say repealing and replacing Obamacare should be a top priority; among the general public, that figure is 44 percent. (A separate Quinnipiac poll, released Friday, finds a mere 18 percent of the public wants to see the Affordable Care Act repealed in its entirety, with a plurality favoring the repeal of just some parts of the law).Similarly, while 78 percent of Trump voters told Politico that they want him to prioritize preventing illegal immigration, just 38 percent of all voters said the same. And while 67 percent of Trumpists want to see major increases in defense spending, only 43 percent of the broader public agrees. The most popular Trump proposal among all voters  new infrastructure spending  is also the least popular among his own backers, although the idea garners roughly 50 percent support from both groups. This divergence in opinion would seem to put Trump in a bind: Delivering for his base and growing its ranks appear to be mutually exclusive goals. However, there is one major policy item on which Trumps supporters and the general public are in overwhelming agreement: More than 80 percent of both groups dont think he should cut taxes on rich people. So, if theres one thing we can be sure of, its that Trump and his party will not prioritize reducing the tax burdens of the wealthy. After all, its not like were living in a failed republic where the preferences of the economic elite carry more weight than those of 80 percent of voters.

One reason is mechanical: They can defund Obamacare with just 50 Senate votes, but they need 60 to rewrite its insurance regulations. The other reason is ideological: Giving people the better coverage they promised, or even minimally acceptable coverage, requires providing resources, and theres no way thats ideologically acceptable to their party to conjure those resources, which is why the unified Republican plan has been stuck in the almost-there stage since 2009. The Republican strategy to solve this dilemma is to coerce Democrats into solving their dilemma for them by repealing Obamacare and blaming Democrats for the disaster caused by the repeal unless they agree to support some kind of Republican proposal  and, by supporting it, neuter their chance to blame Republicans for the outcome. And yet some doubt is already creeping in as to whether this massive hostage-taking scheme can actually work. Their answer to this dilemma is  take even more hostages. Specifically, some very small ones. According to multiple GOP sources, Republicans are looking at whether to use reauthorizations of existing programs, such as the Childrens Health Insurance Program, as vehicles for replacement measures, reports Mike DeBonis in the Washington Post. That could give them leverage to secure cooperation from Democrats. A bit of explanation is required. The Childrens Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, was created in 1998 as part of a deal in which Democrats got health coverage for children and Republicans got a capital-gains tax cut. It has since grown quite popular, and insures 8 million children from low-income families. In 2015, it was reauthorized by a vote of 39237 in the House and 928 in the Senate. It needs to be reauthorized again at the end of this year or it will expire. The leverage for Republicans to secure cooperation from Democrats for their plan to give people cheaper, skimpier insurance than Obamacare offers is to threaten to end the Childrens Health Insurance Program. Apparently the idea is that its not enough to threaten to throw millions of adults off their insurance. You also need to have some sick children to threaten as well. Now, the notion that this will actually compel Democrats to support a painful Republican plan, as opposed to simply making the Republican Party even more unpopular, seems quite fanciful. But its the kind of idea you settle on if you truly have no better options."}, {"date": "2017/01/13", "title": "The Fear of a White Black Bush", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/the-fear-of-a-white-black-bush.html", "text": " Three months before a little-known Illinois state senator named Barack Obama made his now-historic keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, the final episode aired of the second and final full season of Chappelles Show. The last sketch of the last episode of that last full season was Black Bush. The skit was Dave Chappelle having his turn at one of the classic black comedian bits: imagining the fantasy world of a black president in the United States of America. As a scenario, it was always ripe for hyperbole, since the idea of it actually happening was, for so long, far-fetched. There are two sides to the Black Bush sketch, both acknowledged in Chappelles opening monologue on that episode. First, he notes, a black president wouldnt be able to get away with the stuff Bush (or white presidents in general) did without getting barraged with thousands of questions. Second, a time-honored tradition in black comedy is to play with the idea of what peak foolishness would look like if black people had the societal cloak of invincibility that whites have had for centuries. The sketch still holds up, but its impossible to view it the same since Barack Obama was elected president. Obama messed up every black-president comedy routine. Was his every move questioned? Yes. Did he walk on the thinnest of ice, something his predecessors were able to often avoid? Yes. But as we near the final days of Barry, its a reminder that he never fell through, never succumbed, and never acted without poise. During the Obama years, watching Black Bush was like seeing an artifact, reaching back to a time when we couldnt imagine life without a black president. The laughs were still there, because the skit is still hysterical, even if its prediction was slightly off. But then something odd happened  an unwelcome surprise that made Black Bush feel relevant again. In Chappelles monologue, he says, You know, they always do polls like, Minorities just dont seem to trust the government. Because you dont understand what it looks like for us. With Trump, many white Americans are learning what it looks like: a group of powerful white people doing and saying whatever and getting away with it. In many corners of white America, there was a strong belief that this doing and saying whatever recklessness would happen if a black person ever became president. But as we all prepare to become citizens of Trumpmenistan, somehow this character Chappelle created has captured what ultimately is happening when you go back to a white president. Obama has not done a single thing that the Black Bush character did. Everything Trump does, however, feels eerily synced with this fictional, comedic caricature of what a terrible president could be. Follow me as I outline why real-life Trump is the fictional Black Bush, but even worse  hes white. An exchange, while Black Bush is sitting with his associates, in a hearing: Black Bush: After carefully examining the region, me and my cabinet agree that that area is definitely right for regime change.Black Rumsfeld: All right?Black Bush: But, if I can be real about it?Black Rumsfeld: Be real, son.Black Bush: Real?Black Rumsfeld: Be real, real, son.Black Bush: He tried to kill my father, man.Black Rumsfeld: What?Black Bush: I dont play that shit!Black Rumsfeld: Say word he tried to kill your father, son. Black Bush: He tried to kill my father, man.Black Rumsfeld: What?Black Bush: I dont play that shit!Black Rumsfeld: Word on everything we love, we coming to see yall, son. For a moment, just entertain a world in which Donald Trump finds out a foreign leader made fun of his haircut. Or some prime minister is overheard saying, Melania does not have the range. Or some innocent civilian in a brown country tweets that Barron cant read. You think Donald is going to let that come and go? No, because hes a goon, and goons react. And when your existence is reacting, you pull down your figurative boom mic by way of tweeting substandard SoundCloud bars in the middle of the night and then one of your flunkies probably begins the process of making that person who hurt your feelings, oh, I dont know, disappear. In the Chappelle skit, its like  oh, wait, why is Black Bush hanging out with Black Tony Blair, who is wearing a robe, looking very relaxed, almost as if theyre best buds who talk about things they shouldnt be talking about? In real life, heres Nigel Farage: Also, theres the whole Trump and Putin thing, but moving on  Black Bush, at the lectern: The nigga bought aluminum tubes. Do I need to tell you what the fuck you can do with an aluminum tube? ALUMINUM. Whats he talking about? Seems kind of random and unhinged? So far, so Trump. More: That dont scare you? Fine, I didnt want to say this  The motherfucker bought some yellow cake. Okay? In Africa. He went to Africa and bought yellow cake. Ever been listening to Trump and you dont know where hes going with a point and its not really about anything, but if youre in a Trump room it somehow works? Well, Trumps wall is Black Bushs yellow cake. And then, after the cake, a reporter raises her hand and she asks, Are you sure? Black Bush: Yes, Im sure, bitch. Its like Chappelle knew about 2016 a decade ago. This scene ends with the Black Head of the CIA actually bringing the highly classified, very dangerous yellow cake to the briefing, with some black dude (Ben Carson) also present and someone given a job in the inner circle for no apparent reason (Rudy Giuliani) repeatedly telling him not to drop that shit. This is our future, people. In the sketchs most famous scene, it is revealed that the president was playing conspiratorial war games with the Middle East because of oil. Black Bush, when faced with a direct question about it, gets outraged  then bolts out of the room. If you dont see this and think about the press conference that Trump JUST HAD then Id love to visit the rock you currently Airbnb under. Hes still in the stage of talking and yelling and insulting his way out of situations, but when he finally gets away from the podium  wait for it. Hes running. In this scene, he tells the U.N. that if they have a problem with the way hes behaving, they can sanction him with their army  and then jokingly notes that they dont have an army. Following that, a message to the U.N.: It doesnt matter if you are part of the United States government, if you come after Trump he will come after you. Black Bush then notes that hed never take orders from an African (referring to Kofi Annan), which Im sure Trump has said in the past 48 hours. And then he says, I know Gucci when I see it, nigga, Im rich. The two men are the same person. Still not convinced? The next exchange should do the trick: Black Bush: Ive got a coalition of the willing, Ive got 40 nations, ready to roll, son.Reporter: Like who?Black Bush: Who the fuck said that? [Looking around the room, ready to fight.] This happened, TODAY. Trump [to CNNs Jim Acosta, refusing to call on him for a question]: Your organization is terrible  you are fake news. The reporter also noted that he was told hed be thrown out. I cant lie  I think Trump wakes up, unplugs the USB out his back, puts on his hair, and then watches Black Bush to get ready for the day. Its the only explanation. IMAGINE DONALD J. TRUMP GIVING A WARTIME VICTORY SPEECH. I know, the horror, right? Well, if he did, itd probably go something this: Black Bush [in military outfit]: [Clears throat] What did I say? Im not gloating, but what did I say? Did I not say that we would win that shit? We ROCKED them bamas. We ROCKED THEM. Nigga, you see me come in on that plane? A reporter asks Black Bush during a press conference about Iraq and Black Bush flips out: Damn, I knew I shouldnt have called on this nigga. I shouldnt have called on you because you always trying to distract motherfuckers with things like the war and skirt all the real issues  Gay people are getting married, folks. Yes. Nasty. Classic Trump move, both hating the idea of a White House press corps and then saying that people are distracting the public from the real issues, the real issues being his distractions from the actual real issues. Black Bush proceeds to talk in great detail about titty balls, saying caressing them, gently stroking those nipples till they get so  STIFF. And ERECT. Blowing on them. Ive got a lot of papers on my desk and Im 95 percent sure one of them is a dossier of Trump saying that exact sentence. Black Bush finishes the sketch with the most Trump line of them all: You cant be distracted with whats going on with the war or whats wrong with the economy  stop worrying about that, I GOT THAT SHIT UNDER CONTROL. Lets focus on space, nigga. The United States of Space. Because I aint stopping at the moon. WRITE THIS DOWN  M, A, R, S, Mars, bitches, thats where we are going, Mars, RED ROCKS. Looking back at this sketch, its clear why Trump is so terrifying: The worst possible scenario for a modern-day president is being a white Black Bush."}, {"date": "2017/01/13", "title": "Chaffetz Goes After Ethics Watchdog Who Dared to Criticize Trump", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/chaffetz-goes-after-ethics-watchdog-who-criticize-trump.html", "text": " Just after the Access Hollywood video was released, Representative Jason Chaffetz unendorsed Donald Trump, saying, Im not going to put my good name and reputation, and my family behind Donald Trump for President when he acts like this. I just cant do it. But once the whole grab-em-by-the-pussy thing started to blow over, Chaffetz decided that he actually could bring himself to vote Trump. Still, Chaffetz stressed, he would not compromise his morals by defending Trumps behavior. Earlier this week, he declared that, as chairman of the House Oversight committee, My job in this role is not to protect or be a cheerleader for the president. Its just not. Im not here to defend him at every turn. So how did Chaffetz respond to Trumps widely panned plan for handling his business while in office? By praising the president-elect and issuing veiled threats against a federal ethics watchdog who dared to publicly criticize him. Chaffetz believes that by letting his sons run his business, Trump is going to great lengths to be as responsible as possible and comply with the law. Ethics lawyers from both parties disagreed, and Walter Shaub, director of the Office of Government Ethics, an independent federal watchdog, took the extraordinary step of delivering a press conference to lay out the problems with Trumps plan. On Thursday, Chaffetz threatened to subpoena Shaub, then issued a letter asking him to meet with lawmakers for a deposition-like interview, according to the Washington Post. He seems to be acting prematurely at best, without doing investigations or thorough looks, Chaffetz told Politico. Hes rendering opinions publicly that really cause you to scratch your head. We need the Office of Government Ethics to act ethically. Ironically, thats not what theyre doing. More specifically, Chaffetz was upset that Shaub was publicly bashing Trump when his job is to aid the president: Shaubs blistering criticisms of the president-elect were widely reported, but he actually framed his statement as an offer to help him resolve potential conflicts of interest, saying that protecting the president is his job. Shaub didnt publicly discuss private conversations with the Trump team, because they never consulted him. Shaub didnt have the opportunity to examine the details on Trumps business plan because Trump wouldnt release any of the documents, even though he displayed a huge stack of folders at his press conference. Chaffetzs issues with Shaub pre-date Trump. In 2015, Shaub argued that Hillary Clintons financial disclosure reports did not need to include paid speeches given by Bill Clinton if the speaking fees went to the Clinton Foundation. Other ethics experts disagreed, and during a hearing Chaffetz and Shaub argued over whether the information, which the Clintons eventually released, should have been included. The New York Times reports that in his letter Chaffetz noted that the House Oversight Committee has jurisdiction over the Office of Government Ethics, which was viewed as a suggestion that he might shut the office down. Shaub is serving a five-year term that ends in 2018. They are strong-arming them, said Richard Painter, who served as an ethics lawyer during the George W. Bush administration. They are obviously very upset the Office of Government Ethics is leaning on Trump and not willing to jam through his nominees. It is political retaliation. Democrats are pushing for Shaub to meet with Chaffetz and other lawmakers in an open hearing, which would give him the opportunity to publicly air his concerns about Trumps business arrangement once again. I believe it is imperative that Director Schaub be permitted to testify in public  before the American people  to avoid any perception that he is being unfairly targeted behind closed doors for expressing his views, Representative Elijah Cummings wrote in a letter to Chaffetz. Chaffetz essentially ignored calls from Cummings and other lawmakers to open an investigation into Trumps finances, so he probably wont be swayed by this latest missive."}, {"date": "2017/01/13", "title": "Paul Ryans Obamacare Repeal Plan Is As Confusing As Trumps", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/ryan-wants-aca-repeal-replace-together-it-already-isnt.html", "text": " During a CNN town hall on Thursday night, on the eve of a vote in the House that is expected to give Congress final approval to begin gutting the Affordable Care Act, House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked a question thats weighing on both Obamacare advocates and rank-and-file Republican lawmakers. Why would you repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement? wondered a Republican small-business owner and cancer survivor. Oh, we wouldnt do that! We want to replace it with something better, Ryan replied. Before he could finish, the questioner interrupted to thank President Obama from the bottom of my heart because I would be dead if it werent for him. After noting that hes happy the questioner isnt dead, Ryan described what a disaster Obamacare is. The law is collapsing, and so weve got to rescue people, he said. We want to do this at the same time, and in some cases in the same bill, Ryan told moderator Jake Tapper. So we want to advance repealing this law with its replacement at the same time. This sounds reassuring, until you consider that Congress will probably advance its effort to repeal Obamacare on Friday, and the Republican replacement plan still doesnt exist. Ryan is in an impossible position, as is often the case. For years, Republicans have been saying that the Affordable Care Act is so onerous that it must be repealed immediately and replaced with something better  but they never coalesced around what that something might be. Further complicating the situation, as the Washington Posts Paul Kane points out, is the Republican claim that Democrats rammed the ACA through Congress too quickly. This is why opponents of the ACA were chanting read the bill back in 2009 (though it took 15 months to get the legislation passed). Kane explains: This week, members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus and some moderate Republican lawmakers questioned the logic of beginning the long journey to Obamacare repeal when theres no agreement on where theyre headed. Per the Post: The solution Ryan and other GOP leaders have come up with is to begin the repeal process while assuring their wary colleagues that this weeks votes are just procedural. Theyre correct that, technically, the votes held this week wont repeal Obamacare. Its the first part of a confusing three-step procedure that will allow them to defund Obamacare through budget reconciliation, bypassing a Democratic filibuster. The Senate just passed a budget resolution, and once the House approves the legislation the committees can begin working on how to do away with parts of Obamacare (but only aspects that relate to the federal budget). Once they agree on a plan, it will go up for a vote in the House and Senate. If it gets a simple majority, Obamacare will be defunded, with the presidents signature. The legislation being voted on this week sets January 27 as a nonbinding deadline for the committees to come up with a plan to repeal the ACA. Theres no deadline for enacting a replacement plan, which would require 60 votes in the Senate to pass. To make matters even more difficult, Donald Trump has been voicing his own contradictory thoughts on the fate of Obamacare. On Tuesday he told the New York Times that he thinks he can pressure eight Democrats into voting for a Republican replacement plan. That seems unlikely, but it makes more sense than his timeline for the process. As New Yorks Jonathan Chait wrote: Then at his press conference on Wednesday, Trump said hed be filing a plan as soon as Tom Price, his pick for Health and Human Services secretary, is in place. His confirmation hearing hasnt been scheduled yet. Thursday, at his weekly press conference, Ryan confirmed that Republicans wont magically repeal and replace Obamacare some time next week. He suggested details on the GOP plan will be available after their congressional retreat, which will take place the week after the inauguration. This will be a thoughtful, step-by-step process. Were not going to swap one 2,700-page monstrosity for another, Ryan said, criticizing the way Democrats passed the ACA. Were going to do this the right way, were going to do this the way it was designed to do, through the congressional committee system. But just a moment later, Ryan said the threat posed by Obamacare is so great that repeal must be passed quickly: Of course, our goal, though, is to deliver relief as soon as possible, because this is just not a matter of us keeping our promise to the American people. This is a rescue mission. Ryan told reporters that he and Trump are completely in sync on health care, and later her underscored that point by posting a confusing tweet: The House speaker and the president-elect are indeed perfectly in sync, in that little about their stated vision for the repeal and replace of Obamacare makes sense. Correction: A previous version of this post incorrectly stated that the president does not need to sign the legislation to defund Obamacare. We regret the error."}, {"date": "2017/01/13", "title": "White House Ends Decades-Old Wet Foot, Dry Foot Immigration Policy for Cubans", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/white-house-end-wet-foot-dry-foot-policy-for-cubans.html", "text": " President Barack Obama made a big foreign-relations splash in the waning days of his administration. The White House is reportedly ending the wet foot, dry foot policy, a 20-year-old immigration stance that granted Cuban nationals legal U.S. residency once they arrived on American soil. The change is effective immediately, reports the Associated Press. The preferential wet foot, dry foot policy to Cubans began under the Clinton Administration in 1996, which revised a more expansive policy from the 60s that gave residency to those Cubans intercepted at sea as well as those that reached American shores. Even the more restrictive U.S. policy had been a sticking point with the Cuban government. Its repeal signifies another milestone in the warming relations between the United States and Cuba, which began in 2015 under President Obama. Of course, this policy change could last less than two weeks if soon-to-be president Donald Trump  who has criticized Obamas opening with Cuba and threatened to dial back those efforts  wants to reinstate the wet foot, dry foot rule. According to U.S. officials, those who already came to the country under wet foot, dry foot will be grandfathered in, and the option to apply for political asylum remains.

Hedge-fund manager Anthony Scaramucci has accepted a job to serve as a top adviser to Trump and will work as an intermediary between the administration and the business community, according to multiple reports. A highly visible member of Trumps transition team, Scaramucci was a late arrival on the Trump train. After first supporting Scott Walker and then Jeb Bush, he finally came around to Trump early last summer. The hedge-fund manager, whose SkyBridge Capital is a hedge fund of hedge funds, went on to raise a lot of money for the president-elect and, like many already in the Trump White House, is a former Goldman Sachs employee. Scaramuccis elevation to the top of the Trump team has happened despite once calling his boss an inherited money dude from Queens County. And despite being a member of the global financial elite that Trump vilified during the campaign. And despite running a hedge fund, which Trump once said allows people to get away with murder. But those small blips in their relationship could not keep Trump and Scaramucci apart. Theyre just too much alike. Like Trump, Scaramuccis career was made less on his financial brilliance than his charisma, The Wall Street Journal wrote this week. The self-described diva is also a total shit-stirrer, he told New York in 2012. My middle name could be Shit-stirrer, except then my initials on my shirt would be a.s.s., and I cant have that. Occasionally that impulse can lead to trouble, like in October when he said a rule requiring financial advisers to act in the interest of clients was like a Supreme Court case upholding slavery. The most obvious similarity between Trump and Scaramucci is that they love attention. At his annual SALT conference, a hedge-fund bacchanal, he surrounds himself with celebrities. Since hes joined Trump, hes been all over TV, and if you go back and watch Oliver Stones Wall Street 2, youll see the logo for SkyBridge, which Scaramucci paid to have featured. His boyish face can be found in several scenes, too. No wonder Trump loves him."}, {"date": "2017/01/12", "title": "President Obama Awards Joe Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/obama-awards-biden-the-presidential-medal-of-freedom.html", "text": " What a bookend to the eight-year bromance: President Barack Obama surprised Vice-President Joe Biden with the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Thursday during a send-off at the White House.

Biden, clearly floored by the honor, could not hold back his tears: And again: Obama added another twist. He honored Biden by giving him the medal with distinction, something he has never done in his presidency, and which has only been given out three other times in U.S. history: to Colin Powell, Ronald Reagan, and Pope John Paul II. Biden took deep breaths, his eyes still welling with tears, as his citation was read and Obama slung the medal around his neck. They hugged it out.

But thats what is happening today as the word spreads that 13 Senate Democrats voted against a Bernie Sanders/Amy Klobuchar amendment encouraging importation of prescription drugs from Canada, while 12 Republicans voted for it. The vote was actually one to waive a point of order against the Sanders-Klobuchar amendment for being non-germane to the bare-bones budget resolution it sought to amend. So the 4652 margin by which it failed was actually 14 votes short of what the sponsors needed for success. Thus it failed like the other 16 amendments voted on during the Kabuki theater of the budget resolution vote-a-rama, a high-speed series of votes engineered by Senate Democrats to get Senate Republicans on record for casting unpopular or party-dividing votes. It would be ironic to say the least if last nights votes instead exposed Senate Democrats to opprobrium. But that is what may be happening as progressives excoriate the 13 Democratic turncoats (Bennet, Booker, Cantwell, Carper, Casey, Coons, Donnelly, Heinrich, Heitkamp, Menendez, Murray, Tester, Warner) who voted no on the Sanders-Klobuchar measure. It did not take critics too long to unearth the campaign contributions some of these Democrats received from pharmaceutical companies: In any event, its reasonably clear that there are two factors mainly affecting the reaction to the otherwise obscure vote last night. The first is that just yesterday Donald Trump attacked pharmaceutical companies and called for government negotiation of drug prices (an idea nearly all Republicans oppose now as they did in 2007), raising the issues visibility. And the second is that Cory Booker  who is being singled out for the most outspoken criticism by progressives this morning  was getting a lot of Democratic love for his remarks (also yesterday) at Jeff Sessionss confirmation hearings. Its no secret that Cory Booker, who has been a rising star favorite of Democratic centrists since he took on old-school liberal Newark mayor Sharpe James back in 2002, probably sees a future president of the United States in the mirror each morning. On the Democratic Left, the prospect of Bookers rise to the top causes a lot of angst because of his close relationship to Wall Street and his heresies on a few key issues like school vouchers. Taking him down a peg this very week for allegedly serving the interests of another hated big-money lobbying titan, Pharma, makes perfect sense politically. More broadly, the vote last night raises a perennially difficult issue for both parties: How much slack should they give individual members of Congress for representing home-state interests? There are an awful lot of pharmaceutical companies based in Cory Bookers New Jersey, which also views nearby Wall Street as something of a constituent. Is supporting Pharma on votes like the one last night inherently any different than opposing Pharma because you represent people who can see how much cheaper drug prices are within close driving distance of your home? However you answer that question, it is increasingly clear Booker needs to do something that looks like a clear declaration of independence from his donors. Otherwise his very name will become a spark igniting an ideological fight in his party."}, {"date": "2017/01/12", "title": "New York City Broke a More Than 120-Year-Old Temperature Record", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/new-york-city-broke-a-more-than-120-year-temperature-record.html", "text": " The sudden break in the bitter cold in New York City  it was in the 20s just two days ago  has brought kind of freaky May weather to the area, with the temperature reaching 65 degrees in Central Park this afternoon.

She asked whether he could guarantee that HUDs massive investments would not benefit the president-elect and his family, given their heavy involvement in real estate development. Carson spluttered a bit, and initially said, It will not be my intention to do anything that will benefit any American. Carson finally recovered enough to tell Warren that no, he could not make any such guarantee with respect to the Trumps, and even said he didnt have a problem with good programs creating incidental benefits for individuals. And so Warren pivoted to a statement encouraging Congress to enact legislation forcing the 45th president to put his assets in a blind trust. The president-elect is hiding his familys business assets from me, from you, from the rest of America, said Warren to Carson. He didnt have any response to that, though in a later question about funny stuff Trump has said and done, he did remind the Committee he had run against the mogul for president.

Were most viewers not focused on this fusillade of authoritarian declarations and reality-TV provocations, Trumps remarks would have been a bigger headache for the GOP  because when the president-elect strayed into the realm of policy, he tended to say things antithetical to his partys agenda. Early in the presser, Trump was rambling about all the jobs hed already brought back to our shores, when he found himself denouncing the pharmaceutical industry. I think a lot of industries are going to be coming back. We have to get our drug industry coming back, Trump said. Pharma has a lot of lobbies, a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power. And theres very little bidding on drugs. Were the largest buyer of drugs in the world, and yet we dont bid properly. And were going to start bidding and were going to save billions of dollars over a period of time. The Republican Party has a lot of ideas about how it would like to reform Medicare. Giving the government the power to negotiate drug prices is not one of them. Minutes later, Trump said of Obamacare, You have deductibles that are so high that after people go broke paying their premiums, which are going through the roof, the health care cant even be used by them because the deductibles are so high. The GOP has a few half-baked alternatives to the Affordable Care Act. Virtually all would raise deductibles, not lower them. As House Republicans explained last year, high-deductible plans help patients understand the true cost of care. And right before making the hallucinatory claim that there are 96 million unemployed workers in America (he was referring to adults outside the labor force, which is a different thing), the president-elect announced that his job creation plan would include a major border tax on these companies that are leaving and getting away with murder. Republicans have reconciled themselves to a presidency free of new trade deals. But they have not made their peace with confiscatory tariffs on companies that buck the presidents nationalist policies. Trump may take these heretical stances as seriously as he takes his pledge to send Mexico the tab for our border wall. Which is to say, these policies may be for promotional use only. And yet, it appears that the president-elect is actually trying to follow through on two of his campaigns left-of-center proposals: On Thursday, Trumps transition team will meet with House GOP staffers to discuss his plans to subsidize child care and guarantee women six weeks of paid maternity leave. According to Politico, Ivanka Trump is already lobbying for these proposals in meetings with female lawmakers. Its worth noting that Trumps approach to social welfare is a distinctly conservative one. His child-care plan is composed entirely of tax breaks. And while he has floated the idea of expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit for impoverished families, the initial draft of his plan would do more to lower the nanny bills of millionaires than to provide day-care funds to the working poor. Further, by restricting his plan for parental leave to mothers, Trumps most liberal policy reinforces traditional gender roles. Nonetheless, forcing employers to provide female workers with paid maternity leave is a radical departure from the Paul Ryan playbook, as is popularizing the idea that the federal government has a responsibility to control child-care costs. If Trump is willing to put muscle behind these proposals, its possible hed be willing to push his party left on other issues. After all, he won the GOP nomination while vowing to preserve entitlement spending and establish universal health care. Trump may be fond of the GOP agendas spoonfuls of sugar (tax cuts that enrich him and regulatory changes that enrich his friends), but he has little interest in its medicine (unpopular cuts to social spending). And the president-elects authoritarian ethos is diametrically opposed to small government conservatism. Ronald Reagan claimed that the nine most terrifying words in the English language were, Im from the government and Im here to help. For Trump, the five most terrific ones may be, I alone can fix it. Whats more, while theres little support for price controls on pharmaceuticals among House Republicans, theres plenty among the American people. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll from late last year found that 78 percent of Americans support new restrictions on high-cost drugs, while 86 percent want the federal government to secure lower drug prices for Medicare recipients through negotiation. Even among Republicans, both proposals enjoy strong majorities. In an era of stagnant working-class wages and rampant inequality, laissez-faire conservatism doesnt play that well outside the country club. But even as Trumps remarks Wednesday reaffirmed his instinct for government activism, they betrayed an astounding laziness that may render that instinct irrelevant. The president-elect seems to have put less time into preparing for his press conference then he has into studying the ratings of the new season of The Celebrity Apprentice. His riff on pharma Wednesday appears to have been completely spontaneous, surprising both his party and the stock market. His comments on Obamacare repeal  which is to say, the single most pressing issue in American politics today  suggested that he still lacks a rudimentary understanding of the legislative process. Trump said that Republicans could repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act within the same hour  and that an entirely new health-care system would be put in place before the end of 2017. The former proposal is highly unlikely, the latter, essentially impossible. Its hard to see how a deeply unpopular president  who is unwilling to study the basic mechanics of Congress  will be able to force his party to pass laws it doesnt wish to. Still, its possible that Republicans will turn left of their own volition. Once the GOP secures power, it tends to retain its interest in cutting taxes on the rich, but forget its concern with reducing the deficit. Under George W. Bush, the party increased entitlement spending by adding a prescription-drug benefit to Medicare. The Republican Party may be more ideologically conservative today than it was then. But it has also spent much of the past seven years stoking anger about problems with the American health-care system that cannot be solved with conservative reforms. Republicans oppose the ACA because it increased taxes on rich people and entrenched the idea that the government should guarantee Americans access to affordable health care. But conservative politicians know those complaints dont resonate with the public. Very few Americans are outraged that government subsidies have rendered their deductibles artificially low, thereby hiding the true cost of care; a lot of voters are outraged that their deductibles are so high they cant afford to see a doctor. And so when Mitch McConnell made the case against Obamacare on Face the Nation last Sunday, his grievances were indistinguishable from Trumps. What you need to understand is that there are 25 million Americans who arent covered now, the Senate Majority Leader explained. And many Americans who actually did get insurance when they did not have it before have really bad insurance that they have to pay for, and the deductibles are so high that its really not worth much to them. Donald Trump is not going to strong-arm the GOP into socializing medicine. But his disinterest in conservative ideology may enable his party to put the will to power over principle  and ditch its terrific plans for making health insurance less affordable and harder to come by."}, {"date": "2017/01/12", "title": "Donald Trump, Russia, and the Political Witch Hunt That Isnt", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-russia-and-the-political-witch-hunt-that-isnt.html", "text": " Most weeks, New York Magazine writer-at-large Frank Rich speaks with contributor Alex Carp about the biggest stories in politics and culture. Today: Trumps press conference, BuzzFeed, and Bill OReillys settlement. Near the end of Donald Trumps press conference yesterday, Trump was asked if he could stand here today, once and for all, and say that no one connected to him or his campaign had any contact with Russia leading up to or during the presidential campaign. He tried to avoid the question at the podium, and the press chased him to ask again at the elevator. Is this a sign that Trumps Russia evasions and broad denials will eventually run out of steam?Lets not pretend we dont know what is happening here. There is evidence that Donald Trump and his administration-in-formation are partially, perhaps wholly, beholden to the Kremlin and/or those Russian oligarchs in its thrall. This is why Trump refused to answer that question about contacts with Russia during the campaign  and why hell lie about it when he finally feels he must muster some kind of answer. His symbiosis with Russia is also why he will never release his tax returns, for what other reason could there be at this point except that they reveal the Russian financial ties he denies? After all, we already know the other embarrassments contained in those returns  that he hasnt paid taxes for years, that he practices no actual philanthropy, and that his businesses are in a perennial waltz with bankruptcy, fraud, and failure. No, Russia is the big story here. The elephant in the room is a bear. Trump has made no bones about repeatedly hiring fellow Putin sycophants, whether his former campaign chief Paul Manafort, the incoming National Security Adviser, Mike Flynn, or the secretary of State nominee, Rex Tillerson. When the heroic aviator Charles Lindbergh was awarded a medal, the Service Cross of the German Eagle, by Hermann Goering by order of der Fhrer before World War II, it helped make him persona non grata in the FDR White House. When Tillerson received a Russian Order of Friendship Award from Putin, Trump regarded it as an incentive to hire him. How this will play out once Trump is inaugurated is impossible to fathom. We have a president-elect who trusts Putin and Julian Assange more than he does Americas intelligence agencies, whom he has compared to the Nazis. Perhaps Trumps only real goal is to grab money from deep Russian pockets as fast as he can in opaque business deals managed by his sons while hes in office. Even so, its entirely possible that he and Flynn will help facilitate Putins own political aims in exchange  all the while claiming that their motive is merely to band with Russia in fighting ISIS. Whats clear is that we are not going to get straight answers to any Russian questions. Even before Trump took over the lectern at his Wednesday press conference, his press spokesman, Sean Spicer, unleashed a preemptive lie about still another Trump-Kremlin connection by claiming that Trump does not know Carter Page, an investment banker who was investigated by the F.B.I. last summer for suspicions of private dealings with Russian leaders. In fact, Page had been announced as a Trump foreign-policy adviser by his campaign last year and had been cited by name by Trump himself in an interview with the Washington Post editorial board in March. Both Page and Trump, by the way, have used the term witch hunt to describe any attempts to investigate their Russian dealings  the same term used by the Kremlin to fend off evidence that Putin manipulated the American election. Perhaps Page and Trump have the same Kremlin handler, whether or not it is the former KGB agent Putin himself. Just minutes after CNN reported that intelligence agencies had briefed Trump and President Obama about compromising financial and personal information Russia may hold about the president-elect, BuzzFeed posted a dossier containing the unconfirmed details. BuzzFeed says their dossier is how we see the job of reporters in 2017; CNNs Jake Tapper says it is irresponsible and hurts us all. Did BuzzFeed make the right call?Next to the staggering list of press failures that have marked Trumps rise to the presidency, this seems small potatoes. BuzzFeed did frame what it published as being both unconfirmed and redolent with errors. The dossier may well prove to be utter trash (if entertaining trash), and the only slender justification for publishing it is that it fleshes out a true news break by CNN, that both Obama and Trump had been told of this salacious reports existence by American intelligence agencies, who also have not verified it. But is BuzzFeeds sin worse than CNN having put Trump henchman Corey Lewandowski on its election-year payroll? Or than the Times repeatedly giving major home-page play to data suggesting that Hillary Clinton had a close to 100 percent chance of victory right up to Election Day? You could argue that that latter stunt actually suppressed Democratic turnout in the presidential race; the BuzzFeed stunt changed nothing unless you count the impressive number of jokes it has prompted, on Twitter and beyond, around the phenomenon of #GoldenShower. It is not a bright spot in BuzzFeeds history, but the ruckus it has generated seems disproportionate, a reflection of how much Trump has put the press on the defensive over a bruising 18 months. What most seems to upset press critics about BuzzFeeds action understandably  is that Trump seized on it to paint the entire press Establishment, including CNN, as purveyors of fake news. That is an outrage, but if Trump hadnt found this pretext, he would have found another opening soon enough. There is, of course, no bigger purveyor of fake news than Trump himself, unless its his comrade in alt-right propaganda, Stephen Bannon. Trumps entire campaign was spawned by trafficking in conspiracy theories, whether about President Obama or Mexican immigrants or imaginary Muslims cheering 9/11 in New Jersey. His effort to play the virtuous defender of journalistic ethics is as ludicrous as his presenting himself as the greatest, most respectful champion of Americas women. He is determined to bully, destabilize, and discredit the press. But those who buy his preposterous self-righteous pose are so imprisoned by the alternative reality of Trump anyway that they might as well be Scientologists  nothing short of an intervention will return them to the real world. These are the same people who think that Trumps display of piles of manila envelopes at his press conference actually told us something about his business ethics. If I may briefly embrace Trumpism by being both vulgar and politically incorrect, let me say that people who fall for his bullshit are idiots. Even if the dossier BuzzFeed published is found to be mostly true, theyll still believe its fake news because it doesnt match the fake news they are imbibing every day. Its now come out that, soon after Fox News ousted chairman Roger Ailes, declaring that his behavior would not be tolerated, the network also settled with an employee making similar sexual-harassment complaints against Bill OReilly. Why do you think OReilly was able to remain at the network?As my colleague Gabriel Sherman has reported, Fox News is now officially all in on Trump, as certified by Rupert Murdochs decision to promote the Trump-friendly Tucker Carlson to the Trump skeptic Megyn Kellys vacated prime-time slot. A network allied with the president-elect who gave America grab em by the pussy and that tolerated Ailess predatory sexual behavior for years is certainly going to stand by its highest-rated on-camera personality even if he is a repeat sexual offender. Lets just be grateful that neither BuzzFeed nor anyone else has yet obtained audio tapes of OReilly masturbating while on the phone with his female prey, a particularly gross element in the Times account of the latest incident. Then again, in the Trump era, its safe to say that just as Trump could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose any of his followers, so OReilly could be found masturbating outside the Fox News studio on Sixth Avenue and not lose the confidence of either his viewers or the Murdochs."}, {"date": "2017/01/12", "title": "The Making of the Bombshell Trump Dossier Dominating the News", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/the-making-of-the-bombshell-trump-dossier.html", "text": " A day after BuzzFeed offended many members of the media by publishing a secret dossier about Donald Trump, including claims of close ties with Russia and unsanitary escapades with prostitutes, the New York Times is providing the backstory on how that dossier came to be. In September of 2015, the Times says, a Republican donor with deep pockets and a deep distaste for Trump hired a D.C. investigative firm to compile a report on Trumps scandals. The firm, Fusion GPS, is led by former Wall Street Journal reporter Glenn Simpson, who has written extensively on Russian corporate crime and criminal organizations, according to his bio on the website for the nonprofit International Assessment and Strategy Center. As Trump went from primary hopeful to GOP nominee, Fusion GPS continued working on the report  digging through lawsuits, compiling news reports, delving into his business dealings  but with new financiers. Hillary Clinton supporters began footing the bill in hopes of derailing Trump. Then, the hacking of the DNC in June, believed to be conducted by Russian agents, led to a shake-up. Simpson hired Christopher Steele, a former MI6 agent with experience working undercover in Moscow. Steele reached out to some of his old contacts and farmed out other research to native Russian speakers who made phone calls on his behalf. The information they found concerned attempts to compromise Trump and coordination over hacking of the DNC. Even after the election, Steele and Simpson continued their investigating without pay because they were convinced they were doing very important work, the Times says. Now that his identity has been revealed, Steele has gone into hiding, according to The Telegraph. He fled his home outside of London on Wednesday morning, the paper says. He left his cat with a neighbor and went underground, terrified for his and his familys safety, a source told The Telegraph. The BBC confirms that story, with one minor change. Steele went into hiding after leaving not one, but three cats with his neighbor, BBC News correspondent Paul Wood reports."}, {"date": "2017/01/12", "title": "Watch: An Iceberg the Size of Delaware Is Set to Break Away From Antarctica", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/a-massive-iceberg-is-set-to-break-away-from-antarctica.html", "text": "  Dont worry.

Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto said, bluntly, on Wednesday that of course Mexico is not going to pay for the border wall with the United States. Nieto, who was speaking at a meeting of Mexican ambassadors, added that he would never accept a policy that went against our dignity as Mexicans. Trump has, of course, slightly tweaked the language on his plan  saying the United States will begin building the wall, and then Mexico will reimburse its neighbor for the cost after construction has started. I could wait about a year and half until we finish our negotiations with Mexico, which will start immediately after we get to office, Trump told reporters at his press conference Wednesday, but I dont want to wait. Trumps plan for how to get Mexico to pay, according to Trump, could come in many different forms. He explained, whether its a tax or a payment  probably less likely that its a payment  but it will happen. Which is all very different from Nietos of course Mexico will not pay for that wall. Even if the wall is a nonstarter, Nieto did say that Mexico was going to work to have a good relationship with President Trump, which is the more diplomatic equivalent of the next U.S. presidents by the way, Mexico, so nice.

Going into the session, there was a sense that Democrats might be able to use the vote  and their freedom to offer politically dangerous amendments  to split the GOP over when and how they hoped to enact the repeal. After all, several Republican senators have lately voiced doubts over the partys apparent strategy of repeal and delay, and the turmoil has only been deepened by Donald Trumps recent announcements that Obamacare repeal must be accompanied by a full replacement with some yet-to-be-determined-but-definitely-terrific GOP plan. The logistics of doing what the president-elect and the handful of wavering Republican senators want are, to say the least, daunting. But when it came to cast the key vote last night, party unity held: 51 of 52 Senate Republicans voted for the repeal budget (only Rand Paul bucked party discipline, reflecting his opposition to repealing Obamacare without a replacement plan being in place). No Democrats crossed the line to vote for it, though Dianne Feinstein was absent following surgery. Over the course of the evening, 17 amendments were brought to the floor. Most were offered by Democrats, seeking to highlight popular aspects of Obamacare that would be lost in repeal. All the amendments were, in turn, defeated. The Republicans senators who were expected to offer an amendment to put off the deadline for passing the actual repeal  in the form of a budget-reconciliation bill  from late January to early March announced they were backing off, based on assurances from leadership that the deadlines could be adjusted later. Which is to say, for the moment, the party managed to paper over substantive disagreements by kicking key questions down the road. So did Democrats get anything of value from this truncated exercise? Perhaps so. Republican senators are now on record as having rejected opportunities to keep Medicare, Medicaid, and the childrens health program CHIP off the cutting-room floor; to make it possible to import prescription drugs from Canada; to prevent erosion of womens health services and support for rural hospitals; and perhaps most tellingly, to protect Medicaid funding for the 32 states that accepted the option of expanding that program under the Affordable Care Act. For the moment, the budget resolution will go to the House, which is expected to approve it on Friday unless the Freedom Caucus (some of whose members share Rand Pauls heartburn over moving ahead with an Obamacare repeal without a replacement) decides to rebel. And then the real rubber will meet the road as Republicans try to figure out what exactly to put into the repeal legislation to deal with the transition and to satisfy wildly varying Republican views on the post-Obamacare health-care system. The future for Obamacare remains fuzzy. The big, potentially derailing disagreements over repeal among Republicans  most importantly between the Congressional leadership and Trump  remain very much in place. Nothing about last nights vote changes that. But the fact that the party could pull together to pass the repeal budget has to be encouraging for conservatives. Its a relatively easy part of a long process  but theres no question that America is now a little bit closer to losing Obamacare."}, {"date": "2017/01/12", "title": "Trump Needs to Take Business Conflicts More Seriously, for His Own Sake", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-should-take-business-conflicts-seriously-for-his-sake.html", "text": " Donald Trump loves a good prop, and his first press conference as president-elect featured a display that perfectly illustrated his plan to avoid conflicts of interest while in office. Trump appeared next to a table teeming with stacks of papers packed into manila folders. He explained that the papers were just some of the many documents hes already signed turning over complete and total control of his business to his sons. Reporters asked if they could take a closer look at the documents, but Trump staffers said no. CNN zoomed in on the papers, and it appeared that they were completely blank. Similarly, the plan Trump unveiled on Wednesday for resolving conflicts that may arise from the president controlling a vast business empire was meant to sound impressive, but upon closer inspection, ethics experts deemed it meaningless. Trump said he would not sell his holdings or put his assets in a blind trust, as recommended. Instead, his business will be put in a trust controlled by his two eldest sons and a longtime Trump Organization executive. Trump attorney Sheri Dillon said at the press conference that the company will make no new foreign deals whatsoever during Trumps time in office, and profits his hotels earn from foreign governments will be donated to the U.S. Treasury. Domestic deals will be approved in writing by a newly appointed independent ethics adviser. The Trump Organization will also hire a chief compliance counsel to ensure that the company is operating at the highest level of integrity and not taking any actions that could be perceived as exploiting the office of the presidency. Under the new setup, Trump will have limited information rights about his companys activities, and he said his sons are not going to discuss it with me. Communications from the Trump Organization will not reference the president or his office. Disentangling himself from his business is no easy task, and the plan Trump presented takes a step forward on ethics, as the Washington Post put it. But even after delaying the reveal for a month, the Trump team didnt provide basic information about his ethics strategy. Per the New York Times: A trust managed by Eric and Donald Jr. is nothing like the blind trust recommended by many ethics experts, and the only guarantee that theyre not discussing business with their father is the president-elects word. The Trump team could not identify either of its two new ethics officers, as they havent been hired yet. Anticipating complaints, Dillon explained why the Trump team ignored solutions ethics professionals have been pushing publicly since the election. She said the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which bars the president from receiving revenue from foreign governments, does not apply to a business transaction, like paying for a room in a Trump hotel at the normal rate. As for the suggestion that the president-elect should sell his business, she said thats impossible because whatever price was paid would be subject to criticism and scrutiny. Experts were not swayed by these arguments. Former Obama administration ethics attorney Norman Eisen told The Atlantic that giving foreign hotel revenue to the Treasury does not make Trumps business activities legal. The Emoluments Clause doesnt only cover some hotel revenues, as the Trump team wrongly believes, but applies to a much broader range of foreign-government benefits that Trump is collecting, and will continue to collect, from foreign governments, Eisen said. On January 20, that will be in direct violation of the Constitution. In a highly unusual press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Walter Shaub, director of the Office of Government Ethics, said Trumps team had not consulted his office. If they had, he said, they would have learned that they help presidents and cabinet members sell and rearrange their assets all the time. The part of Shaubs statement thats drawing the most attention is his pronouncement that since Trump is not fully divesting from his business, his plan doesnt meet the standards  that every president of the past four decades has met. He said the trust adds nothing to the equation because its not blind, and described other aspects of the plan as wholly inadequate. He also had a scathing response to Dillons assertion that Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built: Yet Shaubs message wasnt framed as an attack on Trump, but an offer to help. Our goal  our reason for existing  is to guard the executive branch against conflicts of interest, he said. Sure, Americans dont want to slide down the slippery slope to kleptocracy, but as Shaub pointed out, Trump is hurting himself too. Ethics lawyers predict that under the plan presented by the president-elect, hell quickly spark a legal battle over the meaning of the Emoluments Clause, and open himself up to new controversies. Tragically, the Trump plan to deal with his business conflicts announced today falls short in every respect, Norm Eisen told Politico. Mr. Trumps ill-advised course will precipitate scandal and corruption. Trump said at Wednesdays press conference that he has no intention of releasing his tax returns, and the American people dont care about the issue. I won, when I became president, he said. I dont think they care at all. The idea that Trump was validated for all time by his election win was a running theme, but a survey released on Tuesday suggests Americans are concerned about his business conflicts. According to a Pew poll, 57 percent of adults are very or somewhat concerned that Trumps relationships with organizations, businesses or foreign governments conflict with his ability to serve the countrys best interests. Its true that people may not be paying attention to the status of Trumps tax returns, or his confusing plan for how hell structure his business while in office. But in the next four years they may come to care about repeated accusations that Trump is using his office to enrich himself, and the haze of scandal hanging about the presidency. Having ethics lawyers hammer out a more thorough plan for avoiding conflicts of interest would let Trump prove his critics wrong, protect his presidency from unnecessary controversy, and show the American people that hes fully committed to serving them, not his business interests."}, {"date": "2017/01/12", "title": "Clapper Denounces Corrosive and Damaging Trump Dossier Leak", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/clapper-denounces-corrosive-damaging-trump-dossier-leak.html", "text": " In yet another extraordinary development, on Wednesday night Director of National Intelligence James Clapper released a statement on an unverified dossier that outlines Donald Trumps alleged ties to Russia. BuzzFeed published the 35-page document on Tuesday after CNN reported that Clapper and other intelligence chiefs gave the president-elect a two-page summary of the memos when they briefed him last week. In the statement, Clapper says that he spoke with Trump again on Wednesday evening, and expressed his profound dismay that leaks about the meeting have been appearing in the press. We both agreed that they are extremely corrosive and damaging to our national security, he said. Clapper then addressed the dossier itself: While NBC News said Trump actually wasnt presented with a summary of the document last week, Clappers statement seems to suggest that CNNs original report was correct. The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that the intelligence chiefs concluded they had no choice but to include the dossier in the briefing prepared for President Obama and President-elect Trump. Many journalists and lawmakers had seen the document, and they thought Trump and Obama should know that the intelligence agencies were aware of the allegations. They also believed it was only a matter of time before the claims were made public (just before the election Mother Jones reported on the dossiers existence, but did not go into detail). The Post reports that Clapper, CIA director John Brennan, FBI chief James Comey, and NSA director Mike Rogers were unanimous in their decision to include a two-page summary of the dossier in an annex to a much larger report on Russias alleged election meddling. A U.S. official told the paper the summary was fully explained to Trump and put into context, to make it clear that the government did not compile the dossier or verify its claims. Former U.S. intelligence officials told the Post that including opposition research in a presidential briefing is very unusual. It would be extraordinary if not unprecedented to bring to the attention of a president and president-elect a private document for which you had no reason to believe the allegations made in it, said Michael Morell, the former deputy director of the CIA. Journalists held off on publishing the allegations contained in the memo because they werent able to confirm the explosive claims about Trump and Russia.

Powell will reportedly work closely with Trumps daughter Ivanka and her husband, newly appointed Trump senior adviser Jared Kushner. CNN says Powell, who is advising Ivanka, will serve as the First Daughters woman in the White House. With Powell, Trump has now brought at least five Goldman Sachs veterans into his administration. She joins Trumps chief strategist Stephen Bannon, his Treasury Secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin, his pick to head the National Economic Council Gary Cohn, and transition official Anthony Scaramucci  all of whom worked at Goldman. Add in Trumps nominee to lead the SEC, lawyer John Clayton, whos represented Goldman, and the number is six. Former Obama administration appointee David Shulkin will also join Trumps White House as secretary of Veterans Affairs, if confirmed. The president-elect slipped mention of Shulkins nomination into his wild Wednesday press conference, where he said, Hes fantastic. He will do a truly great job.

They were a mixed bag of Sessions fans and critics who probably didnt change anyones mind about his qualifications for the job. The final panel, though, contained two members of Congress who had unusually strong standing to challenge the Alabamans confirmation. The first was New Jersey Democratic Senator Cory Booker, one of ten African-Americans ever to serve in the upper chamber (two others, Republican Tim Scott of South Carolina and Democrat Kamala Harris of California, serve with Booker today). Much was made in advance that he would be the first U.S. senator to testify against a colleagues cabinet confirmation (thats sort of a technical first, since a lot of senators spoke out against a former colleague, John Tower, when his confirmation as secretary of Defense was rejected in 1989). And there was a lot of talk about Booker trying to boost his presidential stock. But what most made Booker an effective dissenter against the picture of Sessions skillfully painted during the first day of hearings  as a man firmly in the mainstream of thinking on all matters involving the justice system, and deeply sympathetic to minority Americans  was his experience with the nominee on criminal-justice reform. Booker has been a leader in the Senate on this subject, working effectively with Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley to draft a bill Republicans could support. But he ran right into a stone wall of opposition led by Jeff Sessions. Booker views this as a civil-rights issue, as he should. And today he implicitly compared Sessionss law and order objections to criminal-justice reforms to the posture of the Alabama state troopers who stood at the Edmund Pettis Bridge near Sessionss birthplace, in Selma, and shocked the world by clubbing people who were marching for civil and voting rights. One of the activists who was clubbed that day  suffering a skull fracture  was sitting next to Booker at the Sessions hearing. And while John Lewis kept his remarks generally mild, he also conveyed the clear sense that he wasnt buying the makeover Sessions was receiving: Booker and Lewis both made it clear that not being a racist wasnt good enough for anyone to become the chief federal official responsible for vindicating rights and defending justice. Sessions may have easily leapt over the low threshold set for him by Grassley and Judiciary Committee Republicans. But when a nominees most recent accomplishment was serving as Donald Trumps first and most loyal supporter in Congress, demanding something a bit more forward-leaning should be perfectly in order for those who do not share Jeff Sessionss reactionary views."}, {"date": "2017/01/11", "title": "At His First News Conference As President-elect, Trump Owns the Press", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/at-news-conference-trump-owns-the-press.html", "text": " This morning, Donald Trump hosted his much-delayed, long-awaited first news conference as president-elect. Inside the Trump Tower atrium, the atmosphere was as charged as at a highly anticipated prize fight. The last time Trump fielded questions from the press corps was last summer. For weeks, the media had been preparing to challenge him on any number of controversies: his conflicts of interest, polarizing cabinet appointments, decision to appoint his son-in-law as a senior adviser, and, most alarmingly, Vladimir Putins apparent efforts to manipulate the election. Trump being Trump, he didnt show any interest in directly answering questions. He opened with a rambling monologue that included the pronouncement: I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created. When asked by a reporter if Russia aided his win, Trump said, Well, if Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset. Questioned whether the American people wanted him to finally release his tax returns, he replied, No, I dont think they care at all. Challenged on the potential conflicts of interest for his cabinet appointees, Trump explained that Rex Tillerson and Jeff Sessions were brilliant. Judged on a policy basis, it was a disaster. Trump came across as just as unprepared and unfocused as he did during his shambolic campaign. He let his lawyer speak for nearly a quarter of the allotted time to explain why he wouldnt be putting his company into a blind trust and instead would be turning it over to his sons Don Jr. and Eric. For visual effect, aides stacked manila folders on a table next to the lectern. Trump said they were filled with legal papers. But observed as spectacle, Trump came away with a resounding victory. Thats because Trump won even before he stepped before the microphone, by making the media the story. Last night, BuzzFeed published a salacious 35-page oppo-research dossier on Trump that alleged Russia possessed sexual and financial dirt on Trump that could be used to blackmail him. BuzzFeed justified reporting the unverified oppo-research document  which had been compiled during the presidential campaign by a political operative working for Trumps Republican rivals  by stating that intelligence agencies had briefed Trump on a summary of the findings last week. But BuzzFeeds article boomeranged back on the website as journalists were quick to denounce its decision to publish unconfirmed claims and errors. (CNN broke news of the intelligence briefing, but did not print the sensational details.) Trump exploited this wedge. From the outset, he worked to isolate BuzzFeed and CNN. I want to thank a lot of the news organizations for some of whom have not treated me very well over the years  a couple in particular  and they came out so strongly against that fake news and the fact that it was written about by primarily one group and one television station, he said. Trump also deflected attention from the urgent questions at hand by taking aim at the intelligence agencies, which he accused  without proof  of the leak. It was disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out  [T]hats something that Nazi Germany would have done, and did do. For the most part, Trump remained calm and jocular (except when he refused to call on CNN reporter Jim Acosta, yelling You are fake news!). He invited reporters to the White House the week after his inauguration. He left the bad-cop routine to his press secretary, Sean Spicer, who called BuzzFeed a left-wing blog and said the decision to publish was outrageous and highly irresponsible. The cumulative result is that Trump turned what should have been a serious examination of his incoming administration into a debate over journalistic practices and Michael Cohens travel itinerary. BuzzFeed deserves some of the blame for this. Journalists receive oppo research frequently during political campaigns, but publish only what they can verify. By amending this standard for Trump, BuzzFeed handed him an opening to play the victim. Trump thrives in a world where facts are fungible. As the journalist Masha Gessen, whos covered Putins Russia for years, tweeted: We are now fully immersed in the anonymous, the unverified, and the unverifiable. And he hasnt even taken office. Trumpism sure is fast. The matter of whether Trump campaign officials coordinated with the Kremlin needs to be investigated, and answered definitively. Trumps propensity to traffic in rumor, gossip, and innuendo makes it ever more important that the news organizations dont."}, {"date": "2017/01/11", "title": "Trump Keeps Screwing Up Republican Plans to Repeal Obamacare", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-just-screwed-up-obamacare-repeal-even-more.html", "text": " Yesterday, President-elect Donald Trump, in an interview with the New York Times, threw all sorts of sand into the gears of the congressional GOP effort to repeal and replace Obamacare. As Jonathan Chait explained, what he was saying made absolutely no sense: So unsurprisingly, at todays bizarre press conference, the first he has held since being elected president, Trump was asked to restate his basic views on how Congress should deal with Obamacare. And he responded with a somewhat different but equally screwed-up scenario: The new criterion Trump threw into the mix is that nothing at all will happen until Tom Price is confirmed as secretary of HHS. Price has to go through two confirmation hearings. The first is on January 18, at the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. The second and voting committee on his confirmation is Finance, which hasnt even scheduled a hearing. But the Senate is voting on amendments to the basic blueprint for Obamacare repeal right now; final passage in that chamber will probably occur tomorrow after votes today and tonight on literally more than a hundred amendments that could shape the repeal. If Trump thinks nothing should happen for weeks, he should have probably shared that sentiment with congressional Republicans, who have been talking for months, publicly and privately, about moving on Obamacare before Trumps inauguration. Beyond that new problem, Trump is also suggesting we will be submitting a plan for the whole set of problems. Who is we? HHS? The White House? The Republican Party? Thats unclear. Again, if he has policy preferences he has not yet shared with congressional Republicans, why arent they awaiting them obediently? Finally, Trump went out of his way to confirm some of the craziness from the Times interview. Repeal and replace will happen most likely on the same day or the same week  but probably the same day  could be the same hour. Surely someone has told him by now that anything worth calling a replacement for Obamacare, with its many insurance regulations and other non-budget features, cannot be done via a budget measure, and thus will require 60 Senate votes. How is that going to happen? It wont if it resembles any of the plans that Republicans are currently discussing. Now maybe Trump is alluding to some talk from Paul Ryan about handling repeal and replace concurrently  which seems to mean including a few budget-germane elements of a replacement in a bill that repeals Obamacare. According to one report, that eternal conservative policy hobbyhorse, Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), could get some new money as a sort of down payment on a replacement plan that could be part of a package that needed no Democratic votes. If HSAs are to represent the replacement thats not delayed significantly, Trump may have created another problem in todays press conference in a complaint about Obamacare: HSAs are a central part of a standard conservative health-care-policy scheme encouraging personal responsibility for routine medical expenses. That means paying for them not through insurance, but through out-of-pocket spending supplemented by HSAs. High deductibles and other cost-shifts from insurance companies to consumers are indeed a major complaint you hear about Obamacare. But the problem is going to get a lot worse under any GOP replacement plan we have seen so far. All in all, Trump advisers might want to convince him to keep his mouth shut about Obamacare until they are on the same page as their alleged Republican allies. Right now, repeal-and-replacement planning is an out-of-control wildfire on which the president-elect is pouring gasoline."}, {"date": "2017/01/11", "title": "Many in Media Shout Fail at BuzzFeed for Publishing Unverified Trump Dossier", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/many-in-media-shout-fail-at-buzzfeed.html", "text": " In an email to his staff Tuesday night, BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith defended his decision to publish a 35-page report full of salacious claims about Donald Trumps relationship with Russia and interest in water sports. Assembled by a former British agent, the report was included in intelligence briefings given to President Obama and Trump last Friday, CNN reported. NBC News says Trump was actually not briefed on the documents, which the president-elect confirmed at his Wednesday press conference. In any case, BuzzFeed determined that CNNs report was reason enough to publish the documents. Smith defended that decision like this: Our presumption is to be transparent in our journalism and to share what we have with our readers. We have always erred on the side of publishing. In this case, the document was in wide circulation at the highest levels of American government and media. He added, Publishing this document was not an easy or simple call, and people of good will may disagree with our choice. He was right about that. Criticism of the choice to publish the report has been swift, and not just from Trump partisans. The Washington Posts Erik Wemple, for one, takes issue with BuzzFeeds claim that its allowing readers to decide what to make of the information in the dossier. Americans can only make up their own minds if they build their own intelligence agencies, with a heavy concentration of operatives in Russia and Eastern Europe, Wemple writes. The document, he added, is unverified  meaning that it requires further investigation. BuzzFeed has started that process and pledges to continue pursuing it. So why post the documents now? Margaret Sullivan, also of the Washington Post, writes that Smith has plunged down a slippery ethical slope from which there is no return. At The Atlantic, David A. Graham writes that publishing the documents represents an abdication of the basic responsibility of journalism. John Podhoretz, editor of Commentary and neocon Never Trumper, writes in the New York Post, At a moment when journalists are up in arms about fake news, what BuzzFeed has done here is take fake news to a new level. David Corn of Mother Jones, who reported on the existence of the dossier in late October, tweeted that publishing it was unfair to Trump. Many other journalists tweeted their discontent with BuzzFeeds decision to publish this content. After the end of Trumps Wednesday-afternoon press conference, which included an attempt by the president-elect to conflate the BuzzFeed and CNN reports, CNN released a statement seeking to distance itself from BuzzFeeds decision to publish unsubstantiated memos. Jake Tapper also went to bat for his network on the air, calling BuzzFeed irresponsible. What does Ben Smith make of the criticism? In an interview with Huffington Posts Michael Calderone, he said he stands by the decision to publish a newsworthy document."}, {"date": "2017/01/11", "title": "Donald Trump to America: I Won, Accountability Is Over", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/donald-trump-to-america-i-won-accountability-is-over.html", "text": " Donald Trumps first press conference since the summer was a surreal exercise in the assertion of immunity from accountability. He either ignored questions about his behavior, or dismissed the questions as illegitimate. He painted a chilling depiction of politics not as an ongoing process but as a one-time event, settled in his favor by the presidential campaign, once and for all. The press conference began with Press Secretary Sean Spicer attacking BuzzFeed as a left-wing blog (which it is not) for its questionable decision to publish an unverified dossier collected on Trumps dealings with Russia on behalf of rival Republicans from the primary. This set the template for Trump to dismiss not only BuzzFeeds report, but also a much more detailed and credible report by CNN (which had, but did not publish, the dossier thrown online by BuzzFeed). As the press conference went on, Trump would extend the dismissal of BuzzFeed to all skeptical news coverage. Trump was asked about reports that intelligence agencies had concluded Russia hacked his opponents for the specific purpose of helping him win. He did not answer the question. Instead he expressed his view that having good relations with Russia would be nice, and concluded by mocking his Democratic opponent: Do you honestly believe that Hillary would be tougher on Putin than me? Does anybody in this room really believe that? Give me a break. It is abnormal, to say the least, for a president-elect to defend his behavior by pivoting to a contrast with the candidate he defeated. But invoking Clinton served a purpose that became clear as the press conference drew on. It defined any question he disapproved of as a challenge to his legitimacy, and thus a campaign matter, and thus by definition moot. Asked about Senator Lindsey Grahams proposal to introduce tougher sanctions on Russia, Trump harkened back to the campaign as well. Lindsey Graham  Ive been competing with him for a long time, he said, He is going to crack that 1 percent barrier one day. I didnt realize Lindsey Graham is still at it. Graham, of course, is not still at it. He is governing, not running against Trump. But to Trump, any action that might challenge him is indistinguishable from a contest for power. Perhaps most telling of all, Trump insisted that the election validated for all time his refusal to disclose his tax returns, the only way to substantiate his claims not to have any business with Russia: The only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters. Theyre the only ones. But no, I dont think so. I won  I mean, I became president  no, I dont think they care at all. I dont think they care at all. Likewise, the people dont care about his precedent-smashing plans to maintain ownership of his business in an un-blind trust. Selling off the Trump business, his lawyer came on to explain, would expose the president to unreasonable losses. Perhaps the most chilling thing about the affair was the abuse Trump and his staffers hurled upon the press corps. Trump brought in supporters to cheer his answers and shout at reporters who asked tough questions. He lambasted CNN as fake news, a term originally applied to deliberately false stories concocted by trolls, but quickly repurposed by conservatives for use against any news article that they disapprove of for any reason. Trumps press secretary threatened to eject CNN reporter Jim Acosta if he continued to demand the chance to ask a question, which Trump refused to grant. It is impossible to know what course American democracy will take under Trumps presidency. The fears of authoritarianism may prove overblown, and Trump may govern like a normal Republican. But the initial signs are quite concerning. Trump believes he can demolish normal standards of behavior, like the expectation of disclosing tax returns, and placing assets in a blind trust. He has received the full cooperation of his party, which controls Congress and has blocked any investigation or other mechanism for exerting pressure. His dismissal of the news media might simply be a slightly amped-up version of the conservative tradition of media abuse, but it seems to augur something worse. Rather than making snide cracks about liberal bias, Trump escalated into abuse and total delegitimization. Will the abuse of the media be seen as an idiosyncratic episode, or the beginning of something worse to come? We dont know. His early behavior is consistent with (though far from proof of) the thesis that he is an emerging autocrat. The people have granted him license to steal and hide as he wishes. The bully has his pulpit."}, {"date": "2017/01/11", "title": "Watch: Donald Trump Went at It With a CNN Reporter at His Press Conference", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-argues-with-a-cnn-reporter-at-his-press-conference.html", "text": "  Dont worry.

But St. Louis, not the Windy City, is the murder capital of the United States: 188 killings, which, according to analysis by FiveThirtyEight, comes out to 60 homicides per 100,000 residents  a rate that ranks among the highest in the world. The 2016 murder rate in many major U.S. cities is up for the second straight year, though the FBI has yet to release its official national crime statistics. The increases werent as massive as 2015  which saw the highest single-year uptick since 1971  but puts a snag in the decades-long downward trend of violent crime. FiveThirtyEight crunched the numbers, and based on available crime stats and media reports, estimates the rise in cities to be about 11.3 percent compared to 14.8 percent for the same grouping of municipalities in 2015. A handful of cities  including Chicago  altogether accounted for more than 75 percent of the overall murder rise in 2016, according to FiveThirtyEight: Baltimore, which witnessed a surge of violence, and its deadliest year in 2015, saw its homicides numbers dip about 6 percent, though it was still the second-highest figure after last year. Yet it still has the second-highest murder rate (killings per 100,00 people) behind St. Louis. One critical note: The overall U.S. murder (that is, not just in major cities) rate remains at historically low levels across the board, even with this two-year jump. And New York  Americas biggest city  saw record low crime-rates in 2016, including a more than 4 percent decrease in murder and a historic drop  below 1,000  in shootings.

During the presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton focused on his extraordinary qualities  the bullying, overt racism and misogyny, and authoritarianism  rather than his ordinary ones, like his plans to cut taxes for the rich and deregulate business. Now that the bullying authoritarian has won the presidency, the question changes to how to stop him from abusing his power in a Berlusconi-esque, or even Putin-esque, fashion. Lee Drutman and Mark Schmitt suggest that Democrats in Congress should focus on the safeguarding of norms and democracy, rather than fighting regular political battles on issues such as taxes, spending, and regulation. Since autocracy poses the more dire and potentially irreversible threat, they reason, that ought to receive priority: Challenging Trump primarily on normal politics  legislative fights over safety net programs and taxes  is like ignoring a cancer diagnosis and instead devoting all your time to going to your chiropractor because in the past, hes succeeded at getting rid of your sore back. This might be a sensible way to proceed if you think of the problem as though Trump has rigged firebombs to destroy the Constitution in one location and health insurance for 20 million people in another, and opponents face the diabolical question of choosing which one to save: (Hopefully this hypothetical does not give Steve Bannon any ideas.) But the actual calculation facing Trumps opponents is different. They dont need to choose whether to defend democratic norms or the regulatory and welfare states. They can, and must, defend both. To be fair to Drutman and Schmitt, who are both very smart analysts, their case does not rest on the simple assumption that Democrats have to choose where to apply limited resources. They argue instead that fighting Trump on economics will impair their ability to fight him on democratic norms, since a policy fight will draw to his side Republican allies who might otherwise oppose his autocratic and kleptocratic governing style. Making the fight about entitlements and taxes is only going to reinforce existing partisan divides, they argue, at a time when Democrats and Republicans need to figure out how to build alliances to minimize the damage Trump can do to basic norms, rather than reinforcing the divide that Trump exploited in the general election. But it seems clear that Trump has maintained conflicts of interest between his business and office that are orders of magnitude larger than what used to be considered a major scandal, a state of affairs Republicans have almost entirely ignored. Republicans have refused to support a special committee on Russian hacking that would give subpoena power to Democratic as well as Republican chairs, and allowed Trumps nominees to flout disclosure requirements. James Inhofe actually admitted to reporters that he opposes disclosure of financial interests by presidential nominees now, after having supported them in the past, entirely because the nominees were now of his party. Over the last couple of decades, appealing to the consciences of Republican legislators has not been a strategy with an encouraging record of success. Republicans in Congress support Trump because it is in their political interest to do so  he is popular with the base, and they face a much greater risk in opposing him than in supporting him. An excellent way to change this is to attack Trump on economics. Indeed, the entire GOP is rife for attack. Trump enters office with extraordinarily low political capital and an approval rating below 40 percent, which is unheard-of for a not-yet-inaugurated president who can still promise to be all things to all people. To the very limited extent that he had any positive appeal to swing voters (as opposed to simply being less hated than Hillary Clinton), it was because he was seen as antithetical to the normal plutocratic Republican agenda. And yet Trump and his Republican allies are carrying out an agenda diametrically opposed to the populist image he cultivated. They are busily deregulating Wall Street, cutting taxes for the rich, throwing working-class people off their health insurance. That agenda is easy to connect to the corrupt cast of his administration, which is staffing up with lobbyists and insiders who are using their power to enrich themselves and their partners. Trump and his party are supplying Democrats with a simple, easy-to-understand frame of opposition that has the virtue of being completely true. Republicans in Congress dont care right now about defending political norms because the public doesnt care much about political norms. That doesnt make it pointless for opponents, big-D Democrats and small-d democrats, to raise a fuss about them. But realistically, Republicans wont defect until political survival demands they do so. And the path to that outcome runs through exposing Trump as a corrupt handmaiden of wealth."}, {"date": "2017/01/11", "title": "Senate Gets Ready for an All-Night Vote-a-rama on Obamacare", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/senate-gets-ready-for-all-night-vote-a-rama-on-obamacare.html", "text": " In a fitting nightcap for one of the craziest days in Washington since Michele Bachmann left town, the U.S. Senate is planning an around-the-clock vote-a-rama beginning this afternoon, wherein senators (mostly Democrats) will offer amendments to the budget resolution that was originally designed to authorize the repeal of key elements of the Affordable Care Act. As I explained in a separate piece a week ago, the vote-a-rama is a quirky byproduct of the limits the Congressional Budget Act places on debating budget resolutions (or the reconciliation bills that implement them). While time for debate is strictly limited, ruling out filibusters, there are no limits on the number of amendments that can be offered. Thus senators (usually from the minority party) use this opportunity to offer a vast number of amendments on which votes are guaranteed  typically those that put senators on the spot and on the record on sensitive issues. In the context of this years budget, the amendments will mostly be about Obamacare. Several Republican senators have already indicated they want to amend the resolution to stretch out the time available for putting together a reconciliation bill  i.e., to actually repeal Obamacare. Its anyones guess how Donald Trumps signals this week that he wants action quickly will affect that possibility. Meanwhile, Democratic senators will be offering a blizzard of amendments, mostly seeking to place this or that Obamacare feature off-limits for the repeal bill. Senator Chris Murphy offered a glimpse of what we might expect: You can expect additional amendments that seek to insulate Medicare and Medicaid from big changes. And since House Speaker Paul Ryan has said the reconciliation bill will also include a measure banning distribution of Medicaid funds to Planned Parenthood, that will be the subject of still more amendments. All in all, reports McClatchys David Lightman, senators have filed 105 amendments as of early this morning. Since the vote-a-rama is expected to begin at some point this afternoon, it will probably go all night: Unlike normal Senate voting, these amendments will be called up at very short intervals, with virtually no debate. Thus they are not compatible with simultaneous Senate business. So the vote-a-rama probably wont get rolling until todays confirmation hearings are complete. And to make sure senators arent snoozing when they should be voting, word is they wont have cots available. The bigger question is whether the hearings and Donald Trumps press conference today (which Republican senators will be watching closely for additional explanation of the Bosss views on Obamacare) will absorb so much attention that the vote-a-rama will pass virtually unnoticed beyond the ranks of weary senators, staffers, and Capitol Hill reporters. But the votes will be tabulated and pored over later, even if they do not produce big messaging opportunities for either party."}, {"date": "2017/01/11", "title": "Trump Asks If We Are Living in Nazi Germany, As Priebus Denies Russia Leak", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-asks-if-we-are-living-in-nazi-germany.html", "text": " Donald Trump, his incoming Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, and the foreign nation with which Trump is accused of having secret connections all denied claims made in an unverified report drafted by a former British intelligence agent and published by BuzzFeed Tuesday.

The line quoted in the above tweet comes from Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, who told reporters Wednesday, The Kremlin does not engage in collecting compromising information. He blamed Trumps enemies for the report and, like Trump, called it a witch hunt. Trumps final tweet of his morning rant blamed U.S. intelligence agencies for allowing the report to be leaked.

But BuzzFeeds publication of unsubstantiated spy memos/opposition research claiming Trump is, in fact, a (kinky) Siberian candidate, has pushed the news cycle past its breaking point. To help you keep up, Daily Intelligencer will be maintaining a liveblog of the craziest day D.C. has seen for some time. 6:08: Corker brings things to a close. Says being a U.S. senator is like getting a PHD every day, because you have to take in so much information. Corker notes that Tillerson got through the hearing without even using notes, and suggests he should be graded on curve, considering that hes coming to this position from a different world.Why America should select a secretary of State who needs to be graded on a curve, Corker does not say. 5:54: Jeff Merkley notes that Saudi Arabia has used cluster munitions against civilians in Yemen. Merkley asks Tillerson what the U.S. could do to end that.Tillerson says he hopes we can provide Saudi Arabia with more intelligence about targeting (a suggestion that ignores the possibility that the Saudis are deliberately bombing soft targets). Merkely asks what we could do about the use of cluster munitions specifically, which is unambiguously intentional.Tillerson says he will need to review Americas policies on that subject. 5:43: Senator Markey notes that China has announced that it is going to invest billions of dollar into alternative energy. He suggests that if America does not take advantage of the global market demand for renewable energy, it will miss out on job growth. Markey asks Tillerson for his view on how America can capitalize on the renewable energy revolution.Tillerson says that this is largely a trade issue, and that he trusts free market forces to work it out. 5:28: Senator Shaheen asks if Tillerson believes it is time to end subsidies to Americas fossil fuel industry. Tillerson says that he does not believe that energy companies receive subsidies. 5:22: Rubio argues that true foreign policy realism requires moral clarity. And the Florida senator explains that he asked Tillerson to say whether or not China and Saudi Arabia were human rights violators, earlier in the hearing, so as to test the clarity of his moral vision.Rubio says that the rationale for Tillersons nomination was that, even though he lacks diplomatic experience, he has traveled the world while working for Exxon and boasts extensive knowledge of global affairs.But the fact that Tillerson was unaware of the heinousness of Dutertes drug war  and was unwilling to condemn Saudi Arabia and Chinas human rights violations  has thrown that rationale into doubt.Rubio says America needs a secretary of State who stands up for our moral principles. Rubios statement strongly implies that he does not support Tillersons confirmation.But then 5:15: Menendez reads a passage from a Time Magazine story on Russias expectations for Tillerson: Tillerson says that he hopes if the committee has taken anything from todays hearings, its that these passages do not accurately characterize his views. Tillerson says he is Boy Scout who believes in duty to country, and does not view geopolitics as a game. 5:10: Senator Menendez asks if Tillerson recalls the time Exxon used legal loopholes to do business with three nations designated as state sponsors of terror. Tillerson says that he has no memory of that. 5:04: Coons reviews the various issues on which Tillerson has taken a position today that stands in tension with Donald Trumps  among them, climate change, Iran, nuclear proliferation, NATO, and Muslim bans.Tillerson says that Trump has been very open to his point-of-view in their private conversations, and that this was one reason he chose to accept the nomination. 5:00: Earlier, Tillerson said that the Obama administrations nuclear agreement with Iran still allowed Tehran to purchase a nuclear weapon, as it merely barred the regime from developing their own.Senator Coons notes that the agreement does, in fact, bar Iran from purchasing a nuclear weapon. Tillerson admits that he misspoke. 4:40: Senator Merkley asks if Tillerson sees climate change as a national security threat.Tillerson says that he doesnt regard climate change as a top national security threat, though he recognizes others might. Merkley notes the possibility that climate change had a role in causing the drought in the Middle East that helped instigate the Syrian crisis.Tillerson argues that there is ambiguity about climate changes role in that drought.Merkely tries to make Tillerson see the broader point  that if the world is getting warmer, then droughts will occur more frequently, and the events in Syria suggest that this will create more foreign policy crises. Tillerson rejects the idea that there is a scientific consensus on whether climate change will lead to more droughts and extreme weather events of other kinds.Merkley finds that disappointing. 4:37: Republican senator Rob Portman asks what Tillerson would do to ensure that Israel isnt judged by a double standard at the United Nations, but treated as a regular member of the international community.Tillerson says that Irans behavior in the Middle East has made it a common enemy of the U.S., Israel, and the Arab world  and that this opens up the possibility of greater cooperation between the Jewish state and Arab nations.Portman asks if Russia has a genuine interest in fighting ISIS in Syria, or if it merely wishes to prop up the Assad regime.Tillerson says that Islamic radicalism presents a real threat to the Russian homeland and so there may be opportunities for cooperation between the U.S. and Putins regime on that matter. 4:26: Cory Booker notes that Trumps national security adviser Michael Flynn has said that fear of Muslims is rational, and that Islam is a political ideology, not a religion. Booker asks Tillerson if he sees that rhetoric as helpful.Tillerson says its critical that we deal with the Muslim world on the basis of mutual respect, not judgement of faith. 4:11: Senator Markey asks if Tillerson agrees with Donald Trumps past statement that it wouldnt be a bad thing if Japan, South Korea, and Saudi Arabia acquired nuclear weapons.Tillerson says that he does not agree, and that no one wants to see more nuclear weapons on the planet.Markey asks about Trumps recent vow to expand Americas nuclear capability. Tillerson suggests Trump was describing a modernization of Americas nuclear arsenal, not an expansion of it. 4:00: Democratic senator Chris Murphy returns to Tillersons refusal to condemn Dutertes drug war. Tillerson again insists that he will not classify Duterte as a human rights violator until he reviews the facts of the matter himself. 3:50: Kaine asks if Tillerson believes that the two-state solution is the proper outcome of the Israel-Palestine conflict. (Notably, Trumps prospective ambassador to Israel has suggested he does not).Tillerson says that he does believe that the two-state solution is the dream. Kaine asks what Tillerson would do as secretary of State to advance the prospects of that dream.Tillerson says that peace between the Israelis and Palestinians may not be possible for some time. He suggests that future generations may be more amenable to peace. Says the Palestinians have suffered terribly, often due to the failures of their own leadership. 3:45: Senator Tim Kaine asks Tillerson about his views on the crisis of migration from Central America.Tillerson talks about improving conditions in Central American countries through foreign aid and infrastructure investment. He says measures intended to extend compassion to undocumented immigrants  like Obamas various executive orders  have had the unintended consequence of encouraging further illegal immigration, which endangers the lives of the migrants themselves. 3:36: Republican senator Jeff Flake notes that America has diplomatic relations with many nations with unsavory governments, Saudi Arabia among them. Flake asks if Tillerson believes (as Rubio appears to) that having diplomatic relations with an unsavory government is tantamount to making concessions to an oppressive regime?Tillerson says Americas disengagement with Cuba is grounded in history, and its up to Congress whether or not to change many aspects of our relationship with the Communist island. 3:32: Mark Udall notes that we gave disengagement from Cuba 50 years and it did not achieve its stated objectives. He argues that engaging with the Cuban government has allowed the United States to coordinate on a variety of important issues, including how to handle oil spills off the shores of both nations. He asks if Tillerson would end the Obama administrations engagement with Cuba.Tillerson said he would need to consult the State Department to review its reasoning for changing policy towards Cuba. 3:29: Democratic senator Mark Udall reminds Tillerson that he once praised the Paris Climate Accords. He asks if Tillerson thinks the U.S. should stay in that agreement, and if not, why not.Tillerson says its important for the U.S. to have a seat at the table on these issues. He does not want the U.S. to leave that table. It is not clear whether staying at this figurative table would mean remaining a signatory of the Paris agreement. 3:20: Cory Gardner asks Tillerson what more the U.S. can do to force China to obey international law in the South China Sea.Tillerson says that China has been claiming control of islands that are not rightfully Chinas. He likens Chinas island-building in the South China Sea to Russias annexation of Crimea. He says that the Obama administrations failure to respond has emboldened China.Gardner asks if Tillerson supports a more aggressive posture towards China.Tillerson says the U.S. needs to send China a message about its activities in the South China Sea. 3:17: Shaheen asks if Tillerson supports banning Muslims from entering the United States. Tillerson says he does not support banning any religious group as a class, but does believe that we need to be careful about who we let into the country. 3:12: Democratic senator Jeanne Shaheen asks Tillerson why he thinks its important to divest himself from ExxonMobil.Tillerson says that he was humbled by the opportunity to serve his country. And, in light of that fact, he immediately hired an ethics counsel who advised him to completely separate himself from ExxonMobil. I dont even want the appearance that there is any connection between myself and the fortunes, up or down, of the ExxonMobil corporation.Shaheen thanks Tillerson, notes his position stands in stark contrast to the president-elects refusal to divest from his globe-spanning business interests. 3:07: Ron Johnson asks Tillerson if he agrees that Israel has already conceded every point to the Palestinians, and the Palestinians just refuse to reach an agreement on two states. (Johnson asks this question after decrying the fact that the United Nations recently condemned Israels settlement expansion in the West Bank. Ending settlement expansion is one of the most basic pre-requistes for a two-state solution, in the view of the international community and every American president of the past three decades).Tillerson says he knows there were offers in the past. He says the conflict can only be solved by Israel and the Palestinians. 3:02: Idaho senator Jim Risch says Americas policies on Iran and North Korea need to be re-thought and re-announed. Risch says hes not going to press Tillerson on that because he knows the Exxon CEO is just getting his feet on the ground. (Apparently, Risch does not expect nominees for secretary of State to be prepared to explain their plans on top foreign policy issues).Its difficult for people to understand the transition from the private sector to the world of diplomacy, is a difference, Risch observes, but suggests he is excited by the fact that Tillerson lacks experience directly relevant to the job hes been nominated for. 2:59: Menendez notes that Obamas recent opening with Cuba has not ended authoritarian repression there. Suggests returning to the policy regime that failed to end authoritarian repression in Cuba for half-a-century would be wise. 2:53: Bob Menendez notes that ExxonMobil filled out a lobbying disclosure form on Russian sanctions. Tillerson suggests that Exxon might have lobbied America in favor of sanctioning its own operations in Russia. Menendez thinks this is unlikely. 2:48: Tillerson refuses to condemn Rodrigo Dutertes policy of murdering alleged drug dealers without trial. He says he does not trust news accounts of the issue, would want to review the facts on the ground. Rubio notes that Duterte himself has bragged about his extrajudicial assassinations of drug dealers. Tillerson says if thats true, hes against it.Rubio asks if Tillerson considers Saudi Arabia a human rights violator. Tillerson says the Saudis have different values from us, and he would like to see progress on womens rights there. But he isnt sure if they are a human rights violator and is worried that classifying Saudi Arabia as such would stymie the great progress the kingdom is making on human rights. 2:43: Rubio asks Tillerson if he would veto a bill ending a travel ban with Cuba.Tillerson says that he expects that the president would not sign such a bill. Tillerson says he would advise Trump not to end the embargo on Cuba.Rubio asks Tillerson if he would support placing Cuba back on the list of state sponsors of terror, in a tone that suggests it is obvious that Cuba is a major sponsor of terrorism. Tillerson says the decision to remove Cuba from that list will be reviewed. 2:31: Senator Cardin enters into the record a form that shows ExxonMobil spent over $3 million lobbying the government on Iranian sanctions. 2:21: Tillerson is back in session. Cory Booker returns to the subject of whether ExxonMobil has lobbied the government against sanctions. Booker notes that an entity called USA Engage did lobby against sanctions, and ExxonMobil supports that organization.Tillerson says that Booker should ask ExxonMobil (the company that he is CEO of) about that stuff, says he has no idea what the companys relationship is to USA Engage. 1:48: Congressional Black Caucus chair Cedric Richmond opens by likening the comittees decision to schedule Booker and Lewis for the second day of hearings to forcing them into the back of the bus. During his confirmation hearing, Sessions represented himself as a staunch defender of civil rights, saying that a series of desegregation cases handled by his U.S. Attorneys office were among his proudest professional accomplishments.Richmond asks the panel to ask itself: If Sessions is such a civil rights hero, why is the entire civil rights community  every major organization and politican associated with the cause of racial equality  united in opposition to his appointment as attorney general? 1:41: Congressman (and Civil Rights hero) John Lewis testifies against Sessions. Lewis scrutinized what it means to value law and order, as Sessions claims to. He notes that when he was growing up in Alabama, law and order meant that if you looked a white person in the eye, you could be arrested. The forces of law and order in Alabama was so strong, Lewis says, we had to risk our lives to take a stand for our cause. Lewis calls the Supreme Courts decision to strike down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act a sad and dark moment for our democracy  and notes that Sessions praised the decision as a good thing for the south. 1:24: Meanwhile, Cory Booker just became the first sitting senator to testify against the cabinet appointment of a colleague. Booker noted that the Obama Justice Department has recently uncovered evidence of systemic abuse in police departments across the country, including Ferguson, Missouri, and Newark, New Jersey. He argued that a Justice Department run by Alabama senator Jeff Sessions would not continue this urgently needed change as that change demands a more courageous empathy than senator Sessionss record demonstrates.Love of country means loving all of our citizens, even the most marginalized, the most degraded and the most unfortunate, Booker said. The arc of the moral universe does not naturally curve towards justice  we must bend it. America needs an attorney general who is resilute and determined to bend the arc, Booker concluded. Senator Sessionss record does not speak to the desire, intetion or will. 1:19: Tillerson says that he would like to do a full review of the Iran nuclear agreement. He says that the current agreement freezes their ability to develop a nuclear weapon but does not deny them the ability to purchase one. The real important question is what comes at the end of this agreement? He suggests that the endpoint must be no uranium-enrichment in Iran, whatsoever. 1:14: Senator Chris Coons reminds Tillerson that the intelligence community believes Russia intends to undermine the current global order, asks if Tillerson will heed the intelligence agencies findings.Tillerson says he will.Coons informs Tillerson that Trump just acknowledged that Russia perpetrated cyberattacks against the United States last year  but did not committee himself to any particular line of action. Coons asks if Tillerson would support a congressional effort to pass sanctions on Russia.Tillerson says that he would appreciate having sanctions as a tool, but would not want to have the executive branchs hands tied. He suggests that he would like to use the sanctions as a threat to give Putin the opportunity to change his behavior. 1:05: Wyoming senator John Barrasso asks what Tillerson will do to reassert Americas position in the world.Tillerson says he will do this buy projecting strength, dealing from strength, forming a strategy to defeat the most pressing threats, and engaging our friends and allies. (This diverges from the Obama doctrine, which apparently held that America benefits from projecting weakness, acting without a strategy, and abandoning all allies). 12:58: Democratic senator Jeff Merkley now grilling Tillerson on his claim that Exxon did not lobby against sanctions on Russia. Merkley cites a Politico article headlined ExxonMobil helped defeat Russia sanctions bill.Tillerson says that story is inaccurate. 12:52: Following Trumps press conference, CNN tries to distance itself from BuzzFeeds decision to publish the unverified spy memos on the president-elects relationship to Russia. CNN reported the the intelligence agencies had presented Trump with a synopsis of the memo, and described its allegations in broad terms. 12:43: Rand Paul asks Tillerson whether the failure of the American invasion of Iraq would influence his view on whether the United States should pursue regime change in Iran via military action.Tillerson says this is an instance in which our values and interests may come into conflict, since wed like to free foreign people from oppressive regimes, but dont want to risk the lives of American soldiers unless absolutely necessary.. Whats most important is that we protect the American people first. I think sometimes we have too many priorities. He says any decision to pursue regime change cannot be taken lightly, and that policymakers must ask, what comes next? Argues the same question applies to Syria.Tillerson says he would like to pursue regime change through nonmilitary means. But he also says we must not ignore the threat Irans support for terrorism presents. 12:38: Okay, back to Tillersons confirmation hearing. Senator Ed Markey asks Tillerson to assure the American people that the Trump administration will honor international climate agreements.Tillerson notes that Trump won on the message, America first. So, his evaluation of international agreements would proceed from an estimate of how they impact our national competitiveness.Markey asks if it should be a priority of the United States to forge climate change agreements with other countries.Tillerson says that America should be a part of those discussions. Says nothing about whether preventing climate change should be a priority. 12:34: Trumps drug price comments have done a number on pharmaceutical stocks. 12:19: Its over. In sum: The president-elect condemned Americas intelligence agencies and its leading cable news network. He suggested that news outlets that report on material he deems irresponsible will lose access to his administration. He said that he would force our southern neighbor to finance our border wall, establish enormous tariffs on the goods of companies that relocate outside the United States, negotiate drug prices with big pharma, demand congressional Republicans pass a replacement for Obamacare at the same time that they repeal it (thus, contradicting Mitch McConnells plan), and try to establish friendlier relations with Russia, even though he believes that nation did hack Democratic institutions during the 2016 election.His lawyer also laid out a reasonably detailed plan for minimizing his conflicts of interest. But that plan will not include the release of Trumps tax returns  an omission Trump explained by repeating the long-discredited lie that the IRS wont let him to release that information because he is under audit. When the press reminded him that they already know that isnt true, Trump suggested that reporters are the only people who care about his tax returns (a recent poll found that 62 percent of Republicans would like to see those returns). 12:14: Trump says Putin shouldnt have done the hack, but he doesnt believe hell be doing it more now: Russia will have far greater respect for our country when Im leading it. Trump then suggested that Hillary Clinton presented Putin with a literal reset button. He then impersonated Putins reaction to said reset button, the guy said, what is this piece of plastic?12:12: Trump says he was aware that they were trying to hack us, and the Republican National Committee was able to prevent itself from being hacked, unlike the DNC, which lacked hacking defense. 12:07: Asked what he meant by his tweet likening America to Nazi Germany, Trump says he thinks its a disgrace that the intelligence community leaked information to BuzzFeed News, which is a failing pile of garbage that will suffer consequences.A CNN reporter tries to ask a question. Trump says he will not give him a question because his outlet is fake news.A Breitbart reporter than asks Trump what he will do about irresponsible journalism. 12:04: Trump says he likes Mexico, doesnt blame them for taking advantage of the United States. He blames America for letting Mexico do so.12:02: Trump vows to start building the wall this year. He says Mexico will reimburse us for the cost of the wall. That will happen, whether its a tax or whether its a payment.Trump reminisces that when he would tell crowds that he would build a wall they would go crazy. Id say whos going to pay for the wall, and theyd scream out Mexico. 12:00: Trump reiterates vow to slap a major border tax on companies that relocate outside of the United States. He says the real number of Americans who are involuntarily unemployed is 96 million. 11:57: Trump says that Obamacare is a disaster. It will collapse in 2017. And the easy thing for Republicans would be to sit back and let it happen  and let the American people blame Democrats for passing that awful law. But instead, Trump promises that Republicans will do repeal and replace simultaneously. Trump promises lower deductibles, which is antithetical to most of the GOPs alternative healthcare proposals. 11:54: Trump praises the brilliance of Jeff Sessions and Rex Tillerson in their confirmation hearings. I think we have one of the great cabinets ever put together. And weve been hearing that from so many people. 11:51: Dillon addresses the Emoluments Clause. She argues that it bars foreign entities from giving officeholders gifts, but does not prohibit fair exchanges, like paying for hotel rooms.The Constitution does not require president-elect Trump to do anything here, Dillon says, but Trump has decided to donate all profits from foreign visitors to his hotel to the U.S. Treasury, so that the American people will be the ones who profit. 11:48: Dillon says if Trump sold his assets, it would actually make his conflicts of interest worse: Trump would still be entitled to royalties on branded properties, and the price he sold them at would be subjected to scrutiny: Was it too high? Was there pay-to-play?If he sold these properties without his personal branding, their value would plummet and Trump should not be expected to devalue the company he has built, Dillon maintains. 11:40: Trump tax attorney Sheri Dillon comes forward to talk conflicts of interest. Notes that Nelson Rockefeller was never given this hard a time about conflicts of interest when he was made vice president. Emphasizes that Trump would be legally free to continue running his business, implying any measures he takes to avoid conflicts of interest should be met with gratitude.Dillon says Trumps sons will take over the business. An ethics adviser will be given veto authority over any new deals. President-elect Trump will resign from all of his organizations entities, as will Ivanka Trump. The president-elect has already sold off his publicly held stock. He will put his assets into a trust that will hold his illiquid business assets  including branded properties and rights to royalties.Trump canceled pending deals, which cost his family millions of dollars, Dillon says. There will be no new foreign deals during Trumps presidency, though there will be domestic ones. He will only be aware of these deals if he hears about them through the news media. 11:37: Trump is asked whether he will release his tax returns to prove he has no deals in Russia. Trump says that he wont because he cant, because he is under audit (which is a lie, he is free to release his returns whether or not he is under audit). The president-elect says reporters are the only ones who care about his tax returns. 11:34: The president-elect suggests that he would never have been involved in urine play with Russian sex workers because he is a germaphobe. 11:31: Trump is asked how his acknowledgement of Russias responsibility for the cyberattacks will affect his desire to form better relations with Putins government. Trump praises Putin for calling BuzzFeeds memos fake news. Says that if he had anything on Trump or the RNC, Putin would have released it just like he did with the DNCs emails. Trump then goes on a tangent about the awful things John Podesta said about Hillary Clinton in hacked emails. Argues the hacked information was important (which is hard to square with his claim last week that they had absolutely no impact on the elections outcome). 11:27: Trump is asked whether the intelligence agencies presented him with a two-page synopsis on the unsubstantiated Russia rumors. Trump says the meeting was confidential, but suggests he only saw the information outside of the meeting. Calls it fake news and a disgrace. He says he thinks Russia was responsible for the 2016 hacking, but argues that were hacked by a lot of people. When the OPM was hacked, we didnt make a big deal out of that, Trump notes. 11:22: Trump says pharm-ma is getting away with murder. Suggests government will negotiate drug prices, which would be a huge break from GOP orthodoxy. Says drug companies should manufacture their wares in America. Says he will be the best jobs president God ever created. 11:20: Trump comes out swinging at the intelligence agencies, saying if they released the BuzzFeed memos, it is a great blot on their record. He thanks the news organizations that looked at that nonsense, and chose not to publish it. He says his respect for those news outlets has gone up a notch. Brief, isolated bout of applause.11:18: Vice president-elect Mike Pence says he has always been a supporter of a free press. But with freedom, comes responsibility. Pence argues that BuzzFeeds decision to publish false and unsubstantiated claims about the president-elect can only be explained by media bias and the American people are sick of it. 11:16: Sean Spicer appears at the podium in Trump Tower and decries BuzzFeeds shameful and disgraceful publication of baseless claims about the president-elect. Calls BuzzFeed a left-wing blog that publishes fake news. 10:56: Ron Johnson says that he loves Tillersons private sector experience, which he says was reflected in the fact that the Exxon CEOs opening statement used words like reality and logic  the kind of words people use in business.MEANWHILE IN TRUMP TOWER 10:46: Environmental protestors encourage senators to be brave, and resist the temptation to put Exxon in charge of the State Department.Senator Ron Johnson asks Tillerson to explain what he meant by saying Russia does not think like we do. Tillerson says that Russias central goal is to assert themselves as power in the global world order. And so the steps being taken are simply to make that point.Tillerson says that Russias central goal is to assert themselves as power in the global world order. And so the steps being taken are simply to make that point.Tillerson says that Russias central goal is to assert themselves as power in the global world order. And so the steps being taken are simply to make that point.Tillerson suggests that the conversation America needs to have with Russia is about whether it wants to always be Americas adversary, or to be a partner, at least on some issues.Tillerson says that he considers Russia an unfriendly adversary at this point. 10:35: Senator Bob Menendez notes that Tillerson has called sanctions a poor tool for diplomacy in the past. Asks to know whether Tillerson has changed his mind.Tillerson notes that sanctions are inherently harmful to American business. (Obamas sanctions on Russia put the freeze on Exxons plans to drill in the Siberian arctic). So, he would like sanctions to be designed carefully.Menendez suggests that sanctions dont hurt American business, but merely ask them to put patriotism over profits. He notes that Exxon lobbied against sanction against Iran. With that as a history, Menendez asks, what message are you now going to be able to send to American businesses that are intent to pursue their interests even when they conflict with our national interest.Tillerson says that, to his knowledge, Exxon has never directly lobbied against sanctions. 10:26: Rubio asks if Tillerson considers Vladimir Putin a war criminal. Tillerson isnt so sure about that. Rubio argues that Russia has targeted civilians in Syria. Tillerson isnt so sure about that. Rubio is done. He did not comport himself as a senator who is excited to vote for Rex Tillerson. If the Democrats unite against his nomination, Tillerson can only afford to lose two Republican votes in the Senate. 10:22: Rubio asks if Tillerson would support legislation that sanctioned people who were involved in cyberattacks against the United States. Tillerson is reluctant to commit to that. Cyberattacks are occurring from many nations, Tillerson observes. Rubio asks if he would support legislation that would sanction people from any nation who were involved in cyberattacks. Tillerson suggests that he would not want the president to sign that, because he would prefer the president have the flexibility to withhold sanctions if there are other national interests at stake. Rubio finds this answer troubling. He asks if Tillerson would advise Trump to repeal Obamas executive orders sanctioning Russia over its 2016 cyberattacks. Tillerson says that what we really need is a comprehensive cybersecurity policy. Makes no commitment with regard to Obamas sanctions. 10:20: Cardin asks whether the United States maintain its leadership on climate change issues. Tillerson says the U.S. must keep its seat at the table on climate issues. He says that climate change requires a global response, because no one nation can solve it alone. 10:15: Cardin asks Tillerson what he would have done to punish Russia after its invasion of Crimea, since the CEO has claimed that Obamas reaction was insufficiently tough.Tillerson says that he would have made a powerful response that said, yes, youve taken Crimea, but it stops here. Specifically, Tillerson says that he would have moved NATO aerial assets to surveil the Russia/Ukraine border. 9:55: Tillerson delivers his opening statement. He argues that America has failed to lead in recent years, withdrawing from some parts of the world while intervening in others with good intentions but failed results. Tillerson suggests that he is against foreign policy failures, but very much for American leadership. Tillerson strikes some hawkish notes on China. He says China has no rights to some of the islands it claims in the South China Sea, and has violated its commitments on trade. But he argues that America and China have a shared interest in combating extremism. Tillerson also argued that America must have the courage to hold allies to their commitments, because when we dont, it is an injsutice not only to us, but also to allies that do uphold their commitments, like Israel. (Israel has repeatedly violated its commitment under international law not to build settlements in occupied territory). Like Trump, Tillerson is decidedly more biting in his assessment of China than of Russia. But he does say that Russias recent actions have not advanced American interests. 9:46: Cardin notes that news reports suggest Russia may well have compromising information on Trump. Suggests we need to stand up to this bully in Moscow. Cardin says that he was disappointed in Tillersons prepared opening remarks (which were submitted to the committee yesterday, but not yet read). Those remarks did not have much to say about Russias cyberattacks during the 2016 elections, Cardin contends, but the statement did suggest that Putins aggression was a product of the Obama administrations weakness. The Maryland senator, thus, asks Tillerson to tell him what, precisely, he would have liked Obama to have done differently. (Notably, Tillerson lobbied the Obama White House to lift sanctions on Russia, over its invasion of Crimea  a position thats in tension with the idea that he believes Obama was too soft on Putin). 9:43: Democratic senator Ben Cardin argues that, those who suggest anyone who can run a business can run a government agency does a great disservce to both, noting that serving the interests of the American people is very different from serving the narrow, market-driven interests of Exxons shareholders. 9:30: Senate Foreign Relations Committee chair Bob Corkers opening statement catalogues the many disasters that have arisen from the Obama administrations (supposed) failure to lead. These include Russias annexation of Crimea, a move that the president-elect has had little interest in condemning. 9:26: Exxon CEO Rex Tillersons confirmation hearing for secretary of State begins with endorsements from Texas senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, followed by former Georgia senator Sam Nunn, and ex-Defense secretary Robert Gates. The theme of their statements: Tillersons warm relationship with the Russian government and ties to the oil industry arent liabilities  theyre assets.Nunn emphasized the (very real) danger inherent to hostile relations between two nations with the worlds largest nuclear stockpiles, while Gates argued that Tillerson was well-positioned to prevent Americas relationship with Russia from getting any worse. 7.48 a.m.: The president-elect denies that Russia has cultivated him as its stooge via blackmail, likens the United States to Nazi Germany. Meanwhile, incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus decried the memos claims as phoney baloney garbage, on the Today Show. Ostensibly, Trump believes that the big problem in Nazi Germany was that its intelligence agency was insufficiently loyal to its president."}, {"date": "2017/01/11", "title": "Behold the Next New Astor Place", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/behold-the-next-new-astor-place.html", "text": " When was the heyday of Astor Place? In 1847, when an impresario gratified New Yorks cultural pretensions by erecting its grandest opera house and opening it with an authentically Italian cast singing Verdis nearly new Ernani? Two years later, when patriotic populism stirred a crowd of protesters to try chasing off the English actor William Macready? In 1860, when the Republican candidate for president (Abraham Lincoln) electrified a skeptical audience in a speech at Cooper Union? Was it when the Third Avenue el clattered through in the 1870s, or after it was taken down in the 1950s, and sunlight streamed in over the low buildings? Or later, when for a couple of bucks you could buy a used Clash LP at the flea market in front of the parking lot? Few open areas of the city have changed identity as regularly as Astor Place and adjoining Cooper Square, so every generation has its grumblers who remember the way they used to be. Now, after several years of construction on the knot of streets and plazas, the fences have been peeled away like bandages, leaving a broad and orderly plain designed by the New York architecture firm WXY. New curbs confine traffic to sensible channels rather than let it slosh across a delta of conflicting lanes. Sidewalks have been broadened into pedestrian boulevards. Astor Place in 2017 feels like fresh turf waiting to receive its next deposit of history. The young techies and skateboarders and students who swirl through these days know only its current, amiably deluxe incarnation, a symphony in metal and glass: Fukihiko Makis office building, as glossy and black as a Steinway grand; Charles Gwathmeys amoeboid turquoise tower on the south side of the square; Thom Maynes self-deconstructing Cooper Union academic center; and, farther downtown, the starchy white Standard East Village hotel. If there are older habitus who still remember the neighborhoods corral of dilapidated buildings, they are vastly outnumbered by the callow throngs. Even the scattering of saplings and Piet Oudolfs still-fragile plantings in their new beds seem to sing of youth. In this amnesiac corner of a nostalgic city, memory is preserved in architectural artifacts. A strip in the sidewalk marks the direction of now-erased Stuyvesant Street, and a stand of mosaic-covered poles recalls the Astor Place of a generation ago. In the 1980s, a Vietnam vet named Jim Power exorcised his demons by encrusting lampposts with little tiles, turning steel poles into colorful monuments to local heroes and landmarks. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani decreed them to be vandalism and ordered most of them ripped out, but a corps of activist residents defended the lampposts as guerrilla street art. In todays Astor Place, they are something else: survivors and relics. Carefully removed before construction, restored, and now returned, they stand as glittery witnesses of a more freewheeling time. (Just try adorning several dozen utility poles without authorization in todays Manhattan: Youd be courting a swat-team intervention.) Powers totems are not the first bit of wistful artifice to enter the square. The gracious subway kiosk in the middle may look like its been there since the IRT opened in 1904; actually, its a 1986 reproduction. Cooper Square is not a square, and Astor Place is not a piazza but a two-block thoroughfare that the redesign has truncated to one, running from Broadway to Lafayette Street. The wide, busy triangle has no name: Its just a haphazard clearing formed by the intersection of angled streets. In the mid19th century, this was a border zone between two vastly different worlds: one patrician and decorous, the other rowdy and poor. In his book The Shakespeare Riots, Nigel Cliff describes the polar contrast between genteel Broadway and the Bowery, that boulevard of penny-ante hustles. On Bowery, he writes, Flames smelling of turpentine illuminated glass signs advertising cockpits, rat-baiting arenas, boxing rings, dime museums, bowling alleys, and gambling dens, together with scores of taverns and beer gardens, some of which served firewater through a rubber tube straight from the barrel at three cents a gulp. Even as recently as a couple of decades ago, this area formed a junction of classes and lifestyles. Ukrainians wandered in from the borscht and pierogi joints on Second Avenue, squatters and punks from Tompkins Square Park and Alphabet City; addicts and alcoholics drifted up from the Bowery. At Astor Place, they met clean-cut newcomers, NYU professors, and aging hippies, along with the new wave of West Village bankers on their weekend slumming excursions. The triangle no longer has that souklike vibe, and no amount of street design can bring it back, but, with a combination of modesty and flair, WXY has literally paved the way for the next iteration. The architects have sprinkled the plaza with an assortment of seating options: stone steps, a few handsome granite blocks, and several of the firms signature zipper benches, which look like solidified sound waves that have alighted on the asphalt. But most of the design inhabits a thin plane between the heavy-duty surgery belowground and the evolving architecture above. Streets and plazas depend on details that slip underfoot, unnoticed. New sinuous edges enclosing the old Peter Cooper Park, porous pavers that keep rainwater from pooling, strategically placed soil beds that draw and store storm water, preventing the streets from turning into cataracts  unless youre a road-design junkie, these operate at the subliminal level, which is precisely the point. Claire Weisz, WXYs co-founder, has used what she calls a DoT palette, materials plain and tough enough to satisfy the Department of Transportation, which means that rather than having the sleek preciousness of a corporate plaza, Astor Place and Cooper Square look like what they are: city streets. This is distinguished, if self-effacing, public design. The complex of new plazas sets off the existing structures. Tony Rosenthals Alamo is back where it was last seen in 2014, only now the big black cube balances en pointe on a broad plaza rather than a traffic-ringed reef. Maynes molting battleship looks newly impressive from vantage points that no longer sit in the middle of traffic. The ornate subway entrance, too, has acquired a fresh old-fashioned graciousness. But the longevity of WXYs design will depend on how it shapes the future, not how it frames the past. The new pedestrian areas are ample enough  a full acre, all told  that they could (but do not yet) accommodate several competing outdoor cafs, a farmers market, a political rally, craft kiosks, and pop-up pavilions designed by Cooper Unions architecture students. The design is a blackboard full of possibilities, and it is up to those who inhabit it to chalk the next chapter onto its waiting surface. *This article appears in the January 9, 2017, issue of New York Magazine."}, {"date": "2017/01/11", "title": "Vocal Anti-Vaxxer Claims Trump Asked Him to Chair a Committee on Vaccine Safety", "url": "http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2017/01/trump-taps-anti-vaxxer-to-chair-committee-on-vaccine-safety.html", "text": " Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is an outspoken vaccine skeptic, and on Tuesday he said President-elect Donald Trump tapped him to head up a commission on vaccination safety and scientific integrity. Trump has openly questioned the link between vaccines and autism before and during the presidential campaign  a belief that has been completely debunked and discredited. While exiting Trump Tower, Kennedy, who has written articles and a book that peddled the autism-vaccine conspiracy, and has lobbied for vaccine-exemption provisions, gave reporters a few clues on what this commission will entail. President-elect Trump has some doubts about the current vaccine policies, and he has questions about it, he said. His opinion doesnt matter, he added, but the science does matter, and we ought to be reading the science, and we ought to be debating the science. And that everybody ought to be able to be assured that the vaccines that we have  hes very pro-vaccine, as am I  but theyre as safe as they possibly can be. Late on Tuesday, the Trump transition team walked back Kennedys claim. The president-elect enjoyed his discussion with Robert Kennedy Jr. on a range of issues and appreciates his thoughts and ideas, said spokeswoman Hope Hicks. The president-elect is exploring the possibility of forming a commission on autism, which affects so many families; however no decisions have been made at this time. The anti-vaxxers are a fringe movement, but a vocal one. The junk science has managed to attract the conspiracy-minded on both the left and the right (Kennedy Jr. is a Democrat)  but its no small thing that these totally baseless theories might have some traction with the future White House, as it could have serious implications for the nations public health. Yoel Inbar, a psychologist at the University of Toronto who studies anti-vaccination beliefs, called Kennedy Jrs appointment, if true, terrible. Even if the commission doesnt find anything (they wont), he wrote in an email to Science of Us, people will likely hear about it and infer that something must have been up in order for the government to investigate. In other words, the Trump administration may be dealing another blow to scientific facts.

His speech devoted only the most perfunctory attention to his many accomplishments in office. Instead, he delivered a stirring call to his country to defend its democracy against a looming threat  one he never named, even elliptically, but whose identity was clear in the references laced throughout his speech. Obamas address walked through the currents that had produced the Trump presidency, warning of their dangers and offering solutions. He suggested rampant income inequality and stagnant growth as sources of political instability. Stark inequality, he warned, made struggling people believe that their government only serves the interests of the powerful  a recipe for more cynicism and polarization in our politics. Racism and racial polarization, too, allowed a politics where any economic issue would be framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle-class and undeserving minorities  framed, Obama implied, but did not state, by right-wing demagogues. And Obama argued that the sorting of America into hostile tribes, where all sides increasingly shun those with different views and see only news that confirms their beliefs, makes compromise impossible. Obama has made versions of these arguments before. But from this beginning he launched into a more direct attack on Trumpism. He insisted on a respect for science and reason, noting that the spirit of the Enlightenment formed the very basis for democratic government. The philosophy of democratic government is premised on citizens using facts to arrive at truth. He cited the denial of the findings of climate science, a hallmark of Trump and several of his advisers, as the ultimate case of anti-empiricism. Obama defined the threat to liberal democracy as an ideological struggle almost akin to the Cold War. The demise of the Soviet Union created a unipolar world, in which the presidents of the postCold War era presented democracy as an unchallengeable idea spreading across the globe. Since 9/11, George W. Bush, and then Obama, have mostly defined the threat to the liberal order as coming from radical jihadism. But Obama took pains to include illiberal states in the ranks of the enemies of democracy. The liberal order, he said, is now being challenged  not just by radical Islam but also autocrats. Obama defended pluralism, reminding white Americans that their ancestors from Italy, Ireland, and Poland were seen as foreign threats who could not be assimilated, like Latino immigrants today. He received probably his longest ovation during the speech by rejecting discrimination against Muslim-Americans. Obama attacked populism for fostering indiscriminate suspicion of elected officials: We weaken those ties when we define some of us as more American than others; when we write off the whole system as inevitably corrupt, and blame the leaders we elect without examining our own role in electing them. And he urged Americans to insist on the principles of transparency and ethics in public service. The political style described here by Obama is the brand of right-wing nationalism on the march throughout Europe, but especially recognizable as Trumpism: It involves stoking fear against outsiders and minorities, and sweeping claims that the system is rigged, that enable actual (rather than imagined) corruption. Obama called upon the country to fight it. The most remarkable passage of the speech, one that could hardly have been imagined a year ago, came when the departing president called for a defense of the Constitution: This last sentence was especially chilling. Optimism about the course of America has long been a hallmark of Obamas worldview. He sees in American history a long, jagged path to a better world that makes its founding ideals progressively more real. He reiterated that belief again, saying, The long sweep of America has been defined by forward motion, a constant widening of our founding creed to embrace all, and not just some. Obama has warned before that progress is not assured or continuous, that two steps forward are often followed by a step back. The stark warning he offered in his farewell address went far beyond such cautions. He told his country that its cherished Constitution was useless, a scrap of paper, without a vigorous defense of its ideals. And as this wise and thoughtful leader left the stage, to be followed soon by an impulsive, bullying man-child, the implications of that warning seemed to linger. To watch Obama walk away into the darkness was an unnerving sight."}, {"date": "2017/01/11", "title": "Intel Chiefs Presented Trump With Claims That Russia Has Compromised Him", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/cia-presented-trump-with-claims-that-russia-compromised-him.html", "text": " During the Republican primaries, anti-Trump Republicans search for dirt brought them into contact with a former member of MI6, Britains secret intelligence service, CNN reported Tuesday. Currently the proprietor of a private intelligence firm, this man had spent much of the 1990s as a British spy in Russia. Drawing on that experience, the contacts hed gathered from it, and the funds of Never Trump conservative donors, this spook began drafting a memo on the moguls relationships with Russian businesses and political entities. After Trump secured the GOP nomination, donors aligned with Hillary Clinton paid the spy continue his work. That investment yielded 35 pages of memos (which have now been published by Buzzfeed) and two explosive allegations: 1. Russian operatives claim to be in possession of compromising personal and financial information about Americas president-elect. (The former information allegedly includes a videotape of Trump watching several Russian sex workers urinate on the bed the Obamas slept in at the Ritz Carlton in Moscow.) 2. There was a continuous exchange of information between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government throughout the 2016 campaign. Allegedly, the Russians had been cultivating Trump for five years; he supposedly fed them information about Russian oligarchs in return for information from moles in the DNC and Russian hackers. Trumps former campaign manager Paul Manafort, his ex-foreign policy adviser Carter Page, and his lawyer Michael Cohen are named as intermediaries. The Guardian reports that the FBI applied for a warrant from the FISA court to monitor four members of the Trump team suspected of making contacts with Russian officials. The court rejected the request, saying it was too broad, and its unclear if a warrant was ever granted. Cohen has already denied the report, calling it fake news and absolutely silly stuff that reads like a John Le Carre novel. Trump responded on Twitter: One week before the election, David Corn of Mother Jones published a story detailing the existence of these memos and their allegations. But many viewed a single, anonymous private spy as a less-than-credible source and the media quickly moved past the storys explosive claims. But the CIA did not. And CNN reports that Americas top intelligence agencies presented Trump with a two-page synopsis of the spys memos during his intelligence briefing on Russian hacking last week. According to the network, these memos have been circulating through the intelligence community since last summer. But more recently, U.S. intelligence agencies completed a review of the British spys work and his vast network of contacts, and found them credible enough to present his findings to the president-elect. None of these claims have been substantiated, and their contingency should be stressed: To believe them, one must not only trust an anonymous foreign spy who was paid to generate unflattering material about Donald Trump, but also believe the claims of Russian intelligence operatives, who may have an incentive to bluff. Nonetheless, the fact that Americas top intelligence agencies are taking these claims seriously  or, at the very least, want the president-elect to think they are taking them seriously  is big, bizarre news. Trumps strange reaction to the intelligence communitys consensus about Russian involvement in hacking the Democratic National Committee, which included a blanket disavowal of the CIA, and repeated praise of Vladimir Putin, may betray the truth of the secret memos claims. Or that odd behavior may explain why the CIA would leak dubious intelligence that discredits the president-elect. Either way, this is a pretty major plot twist, considering we still have ten more days till the end of the prologue. This post has been updated with new information."}, {"date": "2017/01/10", "title": "Franken Stumps Sessions on Trumps Crazy Voter-Fraud Tweet", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/franken-stumps-sessions-on-trumps-crazy-voter-fraud-tweet.html", "text": " The first day of confirmation hearings for Jeff Sessions in the Senate Judiciary Committee was for the most part blandly civil. Most Democratic questioning basically gave Sessions the opportunity to hedge on nutty things his favorite presidential candidate said during the campaign season, and/or to deny interest in or knowledge of controversial topics (e.g., the possibility of litigation aimed at overturning Roe v. Wade, which Sessions incredibly suggested hed never thought about). But Senator Al Franken pretty quickly drew blood by eliciting an admission from Sessions that he might have exaggerated his involvement in civil-rights cases while a U.S. Attorney (Franken was subsequently upbraided by Ted Cruz, in a rare and unconvincing appearance as a defender of moderation and bipartisanship!). And later on, the Minnesotan clearly threw Sessions off his game by asking about the president-elects famous tweet about losing the popular vote only because millions of illegal votes had been cast for his opponent. No, replied Sessions; Trump did not apprise his future attorney general of any evidence he had for so remarkable an assertion, which if true would become pretty much all Sessions would work on for a year or two. What made this an effective line of caustic questioning is that Franken was challenging Sessions, a big believer in the phantom menace of voter fraud, to put up or shut up: If Trump was alleging voter fraud on a scale unknown since the days of Boss Tweed, wasnt Sessions concerned about it? And if not, why not? Were still waiting for an answer to that one."}, {"date": "2017/01/10", "title": "Trumps Latest Obamacare Remarks Contain Layers of Madness", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trumps-latest-obamacare-remarks-contain-layers-of-madness.html", "text": " Like many Republicans, Donald Trumps position on health care is difficult to identify. Obamacare is a disaster is the lodestar of his public stance, but what to do about it, when, and whether the people who use it should be thrown off are questions he has never answered in a consistent way. In recent days, as Republican senators have begun to defect from the GOP leaderships plan to repeal the law without any replacement, some of them resorted to openly pleading with the president-elect to come out and say what he wants to happen. (If it is his view, it would be really good if he would consider tweeting it out very clearly, begged Senator Bob Corker.) In a new interview with the New York Times, Trump continued to say things that make no sense. Trump stated that the Senate must repeal Obamacare probably some time next week, and that the replace will be very quickly or simultaneously, very shortly thereafter. That is completely impossible. It takes months to design a comprehensive reform plan for one-seventh of the economy, even if you have a party committed to a shared vision. And Republicans arent remotely committed to a shared vision: Theyre promising wildly different things, from covering everybody (a promise they have no way to pay for) to a bare-bones dog-eat-dog free-market system where the poor and sick are mostly left on their own. The one explicable element of Trumps comments is his claim that Senate Democrats can be forced to vote for a Republican plan: This is a crazy position, but it is at least explicable. Here is what Trump is saying. Republicans can defund Obamacare with 50 Senate votes, but creating a new plan requires 60. This is why Republicans want two votes: a partisan vote to repeal, requiring only Republicans to pass, and then a bipartisan vote to replace it. Trump is saying that he believes he can pressure at least eight Democratic senators to join in supporting a Republican plan to replace Obamacare. But unless hes prepared to offer Democrats extremely generous terms, they have no incentive to go along with such a plan. The details of any health-care reform are inevitably unpopular, as they require disrupting the status quo. And the details of Republican plans are especially unpopular, since they entail forcing people into extremely stingy health-care plans with huge deductibles, and unaffordable costs for older or sicker people. (Republicans have finessed this problem by attacking Obamacare from the left, for having too-high deductibles and premiums and narrow networks, but their alternatives all go much farther in that direction.) Meanwhile, having (supposedly) voted already to repeal Obamacare, the clock will be ticking toward the meltdown of the individual insurance market. So costs will be exploding. Doctors, hospitals, and insurers will be nervous or apoplectic. And in this atmosphere Trump believes he can lay the blame on Democrats for refusing to sign on to some Republican plan that would raise lots of peoples premiums. That scenario would be fanciful even if Trump were an unusually popular president, when in fact he is already an historically unpopular one with an approval rating in the 30s. This strategy is basically nuts  Republicans will blow up the health-care system and bet that the public will blame things on the party thats out of power, which is completely at odds with how public opinion works. But that is the only path to actually replacing Obamacare with some kind of right-wing alternative that any Republican has managed to come up with. And its the plan Trump is going with. Today, anyway."}, {"date": "2017/01/10", "title": "Sessions Wont Commit to Letting You Smoke Pot Even Where Legal Under State Law", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/sessions-wont-commit-to-letting-you-smoke-pot-even-if-legal.html", "text": " A lot of the questions and answers during the first day of Jeff Sessionss Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing have involved efforts to characterize or recharacterize his past record, and to test whether he will operate independently from the erratic president-elect who appointed him. But one line of questioning with real news value did not come up until well into the afternoon: How will this zealous soldier in the War on Drugs deal with state laws legalizing marijuana? We still dont really know the answer, because Sessions endorsed two principles that are in conflict. In answer to a question from Senator Pat Leahy about the Obama administration Justice Departments decision to look the other way with respect to federal-pot-law enforcement in the legalizing states as a resource decision, Sessions said that decision made sense, but: A few minutes later, after Senator Mike Lee asked if a refusal to enforce laws against pot violate the constitutional principle of separation of powers, Sessions again agreed, and suggested that if Congress wanted to repeal the existing laws it should do so. I suppose that means Sessions believes he should go right ahead and prosecute people in the legalized pot states for violating federal law, but isnt sure it is worth the trouble. That is not terribly illuminating. Perhaps the initial questioning did not dwell on this issue because there is only one senator on the Judiciary Committee from a state that has legalized recreational marijuana use. That would be Diane Feinstein of California, and maybe she has plans to clear this up in later questioning of Sessions. For now, anyone hoping this hearing would clarify that it will be safe to abuse that pot drug in places where the state has decided to step aside would have to be disappointed. Nobody should want their personal freedom to depend on Jeff Sessionss idea of the best way to allocate prosecutorial resources."}, {"date": "2017/01/10", "title": "Kentucky Anti-Union Drive a Harbinger of What We Will See in Washington", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/kentucky-anti-union-drive-a-national-harbinger.html", "text": " Those who are looking ahead, with hope or with trepidation, to what a Republican Congress and administration will do, understandably focus on things in the news: how they will deal with Obamacare and immigration policy and tax policy and some of the, well, exotic opinions of the president-elect. But it is important to remember that there are less visible issues on which a conservative Republican trifecta could change America in significant ways. One of those is labor law. And as Justin Miller points out at The American Prospect, we are getting a rare glimpse at how this might play out in Kentucky, where a new Republican-dominated regime has just taken over state government with the GOPs conquest of the legislature in November. All three of those bills have already been enacted in the week since the current legislative session began, along with a much more publicized 20-week abortion ban. We could see a similar degree of anti-union determination in Washington, at least in actions that are not subject to a Senate filibuster: What has happened is that the old anti-union animus of conservatives has completely taken over the GOP, with no sense of restraint. That is actually a new thing. Worshipers of Ronald Reagan have probably forgotten that their heros designated 1976 running mate, Senator Richard Schweicker of Pennsylvania, earned a 100 percent rating from the AFL-CIO. That was unusual, but not unimaginable, as it would be today. The symbol of this new mood is Donald Trumps choice as secretary of Labor, Andrew Puzder, whose entire background is in fighting collective bargaining and a higher minimum wage in the fast-food industry. There is no pretense of objectivity here; Republicans are abandoning indirect attacks on unions and going for the kill."}, {"date": "2017/01/10", "title": "Jeff Sessions Makes the Case That He Is Not Too Racist to Be Attorney General", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/sessions-makes-the-case-that-he-is-not-too-racist-to-be-ag.html", "text": " The piece of political theater that is Jeff Sessionss confirmation hearing began with a pair of dissonant set pieces: At the back of the room, protestors dressed as Klansmen shouted their parodic approval of the Alabama senator; at the front, Trumps pick for attorney general held his half-Asian granddaughter in his lap. The images spoke to the central question looming over Sessionss bid to become Americas top law-enforcement officer: If a Republican Senate deemed the man too racist to serve as a federal judge in 1986, why would a Republican Senate deem him fit to be chief federal prosecutor in 2016? For Sessions and his defenders, the primary answer is that the Senate made a grievous error three decades ago, allowing the malicious fabrications of the far left to cloud their vision of the upstanding, egalitarian prosecutor seated directly in front of them. But now, after serving in the Senate for 20 years  and working on the very committee charged with confirming his nomination  there is no risk that the Senate will mistake their sweet, fair-minded colleague as a man with white robes in his closet, his backers contend. In their opening statements on his behalf, Judiciary Committee chair Chuck Grassley and Maine senator Susan Collins both testified to Sessionss good character, with Collins saying that in the decades she had spent serving in the upper chamber with the Alabama senator, I have never witnessed anything to suggest that Senator Sessions is anyone other than a dedicated public servant and a decent man. This emphasis on Sessionss lack of conspicuous racial animus was meant to discredit claims to the contrary, which surfaced during his 1986 hearing. Then, Sessionss Justice Department colleagues accused him of calling the NAACP un-American, referring to an African-American colleague as boy, and joking that he didnt have a problem with the Ku Klux Klan until I found out they smoked pot. Such overt expressions of racist (or, in the parlance of our times, racially charged) sentiments are more stigmatized in our society than the pursuit of policies that perpetuate racial disadvantage. Voting laws written with the intention of diminishing the political influence of black voters can be politely debated by reasonable people; the virtues of Americas most straight-laced Klansmen are not. But Sessionss record of supporting attacks on voting rights, draconian drug laws that disproportionately harm minority communities, the reinstitution of chain gangs, and hostility to the Obama administrations efforts to rein in police abuse are, together, both more unambiguous than his private comments to colleagues and, at least potentially, more relevant to how he would carry out the duties of the office of attorney general. In recognition of this fact, Sessions used his opening statement not only to condemn the damnably false allegations of his personal bigotry, but also reframed his record as a federal prosecutor and politician as one befitting an egalitarian anti-racist. Sessions championed his role in the prosecution of two Klansmen who murdered an African-American man  emphasizing his choice to seek the death penalty against one of the perpetrators  while also highlighting his support for the desegregation of Alabama schools, and role in dismantling discriminatory election laws in his states Black Belt. Sessionss critics contend that he has exaggerated his personal involvement in all these efforts, many of which were spearheaded by other attorneys within his office. Democratic Minnesota senator Al Franken took up this charge pointedly in the hearings most contentious exchange. Franken noted that in 2009, Sessions had claimed to have filed 20 or 30 civil rights cases to desegregate schools and other institutions. But in November 2016, the Alabama senators office claimed that he had filed merely a number of such cases. Franken demanded to know which it was  20 to 30, or some other number? The records dont show that there were 20 or 30 actually filed cases, Sessions conceded. Franken then turned his attention to a questionnaire Sessions had submitted to the committee, in which he was asked to list the ten most significant litigated matters he had personally handled in his career. Among those Sessions selected were four civil rights cases  three related to voting rights, one to school desegregation. But a group of former attorneys in the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division contested Sessionss involvement in those cases, in an op-ed published by the Washington Post last week. On Tuesday, Franken referenced that columns central claim: Now, you originally said you personally handled three of these cases, Franken reminded Sessions. Are they distorting your record here? Sessions answered in the affirmative. But the essence of his rebuttal was that attorneys general frequently claim personal credit for cases in which they did not have substantive involvement.I provided office space, I signed the complaints, Sessions said. And, as you may know, Senator Franken, when a lawyer signs a complaint, he is required to affirm that he believes in that complaint, and supports that complaint, and supports that legal action.So, thats your personal involvement  that your name was on it? Franken asked, in a tone that showed little deference to the concept of senatorial courtesy.Sessions did not affirm or deny Frankens summation. As to the most conspicuous blight on his record  his unsuccessful prosecution of African-American activists engaged with voter-registration efforts on dubious charges of voter fraud  Sessions explained in his opening remarks, The voter fraud case my office prosecuted was in response to pleas from African-American, incumbent elected officials, and thus, characterized the prosecution as a testament to his commitment to voting rights. Beyond his record on matters of racial justice, the extremity of Sessionss broader political views was a liability that he and his supporters proved eager to account for. On the issues of immigration, criminal justice, and military torture, among others, Sessions has taken positions to the right of many in his own (reactionary) party. The Alabama senator sought to diminish the relevance of these positions Tuesday by emphasizing the distinction between the role of legislator and that of a law enforcement officer. The Office of the Attorney General of the United States is not a political position, and anyone who holds it must have total fidelity to the laws and the Constitution of the United States, Sessions said in his opening remarks. Grassely hit an identical note at the hearings outset, saying,  I know our colleague Senator Sessions respects the legislative process and the prerogative of Congress to write the law. As he explained during the confirmation hearing we held for John Ashcrofts nomination to serve as Attorney General, The Attorney General is a law enforcer. There is a big difference between a politician and a Senator where we vote on policy and executing policy. Sessions referenced this conviction throughout the hearing, repeatedly declaring his commitment to honor the legality of abortion, despite his belief that Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided. But while Sessions is unlikely to nullify Supreme Court decisions, the suggestion that his ideology will have no bearing on his performance as Americas chief law enforcement officer is transparently false. The United States has a lot of laws; many laws are ambiguously worded; the Justice Department has limited funds. These three facts give the attorney general the power to effectively dictate criminal justice policy in many areas. When the Justice Department uses its discretionary power to relax immigration enforcement for children brought to America illegally, conservatives protest the politicization of the DOJ. But when the department uses its discretionary power to relax enforcement of civil rights laws protecting the urban poor against systemic discrimination by police, Republicans are more liable to appreciate the need to set enforcement priorities. But in either case, the priorities of any given attorney general have the power to radically change the lived reality of millions of Americans. Republican senator Orrin Hatch betrayed this fact, when he asked whether Sessions would commit to upping the enforcement of obscenity laws, in light of the public health crisis that is internet pornography. Democratic senator Mazie Hirono made the point explicit, asking Sessions how he would use his prosecutorial discretion on a variety of issues, including immigration enforcement and voting rights. On that latter subject, Hirono specifically asked whether Sessions would contest state-level voting laws that have a discriminatory impact on minorities, even if they were not enacted with a racist intent. For decades, federal courts have interpreted Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act as prohibiting regulations that disproportionately burden minority voters, no matter the legislative intent. But many conservatives maintain that superficially, racially neutral restrictions  like the voter ID laws proliferating across GOP-controlled states  are kosher, so long as they werent passed by legislators who refer to the NAACP as un-American, or something. Sessions told Hirono that he would challenge laws with discriminatory problems, but studiously avoided making any commitment to challenge ones with a discriminatory impact. There is every reason to suspect that Sessions would see fewer discriminatory problems with voting laws than his immediate predecessors at the Justice Department. After the Supreme Court freed nine southern states from having to seek federal approval before altering their voting laws in 2013, Sessions hailed the decision as good news, I think, for the South, since if you go to Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, people arent being denied the vote because of the color of their skin. The Obama administration recently challenged a North Carolina voter identification law that it regarded as racially discriminatory, and the measure was struck down by a federal appeals court. When Franken asked Sessions about that North Carolina law at Tuesdays hearing, the Alabama senator reiterated his belief that laws designed to deny ballot access to a class of citizens are illegal  again, putting the emphasis on intent, rather than impact. Another area in which Sessionss prosecutorial discretion will prove critical is federal enforcement of the prohibition of marijuana, which remains a Schedule 1 substance even as eight states have fully legalized the drug, and 28 have approved it for medical use. While Sessions is a deep believer in a states right to set its own voting laws, he has previously argued that the federal government has an overriding obligation to put people in cages for selling a substance less dangerous than alcohol. During Senate confirmation hearings for current attorney general Loretta Lynch, Sessions suggested that he viewed opposition to state-level legalization as a core responsibility of Americas top prosecutor. I hope that you will cease to be silent, because if the law-enforcement officers dont do this, I dont know who will, Sessions said. And in the past, attorneys general and other government officials have spoken out and I think kept bad decisions from being made. And during a Senate hearing on the federal response to state-level cannabis laws, Sessions called on the government to foster the knowledge that this drug is dangerous, you cannot play with it, it is not funny, its not something to laugh about  good people dont smoke marijuana. On Tuesday, Democratic senator Patrick Leahy asked whether Sessions would use our federal resources to investigate and prosecute sick people using marijuana in accordance with state law even though it might violate federal law? I wont commit to never enforcing federal law, Sessions replied, while saying that he respected some of the DOJs present guidelines for federal enforcement, but thought there were also valid criticisms of the Obama administrations handling of the issue. He did not specify which aspects of the current policy he would change. At times, Sessions attempted to reframe his more extreme ideological positions, rather than merely arguing for their irrelevance. In 2015, Sessions voted against a Senate resolution urging that prospective immigrants not be subjected to a religious test. He has also praised the Immigration Act of 1924, which banned Asians and Arabs from immigrating to the United States. On Tuesday, Sessions clarified that he did not support an outright ban on Muslim immigration, but merely hopes that we can keep people out of the country who wants to kill everybody because of their religion. Sessions critics are unlikely to be persuaded by the senators showing. But Sessionss Republican colleagues  which is to say, the only people whose opinions will matter at the end of the day  appeared impressed with his performance. (Democrats will not be able to filibuster Sessionss nomination.)Were about to get an answer to the age-old question: Can you be confirmed as attorney general of the United States over the objections of 1,400 law professors, South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham said, referencing a letter denouncing Sessions, signed by a group of legal scholars from every state in the union save Alaska. I dont know what the betting line in Vegas is, but I like your chances."}, {"date": "2017/01/10", "title": "Fort Lauderdale Shooter Planned to Come to NYC on New Years Eve: Report", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/fort-lauderdale-shooter-planned-trip-to-nyc-on-new-years.html", "text": " Esteban Santiago, the 26-year-old Iraq war veteran who killed five people when he opened fire Friday at the airport in Fort Lauderdale, at first planned to travel to New York City.

He will appoint a temporary replacement for Sessions in the Senate and then schedule a special election  perhaps in 2017, perhaps not until the regular election year of 2018  to complete Sessionss term, which runs through 2020. Bentley, as you may recall, has been under fire for over a year as the subject of a lurid sex-and-corruption scandal involving a former staffer and all sorts of allegations of misuse of office. Earlier this year, it looked like his fellow Republicans in the state legislature were going to move forward with an impeachment initiative after Bentley refused to take multiple hints that he resign. But then in early November legislators decided to hold back on impeachment after being advised that another fellow Republican, Attorney General Luther Strange, was conducting a criminal investigation of the governor. Then, Donald Trump won the presidential election, Jeff Sessions got the nod for attorney general, and Luther Strange let it be known that he would really like to become a U.S. senator. Separately, he seems to have told legislators he wasnt finding any compelling dirt on Bentley. In fact, absent any criminal proceedings, the state auditor has asked the appropriate legislators to resume impeachment proceedings against Bentley. Nobody at this point is alleging any sort of quid pro quo in the works, and Bentley could well appoint someone else to the Sessions seat. Several U.S. House members from Alabama would like a promotion, and Bentley and Strange have had some run-ins unrelated to the governors sex life. But the fact remains that Bentley could by sending Strange to Washington appoint an attorney general to his liking, and perhaps close off one line of attack on his position for good. As Philip Wegmann of the Washington Examiner notes: The U.S. Senate could avoid this potential stain on the honor of the Great State of Alabama by denying Sessions confirmation. Barring that, we could soon see another chapter in the unending saga of Robert Bentley."}, {"date": "2017/01/10", "title": "Indian Point, the Nuclear Plant About 30 Miles From NYC, Will Close in 2021", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/indian-point-nuclear-plant-will-close-in-2021.html", "text": " Indian Point Energy Center, the more than aging nuclear power plant in Westchester County thats just a short trip up the Hudson River from Americas most populous city, will fully close by 2021.

Entergy, the company that runs the plant, confirmed that it would shutter one reactor by April 2020, and the other by April 2021. The company cited the high costs of maintaining the facility as one of the primary reasons for shutting down. According to the New York Times, the plants two reactors generate about one-fourth of the electricity consumed in the city and in Westchester County. State officials said the timeline for Indian Points closure would give the area leeway to adjust and replace the energy source, and that any increase in electricity costs would be negligible. Officials also batted away concern over loss of jobs and tax revenue for Westchester. Entergy said it would make room at other facilities for workers. Indian Point  which went online in the 1970s  employs about 1,000 people.

Some of those presidents, like Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, left their office to a chosen successor who carried forward their vision. Lyndon Johnson saw his popularity dissipate in response to a failed war. Abraham Lincoln was murdered, and his successor, Andrew Johnson, was a pro-slavery southern Democrat who abhorred Lincolns vision. There is no precedent for a departing chief executive like Barack Obama. Having saved the economy from ruin, reshaped health care and environmental policy, and reformed the financial industry, he leaves office as the most popular politician in America, to be succeeded by a man who has mocked his work, not to mention the legitimacy of his citizenship, and has pledged to destroy it all. After conservatives spent the Obama years terrified hed sent their country spiraling into a socialist dystopia, and liberals spent it fretting he had done too little, they are mostly united in their belief that Donald Trump will erase the entire Obama project in the blink of an eye. On November 10, Charles Krauthammer gloated, Obamas legacy is toast; its gone. Many liberals quickly arrived at the same conclusion. What will outlast Trump? asked John Judis in The New Republic. We just threw everything out! But this assumption is too shallow and too confident. It reflects, in part, the conservative fallacy that Obama mostly relied on easily reversible executive orders and the liberal fallacy that he mostly floundered in the face of Republican obstruction. The truth is that Obama enacted careful, deep, and mostly popular solutions to a broad array of problems to which his opponents have no workable response. For all the horrors Trump may yet unleash, the specific changes Obama wrought may prove far more durable than either his gloating enemies or his despairing supporters believe. Some of these changes are being overlooked or misunderstood today, just as they were when they first were enacted. The 2009 stimulus, for instance, included a tax credit for workers at the bottom of the income scale, the primary purpose of which was to get more cash into the hands of people who could spend it quickly. It succeeded at this task, but it also served a long-term social objective of making the tax code more progressive. In 2015, Obama struck a deal with the Republican Congress to make those tax cuts permanent in return for making permanent a series of supposedly temporary business tax cuts that had been routinely extended for years. Also, in 2013, the administration allowed expiring Bush-era tax cuts on incomes over $450,000 to lapse, which triggered the return of higher Clinton-era tax rates. The combined effect of lower taxes on the middle class and the poor, higher taxes on the wealthy, and Obamacare provisions reduced post-tax incomes for the highest-earning one percent by more than 5 percent and increased incomes for the lowest-earning tenth of households by an average of 27 percent. With vanishingly little attention, Obama had moved the needle against income inequality. Ever since the Reagan administration, Republicans have spent every ounce of their political capital on shifting the tax burden off the rich and onto everybody else, and Trump is very likely to sign into law a big tax cut for the rich. But Republicans will have a harder time undoing Obamas tax cuts for struggling Americans, and the harder they work to reward the rich at the expense of the poor, the more they will scuff up Trumps self-styled image as the enemy of the elite. The energy they exert on erasing Obamas tax policy will come at substantial political cost. Obama had hoped his successor would accelerate the clean-energy revolution he began, a plan obviously foiled by the election of a president who has deemed climate science a Chinese-authored hoax and has pledged to eliminate all federal regulation of greenhouse-gas pollution. Unlike other extreme positions Trump has taken, most of which would inflict immediate harm on many Americans, his opposition to any policy to slow climate change stands a good chance of remaining in place because its effects will sink in long after he departs. Containing climate change ultimately requires not just continuing Obamas policies but expanding and deepening them, ultimately weaning the economy off carbon altogether. The most hopeful scenario, which had finally come into view at the end of Obamas term, was rendered moot by Trumps election. And the damage wrought will likely be irreversible: A glacier cannot easily be unmelted. This does not mean the task of sparing the planet from the worst effects of runaway global warming is hopeless, though  or that Trump can nullify what Obama accomplished. Trumps promise to bring back coal-mining jobs by eliminating regulations is a fantasy. Natural-gas power plants have replaced coal at a rapid clip in part because they are now dramatically less expensive. And thanks to $90 billion in investments from the stimulus, and incentives that were extended during the 2015 tax deal, green technology has grown dramatically more effective and affordable. Since Obama took office, wind-energy prices have fallen by 66 percent, utility-scale solar-energy prices by 75 percent, and electric-car-battery costs by 65 percent. In much of the country, zero-emission electricity is cost-competitive even with natural gas. Conservatives will not want to pay higher electricity bills just for the privilege of emitting more carbon dioxide. Nor will Obamas diplomatic achievements disappear. In 2014, he agreed to a sweeping bilateral climate pact with China, setting the stage for the breakthrough Paris climate agreement the following year. Trump has promised to withdraw from the agreement, but it is possible that even if he does, it will be too late for him to scuttle its progress. American states and cities  most notably California  have already begun efforts to reduce their emissions beyond what Washington has required. And since American power plants have already met their 2024 emissions-reduction targets under the Paris agreement, a case could be made to the world that America has upheld its end of the bargain and the agreement could remain in place. Many developing countries can now build a new solar plant at lower cost than one using fossil fuels. Trump may slow the pace of diplomatic and technological change that Obamas green-energy revolution began, and that slowing will have horrendous consequences, but he will not reverse it. And then theres Obamacare. In keeping with his partys animating impulses, Trump ran for president calling it a disaster. But many Republicans privately recognized the law was anything but. Even in the face of hysterical Republican resistance and outright sabotage, the law has reduced the ranks of the uninsured by 20 million and come in well under budget (the federal government by 2016 was spending less on health care than it was projected to spend before Obamacare passed). Insurers eager to sign up customers initially set prices too low, and when premiums rose sharply last year, Republicans triumphantly claimed the laws new exchanges were headed into a death spiral of rising prices and fleeing customers. But newer evidence has suggested otherwise, as rates have floated back to the levels originally projected by the Congressional Budget Office. In the fall, new customers flocked to sign up for the exchanges, bringing up enrollment. A financial analysis by S&P predicted that the premium increases were a onetime pricing correction and that 2017 will likely see continued improvement for insurers. This means that Republicans eager to tear up Obamas signature accomplishment will have to rip away coverage from millions of Americans who rely on the law for their medical care (and, not incidentally, penalize the doctors, hospitals, and insurers who make a living selling it to them). During the campaign, Trump promised to replace the law first with something terrific, which he frequently assured audiences would take care of every Americans medical needs at much less cost. It seemed obvious that the candidate lacked even a cursory understanding of how the law worked, what changes he would bring about, or how he could possibly fulfill his promise of fabulous medical care for all. Once elected, Trump told reporters he wanted to maintain the laws protections for patients with preexisting conditions. Possibly the incoming president failed to grasp that these safeguards required the other elements in the law in order to function. Perhaps he was misleading the public about his support. Either way, he did understand a simple political logic: It is easy for politicians to block new benefits, but difficult to strip away existing ones. The Republican plan to eliminate Obamacare has appeared to be: Vote to repeal the law; delay the actual repeal for a long time; and then, allegedly, create an Obamacare replacement. Repeal and delay sounds attractive in theory, but it presents Republicans with enormous political risks. If they pass a law with no replacement in hand, insurers and hospitals will face huge financial losses, and this will probably disrupt coverage for millions of their customers. The only way to prevent such a catastrophe will be to shore up the system until Congress devises a replacement. But patching up Obamacare will enrage conservatives who oppose bailouts for the insurance industry and will also demonstrate that Obamacare can work. Republicans, like Colonel Nicholson in The Bridge on the River Kwai, will have built the thing they had set out to destroy. Recently, a growing number of Republican, or Republican-friendly, voices have turned against the repeal-and-delay strategy. Even the president-elect has warned Republicans to be careful, lest they be blamed for the chaos that repealing the law would create. But they have no attractive option at hand. Obamacare can be defunded with 50 Republican Senate votes, but replacing it requires rewriting the insurance regulations in the law, which needs 60 Senate votes, or at least eight Democrats. Republicans could try to negotiate with Democrats on changes to the law that would make it more Republican-friendly  taxing rich people less, skimping on subsidies to the poor and sick, lowering premiums for the rich and healthy  that they could call an Obamacare replacement. If the changes were small enough, and they left most of the laws achievements in place, Democrats might accept them in return for a truce in the health-care wars. But theres no course of action for Republicans that avoids taking on high levels of political risk. They have made impossible promises on Obamacare and are quickly finding themselves stuck in a political quagmire. Many other elements of Obamas legacy will prove difficult or impossible to reverse permanently. The Trump administration will almost certainly refuse to enforce as intended the Dodd-Frank act, which dramatically curtailed risk in the financial system. But this is the standard approach by a Republican presidency toward regulations it dislikes but lacks the votes to overturn. Republican administrations inevitably refuse to enforce labor law, environmental regulations, workplace protections, and so on. Dodd-Frank will fall into the same category. And when a Democrat (or perhaps a moderate Republican in a chastened future party) returns to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the legacy of these reforms will be renewed without having to wait or hope for congressional approval. The actions Obama took to save the economy  fiscal stimulus, a bank restructuring, and an auto bailout  cannot be undone. And the almost completely unnoticed reforms to education unleashed by the Race to the Top grants tucked into the stimulus continue to drive innovation and better results in public schools. Obamas reactionary opponents wish to nullify his legacy not because it changed little but because it changed so much. Any large-scale reordering of power and resources in American life will inevitably face resistance, sometimes for decades. After Lincoln managed to ban slavery, southern states launched a violent terrorist counterattack, disenfranchising their African-American citizens, subjecting them to constant physical terror, and forcing them into exploitative labor arrangements almost tantamount to slavery. Conservatives never gave up their hatred for Franklin Roosevelts reforms, and the war against New Deal programs has never ended. (As recently as 2005, Republicans were trying to privatize Social Security.) Republicans continue to attack jewels of Lyndon Johnsons legacy, like Medicaid and the Voting Rights Act. Sweeping reforms create powerful enemies who do not disappear. As Obama warned in a 2014 speech at the LBJ Presidential Library, History travels not only forwards; history can travel backwards, history can travel sideways. Trump may very well destroy the underpinnings of a system of government put in place more than two and a quarter centuries ago, and if he does, it will be not only Obamas legacy that is repealed but the legacies of every president from Washington onward. But the future is not predetermined. It depends upon our actions and choices. Protecting, fulfilling, and, in some cases, restoring Obamas legacy will require mustering the political will to rally around it. If Obamas supporters defend the pillars of his legacy, rather than fatalistically accept their destruction, they stand a good chance of warding off the most frontal attacks. And where they fail, and Obamas achievements are repealed, then they can set out to repeal the repeal when the opportunity presents itself. And it will. Previous generations of Americans knew times when it seemed impossible to imagine slavery might be abolished, women given the right to vote, business subject to any government regulation. Progress tends to come in great dramatic bursts of action and then recede. Barack Obamas presidency represented one of those great bursts. His was a vision and incarnation of an American future. His enemies long to restore a past of rigid social hierarchy, with a threadbare state that yields to the economically powerful. He, not they, represents the values of the youngest Americans and the world they will one day inhabit.

According to the Washington Post, searches for Trump on abortion rose by more than 4,000 percent in the late afternoon of November 8. Perhaps these searchers were unclear on the position of the candidate who in his pre-political life had supported Planned Parenthood but during the campaign suggested that women should be punished for having illegal abortions and in the final debate talked about abortion providers who rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby. Or perhaps the frantic last-minute searching was a manifestation of collective anxiety about what would become an early flash point in the Trump administrationand a first test of whether much of the social progress of the past 40 years can be undone over the next four. Any wishful thinking that President-elect Donald Trump might have just been pandering to Evangelical voters with his anti-choice rhetoric during the campaign seems downright fanciful at this point. He has since surrounded himself withand appointed to power  ferocious opponents of both abortion rights and contraceptive access, starting with his vice-president, Mike Pence, who passed some of the nations most restrictive abortion laws as governor of Indiana and, in Congress, co-sponsored so-called personhood legislation that defines life as beginning at conception and would thus make several forms of birth control illegal. Tom Price, Trumps choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, has supported a nationwide ban on abortion after 20 weeks and is a proponent of so-called conscience clauses that would permit doctors and insurance companies to refuse to provide health-care services they dont personally believe in. Trumps attorney-general pick, Jeff Sessions, has voted to ban Health and Human Services grants to organizations that perform abortions and against a bill to reduce teen pregnancy through sex education and contraceptive access. Katy Talento, recently chosen by Trump as a health-care policy adviser, has written (falsely) that hormonal contraception causes miscarriage, cancer, and infertility, and called the idea of making birth control available over the counter tantamount to putting dangerous, carcinogenic chemicals in the candy aisle at CVS. In September, Trump himself wrote a letter to supporters promising that if elected, he would sign a nationwide ban on abortions after 20 weeks, defund Planned Parenthood, make permanent the Hyde Amendment  the legislative rider that prevents Americans from using federal insurance programs like Medicaid to pay for abortions  and nominate pro-life justices to the Supreme Court. With one Supreme Court seat maddeningly open and three sitting justices over the age of 78, this last promise could have a long-lasting impact: It would take only two appointments to get to a Court that would likely overturn Roe v. Wade. Its difficult for many on the left to even wrap their heads around this possibility, which is at such sharp odds with how the country regards the rights of women to control their own reproductive systems. Poll after poll confirms that the vast majority of Americans continue to support legal abortion. A Pew study released the first week in January showed support for Roe at a record high of 69 percent, while a Quinnipiac survey conducted after the election put the percentage of respondents who believe abortion should be available in all circumstances at more than double the number who think it should not be legal in any circumstance. When it comes to contraception, the numbers are even more firmly on the side of reproductive freedom: Gallup found last year that 89 percent of Americans believe that birth control is morally acceptable, a higher percentage than believe the same about divorce, premarital sex, or gambling. And Planned Parenthood, one of the countrys largest providers of womens health care, remains a pretty beloved organization; this summer, an NBC NewsWall Street Journal poll found its popularity to be 19 points higher than Donald Trumps and 20 points higher than the Republican Partys. Anti-choice Americans may be in the minority, but they have empowered the GOP in recent years, all but clearing it of moderates sympathetic to reproductive rights. For the past decade, congressional Republicans have concerned themselves with reducing womens health-care options through obsessive attempts to defund Planned Parenthood and repeal the Affordable Care Act, while state legislatures have created an avalanche of restrictions on abortion. That the right wings focus is not simply opposition to abortion but also reducing womens access to contraception gives away the game: Theirs is an effort to keep women from making decisions about when, if, and under what circumstances to have children, and thereby to keep them from exerting agency over their families, their work, their partnerships, their sex lives, and their bodies. That the restrictions on access most profoundly affect those with the fewest resources means that abortion is not just about womens equality; it is at the very heart of economic and racial inequality. Many women, especially young women, have long believed their reproductive rights were permanent, inalienable. Its not as though a single election could suddenly curtail the freedoms of more than half the population, right? For better or worse, this nation is an ocean liner; it can take decades for it to change course. Women and their extremely popular rights to reproductive autonomy could not be so easily cast aside  right? But the party that has devoted itself to the rollback of abortion and contraceptive access now controls not only the White House but also the House and Senate and a record 68 percent of state legislatures. There is no presidential firewall, no authoritative Democratic opposition. Its easy to forget that it wasnt so long ago that abortion was illegal; it wasnt so long ago that contraception was illegal. And women suffered for it. I didnt learn until I was reporting a story about abortion a couple of years ago that my grandmother, a social worker in Hells Kitchen in the 1930s, had had an abortion after getting pregnant during the Depression. My grandmother is long dead, but as my aunt explained it to me, shed been lucky: Her procedure had been safe, and shed gone on to have two children in the early 1940s. But my grandmothers friend Rosie, whod needed two abortions in the 1930s, was left infertile. My grandmother took her daughter and her friends to the Margaret Sanger Clinic in the 1950s to make sure they had diaphragms. When my aunt nonetheless became pregnant as a teen, my grandmother tried to help her get an abortion, but because she looked so young, no doctor would go near her. My aunt had the baby, my eldest cousin, but would go on to have several abortions, including one administered by Robert Spencer, the Pennsylvania doctor known for safely ending pregnancies in the years before it was legal, and another done by someone who literally used a knitting needle. As she told me in 2014, I am lucky to be telling you about it. This isnt ancient history; this was the lived reality of many of our mothers and certainly of our grandmothers. And it is entirely possible that it could become our future as well. The truth is, conservative activists and legislators have been chipping away at American womens access to reproductive health care for years, with more and greater restrictions in more and more states. We started to lose ground the moment we decided that Roe was the end point and not the beginning point, says Ilyse Hogue, the head of NARAL Pro-Choice America. There has been some progress. Last years Supreme Court decision in Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt landed a hefty counterpunch to state restrictions, holding that states cannot place baseless regulatory roadblocks between women and their health-care options. And Obamas Affordable Care Act acknowledged womens reproductive realities by ensuring that they would not pay more for their care, in part thanks to a revolutionary requirement that insurers cover contraceptives with no co-pay. Activists had hoped to build on that momentum going into a Clinton administration. (In a debate with Trump over late-term abortion, Hillary Clinton had given the most full-throated defense of reproductive rights ever offered by a presidential candidate.) Instead, we are about to enter a period of Republican control  of the White House, Congress, statehouses, governors mansions, and very possibly the Supreme Court  not seen since the 20s. Reproductive freedom in America could be wholly compromised, and it wouldnt even necessarily take overturning Roe. Heres how it could happen. As House Speaker Paul Ryan announced last week, one of the GOPs first legislative actions will be the defunding of Planned Parenthood. Its been a passion project for tea-partyers throughout the Obama administration, with one such measure making it as far as the presidents desk in January 2016. Some Republicans even threatened to shut down the government last year by vowing to block any spending bill that included Planned Parenthood in it. Until now, the right-wing zeal for disemboweling the organization, which operates 661 health centers around the country, has been stemmed by Democratic opposition or by President Obama. But those protections are gone. What defunding means, essentially, is legislating that Planned Parenthood can no longer accept federal insurance programs like Medicaid. The Hyde Amendment has ensured that those programs could not pay for abortions since it was attached to an appropriations bill in 1976. But if Congress voted to bar Planned Parenthood from accepting federal insurance for any services, it would mean that overnight, the 1.5 million American women  60 percent of Planned Parenthood patients  who rely on those programs for Pap smears, breast exams, STD testing, and, of course, contraception would no longer be able to get that care from Planned Parenthood. For many, that would mean not being able to get treatment at all; 54 percent of Planned Parenthoods clinics are in areas that do not have other nearby health-care options. Seventy-five percent of the organizations patients live at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty level. If you combine the defunding of Planned Parenthood with the dismantling of the Affordable Care Act, which saved women around $1.4 billion a year thanks to its mandated coverage of contraception, we are looking at a crisis in womens health care. It wouldnt even take undoing Obamacare entirely to reverse the contraception mandate, which is not written into the text of the ACA itself but is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. Which will soon be headed up by one Tom Price, who has publicly opposed the mandate and who claimed in 2012 that theres not one woman who cant afford to pay for her own birth control. The pre-mandate cost of oral contraceptives in fact ran from $15 to $50 a month, which is not an insignificant amount for large portions of the country. More effective contraceptive methods, including IUDs, cost hundreds of dollars more, leading many women to pick cheaper and less-effective options. Gila Leiter, associate clinical professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive science at Mount Sinai, says that since the ACA and state insurance programs began to cover the cost, my IUD rate has gone way up. This is obviously very helpful in terms of limiting abortions, but also in terms of safety and efficacy. If changes are made in what insurance programs must cover, fewer patients will opt for the more expensive IUDs and, in turn, residents will get less experience inserting them. Then, Leiter explains, residents who dont have practice or arent trained on IUDs arent going to want to present the option to their patients. It may sound like nothing, but actually its quite huge, from the perspective of maintaining a decreased rate of abortion, a reduction in unplanned pregnancies. Adam Jacobs, who heads up the family-planning division at Mount Sinai, fears that defunding Planned Parenthood alongside the reversal of the contraceptive mandate could put women  and clearly low-income women  in the situation of having to choose between food on their table and birth control. To force them to make a decision about whether to lay out $700 for an IUD? Its disgusting. But its what it comes down to: looking at your daily budget and children and having to make a decision. Low-income women are also vulnerable to attacks on Title X, the program passed in 1970 under Richard Nixon to ensure that low-income families would have access to comprehensive family-planning services. Through Title X, a network of nearly 4,000 community-based clinics provides counseling and contraceptive services, as well as pelvic and breast exams and STD testing and treatment. Republicans have repeatedly called for Title X cuts since taking control of the House in 2010. Title X is also part of the Department of Health and Human Services, which means that it, too, would be under the control of Price. Price was a co-sponsor of the Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act, which would have prohibited federal family-planning assistance to any entity that also provided abortion; it was an attempt to prevent grant money from going to Planned Parenthood, which currently receives a quarter of Title Xs funding. Price will select the administrator who heads up Title X. He could put someone who literally doesnt believe in birth control in charge of the program, notes Planned Parenthood spokesperson Erica Sackin. Price, a proponent of parental notification when it comes to abortion, could also get rid of Title Xs confidentiality guarantee, which assures minors that whatever care they receive will not be reported to their parents. Federal funds could be redirected, as has already happened in many states, to so-called crisis pregnancy centers, which cater to women with unplanned pregnancies but steer them away from abortion and future contraception use. The number of CPCs is growing at an astronomical rate, says Renee Bracey Sherman, a reproductive-justice advocate. During NARALs undercover investigation of Virginia CPCs, the organization found staff at these centers passing on misinformation, including claims that abortion causes breast cancer, infertility, and mental-health problems; that medical and surgical abortions are dangerous; that condoms dont work; that abortions cost more than carrying a pregnancy to term. Many of the centers that propagated these fictions receive government support. Thats less surprising when you consider that some states require doctors themselves to tell medically unsupported falsehoods about nonexistent links between abortion and breast cancer or abortion and suicide, or about fetuses being able to feel pain  to patients who want an abortion. Among the most common lies passed on at crisis pregnancy centers is that women have lots of time to decide whether to have an abortion. This is strategic: If CPC staffers drag out the decision-making process long enough, they bring unwillingly pregnant women up against the 20-week abortion bans proliferating in states across the country, most recently Ohio, where the legislature in December passed a so-called heartbeat bill, banning abortion at six weeks, before Republican governor John Kasich vetoed it and instead signed a 20-week ban, trying to give the impression that this was somehow more humane. Twenty weeks is the point at which anti-abortion activists now claim that a fetus can feel pain. Not coincidentally, it is also the point at which many fetal abnormalities are discovered through anatomy scans and testing. Twenty-week bans have been enacted in 16 states so far and blocked in two others. Like every other form of abortion restriction, these bans are hardest on the women with the fewest economic resources. Yamani Hernandez, director of the National Network of Abortion Funds, says, People who cant afford their procedures are especially punished, because its more likely that they havent had the health care they needed and dont know theyre pregnant as early, or because they dont have the funds or the logistical capabilities, or because they are unable to use their federal insurance programs to pay for an abortion and the process of saving money has drawn it out and made the gestational age higher. Pushed up against deadlines, the inequities for poor women only accumulate: They are forced to seek out the fewer and fewer providers willing to do later terminations, which in turn means longer distances to travel, scarcer transportation and child-care options, and more difficulty complying with other burdensome restrictions like waiting periods and parental-notification requirements. Many women, of course, cannot manage to jump through all the hoops and wind up having children they did not intend to have, incurring a whole other set of long-lasting consequences. The Turnaway study of 2012, which compared outcomes for women seeking later abortions, found that those who had managed to secure them were doing better in all respects than those who had been pushed over the limit and forced to give birth. The disadvantages heaped on poor women are why activists in the reproductive-justice movement view reproductive rights as a single thread in a tapestry of economic, racial, and social injustice. True reproductive freedom, they argue, is tied not only to abortion and contraceptive access but also to womens access to affordable housing, education, and employment; from criminal-justice reform to paid leave, subsidized child care, paid sick days, and higher wages, there are many policies that determine if low-income women have any actual choice about whether to have children. Poor women have always paid the punishing price exacted by legislators who might wish to restrict all womens autonomy but can only exert their force on the most defenseless. As Henry Hyde said himself in 1977, I certainly would like to prevent  anybody from having an abortion: a rich woman, a middle-class woman, or a poor woman. Unfortunately, the only vehicle available is the  Medicaid bill. Some look with hope toward the increased availability of medical abortion, via mifepristone and misoprostol pills, which in some cases can be ordered by mail, as the solution to shrinking surgical options. But the medical community is anxious about relying on continued access to the pills. One thing I am very worried about is the availability of medical abortion, says Leiter. There have already been all sorts of questions of whether only physicians can prescribe, or only physicians who have sonogram capabilities. Thirty-seven states unnecessarily require licensed physicians, as opposed to midlevel clinicians and health practitioners, to prescribe medical abortion drugs, and 19 require  for no good reason  that the clinician be physically present for administration of the medication, thereby limiting patients abilities to access this safe and effective termination option remotely. If all other options fail, some women will take matters into their own hands. I think youre going to see more DIY abortions, says Peg Johnston, a manager of an abortion practice in upstate New York. And whether theyre punished or not is going to be an interesting question. The idea of criminally charging and imprisoning women who attempt illegal abortions used to be unheard of in anti-abortion rhetoric  it was all about punishing the doctors and protecting the women. But in December, a poll was released showing that 39 percent of Trumps supporters thought women seeking abortions should be subject to punishment. In 2011, Bei Bei Shuai, a Chinese immigrant to Indiana, was charged with attempted feticide after her suicide attempt while pregnant; another Indiana woman, Purvi Patel, was sentenced to 20 years for feticide after having procured a mail-order abortifacient and leaving the fetus she aborted in a garbage bin; her sentence has since been overturned and she was released from prison in 2016 after having served 18 months. Tennessees Anna Yocca, who attempted an abortion with a coat hanger while 24 weeks pregnant in 2015, was initially charged with attempted murder, though eventually that charge was reduced and she was charged with criminal abortion. There have been too many other infringements on reproductive rights to even enumerate here  from the banal TRAP (targeted regulation of abortion providers) law requirements that clinic hallways be a certain width to gruesome attempts, in Indiana under Mike Pence and more recently in Texas, to mandate the burial or cremation of fetal tissue resulting not just from abortions but also from miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies. The idea that women should be forced to have transvaginal ultrasounds was embraced not just by disgraced Virginia governor Bob McDonnell but by politicians still in power, including Wisconsin governor Scott Walker. In three states, doctors are required to provide a verbal, detailed description of fetal anatomy to women seeking abortion. And anti-abortion activists are pushing for ever more Orwellian measures, suggesting that states keep databases of women whove had abortions. All of this makes the big-ticket dream of anti-abortion activists  the possibility of fully overturning Roe  almost unnecessary and, by many standards, perhaps strategically unwise. (As long as Americans believe their reproductive rights are protected by Roe, they will be less likely to notice that those rights are being eroded past the point of recognition.) And yet any conversation about the not-so-distant future must address the question: Will Roe survive? Trumps first, and imminent, Supreme Court pick wont shift the balance, but it is actuarially unlikely Justices Ginsburg, Kennedy, and Breyer  all of whom support Roe  will all survive Trumps administration. Some have comforted themselves by pointing out that overturning Roe would simply mean a reversion of abortion decisions back to the states, where some would permit full abortion access and others would wholly prohibit it and most would fall between the two extremes. But its not clear how protected even staunch pro-choice states like New York and California would be in a post-Roe future in which there is no judicial barrier to Congress enacting national TRAP laws or a federal 20-week ban. Its also worth remembering just how bad things were in those patchwork days before Roe. All I can say is that if you fall into the temptation to argue that it will be all right if it goes back to the states, says Faye Wattleton, who was president of Planned Parenthood from 1978 to 1992, I guess you dont remember what a horror show New York was during the few years before Roe when abortion was legal here. Wattleton was working for Planned Parenthood in Dayton, Ohio, in 1970, the year abortion was legalized in New York, three years before Roe made it legal across the country. Women who had needed abortions would come back from New York with horror stories. Because every Tom, Dick, and Harry exploited the situation. Enormous amounts of money were made. Women came back injured, infected. It was not a pretty picture. Wattleton sees parallels between the early 80s and today when it comes to divisions over reproductive freedom. When she took over in 1978, Planned Parenthood served around a million women and enjoyed strong bipartisan support. Over the previous decade, the Supreme Court had made contraception legal first for married people, then for singles, then had legalized abortion. But the country was also seeing the rise of a newly cohering religious right that stood in furious, explosive opposition to womens increasing liberty. Our clinics were under tremendous threat. Just before I became president, the Minnesota affiliate had burned to the ground. It was one of the first of a series of bombings and arsons of abortion clinics in the late 1970s. There were organized efforts to engage in guerrilla training camps, to organize people to commit terrorist attacks against Planned Parenthood and abortion providers, Wattleton recalls. Ronald Reagan rode the fundamentalist surge to the White House in 1980. When Reagan was elected, Wattleton says, one of the first announcements that the administration made after the inauguration was that it intended to defund the left. And Planned Parenthood is the first organization they were determined to defund. In the early 80s, there was an effort to launch a constitutional amendment to overturn Roe; when that didnt take off, reproductive-rights opponents turned their energies to the more incremental slog, the slow erosion of Roe, says Wattleton, the hundred-year war, as they put it. Today, we are again seeing a rise in anti-abortion violence, with the 2009 murder of the abortion provider George Tiller and Robert Lewis Dears 2015 attack on a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood clinic in which three people were killed. In the weeks after the 2016 election, threats to abortion clinics spiked, with protesters throwing rocks through the windows of a Kentucky clinic. Reproductive-rights opponents have notched a startling number of wins in that hundred-year war, and Roe still hangs in the balance. When I ask what the game plan should be now, Wattleton laughs a little grimly. Honey, I dont know what to tell you. It would be lovely to say weve got some fancy new bullet to hit this with. But really it is just hard, backbreaking political work. You have to gird your loins for the battles ahead, because that is what they are going to be: battles. But look, we defeated [Reagans 1987 anti-abortion Supreme Court nominee] Robert Bork. Supreme Court nominations can be defeated. Frankly, I am baffled by people who say, What are we going to do? What are we going to do? Were going to fight. The fight has many fronts, and all of them are fraught. On the legislative side, Congress is stacked against the Democrats for at least two years and possibly for much longer. Still, at the end of December, 105 Democratic members of the House, led by Californias Barbara Lee, who in 2015 championed the EACH Woman Act in opposition to the Hyde Amendment, sent a letter to the president-elect reaffirming their commitment to abolishing the policy, which so negatively affects low-income women and women of color. Constituents can bring powerful pressure to bear: Just five years ago, when the immensely popular Susan G. Komen breast-cancer-research foundation announced it was cutting ties to Planned Parenthood, the negative reaction was swift and intense  1.3 million tweets; $3 million donated to Planned Parenthood; calls to politicians who in turn sent their own protest letters; women who pledged to drop out of Komen-sponsored events. Komen promptly reversed its decision. With that in mind, Planned Parenthood just issued a press release announcing more than 300 marches and rallies that will take place throughout the spring, across 47 states and in 150 cities. The future of the Supreme Court might be shaky, but several organizations intend to pursue legal challenges to abortion restrictions given the strong precedent recently affirmed by the Whole Womans Health decision and a federal court system that, for now, is still friendly to abortion rights. In the weeks after Trumps election, the Center for Reproductive Rights, along with Planned Parenthood and the ACLU, filed simultaneous lawsuits challenging abortion restrictions in Alaska and in North Carolina, where they are challenging a 20-week ban. Planned Parenthood and the ACLU are also challenging a set of restrictions that has left Missouri with only one licensed abortion provider. And the CRR is fighting the Texas fetal-funeral requirement. Were going to be looking at every single thing theyre doing and looking to use every legal avenue we have to stop them from setting us back on womens health, says Nancy Northup, head of the CRR. But there are more subversive ways of thwarting abortion restrictions at the state, local, and even physician levels. Seventeen states currently circumvent Hyde by using their own funds to cover medically necessary abortions for Medicaid patients. In Texas, after the state cut its funds to Planned Parenthood, the City of Austin said it would chip in with funding. When it comes to access to contraception and abortion, the possibility of safe-haven states as well as cities might be absolutely crucial, says Amanda Lerman, an adolescent-health physician in Philadelphia. And doctors themselves could play a more strategic role both in making the case for protected  and expanded  reproductive rights and by shifting their training practices to better get around funding cuts and restrictions. One of Lermans ideas, for instance, is that the medical community can bring sexual-health approaches into primary-care settings. If more primary-care physicians and nurse practitioners were trained to insert IUDs or administer injectable long-lasting contraception, for instance, they might better fill in the gaps left by defunding efforts. In other words, patients who could no longer use their insurance at Title X clinics might be able to receive necessary care from general practitioners, still permitted to accept Medicaid. I think youre finding physicians realizing that if they dont get themselves engaged, there is no stopping this, says Adam Jacobs at Mount Sinai. But many of these are small fixes, Band-Aids on a serious wound. Inarguably, were still playing checkers while theyre playing chess, says NARALs Ilyse Hogue. And thats not because theyre smarter than us or more sophisticated; in fact almost exactly the opposite. Were still focused on policy and data and how many women will be restricted and how to get enough money to get women to safe states. And thats all really important. But Im looking at a poll today that says that 40 percent of Trump supporters think that women should be punished. Were still operating in the world of the intellect, and theyre going for the visceral. And were living in visceral times. It may be that the biggest opportunity for the reproductive-freedom movement at this critical point in history is a change not in strategy but in mind-set, in the very tenor of the conversation. The first march I ever attended in Washington was a pro-choice rally in 1989 that drew half a million people. I was 13 years old, and I didnt understand why the protesters wore pins and carried signs with pictures of coat hangers on them. Thats when I was told, by women for whom illegal abortion was just 16 years in their past, about how women, desperate to end pregnancies in days when it was not legal, untwisted coat hangers, inserted them into their vaginas, into their cervixes, cutting themselves, causing bleeding, infections, and often infertility. Fifteen years later, at the 2004 March for Womens Lives, I watched Whoopi Goldberg take the stage, gripping a coat hanger and yelling accusatorily: You understand me, women under 30? This is what we used! At the time I thought this was unfair: The whole point was that young women shouldnt have to know about coat hangers. The not-knowing was its own victory. But in 2015, Anna Yocca tried to self-abort by using a coat hanger in Tennessee. Our past is reaching into the present. Renee Bracey Sherman, the reproductive-justice advocate, says that when she speaks to multigenerational crowds, she often hears from older feminists who say, Kids these days dont know how hard it was to get an abortion; they dont know we had to smuggle people and they dont know about coat hangers or how my cousin died or my best friend died. She often asks these women if they have grandchildren; many do. How many times have you told your daughter or your grandkids your story? she asks them. Thats how young people dont know. We dont talk about it. Its hard because it was such a scary time, and it hurts to talk about it, to say, Yeah, thats how so-and-so died or, I had to get on this bus and someone blindfolded me and took me to this farm. We dont like to tell these stories. But thats where the conversation got lost, because people thought, Oh, its legal, we dont have to tell these stories. But the telling of abortion stories serves a purpose. The pre-Roe horrors remind us whats at stake for women should they lose their ability to determine their own reproductive lives. Many of us have forgotten, or perhaps never seen, the graphic photograph of Geraldine Santoro, a 28-year-old woman who bled to death after an illegal abortion in a motel room in 1964. Santoros fate was not unique; around 200 women a year died as the result of illegal abortions in the mid-1960s. Telling any abortion story  legal, illegal, surgical, medical  serves to normalize the procedure as the very common part of life that it is. Thirty percent of all women are going to have an abortion in their lifetime, most of them already mothers, says Peg Johnston, the abortion-clinic administrator in upstate New York. This is a normal reproductive experience. And we shouldnt forget the part of the story that comes after the abortion or the successful use of contraception  the high-school or college or graduate-school studies that were continued; the household budget that was kept, barely, intact; the existing children who were better off; the bad marriage that was avoided. Abortion and birth control are part of the fabric of American life, says Katha Pollitt, the author of 2014s Pro: Reclaiming Abortion Rights. Theyre the reason you can have later marriage, and why women can have a sex life and also go to college and graduate school and have professions; theyre how there can be the small families that most people want and most people can afford. Its why marriage is better! You dont have to marry some guy who got you pregnant. Thats all part of a package that people like. And the more that connection is made in the collective understanding, the harder it will be to unwind, even in an administration that is set on curtailing reproductive rights. As Pollitt points out, Even if people dont like abortion, they like the things that it brings them. *This article appears in the January 9, 2017, issue of New York Magazine."}, {"date": "2017/01/10", "title": "Chaffetz Continues Clinton Email Probe, Hasnt Mulled Trump Business Conflicts", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/chaffetz-continues-clinton-email-probe-hasnt-mulled-trump.html", "text": " Months after Election Day, theres at least one member of Congress who isnt sick and tired of hearing about Hillary Clintons damn emails. On Monday, Representative Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight committee, vowed to keep investigating Hillary Clintons private email server, though she did not win the election. This was never a political targeting from the beginning. Just because theres a political election doesnt mean it goes away. So of course Im going to continue to pursue that, Chaffetz told reporters, according to BuzzFeed. He described her email setup as potentially one of the largest breaches of security in the history of the State Department, and said completing the House investigation will remain a priority  though, Ive got a lot of top priorities. It seems investigating the person who actually won the election isnt currently one of them. Chaffetz did say that his job will remain the same in the Trump administration, and noted that he doesnt answer to anybody in Washington, D.C. He continued, My job in this role is not to protect or be a cheerleader for the president. Its just not. Im not here to defend him at every turn. But it seems Chaffetz hasnt devoted time to considering the issues that have already arisen for the president-elect. He still considers the calls from Democratic lawmakers and his hometown paper to open a probe into Trumps conflicts of interest silly, and while he said he plans to meet with incoming White House Counsel Don McGahn, he noted that there isnt much he can do. My concern is that there is compliance with the law. I will tell you the president is exempt from a lot of these. I didnt write these laws but thats the reality of it, Chaffetz said, adding, Maybe some of that should be tightened up but its not something I dove into. When asked whether Trump appointing his son-in-law Jared Kushner to be senior adviser to the president would violate laws banning nepotism in the White House  an issue that was first widely discussed in November  Chaffetz said, I have not looked at that at all. I cant say one direction or another without looking at it. Chaffetz has to stay focused. If he starts thinking about all the conflict-of-interest issues surrounding the Trump administration, we might never get an answer on Clintons emails (aside from the one we got from the FBI)."}, {"date": "2017/01/10", "title": "Hearing Delayed for Trump Pick Betsy DeVos, Whose Ethics Report Is Not Finished", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/hearing-delayed-for-trump-education-pick-betsy-devos.html", "text": " Those concerned that Republican senators are rushing through Trumps Cabinet appointments, though some nominees havent been thoroughly vetted, scored a small victory on Monday night. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions has postponed its confirmation hearing for Betsy DeVos, Donald Trumps pick for Education secretary. DeVos, a billionaire whos spent millions on promoting charter schools and school vouchers in Michigan, was originally set to have her hearing on Wednesday, along with four other Cabinet nominees. Now her hearing has been rescheduled for January 17 at 5 p.m. Ethics reports for four of the nominees set to face hearings this week, including DeVos, had yet to be made public as of Monday night. Several days ago the Office of Government Ethics complained that they were being rushed through the process  though with so many billionaires in Trumps cabinet, this years vetting is unusually complex. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell dismissed calls for more time to properly examine the nominees potential conflicts of interest, prompting Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to point out that McConnell called for a thorough vetting of all nominees eight years ago. The committees statement on the scheduling change for DeVos said nothing about her incomplete ethics report. Betsy DeVos is an outstanding nominee who has complied with all of the committees requirements and no one doubts that she will be confirmed as Education Secretary, an aide to committee chairman Lamar Alexander told the Washington Post. This hearing delay is simply to accommodate the Senate schedule. An aide to Patty Murray, the committees ranking Democrat, said she hopes this delay will give DeVos time to complete the required paperwork just as every single one of President Obamas nominees did and as Leader McConnell demanded eight years ago. The first confirmation hearing is set to begin on Tuesday, for attorney general Jeff Sessions. His ethics report is complete, but a review by independent ethics experts found on Monday that the senator failed to disclose that he owns oil interests on land in Alabama. He only earns about $4,700 a year from the small holding, but Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal told the Post that the omission is particularly troubling because this ownership interest involves oil and gas holdings connected to a federal wildlife refuge. An attorney assisting Sessions with the confirmation process said hed discussed the matter privately with Justice Department ethics officials and they did not raise any concerns. He said theyll investigate the matter and the paperwork will be amended if necessary. Regardless, the omission illustrates a point made by Norm Eisen, who served as an ethics lawyer in the Obama administration: Even if the ethics reports are completed just before all of this weeks hearings, it may be too late. The whole point of ventilating this stuff is to enable the American people and senators to ask questions of the nominee about how you are going to address conflicts, Eisen said."}, {"date": "2017/01/10", "title": "Cory Booker to Testify Against Fellow Senator Jeff Sessions for Attorney General", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/booker-to-testify-against-fellow-senator-sessions-for-ag.html", "text": " Several high-profile figures have already come out against Senator Jeff Sessionss nomination for attorney general, and last week the national president of the NAACP was arrested while protesting Donald Trumps nomination of the Alabama senator. Now, in an unprecedented move, one of Sessionss Senate colleagues is testifying against him at his confirmation hearing. Three members of the Congressional Black Caucus have been added to the list of people testifying at Sessionss hearing, including Senator Cory Booker. I do not take lightly the decision to testify against a Senate colleague, Booker said in a statement. But the immense powers of the attorney general combined with the deeply troubling views of this nominee is a call to conscience. The New Jersey senators office said the Senate historian could not find any previous instance of a senator testifying against a colleague nominated for a Cabinet position. California Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, told Politico that the three lawmakers  Booker, Representative John Lewis, a civil rights icon, and Representative Cedric Richmond, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus  asked her to let them speak at the hearing on Sessions, which is scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday. She went to chairman Chuck Grassley, who agreed to let them testify, but only if they appear after outside witnesses testify. Democrats are miffed, since members of Congress are usually allowed to testify before non-members; they believe Republicans are trying to bury the high-profile opposition to Sessions. Asking three members of Congress to sit and wait until the end of the hearing to testify  likely at the same time the Senate will be holding important budget votes  is deeply unfair, Feinstein said. These members offer a very important perspective and they deserve to be heard. However, Grassley spokeswoman Beth Levine said letting the lawmakers speak first was unacceptable. A members-only panel that could have preceded even Senator Sessions, simply to satisfy an ideological perspective, was unacceptable to Senator Grassley, Levine said. Instead, a third panel, with both supporters and opponents, has been added to the hearing following the panel of citizens on Wednesday afternoon. There is a long list of reasons why Democrats do not want Sessions to helm the Justice Department  from his resistance to expanding LGBT rights to his opposition to medical marijuana  and senators say they plan to raise a broad range of topics at the hearing. But the biggest issue facing the senator is accusations of racism. The Senate denied Sessions a federal judgeship in 1986 after former colleagues claimed he made racist remarks while serving as U.S. attorney in Alabama. Opponents also point to his criticism of the Voting Rights Act, and his decision to pursue voter-fraud charges against activists registering black voters in 1985. Weve seen Jeff Sessions  thats Senator Jeff Sessions  consistently voting against or speaking out against key ideals of the Voting Rights Act, taking measures to try to block criminal justice reform, Booker said Monday night on MSNBC. He has a posture and a positioning that I think represent a real danger to our country. Anticipating the criticism of Sessionss history on race, Republicans lined up some well-known defenders. Senator Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate, said on Monday evening that after talking with Sessions and researching his record, hes endorsing him for attorney general. CNN reported that former secretary of State Condoleezza Rice sent a letter to Grassley backing Sessions, calling him a man who is committed to justice and knows that law and order are necessary to guarantee freedom and liberty."}, {"date": "2017/01/10", "title": "Trump National-Security Pick Monica Crowley Plagiarized Ph.D. Dissertation Too", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-pick-monica-crowley-plagiarized-ph-d-dissertation-too.html", "text": " Over the weekend, the Trump transition team essentially shrugged in response to CNNs report that Monica Crowley, Trumps pick for senior communications director of the National Security Council, plagiarized many sections of her book What the (Bleep) Just Happened?

Any attempt to discredit Monica is nothing more than a politically motivated attack that seeks to distract from the real issues facing this country, the transition responded. The problem, as the Washington Post notes, is that whether or not Crowley is a plagiarist is a factual question, not a partisan one. And now theres more evidence to back up CNNs assertion, if the 50 examples from her book werent convincing enough. Politico combed through Crowleys PhD dissertation, titled Clearer Than Truth: Determining and Preserving Grand Strategy: The Evolution of American Policy Toward the Peoples Republic of China Under Truman and Nixon, which she submitted in 2000 while pursuing her PhD in international relations at Columbia University. They found more than a dozen sections of text that were copied from scholarly works without proper attribution. Side-by-side comparisons show Crowley lifted sentences, with a few words switched, from John Lewis Gaddiss book Strategies of Containment: A Critical Appraisal of American National Security Policy During the Cold War and Thomas Christensens book Useful Adversaries: Grand Strategy, Domestic Mobilization, and Sino-American Conflict, 19471958, as well as other books and articles on foreign policy. In some instances, she cited the author in the text, but did not use quotation marks; in others, there is no attribution. The transition team has not responded to Politicos requests for comment. Its hard to imagine the Trump team being riled by the new findings, especially after the future First Lady had her own plagiarism scandal. But Columbia might care. As Politico notes, the university has rescinded at least one Ph.D. for plagiarism. The university has yet to comment on the matter."}, {"date": "2017/01/10", "title": "Obamacare Repeal Might Have Just Died Tonight", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/obamacare-repeal-might-have-just-died-tonight.html", "text": " The Republican plan to repeal Obamacare and delay the implementation of the repeal  with a promise to come up with a terrific replacement later  is probably the partys best way to destroy Obamacare. Unfortunately for Republicans, its also the best way to destroy the Republican majority in Congress.Something big is happening in the Senate right now: The Republican plan, affirmed again today by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, is facing dire peril from Republican defections. Republicans need a House majority, 50 Senate votes, and soon-to-be President Trump to pass repeal and delay. If Republicans lose three Senate votes, that drops them to 49, and repeal and delay cannot pass. At least three Republican senators (in addition to all the Democrats) now oppose repeal and delay. Rand Paul, of all people, has demanded that Congress repeal Obamacare at the same time it passes a plan to replace it. Paul has announced that he spoke with Trump and secured his agreement on this. Trump has not said so himself, confining his comments to date to a vague assurance, Thats all gonna work out. Trump, of course, tends to change his mind frequently and agree with whomever he spoke with last. But other Republicans senators are taking the initiative. Fellow Republican Lamar Alexander says the same thing as Paul: We have to take each part of it and consider what it would take to create a new and better alternative and then begin to create that alternative and once its available to the American people, then we can finally repeal Obamacare. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas said on MSNBC, It would not be the right path for us to repeal Obamacare without laying out a path forward. And Senator Bob Corker is walking right up to the edge of the same position, asking Trump to tweet out confirmation of what Paul claims he promised. If it is his view, it would be really good if he would consider tweeting it out very clearly. Theres more and more concerns about not doing it simultaneously, Corker says. Even more ominously for the Republican leadership, four other Republicans have joined Corker to sponsor a bill delaying the bill that would repeal Obamacare for a month: Portman, Collins, Cassidy, and Murkowski have not joined the other three in formally opposing any bill that repeals Obamacare without a replacement. But their willingness to buck their party leadership and try to delay a vote that McConnell hopes to rush through as quickly as possible indicates severe reservations about repeal and delay. Meanwhile, numerous Republican governors  who dont have a vote on it but can nonetheless exert pressure  are lobbying Washington Republicans to protect the parts of the law that their states rely on. The stated goal of the dissenters is mild: They merely want to take a little more time to clarify what comes next. You would think after six years we would have a pretty good sense of what we would like to do, explains Corker. Of course, they dont have a good sense of what to do. They have some vague concepts without agreement. And any Republican plan, when fleshed out, turns out to be extremely risky. Conservatives hate Obamacare because it redistributes too much money from the rich and healthy to the poor and sick. But they dont publicly attack the law on that basis. Instead they attack it for high premiums, high deductibles, and narrow choice of doctors and hospitals  all flaws that any Republican plan would have in much higher doses. Republicans have yet to unify around a single, concrete, scorable plan because it is conceptually impossible to design a health-care plan that meets conservative ideological goals and is also acceptable to the broader public. In other words, the dissenters pretend they just want to give the GOP a little more time to design its plan. But more time isnt going to help. Theres never going to be a Republican plan. Republican leaders like McConnell promise the replacement will come soon thereafter, but people in the insurance and medical industry arent idiots. They know later means never. Senate mechanics also explain why its so significant to demand that Obamacare be replaced at the same time its repealed. Republicans can use a budget reconciliation bill to defund Obamacare. A reconciliation bill can evade a filibuster and pass with just 50 senators. But that bill cant create a new system, because reconciliation bills can only be used to change taxes and spending. The insurance regulations  requiring insurers to cover essential benefits, not discriminate against people with preexisting conditions, and so on  arent taxes and spending. They can only be altered with a regular bill, subject to a filibuster. That means if Republicans want to actually put a new system into place, and not just turn the health-care market into a smoking crater, they need at least eight Senate Democrats to join them. What that means is that replacing Obamacare at the same time its repealed would create completely different parameters for what happens next. There arent going to be eight Democrats willing to support a right-wing bill that throws people into catastrophic coverage plans that dont cover basic medical care, as conservatives would like. It would be a coalition to patch up Obamacare with incremental changes. Maybe Republicans would call it repeal of Obamacare and replacement with something thats about 90 percent similar, but that would be symbolic. A bipartisan law would advance Obamacares goals rather than destroy them. Thats why repeal and delay was the best chance to destroy Obamacare. The gamble was that, by blowing up the health-care system on a fuse, Republicans could pressure Senate Democrats into going along with a Republican-friendly replacement. The details might be unpopular, but coerced Democratic support might give it cover. But this plan only works if 50 Senate Republicans are willing to gamble that they can hold the one-seventh of the economy consumed by health care hostage and force a bunch of Democrats to go along. If that gamble fails, the ruin could easily trigger a backlash against the majority party. Apparently not enough Senate Republicans are willing to roll the dice. If this holds, Obamacare, or something substantially similar, is probably going to survive."}, {"date": "2017/01/09", "title": "Chuck Schumer Recycles Mitch McConnells 2009 Demands on Cabinet Nominations", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/schumer-recycles-mcconnells-2009-demands-on-nominees.html", "text": " Senate Republicans have scheduled nine confirmation hearings for this week, with five penciled in for Wednesday alone  the same day that Donald Trump will hold his first press conference since last summer. The decision to front-load the confirmation process has raised the hackles of the (nonpartisan) Office of Government Ethics, which made its frustrations known in a letter to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer over the weekend. The announced hearing schedule for several nominees who have not completed the ethics review process is of great concern, wrote OGE director Walter Shaub. It has left some of the nominees with potentially unknown or unresolved ethics issues shortly before their scheduled hearings  I am not aware of any occasion in the four decades since OGE was established when the Senate held a confirmation hearing before the nominee had completed the ethics review process. In truth, the Senate did hold confirmation hearings for Roderick Paige and Elaine Chao (who is now Trumps pick for Transportation Secretary) in 2001 before the OGE had completed their reviews. But those instances were rare exceptions, according to Obama ethics counsel Norm Eisen. Whats more, the importance  and difficulty  of assessing the potential ethical conflicts of Trumps appointees is far greater than those of his predecessors: The president-elect has assembled the wealthiest cabinet in history, with some appointees holding billions of dollars in assets that are spread throughout the world. As of this writing, four of the nine cabinet nominees who are set to receive confirmation hearings this week still havent completed their OGE ethics reviews  prospective Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Commerce Secretary pick Wilbur Ross, would-be Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, and nominee for head of the Department of Homeland Security John Kelly. But Mitch McConnell is unmoved by the OGEs plea for more time. All of these little procedural complaints are related to their frustration at having not only lost the White House, but having lost the Senate, McConnell said on Face the Nation Sunday, ostensibly suggesting that the OGE is a front group for the Democratic Party. I understand that. But we need to, sort of, grow up here and get past that. But if McConnell wont listen to the OGEs words, perhaps, hell take heed of his own. Or so Chuck Schumer seemed to reason on Monday. In 2009, thenMinority Leader McConnell sent thenMajority Leader Reid a letter laying out his list of pre-requisites for time agreements on the floor for President Obamas nominees, Schumer said from the Senate floor Monday. They are almost exactly what Democrats have requested. In fact, McConnells 2009 demands are so close to Schumers 2016 ones, the Senate Minority Leader decided to send the Kentucky Senator his own letter, albeit with a few line edits. In that letter, McConnell asked that committees be provided with each nominees OGE letter in time for review and prior to a committee hearing. The Kentucky senator described such a requirement as consistent with the longstanding and best practices of committees, regardless of which political party is in the majority. If the Republicans do not honor those best practices in 2016, Schumer has threatened to drag out the confirmation process for weeks via procedural mischief. (Democrats do not have the power to filibuster cabinet nominees, but do, ostensibly, have a means of delaying the inevitable.) As Politico notes, McConnell sent his 2009 letter weeks after the Senate confirmed seven top-level Obama nominees on his first day in office. Thus, in the Kentucky senators view, he is merely asking for Democrats to confirm Trumps picks at the same pace that Republicans okayed Obamas  on Monday, McConnell told reporters that he hopes to have more than a half-dozen nominees confirmed on the day Trump is sworn in.

Governor Tries to Sneak a Medicaid Expansion Under the Wire", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/nc-governor-tries-to-sneak-medicaid-expansion-under-the-wire.html", "text": " Roy Cooper did not get off to what youd call a great start as governor of North Carolina. He had to wait weeks for confirmation of his election, thanks to challenges to the results by the incumbent Republican he defeated, Pat McCrory. And then, two weeks before he took office, the Republicans who control his states legislature took advantage of a special session called for flood-relief measures to whip through several bills stripping the governorship of several previously established powers. So now that hes in office Cooper is trying to flex his own muscles by adding North Carolina to the list of 31 states that have accepted the Medicaid expansion authorized by the Affordable Care Act. Cooper is really trying to thread a needle here. Approval of his states Medicaid expansion application would have to happen by January 20, assuming (as is safe to assume) the Trump administration will at the very minimum put up a caution light on expansions if it does not succeed (with Congress) in shutting them down entirely and perhaps repealing those currently in place. He needs some commitments from hospitals and other providers to come up with the relatively small but crucial non-federal match needed to make an expansion happen, since the legislature isnt going to appropriate it. And there are notice requirements in state law that have to be satisfied. GOP legislators are livid about Coopers efforts; hes disregarding as unconstitutional a state law passed earlier that prohibits any gubernatorial initiative to expand Medicaid. Even if Cooper and HHS can somehow get it all done before Donald Trump takes the oath of office, there will be litigation to try and stop or reverse the expansion. But Cooper figures its worth the gamble if theres even a remote chance of covering over a half-million North Carolinians who might qualify for Medicaid under the expansion. And for all we know, states that did choose to expand (including Vice-President-elect Pences Indiana) may be privileged in any post-Obamacare-repeal scheme, and will certainly be in a better position if congressional Republicans cannot get their act together to repeal Obamacare at all."}, {"date": "2017/01/09", "title": "Watch: A Powerful Tribute to the Victims of Racial Lynchings", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/this-initiative-memorializes-the-victims-of-racial-lynchings.html", "text": "  Dont worry.

Most people yawned or missed the story entirely, though my colleague Jonathan Chait observed on Twitter that if Paul was telling the truth, the whole repeal-and-delay strategy for Obamacare might soon be dead. Politico offered a rather restrained original story on it, but came back today with a much splashier headline: Paul, Trump upend GOPs Obamacare repeal plans. So in addition to the thunder and lightning Trump is prone to unleash via Twitter at any time of day or night, is he also going to go old-school by phoning up Republican members of Congress to communicate his policy views on, well, the most important topic in contemporary politics? And if so, will he bypass the congressional GOP pecking order as he appears to have just done by letting Rand Paul, of all people, upend the leaderships plans? Its hard to say. On the immediate subject at hand, Trumps been trying to tell congressional Republicans to be careful about inheriting a whirlwind by repealing Obamacare before a replacement is in place. Rand Paul seems to think a replacement is real easy, perhaps because what most people think of as losing your health insurance he regards as freedom. So its possible they are, as Paul put it, in total agreement in opposing repeal and delay while being far apart on the matter of how quickly the simultaneous action occurs. If thats the case, it wont necessarily screw up this weeks Senate votes on a budget resolution that authorizes the Obamacare repeal, though some GOP senators might balk at voting to move right along with a game plan nobody is in a position to write. But it does suggest that the old repeal and delay plan, with the only disagreement being over how long to delay, is in deep trouble. It could mean delay the repeal is the only real consensus going forward. Now, its entirely possible Trumps call to Paul wasnt exactly as Paul reported it, or that Trump was just telling the Kentuckian what he wanted to hear, with absolutely no intention of upending everyone elses plans. But how are we supposed to know? At least with a Twitter pronunciamento Trump is uttering words we can all read and interpret and debate. But then again, as soon-to-be presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway says, this is an administration that thinks it unfair to judge Trump by what comes out of his mouth. So well all just have to wait and see.

Or, at least, thats how the companys spokespeople  and incoming press secretary Sean Spicer  characterized the meeting. And it truly would represent a job boom if the Chinese e-commerce company added 1 million full-time American workers to its current (global) labor force of 36,450. Especially since Amazon  Alibabas American competitor  employs less than 300,000 people. But Alibaba is not actually proposing an exponential increase in its own payroll  rather, the company claims that it will create 1 million jobs in the United States by enabling American small businesses to sell their wares to the Chinese middle class. Which is to say: It is promising to spur the U.S. economy by increasing trade with China. Alibaba will create 1 million US jobs by enabling 1 million American small businesses and farmers to sell American goods to China and Asian consumers on the Alibaba platform, the company said in a statement. We had a great meeting, and a great, great entrepreneur, one of the best in the world, and he loves this country, and he loves China, Trump told reporters following the meeting. Jack and I are going to do some great things. Were focused on small business, Ma said. We also think that the China and USA relationship should be strengthened  should be more friendly The door is open for discussing the relationship and trade issues. I think the president-elect is very smart, hes very open-minded to listen. Since winning the election, Trump has done much to make U.S.Sino relations less friendly, proposing tariffs on Chinese goods, making precedent-defying overtures to the government of Taiwan, and castigating China for enabling North Korean belligerence. These actions have inspired the Chinese government to fly a nuclear-capable bomber over its disputed islands in the South China Sea  while its state media has promised that if Trump continues on his current course, China will take revenge. In this context, Trumps embrace of a company that aims to help U.S. exporters capitalize on Americas trade relationship with China may be a source of comfort: Better for the president-elect to flip-flop on trade with the Chinese then to start a war over it. But the Trump-Ma meeting is less comforting when viewed in the context of the president-elects habit of making misleading claims about job creation. In December, Trump met with Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son. Following that meeting, Son informed reporters that his company, SoftBank, would invest $50 billion into the U.S., thereby creating 50,000 new American jobs. Trump claimed that such an investment never would have happened had he not been elected. But Son had already pledged to invest at least $25 billion into the United States in October of last year. Its possible that Trump inspired Son to double his investment. But its also possible that Son merely allowed Trump to spin a preexisting expansion plan as he saw fit, in a bid to curry favor with the incoming administration. As Politico has noted, the latter option is fast becoming standard operating procedure in the corporate world: On Monday, Ma helped Trumps press secretary spread the (fake) news that the president-elect had just inspired Alibaba to create 1 million new jobs in the United States. In actuality, Ma declared his intention to facilitate American job growth by helping exporters market to the Chinese consumer class in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published in June 2015. In other words: Alibaba is not directly creating 1 million U.S. jobs, and its plan to indirectly spur such job growth seems to have been formed long before Trumps election. (It is difficult to fathom how the election of an anti-trade demagogue would have inspired Alibaba to drastically increase its focus on facilitating trade between China and the U.S.) But Ma has plenty of incentive to provide Trump with a flattering headline. Alibabas accounting practices have been probed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and in December, American trade officials placed its platform, Taobao, onto a blacklist of markets that facilitate the sale of counterfeit goods. A friend in the White House could do much to alleviate such headaches. As it happens, Trumps pick for SEC chair advised Alibaba on its initial public offering."}, {"date": "2017/01/09", "title": "Heres a Look at the Nightmare Commute in London After a 24-Hour Transit Strike", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/scenes-nightmare-commute-in-london-after-tube-strike.html", "text": " The MTA had a bit of a snow hangover on Monday morning, but take consolation in the fact that pretty much any commuter in London had it way worse.

Trump actually didnt discuss it often or in much detail; Republicans typically downplay public discussion of this subject since entitlement reform, especially when it involves the universally available Social Security and Medicare retirement programs, is very unpopular among GOP, as well as Democratic and independent, voters. But on the campaign trail Trump did make it reasonably clear he thought the mega-growth his economic polices would allegedly produce would keep Social Security and Medicare solvent without big changes in either program. Trump sometimes included Medicaid as well as Social Security and Medicare in the list of entitlements he did not want to touch. But we can probably disregard any assurances on that program, since you cannot repeal the Affordable Care Act without tampering with the Medicaid expansion that has been the source of much of the ACAs coverage expansion. In addition, Trumps sketchy health-care platform included a proposal to turn Medicaid into a block grant wherein states would call the shots in exchange for a fixed (and probably shrinking) federal grant, which, needless to say, would represent a big change. So while Democrats will throw Trumps occasional words about protecting Medicaid back at him whenever possible, the real drama involves Social Security and Medicare, the programs that also most affect Trump voters. And whatever he said as a candidate, there is no question Trump has surrounded himself with politicians and opinion leaders who would go after both the big entitlement programs for the elderly with a clawhammer if given the opportunity. His vice-president, Mike Pence, was a big-league entitlement reformer in Congress. So, too, were the two men who will be most intimately involved in the administrations legislative agenda in this area, his appointees as OMB director, Mick Mulvaney, and HHS Secretary, Tom Price. And the administrations most important partner in Congress, House Speaker Paul Ryan, has repeatedly proposed to change Medicare from a defined benefit program to a system of subsidies for the purchase of private health insurance  a reform nearly every Republican who has served in Congress in recent years has voted for at one time or the other. Ryan was also a big fan of George W. Bushs proposal to partially privatize Social Security. Unsurprisingly, despite Trumps earlier vague assurances, there has been renewed talk of entitlement reform  especially with respect to Medicare (Medicaid cuts are simply assumed)  taking a big step forward now that Republicans control Congress and the White House, probably in a second budget bill later this year after the Obamacare repeal has been enacted, assuming that happens on schedule. But Trumps White House chief of staff and former RNC chairman Reince Priebus reset everybodys expectations yesterday: Thus Priebus is confirming that Trumps comments during the campaign represented a promise. And he interpreted the promise as ruling out meddling, not just cuts, which would appear to take off the table Ryan-style Medicare reforms that cut benefits indirectly over time. Notably, Priebus did not mention Medicaid at all. So does that mean seniors worried about Social Security and Medicare can relax for the moment? And is Trump, through his chief of staff, letting Democrats know they wont be able to mobilize opposition to the administrations entire agenda based on Medicare reform? Probably, but one statement on one Sunday show is not definitive. Lets say for the sake of argument that at some point this fall Trump is presented with a large budget-reconciliation bill that includes big, fat, juicy tax cuts, new funding for the Pentagon, and maybe even some semblance of the moguls infrastructure investment plan  and, oh yeah, nestled in the fine print, a step toward Medicare vouchers. Is he going to veto the whole thing to protect Medicare? Or will he shrug and say that while he didnt want to meddle with Medicare, Congress did, and we all have to make some concessions to make America great again. You can be sure that Democrats wont wait around for a nasty little surprise like that to appear. This very week, when the bare-bones budget resolution designed to authorize an Obamacare repeal reaches the Senate floor, they will have a brief opportunity to offer unlimited amendments in what is known as a vote-a-rama. There is no question one of those amendments will rule out Social Security and Medicare cuts as part of the subsequent budget reconciliation bill. With the president-elects chief of staff having disclaimed any intention of going after these programs, why would Senate Republicans vote to expose themselves to the heat Democrats would succeed in generating if they are indeed left on the table? The odds are pretty good theyll instead just cave, at least for the time being. Republicans will never completely relinquish their desire to get long-delayed revenge on the ghosts of Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson by killing, gutting, or seriously restructuring New Deal and Great Society programs like Social Security and Medicare. But ideally they want bipartisan cover for entitlement reform, which is why Republicans always include it in the occasional grand bargain budget proposal. And they sure wont run the risk of a major senior backlash if their own president is not onboard. So unless Priebus was just speaking out of turn, his remarks will probably preclude big Social Security and Medicare changes this year."}, {"date": "2017/01/09", "title": "New York Magazine Competition No. 82: Trump As Hemingway", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/new-york-magazine-competition-no-82-trump-as-hemingway.html", "text": " Welcome back to the New York Magazine Competition.

The mighty storm  what the National Weather Service called a once-in-1o-year event  slammed the region Sunday night. Meteorologists term the storm an atmospheric river, which brings moisture from the tropics. This one, coming in from Hawaii, is dubbed the pineapple express. This type of weather system isnt that uncommon, but it can wreak havoc by dropping a lot of rain or snow in a relatively short time period. And the pineapple express hasnt visited California in quite some time, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service told CNBC  its absence has contributed to the states historic drought. More rain is expected Monday, which is now falling in Southern California, the states most parched region. Parts of Nevada  which see less than a foot of rain per year  could get that and more in a few days. Up to 15 inches of rainfall could drop in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains. Heavy snow will fall at higher altitudes in the mountains, bringing with it an increased risk of avalanches. Governor Brian Sandoval has declared a state of emergency in Nevada, where schools and government buildings are shut down. The Russian River, in Sonoma, and the Truckee River near Nevada are two rivers threatening to crest. The rivers rise has forced hundreds of thousands of people to evacuate homes as roads became deluged with water and debris. Mud the length of a football field, with the sludge about seven feet deep, overtook Interstate 80, in the Sierra Nevadas, reports the Los Angeles Times. At least one woman has died, after being hit by a tree, which was blown down by wind, while walking on a golf course. A natural relic also became a casualty of the storm, when a famous sequoia was toppled in Calaveras Big Tree State Park on Sunday. Known as the Pioneer Cabin Tree, the sequoia had a 137-year-old tunnel drilled through it for hikers, and, at one time, cars could travel through. The storms, as devastating as they may be in the short term, are not totally unwelcome arrivals. Even these precipitation-packed systems cant erase Californias persistent drought  but this one is actually a pretty big start. The moisture has added to the Sierra Nevadas vital snowpack, reports the Los Angeles Times, and to reservoirs in Northern California, a trend that, if it lasts, could be a critical turning point for the state."}, {"date": "2017/01/09", "title": "This Time-lapse Shows Just How Bad the Smog Problem Is in Beijing", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/this-time-lapse-shows-just-how-bad-beijings-smog-problem-is.html", "text": "  Dont worry.

It could have been the Chinese, a lone obese man, etc. The intelligence  he insisted on using scare quotes  was suspiciously postponed, the Iraq War had shown that the CIA was untrustworthy in general, and trusted authority Julian Assange had suggested Russia might be getting unfairly blamed for the actions of a 14-year-old boy. Over the weekend, his line changed. Now, the very idea that Trump had mocked U.S. intelligence was an invention of the dishonest media; in fact, he is a big fan. Trump cited intelligence as his authority that Russia attempted to hack both parties, but only succeeded in hacking Democrats because Republicans had strong defense. (In reality, U.S. intelligence believes Russia successfully hacked both parties, but only released Democratic emails.) Trump and his supporters retreated to a new line, insisting in an official statement that the report had proved there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines. Kellyanne Conway made the talk-show rounds on Sunday to press home the point that the official report concluded that Russian email hacking had no influence on the election whatsoever. They did not succeed in throwing the election to Donald Trump, she told Chuck Todd. If you read the full report, they make clear, Mr. Clapper in his testimony made very clear in his testimony, under oath, that any attempt, any aspiration to influence our elections failed. They were not successful in doing that, she insisted to Jake Tapper. This is completely false. In fact, the intelligence report that Conway refers to took no position whatsoever on whether Russian hacking changed the outcome of the election. We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election, it states. The US Intelligence Community is charged with monitoring and assessing the intentions, capabilities, and actions of foreign actors; it does not analyze US political processes or US public opinion. And James Clapper, whose testimony Conway also cites as evidence that Russian hacking failed to influence the election outcome, took the same position, which, he said, certainly isnt the purview of the U.S. intelligence community. It isnt just outside the purview of the intelligence community to say conclusively whether the Russian email hacks made Trump president. Its outside the realm of human knowledge altogether, since it would require re-running the election in an alternate universe in which every other factor was identical save the presence of hacked emails published on WikiLeaks. Still, in an election that could have been reversed by a swing of 0.7 percent of the vote in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin plus 0.3 percent of the vote in Michigan, it seems quite likely that the revelations produced by the Russian hack made a large enough difference to change such a small number of votes. Trump cited WikiLeaks revelations 164 times during the election, according to Igor Volsky and Judd Legum. WikiLeaks emails were central to Trumps case that Hillary Clinton was corrupt and disqualified from holding office. WikiLeaks emails also infuriated supporters of Bernie Sanders, some of whom never came around to supporting Clinton after the primary grudge. Most important, the leaked emails generated countless headlines connecting Clinton to emails, which to low-information voters had become a catch-all phrase summarizing an aura of scandal around the Democratic candidate. Yet in falsely insisting that U.S. intelligence concluded that Russia failed to influence the elections outcome, Trumps campaign has articulated a defense conservatives are more eager to support than a straightforward denial of Russian guilt. The conservative movement and the Republican apparatus has largely embraced its new president, and have come to see skeptical coverage of a president who promises to enact cast new swaths of right-wing policy as a plot by the liberal media. The conservative pundit David Harsanyi, in a column published in National Review, the Federalist, Reason, and Hot Air, insists, theres no evidence that the Russians had anything to do with Trumps victory, and that any suggestions to the contrary have been made because the Left wants to delegitimize the democratic validity of Trumps presidency. Harsanyis argument rests on his inability to understand the difference between the probability of an outcome and its provability. I wrote in a column it was probable that Russias attack changed enough votes to elect Trump, while conceding it could not be known for certain. Harsanyi makes the case that this is a prima facie contradiction: I wrote that passage assuming readers would understand that a hypothetical scenario could be probable without being provable. This was a mistake, so I will walk Harsanyi through the concept. A hypothetical scenario might be predicted with some confidence even though its outcome is not provable. If I were to play Steph Curry in a one-on-one basketball game, it is overwhelmingly likely that Curry would win, but we cant say this for certain; maybe I would get the ball first and hit crazy shot after crazy shot, or maybe Curry would break his leg and Id repeatedly drive for layups while he writhed in agony on the floor. That Curry would win is not a provable fact. Or, if instead of nominating Trump, the Republicans had nominated Charles Manson, it is likely that Hillary Clinton would have won, but again, we cant say this for certain. In fact, I have my doubts. Republicans would initially view Manson as a dangerous maniac who must be stopped, as Republicans (like Harsanyi) did in early 2016 with Trump, but maybe over time they would place his flaws in context: Manson and Clinton both did radical things in the 1960s, and both are accused murderers, but only one of them used an unsecured email server and plans to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat with a left-wing justice etc., etc. Whos to say? The human mind is capable of tremendous rationalization. Trump, his supporters, and the enemies of his critics want very badly to deny that Russian hacking might have played a decisive role in his razor-thin victory. And so Trump and his supporters will provide reasons  or, at least, sentences in the English language that sound like reasons  to deny this, and those reasons will be believed."}, {"date": "2017/01/09", "title": "Keepin It 1600 Crew Launches New Podcast, Crooked Media Company", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/keepin-it-1600-crew-launches-crooked-media-company.html", "text": " Those distraught about the lack of Keepin It 1600 episodes in recent weeks can stop drowning their sorrows in Bloomin Onions.

According to the companys mission statement, there will still be openly biased snark and analysis, but with a new emphasis on activism and political participation. Eventually they hope to add more podcasts, live video, and written content to Crooked Media, but for now theyre still working out how theyll challenge the Trump administration.

The Texas senator and Greg Abbott, the states governor, met with Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen in Houston on Sunday, while she was passing through on her way to Central America. Cruz said they discussed arms sales, diplomatic exchanges and economic relations, and that he hopes to increase trade between Texas and Taiwan. Abbott said Tsai gave him a vase and he presented her with a clock bearing the Texas State Seal. As Reuters notes, its not that unusual for U.S. lawmakers to meet with Taiwanese leaders, but its a particularly delicate time to do so. Trump signaled his disrespect for the One China Policy, by which the U.S. has abided since 1979, when he accepted a congratulatory phone call from Tsai last month. Then he told Fox News that he doesnt think the U.S. should stick with the policy unless China makes concessions on trade, and selected fierce China critics for top trade roles in his administration. Cruz said that just before meeting with Tsai, the Houston congressional delegation received a curious letter from China asking them to cancel their meeting with Tsai and uphold the One China Policy. The Peoples Republic of China needs to understand that in America we make decisions about meeting with visitors for ourselves, Cruz said. This is not about the PRC. This is about the U.S. relationship with Taiwan, an ally we are legally bound to defend. The Chinese do not give us veto power over those with whom they meet. We will continue to meet with anyone, including the Taiwanese, as we see fit. Though Trump said nothing about the meeting, a short time later the state-run tabloid Global Times issued another warning directed at him. Sticking to (the one China) principle is not a capricious request by China upon U.S. presidents, but an obligation of U.S. presidents to maintain China-U.S. relations and respect the existing order of the Asia-Pacific, the editorial said. If Trump reneges on the one-China policy after taking office, the Chinese people will demand the government to take revenge. There is no room for bargaining, The editorial also said, Tsai needs to face the consequences for every provocative step she takes, suggesting that China would put more diplomatic, economic, and military pressure on Taiwan. Trump has said he does not plan to meet anymore world leaders before taking office on January 20, but hes open to meeting with Tsai someday."}, {"date": "2017/01/09", "title": "McConnell to Democrats Who Want More Time to Vet Trump Cabinet: Grow Up", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/mcconnell-on-more-time-for-vetting-cabinet-grow-up.html", "text": " Donald Trumps cabinet picks present a unique challenge for the independent federal agency tasked with preventing ethical conflicts. In addition to being the wealthiest presidential cabinet in history, some nominees have yet to complete the required financial-disclosure paperwork. The head of the Office of Government Ethics complained on Saturday that they need more time to determine if there are any financial, ethical, or criminal issues with the nominees, but it looks like they arent going to get it. Despite the concerns expressed by the nonpartisan government ethics office, Sunday on Face the Nation Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested the only calls to slow down the confirmation process are coming from Democrats. McConnell told host John Dickerson that Republicans were in the same position eight years ago, but they still confirmed seven cabinet appointments on the day President Obama took office. All of these little procedural complaints are related to their frustration at having not only lost the White House, but having lost the Senate, McConnell said. I understand that. But we need to, sort of, grow up here and get past that. Republicans have at least nine confirmation hearings scheduled for this week, and five are set to take place on Wednesday. Its not unusual to have five confirmation hearings in one day  it happened for both President Barack Obama and President George W. Bushs nominees  but on Wednesday the Senate is also set to hold a vote-a-rama that could kick off the repeal of Obamacare, and Trump is scheduled to hold his first post-election press conference. The GOP has also pointed out that in 2001 the Senate held confirmation hearings for Roderick Paige and Elaine Chao (McConnells wife) before the Office of Government Ethics completed its review. But former Obama administration ethics counsel Norm Eisen told The Wall Street Journal such cases were the exception. If it were one isolated incident, then perhaps you could overlook it, Eisen said. Senate committees have not received paperwork for four of the nine Trump nominees with hearings this week, but McConnell told Dickerson, We want to have all the records in  all the papers completed before theyre actually confirmed on the Senate floor. As Eisen noted on Twitter on Sunday, back in 2009, McConnell wrote a letter to then Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid saying all Obama nominees should have their FBI background check, Office of Government Ethics review, and financial disclosure statements complete before their hearing was even scheduled. These best practices serve the Senate well, and we will insist on their fair and consistent application, McConnell wrote. Looks like the strange malady that prevents the majority leader from recalling that he blocked the consideration of Obamas final Supreme Court pick is affecting his long-term memory as well."}, {"date": "2017/01/09", "title": "Video of Fort Lauderdale Airport Attack Emerges, Shooters Motive Still Unknown", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/video-of-airport-attack-emerges-shooters-motive-not-clear.html", "text": " The 26-year-old Iraq War veteran who opened fire at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on Friday, killing five people, was charged by a U.S. attorney on Saturday and will appear in court on Monday. The shooter, former National Guardsman Estaban Santiago, apparently planned the seemingly-random attack, in which he flew to the airport with his handgun case checked as luggage, then shot 11 people in one of the airports baggage claim areas  but authorities still dont understand why he did it. Five of the six people injured in the attack remain hospitalized as of Sunday, four with gunshot wounds, and two in critical condition. The FBI has not ruled out terrorism, but have found no evidence linking him to that motive. In addition, Santiago, who had flown to Florida from his home in Alaska, has a history of violent and erratic behavior, including domestic violence. He also has a documented history of mental illness, and had even had his handgun confiscated for a month after he walked into the Anchorage FBI office in early November and asked agents to help him, claiming the CIA was trying to control his mind and was making him watch ISIS videos. Santiago, agitated and incoherent, had left his gun  and his newborn baby  in his car before walking into the FBI office. He was subsequently detained by Anchorage police, the baby was retrieved by the boys mother (Santiagos girlfriend), and Santiago was admitted to a mental health facility. Police also confiscated his gun and logged it into evidence for safekeeping. Santiago was eventually released, and on December 8 he was able to reclaim his gun from the police. A month after that, he checked the same 9mm semiautomatic handgun in his luggage for a one-way trip to Fort Lauderdale, using proper protocol and drawing no extra attention to himself. After arriving in Florida, via Minneapolis, he claimed his luggage in Terminal Two, loaded the gun in a bathroom stall, and then came out and opened fire on the first people he saw, aiming for their heads. When Santiago was quickly approached by a Broward Sheriffs Office deputy, he dropped the gun and got down on the floor. The entire attack lasted less than 90 seconds. On Sunday, TMZ published a short security video which showed the beginning of the attack (authorities are already investigating the leak of the video): Now in custody, the gunman is cooperating with investigators. There is no indication that Santiago had any problems with anyone on his flight, which he boarded after a layover in Minneapolis. Authorities have been questioning people who knew Santiago in Alaska, where he worked as a security guard. Some 175 people have been interviewed thus far, and there have apparently been reports of Santiago exhibiting erratic behavior, including selling many of his possessions in Anchorage. Investigators have also reportedly found writings which indicate some level of planning prior to the attack. Members of the Santiagos family have told the media that he had mental health problems stemming from his 2010-2011 ten-month tour in Iraq as a teenager in the Puerto Rico National Guard, during which he saw a bomb explode next to two friends. The New York Times reports that at least two soldiers from Santiagos unit were killed in insurgent attacks during the units tour of duty. Santiagos brother Bryan said that Estaban sometimes couldnt control his anger, had said he was hearing voices, and had requested psychological help from the government. Were not talking about someone who emerged from anonymity to do something like this, he told the Associated Press. The brother also said he couldnt believe authorities had let Santiago have his handgun back after the incident in November, or didnt respond differently to that scenario on account of his mental health history. Santiagos aunt said on Friday that he had lost his mind while in Iraq and was hospitalized after returning, but that his mental illness appeared to be improving while he was living in Alaska, though she lost contact with him several months ago. Santiagos brother said communication between the two had stopped about a month ago, as well. The FBI says they interviewed his family members and ran other checks following the Anchorage incident in November. At the time, he apparently had said that he did not want to harm anyone. The gunmans victims in Florida have not been officially identified by authorities, but the families of four of the five people killed have acknowledged those victims names. All four were arriving in Fort Lauderdale to depart on cruise vacations. 84-year-old Georgia native Olga Woltering, a great grandmother, was traveling to Fort Lauderdale with her husband for a cruise with their children to celebrate his 90th birthday (he was unharmed in the attack). 70-year-old Shirley Timmons was also traveling with her husband, both from Ohio. She was killed and her husband remains in a coma after being shot in the face. Iowa native Michael Oehme, 57, and his wife were in town for their annual cruise. He was killed and she was shot in the shoulder. 62-year-old Terry Andres, a volunteer firefighter in Virginia Beach, was also traveling with his wife on their way to embark on a 16-day cruise. She was unharmed. The identity of the fifth person who was killed remains unknown as of Sunday evening. Santiago has been charged with federal crimes including committing violence and serious harm against someone at an international airport, as well as two firearms offenses, and he could now face the death penalty. He could also face state-level murder charges in Florida, but its not yet clear if state authorities are interesting in pursuing that course of action. So far, no evidence has been found linking Santiago to international terrorism. He was born in New Jersey, but grew up in Puerto Rico from the age of two. He went on to serve in the National Guard in Puerto Rico, and during that time he was deployed to Iraq. He also served in the Guard and Army Reserves in Alaska, but was discharged from the Guard in August for unsatisfactory performance. Santiagos son was born in September, and he was apparently living with the boy and his mother, Santiagos girlfriend, and as many as two other children for a time at a house in Anchorage. However, police had been called to the home at least four times in 2016 for either physical disturbances or domestic violence, and Santiago had been arrested twice. Terminals One, Three, and Four at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport were reopened on Saturday, and some of Terminal Two was reopened as well. Roughly 12,000 travelers were stranded on Friday when the airport was put on lockdown and 300 flights were cancelled. Many of the stranded have since been trying to recover the estimated 25,000 personal items they left behind. Those items comprise luggage, cellphones, and other personal belongings, including clothes, IDs, passports, and money, which travelers obviously need to recover before leaving Fort Lauderdale, but most bags wont be available until Monday, according to airport officials. (The airport has hired a contractor to collect all the discarded items and sort them by where they were found so they can be more easily retrieved by their owners.) State authorities even brought in special computer-equipped buses to print temporary IDs for travelers on Saturday afternoon, and Florida governor Rick Scott asked cruise ship companies to accept passengers with provisional IDs on account of the crisis. Regarding the rules around firearms and airline travel, the Transportation Security Administration says that airline passengers can bring firearms onto flights so long as they are unloaded, locked in hard-sided case, and placed in checked baggage. Firearm ammunition can also be transported in checked baggage. Airport terminals in Florida are now gun-free zones by law, but state lawmakers are currently considering legislation which would eliminate some of those zones. Its not clear how Fridays shooting might impact that debate."}, {"date": "2017/01/09", "title": "Jared Kushners Rise to Unimaginable Power", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/jared-kushner-trump-administration-power.html", "text": " Until very recently, and to all outward appearances, Jared Kushner was just another socially striving young businessman with inoffensively Bloombergian political values. But over the past year, something seems to have changed  in his beliefs, in his manner, in his relationship to his peers among New York Citys elite. On a frigid day in December, Kushner visited the Times Square headquarters of Morgan Stanley to address a private meeting that the Partnership for New York City, which represents the interests of the business community, convened to discuss the outcome of the presidential election. More than 400 executives, many of them CEOs of major corporations, crowded into the banks wood-paneled dining hall to hear first from Charles Schumer, soon to be the Democratic leader in the Senate, and then from Kushner, representing his father-in-law, Donald Trump, soon to be the most powerful man in the world. Jared Kushner is the man, said Stephen Schwarzman, the private-equity billionaire, as he introduced Trumps emissary. (This account is based on interviews with multiple attendees.) Kushner, the 35-year-old husband of Ivanka, Trumps favorite child, sat in a directors chair, wearing a gray sweater and blazer over an open-collared shirt and a pair of gleaming white sneakers. He still has a boyish mien and a polite, ingratiating manner. But these days, he carries himself with the assurance of a man who just received the ultimate validation. Many of the assembled magnates had lunched with him or chatted with him at parties, having known Kushner as the proprietor of a successful Manhattan real-estate firm and the publisher of a less-successful Manhattan newspaper. Some even considered him a protg. Its safe to say none, however, had foreseen this scenario. With little experience, and against all predictions to the contrary, Kushner had managed Trumps way to the White House, and was now poised to be his most trusted adviser and enforcer in the West Wing. This left many of the staid business leaders in the audience confused about whether Kushner really shared their values and worldview  indeed, whether he had ever really belonged to their world at all. Many were hoping  perhaps desperately  that Trump, a formerly unthinkable president, might at heart be a pragmatic dealmaker. If that were true, then maybe he could be moved by Kushners quiet advice, and maybe all his maximalist stances  build the wall, ban the Muslims, bring on the nuclear-arms race  were negotiable. After the election, the financial markets were buoyed in part by this (still unproven) theory. Three days before Kushners appearance, the Dow had closed at a record high. He had come to offer a message to his old friends: Be unafraid. I thought I would need to explain to the business community what a Trump presidency means, Kushner began. But the markets seem to have figured it out. He told the audience about his own process of figuring out Trumps appeal, saying that he had once lived in a bubble on the Upper East Side. He thought about immigration in terms of Silicon Valleys needs, about education the way Robin Hood Foundation philanthropists did, about climate change in terms of carbon emissions, not mining jobs. Then, about a year ago, Kushner said, he had started traveling the country with Trump, going to rallies where thousands of ordinary Americans shouted in fury about government regulations and the Common Core curriculum. (And torturing terrorists and locking up his opponent, though Kushner didnt mention those lines.) The gilded scales fell from his eyes. David Zaslav, the chief executive of the Discovery cable networks, asked Kushner how it would be possible in the future to have a national discussion based on facts. Kushner replied that it was the media that was deluded about America, claiming his own computer models told him the morning of the election that Trump would capture more than 300 electoral votes. Recognizing that outlets like CNN and the Times were implacably against Trump, Kushner said, the campaign cut a deal to grant softball interviews to a local broadcast chain with a strong presence in the Midwest. Sympathizers on Facebook spread their own news through their social networks. The result, he said, was a campaign by alternative means. Kushner believes Trumps victory was a repudiation of the media and both political parties  the entire governing Establishment. He said he was proud Trump had won only 4 percent of the vote in Washington, D.C. Kushner acknowledged that Trump was easy to hate from afar, but he claimed his father-in-law was different once he got down to business in the privacy of the boardroom. He predicted the administration would take a rational position on immigration and would join with Democrats to invest in infrastructure, which he said could mean not only roads and bridges but high-speed internet and driverless cars. He said Trump had asked Elon Musk why the aerospace industry couldnt make planes that fly faster, like the Concorde used to, and Musk replied that most CEOs preferred incremental improvements to moon-shot risks. Trump will not be afraid to fail, he said. If you forgot the context, the handsome, reed-thin young man might as well have been giving a TED Talk about an ambitious start-up, instead of a government soon to be led by a right-wing populist whom his opponents called the chaos candidate. Ten blocks to the north, in his golden tower, Trump was nominating a climate-change skeptic for Interior secretary and tweeting gleefully about Russian hacking, even as his son-in-law said America needed to take a long-term view of the warfare of the future. Kushner imagines his role as managerial, not policymaking. Im not political, he told the audience, not entirely credibly. In D.C., as Reagans adage goes, People are policy, and no person, other than Trump himself, has been as politically instrumental in advancing the new presidents ambitions. During the latter stages of the presidential race, when all the so-called smart people in politics and media were preparing to shunt Trump rudely from the stage, he relied on Kushner the most. He prefers the soothing, whispery voice of his son-in-law, the Times reported in a prematurely funereal dispatch on November 6. Two nights later, as Mr. Trump learned he would soon be President Trump, it was Kushners voice that was screening the calls to his suddenly all-important cell phone. When Trump paid his first postelection visit to the White House, Kushner accompanied him, taking photos of the Oval Office with his iPhone and strolling with President Obamas chief of staff. Now he and Ivanka were preparing to move to Washington, where they reportedly are set to occupy a $5.6 million mansion with their three children. Im hoping that hes our Valerie Jarrett, says Kathy Wylde, the Partnerships chief executive, the last person to speak to the president on matters that are important to New York. Kushners influence appears to be one hard truth at the center of the transitions chimerical swirl of intrigue. I think the bottom line is he believes in Donald, and he believes in the opportunity to rethink the way our Executive branch conducts itself, says Strauss Zelnick, a media investor who is close with Kushner and attended the Partnership event. Kushner has thrown himself into the role of recruiter, exploiting his network in the real-estate industry and finance. Hes gotten advice from everyone, even a rabbi he was close to at Harvard. Kushners business dealings, like Trumps, involve numerous partners and lenders from around the globe, even immigrants investing via a controversial cash-for-visa program, and are likely to come under great scrutiny. He has spent much of the transition period trying to figure out how to remove himself from potential conflicts of interest. Trump seems unconcerned. Kushner flattered the Partnership audience by saying the president-elect was happy to be bringing so many billionaires to D.C., asking, Who else to do you want to see cutting deals? Kushners impact can be seen in the centrist tilt of Trumps economic team, which is heavy on Goldman Sachs guys. For secretary of State, he preferred Mitt Romney and, later, Rex Tillerson over bomb-throwers like John Bolton and Rudy Giuliani. At the same time, he has been an internal supporter of Steve Bannon, the former Breitbart chairman, now Trumps polarizing senior counselor. For a guy who was a progressive, Bannon says, he really gets this grassroots populist movement in a huge way. Trump doesnt really appear to listen to anyone, but he likes to hear a lot of advice. We have no formal chain of command around here, Trump said at a December boardroom audience with Jeff Bezos, Sheryl Sandberg, and other tech-industry leaders. Yet everyone knew who had played the biggest role in arranging the meeting: Kushner, who sat with his back to the cameras, directly facing the president-elect. During the campaign, Trump hired and fired many aides, but Kushner was frequently the last person he consulted before making major decisions. He so far has no official White House title, and he may never have one. But it will scarcely matter if Kushner has a formal job, so long as he maintains his position within the family. There were three campaign managers, says a political consultant who knows Kushner. There was only one son-in-law. Throughout the campaign, the depth of Kushners commitment to Trumps reactionary agenda was surrounded by a bit of what Henry Kissinger  a Kushner admirer  would call constructive ambiguity. He didnt grant on-the-record interviews or give a speech expressing his beliefs at the Republican National Convention. His decision to leave behind his business, his prior political affiliations, and quite a few friendships in order to serve Trump remains mystifying to many people who thought they knew him. True, he had always been quick to champion Trump to his many detractors and expressed admiration for his knack for self-promotion and his impish ability to play the press for suckers. But Kushner never gave the impression that he had anything more than a grudging son-in-laws level of tolerance for Trumps more radical positions. Back when Trump was spinning birther conspiracy theories, which were lapped up by gullible Republicans, one person who talked to Kushner says he offered assurances that his father-in-law didnt really believe that stuff. Yet Trump and Kushner have more in common than surface appearances might suggest. They are both bridge-and-tunnel guys  Trump is from Queens, Kushner from Livingston, New Jersey  who made their names in Manhattan and lived through tumultuous periods of tabloid fire and financial adversity. As a developer, Trump took big risks in the 1980s and faced bankruptcy in the 1990s; Kushner took big risks before the 2008 financial crash and flirted with losing his familys flagship building, 666 Fifth Avenue. Both came back. Kushner is often called soft-spoken, in contrast to his bombastic father-in-law, but people who have worked with him say thats deceiving: His voice is just literally soft. His opinions are anything but deferential. Hes very aggressive, says Zelnick, who says that once Kushner makes up his mind, it may look like hes barreling down a path. Above all, he and Trump share a clannish outlook on life, business, and politics. Trump prizes loyalty, especially when it flows upward, and no defender has been more steadfast during his turbulent struggle than Kushner. Neither forgets when hes been wronged. They both appear to enjoy the metallic taste of payback, although of the two, Trump may be the more forgiving. In October, the Observer, Kushners news organization, asked prominent figures in the real-estate industry, including Kushner himself, Hillary or Donald? Kushner replied: Family first. To some, the endorsement sounded obligatory. They misunderstood Kushner. In fact, family first is his paramount value, a personal principle instilled in him through bitter history. He currently works on the 15th floor of 666 Fifth Avenue, where his corner office is steps from those of his parents, Charlie and Seryl, along with his sister Nicole. (Jareds brother, Josh, has his own venture-capital firm, while another sister, Dara, lives quietly in Livingston.) When Jared was 24, Charlie was sent to prison for a sordid crime with political overtones, a searing episode that sealed their bond in life and business. But the fierce family ethic predates that experience. Its origins can be found in a hardbound book that sits in the Kushner Companies reception area entitled The Miracle of Life. The book narrates the almost unimaginably difficult immigrant story of Kushners grandparents. Rae Kushner, the familys matriarch, was born in Novogrudek, in what is now Belarus. When the Nazis arrived in 1941, they executed the towns Jewish doctors, lawyers, and intellectuals on the square, as an orchestra played. Rae, a teenager, was one of 50 girls selected to scrub their blood from the cobblestones. The Nazis forced tens of thousands of Jews into a ghetto, which served as a labor camp, periodically culling the population. Raes mother and a sister were killed. By the middle of 1943, the 500 or so remaining Jews had concluded that they would all die unless they did something desperate, so they decided to tunnel out. At night, the excavators would work using crudely fashioned instruments, passing back bags of soil via a human chain that ran up to a hiding place in an attic. The residents of the ghetto had heard that a farmer named Tuvia Bielski had gathered an armed group of Jewish partisans, which was hiding out in the nearby forests. One stormy night, several hundred Jews, including Rae, her father, a sister, and a brother, crawled the several hundred feet to the tunnels exit. The Germans soon detected the escape and opened fire. Raes brother ran in the wrong direction and was never seen again. The remaining family made it to the Bielski camp, where they lived a rough existence, sleeping on beds of straw in earthen bunkers, until the Soviets arrived. After the war, Rae married another survivor of the woods, a carpenter named Yossel, and became an illegal immigrant, traveling on foot to Italy. They ended up in a displaced-persons camp, where they spent three and a half years while the family waited for a visa to immigrate to the United States. Nobody wanted to take us in, Rae said in The Miracle of Life. At the time, the United States had immigration quotas based on ethnicity. For the Jews, the doors were closed. We never understood that. Even President Roosevelt kept the doors closed. In America, Yossel became Joseph Kushner. He lived with Rae and their children in Brooklyn while working construction in New Jersey. His nickname was Hatchet Joe. With the brothers Harry and Joe Wilf, he bought three lots in Union County and went into home-building. The Kushners moved to New Jersey, where Joe became part of a cohort, many of them Holocaust survivors, who built the postwar suburbs and left behind dynasties. (The Wilf family now owns the Minnesota Vikings.) Joe Kushner specialized in building and renting garden apartments  a good, if unglamorous, business. One real-estate veteran who knows the Kushners quoted an old proverb: You cater to the masses, you eat with the classes. Joe had two sons, Murray and Charlie. Charlie had just gone to work with his father when Joe died suddenly in 1985. Charlie basically learned how to be a builder very quickly, says Alan Hammer, an attorney who has long worked with him. Charlie expanded his portfolio to around 25,000 apartments and got into commercial real estate, hotels, and banking. The Kushners became a prominent force in Jewish philanthropy, opening an Orthodox school named for Joe. Rae was a founder of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Her story of resistance has become central to the Kushner-family identity. When the story of the Bielski partisans was made into a movie called Defiance, starring Daniel Craig, the Kushners staged a screening party attended by Holocaust survivors. The Kushners are financial supporters of AIPAC, and Jared stage managed Trumps primary-season speech to the lobbying group. He has also served as a bridge to the government of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has known the Kushners for years. Last summer, when Trump tweeted a Photoshopped image of Hillary Clinton many saw as anti-Semitic, Kushner hastened to his defense in a rare column in the Observer, citing his own family history and maligning the speech police. When critics question Trumps relationships with people like Bannon, the purported Svengali of the alt-right, Jared and Ivanka, who converted to Judaism, note that Trump wore a yarmulke at their wedding and has Jewish grandchildren. Donald hired somebody whos an anti-Semite, even though his son-in-law is a practicing Orthodox Jew? developer Richard LeFrak, one of Trumps few close friends in New York real estate, said incredulously. A lot of his best friends are Jewish! Come on, really. What does this all stem from, this hysteria? Jared, born in 1981, grew up in a tight-knit environment structured around family and faith. His many aunts, uncles, and cousins would often descend on their home for Shabbos dinner. Some of the Kushners business associates lived in the neighborhood, within walking distance of an Orthodox shul. Through Jareds teenage years, his father became increasingly involved in politics, becoming a top Democratic Party donor. Politicians with national aspirations, including Hillary Clinton, would regularly pay visits to the Kushners. In July 2000, Vice-President Al Gore descended on Livingston to attend a fund-raiser for his presidential campaign. There were police on every corner, shutting down rush-hour traffic, as the vice-presidents motorcade climbed the hill to the Kushner home. It was a big to-do in Livingston that day, recalls Miles Berger, a business partner of Kushners who attended. What people remember now, though, is the 19-year-old who introduced the candidate. Charlie put Jared up there to do the talking, says Pat Sebold, a Democratic officeholder from Livingston. I was impressed that he was a young guy and handled himself so well. To all appearances, Charlie was grooming his son to understand how power worked. All the New Jersey builders donated to politicians to smooth the way for their projects, but Charlie wanted more than just zoning approvals. He aspired to be a kingmaker. He was the financial force behind Jim McGreevey, a suburban Democratic mayor who won the New Jersey governorship in 2001. After his victory, McGreevey nominated Kushner for chairmanship of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. In retrospect, the cynics said, that was Charlies flaw: his craving for a public role. The much-chronicled fall of Charlie Kushner began as a dispute with his brother Murray over the real-estate business, which triggered an epic family feud. A series of civil lawsuits uncovered evidence that piqued the interest of Chris Christie, the ambitious U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, who appeared to relish the idea of pursuing Governor McGreeveys patron. In July 2004, four months after his mothers death, Charlie was indicted. Along with campaign-finance violations, investigators had discovered that he had staged a vicious retaliation plot against his sister Esthers husband, luring him into an encounter with a prostitute that he taped for use as blackmail. The scandal contributed to the resignation, a month later, of McGreevey, who confessed hed been having an affair with a former Israeli naval officer who had ties to Kushner. The episode had a formative effect on Jared, whose life to that point had followed a glide path through Harvard  to which his father was a major benefactor  and prestigious internships. Whereas Christie, perhaps to his subsequent regret, righteously denounced Charlies vile and heinous acts, Jared saw his father as a victim of injustice. Its an outrage that Charlies brother and sister cooperated with the government against him; thats the lowest thing a Jew can do in my book, says Ken Kurson, the current editor of the Observer, who is a longtime friend of the family. Whatever ill-advised decisions Charlie may have made, it was a family spat and it was not a criminal affair. (Murrays side of the family did not respond to requests for comment, but some members have been vociferously critical of Jareds role in Trumps campaign.) Charlie served nearly a year in an Alabama prison, where Jared and his mother visited him weekly. The Kushners were still wealthy, from their rental income, but their social status had evaporated. Jared was living in New York, where there were other routes to influence besides politics. The media had contributed to his fathers problems by digging into his relationship with McGreevey. So it is perhaps understandable, in retrospect, that Jareds first move was to buy a newspaper. During the summer of 2006, Kushner canceled a planned trip to Germany to watch the World Cup in order to make a $10 million offer for the New York Observer. He had moved in, almost impetuously, just as another bidder was about to close a deal. But Kushner soon discovered that journalism was a strange business. The youthful staff at the Observer made subsistence wages, but the writers didnt seem bothered about money. They competed instead for the fickle approval of the papers charismatic editor, Peter Kaplan, who cultivated an air of intellectual eccentricity punctuated by sarcastic exclamation points. The culture of the office, where I worked under the prior ownership, could be belittling to anyone judged a rube. If Kushner, then 25, was seeking to confirm a suspicion that the media was made up of socially insecure smartasses who glory in the human failings of the rich and powerful, he couldnt have picked a better place to educate himself. Kushner spent time around the newsroom  at least at first  where he listened politely as Kaplan tried to excite him about the romantic ideals of journalism. To the Times, Kaplan cited a scene from Citizen Kane, saying every young man should think it would be fun to run a newspaper. Privately, though, he made a different cultural reference. Kaplan told friends that Kushners favorite book was The Count of Monte Cristo, the story of a wronged man who escapes prison, becomes rich, and uses his wealth to stealthily visit vengeance upon his unsuspecting enemies. It is very helpful to him that hes constantly underestimated, says Kurson, the last of several successors to Kaplan as editor. Kurson, an author and former political consultant, met Charlie Kushner before prison and would sometimes crash at Jareds apartment on nights he worked late on Rudy Giulianis 2008 presidential campaign. We were doing then what we do now, Kurson says, which is bullshit about politics and talk about the media. Kushner had an enthusiastic interest in the dark arts of campaign operatives. The Observer acquired a website that published New Jersey insider political gossip, run anonymously by a former GOP consultant named David Wildstein. In 2009, it persistently attacked Christie as he ran for governor. Later, Wildstein was hired by Christie and engineered the politically retributive traffic jam at the George Washington Bridge. After the scheme came to light, Kushner sent an email to Wildstein, who had resigned amid the investigation. Thats another thing we have in common I guess with my Dad having done the same, he wrote. For what its worth, I thought the move you pulled was kind of badass. Under Kurson, the Observer became more combative, inveighing against Obamas Iran policy on the editorial page and producing pointed investigations of everyone from the Wilfs, the Kushners original business partners, to New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman, who was then investigating Trump University. When the Observer published a negative front-page article about Schneiderman in 2014, illustrated with a caricature of the prosecutor in the guise of the protagonist of A Clockwork Orange, it caused an uproar. (Kurson says it was a great test run for how delusionally unfair the press was during the 2016 campaign.) For the last few years, though, Kushner has had little day-to-day involvement in the Observer. It discontinued its print edition right after the election. The newspaper served its purpose, though, as Kushners foothold in New York, where he made strategic friendships with older media moguls, like Rupert Murdoch and Barry Diller, who understood the workings of power in the city. There is a model we know well, says one of Kushners friends. I think he saw himself in this role, as somebody who would have a successful real-estate business but who also would want to have a voice. I always thought of him as being a smart young man, an up-and-comer, obviously, says Ray Kelly, the former NYPD commissioner, who got to know Kushner as a donor to the New York City Police Foundation, which subsidized his departments overseas intelligence operations. He says he saw Kushner as a law-and-order person who was supportive of the Bloomberg administrations technocratic approach to government. Kushner was also close to Joel Klein, the schools chancellor, who influenced his views on education reform. He was friendly with Newark mayor and charter-school proponent Cory Booker, now a Democratic senator. (Kushner urged Trump to consider two controversial Democratic charter advocates, Michelle Rhee and Eva Moskowitz, for Education secretary.) Kushner found a signature Bloomberg-era cause, pressing the city to rate the quality of broadband in office buildings. The initiative was called WiredNYC. As Kushner wired the city, he was also advancing his familys business interests. In 2006, Jared negotiated the purchase of 666 Fifth Avenue for $1.8 billion, a record sum for a Manhattan office building at the time. The transaction was financed by an onerous amount of debt. The following year, the Kushner Companies liquidated its apartment portfolio for $1.9 billion. The shift was akin to trading a fleet of taxicabs for a single Formula 1 race car. It wasnt my idea to buy a New York building, says Hammer, who was chairman of the company during Charlies absence. That was really the idea of a very aggressive, ambitious young man. The Fifth Avenue purchase quickly ran into problems. Kushners loans were premised on the assumption that office rents would rise; instead, the economy crashed. Vulture investors bought the debt, threatening foreclosure. Kushner felt besieged, with few friends and no leverage. But he fought his way out, refinancing the loans, selling equity stakes to partners, and exploiting its retail space via a complex series of deals that resulted in a stabilizing cash windfall. They lived through turbulent times, and not only did they live, they thrived, says Jonathan Mechanic, a real-estate attorney who was involved in the retail-space negotiations. Kushner didnt forget who had been unkind to him along the way. In one much-discussed episode, he later pushed the Observer staff to pursue a shaky tip about supposed malfeasance committed by one of his debt holders. (No story was ever published.) Kushner emerged from the crisis with a reputation as a gutsy dealmaker. He was soon buying again with backing from institutional investors like the CIM Group, an aggressive private-equity firm co-founded by a pair of former Israeli paratroopers. He acquired the troubled retail space in the old New York Times Building from Lev Leviev, a diamond magnate who is reportedly friendly with Vladimir Putin. He bought up rent-stabilized apartment buildings in the East Village and made a bold move into Dumbo, persuading the Jehovahs Witnesses to sell him a coveted set of properties. Hes very uncluttered in his mind, says Asher Abehsera, who has partnered with Kushner in his Brooklyn redevelopment projects. I think that simplicity allows him to filter some things out. In the case of the Dumbo deals, Kushner managed to tune out the doubts of those who thought the prices he and his partners had paid, more than $1 billion in all, were hard to justify. One day in December, Abehsera, a 33-year-old in a black motorcycle jacket and matching baseball cap, showed me around the first phase of the project, called Dumbo Heights. The churchs former pamphlet-printing plant has been converted into office space, for which the owners are charging Manhattan-level rents. The project is being marketed to the tech industry, to which Kushner has developed ties, partly through his brother, Josh, who runs the VC firm Thrive Capital. Jared was involved early on in Joshs health-insurance start-up, Oscar, which has backing from Peter Thiel and is valued at $2.7 billion. (Oscar currently competes on the Obamacare health exchanges that Trump has pledged to abolish, though the company is shifting its business model, for instance, by selling plans to small businesses. Before the election, Josh said he was voting for Clinton.) Standing on a Dumbo street corner, across from a location of the tech-oriented office provider WeWork and the new headquarters of Etsy, Abehsera pointed out a bike bay, which is visible through large windows from the street. That was Jareds idea, he said. Kushner personally interviewed the owners of more than a dozen coffee shops, he added, before settling on the right tenant. When I asked whether he expected Kushner to pay similar attention to future phases, he answered quickly. Hes not going to be involved, he said. Given the weight of what hes involved in, his interests will be elsewhere. Kushner married Ivanka in October 2009, after an archetypically difficult courtship, involving a daunting obstacle (his parents religious objections), a magical reconciliation (staged by Wendi Deng aboard the Murdoch yacht), and an arduous test (Ivankas conversion, overseen by an eminent Modern Orthodox rabbi). Kushners public identity underwent its own conversion. In the newspapers, he was no longer inevitably identified as a felons son  he was Ivankas husband, an auxiliary Trump. Every marriage is a mystery to the world outside it, but the Kushner-Trump union is particularly well guarded. One thing at its core, especially today, is their allegiance to the domineering patriarch. Donald relies heavily on his family, says LeFrak. I would say that Jared, hes part of the mosaic. He fits into the family very well. The alliance crosses into business. In early November, a few days before the election, the Trump Organization began leasing apartments at Trump Bay Street, a new 50-story building in Jersey Citys waterfront district. Kushner and a local partner developed the building on a site they bought out of foreclosure in 2011. As is his practice, Trump lends his name via a branding and management deal, while Kushners partnership owns and financed the development. The partnership raised about a third of its projected $193 million cost via the federal EB-5 program, which offers green cards to foreign investors. Bloomberg News reported that it was marketed to would-be Chinese immigrants with a video set to the theme from The Sopranos. The visa program will soon face a contentious renewal debate in Congress, but the Kushner Partnership is rumored to be considering whether to use the same method for another Jersey City project. As Kushner distances himself from the family business, his father will likely play a higher-profile role. In recent years, the Kushner Companies has also gotten back into the original family business: renting to the masses. In 2011, it began buying up portfolios of distressed apartment complexes around Rust Belt towns like Pittsburgh, Toledo, and Indianapolis. The turnaround strategy was simple, Jared told the publication Multifamily Executive: a lot of construction and a lot of evictions. The following year, he acquired more than 5,500 apartments in Maryland, mainly in the blue-collar suburbs of eastern Baltimore County. The area has been depressed by factory closures, and Trump ran very strong there. Between 2012 and 2016, a Kushner-affiliated corporate entity called JK2 Westminster LLC filed hundreds of tenant lawsuits in Maryland courts. One defendant was Robert Bolen, a 64-year-old former Honeywell employee with a documented history of alcoholism and mental illness. He was a disruptive resident of a bland brick complex called Carroll Park. Kushners management company evicted him in the summer of 2015. That August, a few days before the first Republican debate, Bolen allegedly walked into the complexs rental office, said Good morning, and opened fire with a shotgun, wounding two employees. As Trump would say, something was going on in America. Kushner spent a substantial portion of 2016 on the trail with his father-in-law, witnessing the anger of the American electorate  or at least the subset of it that turned up at Trump rallies. Then he would return to New York, which was dwelling in its comfortable delusions. Nobody has less credibility than the people in this town, he recently told an associate. If you want to talk with yourselves all day and convince yourselves that youre right, thats what people in this town do all day. Trump was giving voice to authentic grievances, Kushner thought, but many of the people he knew considered him a deranged demagogue. He fumed about CNN, complaining it covered Trumps campaign events as if they were the Nuremberg rallies. People say hes unhinged, Kushner told the associate. I think he unhinged everyone else. The consequences of Kushners decision to enlist in Trumps campaign have reverberated through his life, business, even his synagogue, Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun, where last summer there were protests over the rabbis plans to give the invocation at the Republican National Convention. (The rabbi canceled his participation.) One real-estate executive who knows Kushner told me he doesnt know if he will be able to shake his hand after the campaign. Another said: I cannot be in business with Jared Kushner at the moment, because my wife would divorce me. One of Kushners partners in the Dumbo Heights project, the German-born developer Aby Rosen, erected a giant billboard reading VOTE YOUR CONSCIENCE  a blatant dig at Trump  on one of his buildings before the election. In September, the Real Deal reported that Rosens company had pulled out of a second deal with Kushner amid rumors of political tensions, though the primary reason appeared to be financial. (Rosen did not respond to a request for comment.) For all the criticism he has encountered, though, Kushner has displayed supreme confidence in his own judgment. Sir Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of the advertising conglomerate WPP and a friend of Kushners, recalls running into him one Saturday morning on Park Avenue as he was walking with his children to synagogue. This was way before the election, even before the nominating process, Sorrell says. He said with great conviction that he thought his father-in-law would win, and at that stage there were very few people who thought that would be the case. After the election, Sorrell ran into Kushner and Ivanka at a party and the adman told him, Mazel tov. Kushners involvement in the campaign began as a family commitment, helping out with tasks whenever Trump would ask. But as primary season wore on, Kushners ad hoc assistance deepened into a managerial role. His presence at campaign meetings went from occasional to constant. If the campaign was proof of anything, it was that neither prior campaign experience nor, perhaps especially, presidential-campaign experience was required, says Rick Reed, a veteran consultant who made ads for Trump. Like the technology entrepreneurs he admires, Kusher looked at the business of campaigns and saw a complacent industry ripe for disruption. Pollsters are total thieves, he said in his speech to the Partnership. Kushner pushed the campaign to use direct-marketing strategies employed by private tech companies. Arthur Mirante, who brokered the original sale of 666 Fifth, says that during the campaign he occasionally sent quizzical emails about Trumps more outrageous statements. Why did he have to do it that way, why did he say it this way? Et cetera, he says. And I would always get a typical Jared response from him that was, Look, theres a bigger picture here, you know, I know what he said maybe didnt look good, but he really didnt mean it that way. There was always the typical Jared explanation, totally devoid of politics. Just that there are things happening here that you dont understand, and this is going to work out, trust me. Kushner received more scorching emails, too, some of them from people he respected. He viewed these as useful data points  he now knew who his loyal friends were. I call it an exfoliation, Kushner told Forbes in his only on-the-record interview since the election. The criticism seemed to trigger a practiced defense mechanism. In private conversations, he would return to the prior experience of his fathers arrest and his brush with financial ruin at 666 Fifth. Ive been in quite a few foxholes in my life, he told one associate. I think Ive always found my way out. This time, though, he was fighting next to people like Steve Bannon. Trump cycled through two campaign managers, Corey Lewandowski and Paul Manafort, before Kushner found in Bannon a strategist just as disdainful as he was of the traditional campaign playbook. He threw the whole thing out, Bannon says. Thats why I bonded with him. Though their politics differed, Kushner arguably has more in common with Bannon  an insurgent attitude, a disdain for the GOP Establishment, a background in digital media  than with anyone in Trumps orbit besides Ivanka. Two different worlds, yet they seem to get along and work well together, says a Republican who knows Kushner and Bannon. I think he sees Bannon as a valuable resource in the advancement of Trump. Its not about what he thinks, its about getting Trump what he needs. Kushner, as a family member, was often the person called on to broach difficult conversations with Trump, such as firing Lewandowski or talking him out of offering the vice-presidency to Governor Chris Christie. Christies early endorsement was a watershed moment for Trump, but Kushner argued presciently that the looming Bridgegate trial would be a damaging distraction. When, in its final days, the campaign needed $10 million to buy advertising in several key states, which analysts gave Trump little chance of winning, Kushner made the ask. He appealed to him by saying, I know this is family money and personal wealth, I get it, and I also know that you can win and we need that extra infusion, says Kellyanne Conway, the final campaign manager, who will serve as a White House counselor. Mr. Trump trusts Jareds business instincts as well as his political acumen. Right now, what Trump needs is a government. Kushner has been essential in assembling it for him. Along with Mike Pence, he moved within days of the election to assert control over the transition, reportedly playing the key role in neutralizing Christie, who had previously been in charge of the process. Christie had been doing a shoddy job, Kushner thought, was politically wounded by his scandal, and had shown soft commitment during the campaigns low moments. Kushner also hadnt forgotten his fathers imprisonment. Christies loyalists were purged, while Kushner recruited Bill Stepien, the ruthless campaign manager that Christie fired for his role in the bridge plot, to be Trumps political director. After floating a series of leaden trial balloons  Republican National Committee chair? Homeland Security?  the diminished governor slunk home to Jersey. The Count of Monte Cristo couldnt have plotted it better. When Bannons appointment came under fire, on the other hand, from groups like the Anti-Defamation League, Kushner tried to rally support from Jewish organizations. If youre in a foxhole with him, and fighting with him, youre a brother, and he will defend you nonstop, Bannon says. More recently, during the December dustup over John Kerrys reproachful parting shot at Israels commitment to a two-state solution, Bannon and Kushner were said to be working back channels to Netanyahus government. Trumps statements on Israel have been wildly inconsistent: During the primary campaign, he suggested he would maintain a neutral stance, then he nominated his bankruptcy attorney, a hard-line settlement supporter, as ambassador. He also has suggested he may put Kushner in charge of peace negotiations. If Trumps administration is anything like his campaign, or the rest of his life, it is likely to be split along lines of clan, with the conservative Republicans  Pence, Conway, and chief-of-staff Reince Priebus  competing for influence with the cadre of outsiders who are loyal to Trump, foremost among them Kushner and Ivanka. Already the factions are whispering and jockeying for influence. It would be a mistake, though, to view Kushner as an ideological counterweight. He is earnest, in that sense, when he says he is not political. He has lived a life surrounded by politics, in which Democratic candidates frequently dropped by for dinner, but his liberalism was cultural, reflecting community values. Now he has a new community. Some suggest that Kushner could be a force for moderation, if not in terms of ideology, then at least in managing Trumps incendiary tendencies. Certainly a president needs someone to say, Look, this isnt helpful to you, this isnt helpful to the country, Reed says. I think Jared will play that role. Still, theres little evidence that anyone can moderate Trump, other than Trump himself, and there is little doubt where Kushners ultimate loyalties lie. Im sure that he voices his opinions with Donald, and I think Ivanka has got her own set of opinions, says LeFrak. That family is not a family of robots. But at the end of the day, theyre going to line up behind the president-elect. If the campaign estranged Kushner from the privileged world he once inhabited, the election represented a conclusive break. Some of the same Manhattan liberals who ostracized him during the campaign were rattled afterward, and they sent him emails, trying to offer healing words of congratulations and conciliation. These went right in the trash. Kushner is in no mood to offer comfort  not to this town. Hes going to Washington. *This article appears in the January 9, 2017, issue of New York Magazine."}, {"date": "2017/01/08", "title": "Former Iranian President Rafsanjani Has Died, a Blow to Irans Reformists", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/death-of-rafsanjani-deals-a-blow-to-irans-reformists.html", "text": " Former Iranian president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani has died of a heart attack at the age of 82, according to Iranian state media. A wealthy founding member of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the Shiite Muslim cleric was, for much of his life, one of the most powerful men in Iran, and though his power had waned in recent years, he had nonetheless become an influential voice for reform within Irans theocracy. His death thus represents a blow to Irans already-beleaguered moderates, and leaves current Iranian president Hassan Rouhani without a key ally ahead of this years presidential election. Like Rouhani, Rafsanjani was also an important supporter of rapprochement with the West, a still contentious issue inside Irans government that is sure to flare up because of this year election, as well as the likely more hawkish incoming policies of President-elect Donald Trump in the U.S. Rafsanjani was a close aide and advisor to Irans first supreme leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, as well as the top commander of the countrys armed forces during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. After helping end the war, he served as president from 1989 to 1997, a crucial and mostly productive period in the countrys post-revolution and post-war history. The pragmatic, opportunistic, and politically gifted Rafsanjani was also a power broker, and he was reportedly instrumental in selecting Khomeinis successor, Ayatollah Khamenei, as Irans second supreme leader  though, that backfired on Rafsanjani and the two allies later became rivals, diminishing Rafsanjanis power. In 2005, Rafsanjani sought the presidency once again, but was defeated by the populist Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, in part because Rafsanjani, at that point, was seen as one of the sources of Irans many problems, particularly corruption. Rafsanjani then redeemed himself in the eyes of many Iranians with his subsequent and prominent criticism of President Ahmadinejad, particularly following the disputed 2009 presidential election  at which point Rafsanjani supported the countrys Green Movement reformists, who suffered a brutal crackdown following mass protests against the election results. That public support made Rafsanjani both a target for the countrys conservatives as well as a key ally for the countrys more moderate reformists. He even called for the release of political prisoners and more political freedoms and progressive economic policies within the country. Khamenei and his conservative supporters subsequently stripped Rafsanjani of even more of his influence, and two of his children were jailed. Denied another chance at running for president in 2013 by Irans mostly hardline Guardian Council, Rafsanjani threw his support behind the like-minded Rouhani, who ultimately won in part because of that support. That victory, and the moderate alliance that made it possible, set in motion a chain of events which led to the landmark nuclear peace deal that Iran signed with the U.S. and other Western powers in 2015. Though Rafsanjani was one of the key architects of Irans nuclear program, he was a staunch supporter of the 2015 peace deal, as well as greater overall political and economic engagement with the West and Irans Arab neighbors. (Rouhanis above tweet, about Rafsanjanis death, reads: The soul of a giant man of revolution, politics, a symbol of patience and strength, has ascended to skies.) Irans hardliners are not the only critics of Rafsanjani, however, as some Iranians believe he had used his power and influence to enrich himself and his family members (he died a multimillionaire). In addition, and more troubling, Rafsanjani has also been accused of being involved in, or responsible for, the deaths of many liberals and dissidents both in and outside of Iran before and during his presidency. At the time of his death, Rafsanjani was nowhere near as powerful as he once was, but he did head Irans Expediency Council, which acts as an intermediary between Irans parliament and the Guardian Council. In addition, he was a member of the Assembly of Experts, which is responsible for appointing the countrys next supreme leader. Since Ayatollah Khamenei is 77 years old and rumored to be in poor health, the Assembly of Experts may soon play a key role in shaping Irans future, and its likely that Irans moderates had hoped Rafsanjani would once again wield considerable influence in that process. As analyst Farzan Sabet pointed out on Twitter, Rafsanjanis death also represents an important generational shift away from the Iranian leaders who came of age fighting against the Shah before the revolution, to those who grew up during or after. How that shift plays out in Iranian politics remains to be seen, but in the meantime, its likely that Irans hard-liners will be able to take advantage of Rafsanjanis sudden absence, both in regards to the future leadership of Iran and in the ongoing efforts for rapprochement with the West and Arab world. In addition, as Borzou Daragahi notes at Buzzfeed, Rafsanjanis death means that Rouhani is no longer just the president, but the de facto leader of Irans moderates and reformists, which could mean heading toward a new generation of moderate leaders, or  should he lose this years election  an enormous setback for those political forces in the country. Lastly, the lack of a key moderate voice like Rafsanjanis may become particularly important should President-elect Trump and Republican lawmakers soon pursue a more antagonistic foreign policy toward Iran  like cancelling President Obamas nuclear deal and/or passing new or renewed sanctions  and thats a shift which most analysts agree would further empower the more conservative elements of the Iranian regime."}, {"date": "2017/01/08", "title": "Truck Attack in Jerusalem Kills 4 Israeli Soldiers", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/truck-attack-in-jerusalem-kills-four-israeli-soldiers.html", "text": " Four Israeli officer cadets were killed and as many as 16 others injured after they were attacked by a Palestinian man driving a truck in Jerusalem on Sunday. Haaretz reports that the driver was shot and killed during the attack, which happened at a scenic overlook where a busload of Israeli soldiers on an educational tour had stopped to take in the view. The attacker plowed into the soldiers, then stopped, and reversed back through the group again, which is when he was shot and killed. Israeli police are calling the incident a terrorist attack, and while Israel is no stranger to vehicular-ramming attacks, national police chief Roni Alsheich said it was possible the assailant was motivated by the truck attack that killed 12 people at a Berlin Christmas market last month. That attack was the deadliest truck attack since 86 people were killed when a terrorist drove a 19-ton truck into a large crowd celebrating Frances Bastille Day in Nice last July. ISIS subsequently claimed responsibility for both of those attacks. Sundays assailant in Israel was reportedly a resident of Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem, and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the media later Sunday that all signs point to the attacker being a supporter of the Islamic State. Hamas did not claim responsibility for the attack but a spokesperson nonetheless celebrated it as heroic.

CNN discovered and documented more than 50 instances where Crowley, a former Fox News contributor and syndicated radio host and columnist, had lifted passages or phrases  some wholesale  from a variety of sources including Wikipedia, think-tank websites, and news articles and op-ed columns from numerous publications like the National Review, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, and many others.

Director Walter Shaub Jr. also emphasized his concern that Republicans are pushing forward with confirmation hearings for Trumps nominees before the appropriate paperwork has been completed, and thus before the OGE can confirm that the nominees have no financial, ethical, or criminal red flags. At present, Republican lawmakers expect to hold hearings on at least seven of Trumps cabinet picks within the next several days, which Shaub says has created undue pressure for the watchdog agency to rush through the vetting process, and thus leaves some nominees with potentially unknown or unresolved ethics issues shortly before their scheduled hearings. If that scenario indeed happens, it will be a first in the OGEs four-decade history, according to Shaub. In response to Shaubs letter to Senate Democrats, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused the GOP and Trump transition team of colluding to jam through the nominees and sidestep the law. Of continuing concern are the number of extraordinarily rich among Trumps nominees, a group which includes three billionaires and is set to become the wealthiest White House cabinet in history. The New York Times reports that some of Trumps picks are so rich that there arent enough boxes on the standard disclosure forms for them to list all their varied assets. Members of the executive branch are not allowed to use their positions to enrich themselves, which is why the OGE looks to identify potential conflicts of interest so they can be resolved before cabinet nominees are chosen or confirmed. (That federal law does not apply to the president or vice-president.) In addition to Shaubs letter, emails obtained by MSNBC through a Freedom of Information Request suggest that the OGE briefly lost contact with the Trump transition team after Trumps election in November. According to the communication records, the agency struggled to reach and get responses from the Trump team, the staffing of which was very much in flux at the time. Both MSNBC and Politico, who also reviewed the emails, note that much of the released communication was heavily redacted, and some messages may remain unreleased due to executive privilege  so the full picture of communication between the OGE and the Trump transition team remains unclear. Regardless, the OGE did offer advice to the Trump team on topics like the appropriate structure of a blind trust with regards to Trump divesting himself from the Trump Organization. They also suggested that the Trump transition team give them advance notice of cabinet picks so they could be vetted before making their nominations public. That appears to have happened in some cases, but not in others. The frustration over not being able to effectively communicate with Trump officials is also apparently one of the reasons the OGE posted a series of somewhat bizarre tweets in late November which seemed to encourage the idea of Trump divesting from his family business. The president-elect has yet to explain if and how he will separate himself from the Trump Organization, though he is supposed to announce those details next week."}, {"date": "2017/01/07", "title": "Racist or Not, Sessions Chose the Wrong Side in the Fight for Voting Rights", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/sessions-chose-the-wrong-side-in-the-fight-for-voting-rights.html", "text": " Most liberals look at the prospect of Jeff Sessions serving as attorney general and see a waking nightmare. Hes an extremist in a Republican Senate conference that already skews far right. He has been a leader in a backlash against Republican moderation on issues ranging from immigration to crime and drugs to civil liberties. And on voting rights, he embodies the latter-day conservative belief that the only threat to the franchise is its extension to include people previously excluded. That he was for quite a few months the only member of the Senate supporting Donald Trumps presidential candidacy doesnt help his reputation outside the GOP, either. And then theres what happened when Ronald Reagan tried to make Sessions, a former federal prosecutor in Alabama, a federal district-court judge in 1986. Four former colleagues testified in the Senate that Sessions had made racially insensitive remarks in their presence, and that he generally felt disdain for the Justice Departments role in protecting civil rights and voting rights. It was enough to make Sessions only the second proposed federal judge since the 1930s to be denied Senate confirmation, as two Republicans plus conservative Alabama Democrat Howell Heflin voted against him on the Judiciary Committee. Sessions made his alleged persecution by Senate liberals the foundation of a very successful political career in Alabama. And when he won a Senate seat in 1996, empowering him to join his former tormenters in the Upper Chamber, it represented either vindication or vengeance, depending on how you looked at it. All this background has unsurprisingly come back up as Sessions prepares to face the Judiciary Committee again, on January 10, this time as the proposed chief law-enforcement officer of the United States. But Republicans and conservative opinion leaders have made liberal horror over Sessions their main talking point in his defense. Hes a nice, kind man, they say, much respected in the Senate these days. And most of all, hes not a racist. Sessions supporters think it will be enough to count on Senate deference to a colleague and supply evidence of racial evenhandedness sufficient to clear the very low bar of establishing that the man doesnt have white robes in his closet. They may be right. But not satisfied with this relatively safe strategy, some conservatives have appropriated the Sessions confirmation cause into their broader effort to delegitimize anti-racism as an acceptable tactic in American politics. Characteristically, conservative firebrand (and African-American) Ken Blackwell has taken this tack to grotesque lengths in a Washington Times op-ed that compares Sessions to lynching victims. What can liberals do to counter this bizarre whitewashing campaign and give opponents of Sessionss confirmation a clearer and more compelling case? Deval Patrick may have provided a smart path. Patrick, who was an NAACP attorney before he became assistant attorney general for civil rights under Bill Clinton (and later a two-term governor of Massachusetts), has penned a letter to the Judiciary Committee that cuts through all the she-said-he-said about Sessionss subjective racial views and focuses on one objective aspect of the Alabamans record that ought to be disqualifying: his 1985 voter fraud prosecution of the Perry County Three, volunteer activists trying to help old and frail African-Americans vote in a jurisdiction near the voting-rights mecca of Selma. Sessions lost that case on trial, but as Patrick puts it, it should not have been tried at all, and illustrates a prosecutors use of his discretion in a bad cause brought maliciously. The basic point is that whatever Jeff Sessionss private feelings about race, he stood at the very epicenter of the voting-rights struggle, whose history he had every reason to understand intimately since it was all but in his back yard, and he placed the considerable resources of the federal government on the wrong (historically and morally, as well as legally) side. Perhaps you need to be a former prosecutor like Patrick to fully understand the incredible power to do good and evil that an attorney general has entirely within her or his control. But the fact remains that we have every reason to suspect Sessions will change the deployment of that power from a posture of protecting powerless victims of discrimination to pursuing them with the hounds of justice because hes done it before. Aside from civil rights and voting-rights causes, others traditionally within the protective arms of the Justice Department could suddenly find themselves staring down the barrel of prosecutorial hostility. These will include women seeking to assert their reproductive rights, LGBTQ folk fighting discrimination, nonviolent drug offenders seeking relief from long prison sentences, and undocumented immigrants who have otherwise played by the rules. I dont know that it would derail Sessionss confirmation if all his critics pounded away on this crucial point, but there is no question it would lift the discussions from murky and ultimately impossible-to-resolve questions about what Sessions believes in his heart of hearts. Beyond the focus of the case against Sessions, his opponents would be wise to counter the claim that they are bigoted against Southern white men by enlisting some well-known Southern white men who chose differently in the struggle for civil and voting rights. Indeed, if Bill Clinton is looking for a service to his country amidst the ashes of his wifes presidential candidacy, testimony before the Judiciary Committee about the situation in the South in the 1980s, when he was governor of Arkansas and Sessions was prosecuting voting-rights activists, might raise the visibility of the issue significantly."}, {"date": "2017/01/06", "title": "HRC for NYC?

After the nations top intelligence and law-enforcement officials presented Trump with their case for believing the Kremlin was responsible for hacking the email accounts of both the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, the president-elect released the following statement: Here, Trump acknowledges that Russia is among the many entities targeting Americas cyberinfrastructure, but declines to assign the nation culpability for any specific cyberattacks. He also insists that the various hacks of Democratic institutions had absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election  a claim that no human being who hasnt seen voting returns from an alternate universe could possibly know the veracity of. Regardless, Trump appears to be treating cybersecurity as a significant concern, at least rhetorically. And hes now acknowledging that hacking is a tool available to more powerful entities than 400-pound guys sitting in their beds. He still doesnt seem to have an appetite for punishing Russias alleged attempts to undermine our democracy (and/or get him elected). But he also resisted the temptation to praise Vladimir Putin or Julian Assange. So, count this one as a step toward normality. Shortly after the release of Trumps statement, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence published a declassified version of the CIA, FBI, and NSAs joint report on Russian interference in the 2016 elections. Still, the document isnt without its interesting tidbits. Apparently, Putin underestimated Trumps appeal in the Rust Belt. That report is much heavier on conclusions than it is on evidence. Ostensibly, the intelligence agencies are not comfortable disclosing precisely how they came to conclude that Russian operatives were behind the cyberattacks against the DNC and Clinton campaign. And the reports most explosive finding  that Russia initially intended its attacks to sow doubts about the legitimacy of American democracy, before developing an affinity for the candidate who was constantly praising Putin  has been on the public record for nearly a month now (and wasnt hard to intuit much earlier than that)."}, {"date": "2017/01/06", "title": "Tilikum, SeaWorlds Literal Killer Whale and Star of Blackfish, Is Dead", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/tilikum-seaworlds-literal-killer-whale-is-dead.html", "text": " Tilikum, the SeaWorld orca that killed three people  including his trainer, Dawn Brancheau in 2010  and also inspired a national crusade against the captivity of his species, is no more.

In a speech touting the bill, Nancy Pelosi argued that the atmosphere had prevented the public from understanding what the bill actually did, and expressed her hope that the vote would put an end to the fevered atmosphere and give away to a calm analysis of its actual impact: Conservatives made a part of the last sentence  we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it  famous, possibly the most famous line from the entire health-care debate. Conservatives turned that sentence fragment into an emblem for their claim that Obamacare was passed in the dead of night through a secretive, rushed, undemocratic process. They claim this even now. Just today, Andrew Ferguson attacks that he calls [t]he creepy, authoritarian manner in which the legislation was passed, and Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberley Strassel claims, Senior Democrats crafted ObamaCare in lobbyist-filled backrooms, forgoing hearings, markups, even input from their own colleaguesmuch less Republicans. This is a bizarre description of a bill that spent a year working through Congress, eventually passing numerous committees, two full House majority votes, one Senate supermajority vote and, in fact, many, many, many hearings. While the law did use a budget-reconciliation bill to enact minor fiscal adjustments, a maneuver that Republicans decried as akin to a death blow to the Republic, in fact its major provisions all received 60 votes in the Senate. The bill was evaluated by the independent Congressional Budget Office, and the projected premium levels in the new exchanges turned out to be accurate, and its predictions of overall federal health spending turned out to be too pessimistic, as the federal government is now spending less on health care with Obamacare than it was projected to spend without it. The bill was enacted in a democratic, deliberate, transparent, and excruciatingly slow fashion. But the claims that conservatives have falsely made about passing Obamacare provide a true description of the Republican plan to undo it. They are rushing through a bill to repeal it with maximal speed, and no public deliberation. That might be defensible if Republicans had promised the public that electing them would mean simple repeal and a restoration of the health-care system as it existed before 2010. The conservative health-care journalist Philip Klein laments that Republicans are having a tough time stating a simple truth, which goes something like this: We dont believe that it is the job of the federal government to guarantee that everybody has health insurance. A small-government conservative party with Kleins honesty would have made the case that they simply dont believe the federal government has a responsibility to assure access to medical care for all. The argument framed by Klein does describe the actual policy agenda of the Republican Party, which has worked for years to eliminate or minimize the governments commitment to expanding health coverage. But Republicans havent run on a promise anything like this. Instead, they have insisted since the outset of the debate that they, too, wanted reform. Donald Trump repeatedly promised that his health-care plan would take care of everybody. We dont want anyone who currently has insurance to not have insurance, says senior Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway. So how do they solve the problem? By promising that after Obamacare is repealed, and only then, they will show the country the wonderful system that will replace it. We have a plan to replace it. We have plenty of ideas to replace it. And youll see as the weeks and months unfold, what were talking about replacing it, promises Paul Ryan. Asked if his plan will cover everybody, Ryan demurs, Look, Im not going to get ahead of our committee process. Were just beginning to put this together. Ryan insists they have a plan, and also insists he cannot describe the plan because it is just beginning to take shape. The plan exists rhetorically for the purposes of assuring people there is a plan. But Ryan and his party are unwilling to produce anything that can be compared to the status quo. Republicans say you have to vote to wreck the status quo before they will tell you what comes next. That is why they are rushing a repeal bill through, without any hearings or deliberation, or public accountability about their plan. All the untrue things they said about the passage of Obamacare are true of the passage of their plan. After screaming about the use of a filibuster-evading reconciliation bill to pass minor changes to Obamacare, Republicans plan to use reconciliation for the entirety of their repeal. It is a naked abuse of the legislative process. You have to pass their bill to find out whats in it."}, {"date": "2017/01/06", "title": "Republicans May Not Have the Senate Votes to Repeal Obamacare", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/republicans-may-not-have-senate-votes-to-repeal-obamacare.html", "text": " Right after the election, there was a lot of tough talk among Republicans about getting rid of Obamacare once and for all as the first order of business in 2017. Then, as the political costs of throwing tens of millions of people out of health insurance became apparent, alongside the GOPs total disarray over what to put in Obamacares place, the repeal and delay strategy emerged based on a plan of quick action to zap the legacy initiative followed by a lengthy hiatus before its effective date. The idea was to get the political gratification of bringing down the Great White Whale of Obamacare but then to give beneficiaries and insurers considerable time (two years? three years? four years?) to adjust, and give themselves the time (and political space) to get their act together on a replacement plan, which would probably require Democratic votes in any event. But as January arrived, and the initial step of a budget resolution instructing the relevant committees to repeal Obamacare was unveiled, senatorial feet started dragging. Lamar Alexander, chairman of one of those committees, publicly complained that it might not be smart to repeal Obamacare without a replacement being ready. Rand Paul, coming at it from a different ideological perspective, said Republicans should have the guts to repeal Obamacare immediately and without a delayed effective date, whether or not a replacement was ready (Paul had separate but even more vociferous criticism of the budget blueprint that would enable Obamacare repeal, complaining that it would boost the national debt). Susan Collins and John McCain have been expressing concerns about leaping before looking ahead on health care. And now come two more dissenters, Tom Cotton, who says Republicans should not kick the can down the road for a year or two years in repealing and replacing Obamacare, and Bob Corker, who argues that [r]epeal and replacement should take place simultaneously. Thats six senators who may not fully be onboard the repeal-and-delay train. There are 52 GOP senators, and it will take 51 votes to enact the budget resolution (due to hit the Senate floor next week) that gets the ball rolling (50 will suffice once Mike Pence is sworn in as vice-president, but that wont happen for another two weeks). In other words, shockingly enough, Republicans may not have enough votes in the Senate to repeal Obamacare. Now, it is possible some or all of the unhappy GOP senators can be convinced to vote for the budget resolution that makes the Obamacare repeal possible in a filibuster-proof budget-reconciliation bill, on grounds that the repeal wont actually be put into place until the reconciliation bill itself is passed. And then GOP strategists can take their sweet time building support for a more specific repeal plan with effective dates and at least the glimmering idea of a replacement plan. I suggested yesterday, somewhat whimsically, that Republicans could even put off the reconciliation bill indefinitely, telling their supporters they had more or less already repealed Obamacare in the budget resolution, even though the budget resolution has zero effect on real life (other than perhaps spooking insurance companies and providers who rely on Obamacare funds) until it is implemented in a reconciliation bill. That delay and maybe repeal scenario is beginning to look more realistic every day."}, {"date": "2017/01/06", "title": "New Yorks Subway Stations Will All Have Cell-Phone Service by Monday", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/nycs-subway-stations-will-all-have-cell-service-by-monday.html", "text": " Clark Street station in Brooklyn will go online Monday, the last stop in New York City to get wireless and cell-phone service.

Initially, at least, the correct response to Whos gonna pay for the wall? wont be Mexico! but U.S. taxpayers! Several lawmakers and Trump transition officials said they are exploring a plan to begin funding the wall as soon as April, without passing any new legislation. According to the Washington Post, Republican lawmakers believe that the Secure Fence Act of 2006 already gives the president the authority to construct a border wall. The law signed by former President George W. Bush called for construction of at least 700 miles of physical barrier along the southern border. As Politico explains, the fence was never completed, and the secretary of Homeland Security can decide what kind of physical barrier should be constructed: Constructing an impenetrable physical wall, as it says on Trumps website, would cost billions of dollars. Congressional Republicans are considering tucking the initial funding for the project into a spending bill that must pass by April 28 to keep the government funded. That would set the stage for a government shutdown battle, but Republicans believe they could win the public-relations fight because the 2006 bill passed with support from Democrats  including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and then senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. Though most voters probably missed it, at one point Trump did explain that his plan for funding the wall was more nuanced than his catchphrase suggested. I said Mexico is paying for the wall, with the full understanding that the country of Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such a wall, okay? he said during an October 22 speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Were going to have the wall. Mexico is going to pay for the wall. Trump himself is seeming to have a hard time figuring out how this whole paying for the wall thing is going to work. Early Friday, he tweeted that the dishonest media does not report that any money spent building the Great Wall, will be paid back by Mexico. About an hour later, he amended that Tweet to clarify that the wall will be paid back by Mexico later. The plan being floated by Republicans in Congress would not preclude Trump from making Mexico pay for the wall eventually. Last spring, Trump said he would accomplish this by freezing money transfers from the United States to Mexico until our neighbors to the south agreed to fork over billions for the wall. Mexican president Enrique Pea Nieto said after meeting Trump in August that his country will not pay for the wall. After Trump surrogates suggested that he might construct a virtual wall, the candidate reiterated that he would build a concrete wall (the height kept shifting between 30 and 65 feet). Days after the election, the president-elect said, There could be some fencing, and it doesnt appear that GOP lawmakers are tied to constructing an actual wall all along the border. Theres already in existing law the authorization for hundreds of miles of build out on the southern border  so, one important step in the right direction will be funding the existing law and beginning the building out of hundreds of miles of wall, or fence, on the southern border, said House Republican Policy Committee Chairman Luke Messer. So Trumps campaign promise may need to be revised a little further: Were going to build big, ugly patchwork of concrete and fence along the border, and someday Mexico might pay for it.

Theyll Hate Its Replacement Even More.", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/gop-voters-hate-obamacare-theyll-hate-its-replacement-more.html", "text": " The sense of urgency Republicans feel about taking immediate steps to repeal Obamacare  even if those steps are initially symbolic, and plagued by the GOPs own confusion over what comes next  is in part a legitimate response to the belief that the voters most important to them really, really hate the Affordable Care Act. And there is abundant evidence the white working-class voters whose sudden tilt toward the GOP in Rust Belt battleground states rewarded Donald Trump with the presidency and helped Republicans hang on to Congress really do dislike the Affordable Care Act disproportionately. Heres the problem, though: What these key Trump voters most dislike about life under the Affordable Care Act will get even worse under any plausible GOP replacement plan. As the Kaiser Family Foundations Drew Altman reports in a New York Times op-ed, focus groups among Trump-voting Rust Belt white working-class voters who have obtained health insurance through Obamacare  i.e., those most familiar with the ACA  show a very consistent pattern: Heres what theyd rather have: The trouble is, of course, that keeping out-of-pocket costs high and letting market forces control drug prices are fundamental principles of conservative health-care policy, which have been reflected in every Republican health-care proposal for years. To conservative policy thinkers, overutilization of health services, encouraged by government subsidies and regulations (along with defensive medicine caused by consumer lawsuits), is the primary source of rising health-care prices and virtually every sin of the health-care system. So when Republican policymakers talk about personal responsibility being critical to heath reform, thats code for making sure Americans feel some pain every single time they access health services. The way you do that is by increasing exposure to out-of-pocket costs via premiums, deductibles, copays, and exposure to big bills if you dont strictly obey your insurance companys arcane rules. You can sugarcoat this a bit by offering a tax subsidy for personal savings so that you have more money for those out-of-pocket expenses; thats the basic point of the Health Savings Account idea, a feature of every conservative health-care proposal since time immemorial, and a particular favorite of Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Indeed, the goal many Republicans have long embraced is a system where everybody gets a high-deductible insurance policy covering catastrophic health conditions, with no insurance at all for routine services, which consumers would handle themselves with some help from an HSA. But if the KFF research is correct, its the routine services that Trumps white working-class base thinks they should have access to without emptying their wallets or being hassled by an insurance company. That is partly why so many of these people exhibit resentment toward Medicaid beneficiaries who dont have the same problems in obtaining routine services. Given the chance, of course, Republican pols would introduce personal responsibility requirements to Medicaid as well, as GOP governors like Mike Pence have shown in the deals theyve cut with the Obama administration to expand eligibility in exchange for generous new federal dollars. In the ideal GOP world, everyone would be paying more for routine services  even the very wealthy, who would have to shell out large premiums for concierge services to keep them from rubbing elbows with the hoi polloi in waiting rooms. So will white working-class Trump voters realize this conflict between their views and those of their party before an Obamacare replacement plan goes into effect? Nobody knows. But its not like they wont be paying attention. As Ron Brownstein notes, the savage antipathy these folks feel for Obamacare is based on an intimate familiarity with the law, because so many of them receive health insurance via the ACA: So if they lose insurance altogether or are forced into new health-insurance plans that double-down on the very features they hate about Obamacare, these key Trump voters will not be very happy. And Trump tweets about how terrific the post-Obamacare world of health-care policy has become wont help."}, {"date": "2017/01/06", "title": "Trump Preps for Briefing on Russian Hacking by Going After U.S. Intel Agencies", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-jabs-intel-agencies-before-briefing-on-russian-hacking.html", "text": " After Donald Trump was criticized for appearing to take WikiLeaks founder Julian Assanges word over that of U.S. intelligence agencies on allegations of Russian election meddling, he complained on Thursday morning that the dishonest media was drawing inappropriate conclusions from his confusing Twitter missives: This was interpreted as a sign that the president-elect was dialing back his criticism of U.S. intelligence agencies ahead of his Friday meeting with Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and the heads of the NSA, CIA, and FBI. But apparently the media got it wrong once again, as Trump went back to casting aspersions on the intelligence community after Clapper made his case before Congress on Thursday, and details leaked on the briefing delivered to Obama, which Trump will hear on Friday. During a Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday, Clapper said U.S. intelligence agencies now stand actually more resolutely behind the conclusions they reached last year that the Kremlins senior-most officials orchestrated a campaign to disrupt the U.S. election, and used information they collected from cyber-attacks on Democratic officials in an effort to help Trump. Clapper said that while the hacking has drawn the most attention, the campaign also involved spreading fake news. Whatever crack, fissure, they could find in our tapestry  they would exploit it, he said. As the New York Times notes, none of the Republicans involved in the hearing agreed with Trumps questioning of the intelligence agencies conclusion, though Senator Tom Cotton did criticize the imprecise language saying that Russia hacked the election. He also questioned the prevailing idea that Russian President Vladimir Putin preferred Trump over Hillary Clinton. Prompted by Cotton, Clapper confirmed that Russia did not change any vote tallies  but he said theres no way to know what effect their activities had on how people chose to cast their ballots. On Thursday evening, the Washington Post reported that the 50-page classified document being presented to Obama and Trump this week reveals that U.S. spy agencies intercepted communications in which Russian officials congratulated each other on Trumps win. The report is also said to detail how Russian entities handled the cyber attacks against the Democrats and the Republicans differently, and to identify actors who delivered stolen Democratic emails to WikiLeaks. NBC News explains in the report cited by Trump that an official agreed to discuss the contents of the briefing because they felt the Post report focused too much on the Russian celebration. While those communications bolster the assertion that the Russians aim shifted from undermining the U.S. election in general to helping Trump, the official said theyre viewed with caution because their meaning is subjective. According to the official, the report describes Russian attempts to hack the White House, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the State Department, and American corporations, in addition to the Democratic National Committee. Not all of those cyberattacks were successful. In two other tweets posted Thursday night, Trump referenced a BuzzFeed report that the Democratic National Committee delayed the FBI probe by refusing to give investigators access to their servers. The DNC said the FBI never asked for access to those servers. The president-elect jumped on a BuzzFeed report to stir doubt about U.S. intelligence agencies findings, though hes yet to receive their briefing on Russias activities.

With a net worth of $18 billion, he has more money than all the other billionaires on Trumps team put together. And in a transition marked by what seems to be a flagrant disregard for the appearance of conflicts of interest, Icahn also arguably belongs atop the list of Trump officials best situated for self-enrichment. Trump has tapped Icahn to reform the very agencies that are overseeing his investments, which are concentrated in sectors like energy, auto supplies, and mining. So far, that work includes helping to choose the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Environmental Protection Administration, as well as telling them which regulations need changing. Like Trump, Icahn has not announced any plans to sell his businesses to avoid conflicts of interest that might arise from his work for the administration. He apparently wont file tax returns or go through any sort of congressional vetting. In short, hes an unaccountable figure with great influence who at the very least seems philosophically committed to cutting regulations that will allow his own businesses to become more profitable  likely with significant environmental and market effects for the public. Icahn is already pressuring the FTC to roll back regulations on clean fuel. He could also push the SEC or the Federal Trade Commission to go easy on companies in which he has a stake, regarding pending mergers or other issues. He could even pressure the SEC to make it easier for players like him to take big stakes in companies without informing other market participants. The lack of any accountability is premised on the fact that Trump isnt formally hiring Icahn. It is one more example of what King Trump is doing, circumventing the rules, Richard Painter, the former chief ethics counsel to President George W. Bush, told New York. Painter, who has been critical of the Trump familys business conflicts, said it is unprecedented for a special adviser to the president to not be a government employee, even if he is not being paid and working only part-time, as is the case for Icahn. If he were called an employee, Icahn would have to sell his interests in any and all companies substantially affected by the regulations hes in charge of overhauling or be in violation of the law, according to the ethics expert. Icahn could also be required to file financial disclosures and wouldnt be allowed to trade on any inside information he might receive from the government as a result of his work. This is an end-run around criminal statutes, said Painter. As wealthy as Icahn is, its been a tough few years for him. Billed as a corporate raider in the 1980s and in this century recast in the slightly more genteel role of shareholder activist, Icahn runs an internal hedge fund that, by the end of September, had lost a third of its value since 2014, in large part owing to Icahns many soured energy bets. Icahn Enterprises is also hurting. Prior to the election, shares in the deeply indebted, junk-rated holding company had declined by almost two-thirds since peaking in December 2013. This summer, a UBS analyst said that Icahn Enterprises, which houses a dozen companies Icahn owns or controls, was substantially overvalued  trading at what critics estimated to be almost double its net asset value. The portfolio includes casinos, mines, refineries, and auto-related companies. Part of the Icahn Enterprises business model is to squeeze these companies to pay huge dividends to the parent, even when they are struggling. As a result of his troubled portfolio, Icahns personal wealth had fallen by almost $10 billion before the election, from a peak of $24.5 billion (as estimated by Forbes) in early 2014. Now hes on the rebound, profiting handsomely from Trump. Shares of Icahn Enterprises have jumped more than 25 percent since the election, 8 percent of it on the announcement of his new job. His worst performer is CVR Energy, a refinery that has been pummeled by EPA rules designed to promote renewable fuel. It gained about 20 percent since Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general who has sued the EPA several times, was named to head the agency, after Icahn vetted him. In an interview with Bloomberg, Icahn said he spoke to Pruitt four or five times before Trump tapped Pruitt to run the EPA. When it comes to EPA regulation, Icahn is particularly incensed about something he referred to in a recent interview as this goddamn RIN law. Refinery owners, including Icahn, have railed against RINs, or Renewable Identification Numbers, for years. RINs are tradable credits that refiners must buy to prove they have met the EPAs renewable-energy standards by blending their gasoline with plant-based fuels like ethanol, which is often done by gas stations, not the refiners themselves. Icahn and other refinery owners claim the rising price of RINs could put them out of business. Icahn owns 82 percent of CVR Energy, which has refineries in Oklahoma and Kansas. As Oklahomas attorney general, Pruitt also criticized the EPA-run program that created the market for RINs. Icahn told Bloomberg, Ive spoken to [Pruitt], and I do think he feels pretty strongly about the absurdity of these obligations, referring to the rules mandating that refiners buy RINs. Painter points out that all of this would be illegal if Icahn were officially a government employee. It would be a crime to participate in any conversations that have a direct impact on his financial holdings, said Painter. If in the course of interviewing someone for that job, he starts bringing that topic up and pushing for that regulation to be rescinded, at that point, thats a criminal offense if hes an employee. Icahn general counsel Jesse Lynn told New York that the mogul is well aware of his obligations under the law generally and with respect to 18 U.S.C.  208  the criminal conflict-of-interest statute prohibiting an executive-branch employee from participating personally and substantially in a government matter that will affect his own financial interests  and he will follow the law as he always has. Icahn will not do anything to trigger his status as a special government employee either, he said. Such employees are officers or employees who are retained, designated, appointed, or employed to perform temporary duties, with or without compensation, for not more than 130 days during any period of 365 consecutive days. Icahn also vetted candidates to oversee the SEC, which is investigating at least five companies in which he owns significant stakes. The SEC this year confirmed ongoing enforcement probes of Herbalife, Hertz, and Navistar, according to Probes Reporter, which tracks such investigations via FOIA requests. CVR Energy and Freeport McMoran, two other Icahn holdings, are also under investigation by the SEC, said Probes Reporter CEO John Gavin. On Wednesday, Trump said he plans to nominate Wall Street lawyer Jay Clayton as SEC chairman. As Painter puts it, letting Icahn choose the SEC chair is like letting one of the teams in the game pick the umpire. Its flat-out wrong. Regardless of Icahns official status, Painter thinks the investor should be selling his investments. The FTC is another agency whose actions directly affect Icahns pocketbook, but whose regulatory scheme he could nonetheless be reviewing. The FTC battled Icahn-controlled Herbalife for years before reaching a $200 million settlement, which requires the company to be overseen by an independent monitor for seven years. But critics worry that an Icahn-friendly FTC wont do anything to Herbalife if it breaks the terms of the deal, which prohibits payments for recruitment, the hallmark of a pyramid scheme. The FTC under Republicans long had a hands-off attitude toward multi-level marketers like Herbalife, notes Bill Keep, dean of the School of Business at The College of New Jersey and a prominent MLM critic. He fears that happening again. My concern is that the FTC will revert back to their 2011 stated position which was that any additional reporting from the MLM industry would outweigh the costs, he said, noting that the FTC came to the opposite conclusion with Herbalife and promised to apply its new standard industry-wide. Another of Icahns companies, American Railcar Industries, is already suing its regulator, the Federal Railroad Administration, which found that its tank cars were leaking and ordered that hundreds of them be tested. Soon, this will not be Icahns problem anymore: Last month he agreed to sell American Railcar to a Japanese bank for about $3.4 billion. I am proud to serve President-elect Trump as a special advisor on regulatory reform, Icahn said in the statement announcing his new role. Under President Obama, Americas business owners have been crippled by over $1 trillion in new regulations and over 750 billion hours dealing with paperwork. Its time to break free of excessive regulation and let our entrepreneurs do what they do best: create jobs and support communities. President-elect Trump is serious about helping American families, and regulatory reform will be a critical component of making America work again. In a CNBC interview the day after the announcement, Icahn tried to preempt any potential questions about conflicts. Its almost as ridiculous as saying, you know, Donald shouldnt talk to a Jamie Dimon or Brian Moynihan about bank regulation because they are CEO of a bank, he said, referring to the CEOs of JPMorgan and Bank of America. Its sort of a crazy issue. To suggest that there is something nefarious about him offering his opinions on regulations affecting the refining industry just because a portion of his large and diversified investment portfolio happens to be in that sector is  ludicrous, Icahns general counsel Lynn told New York. Jason Miller, the transition teams former communications director, who stepped down over Christmas weekend in the midst of an apparent sex scandal, said the administration will take steps to address any Icahns conflicts. Obviously, there are proper oversights and there will be plenty of transparency when it comes to how this all ultimately comes together, he told reporters in a media briefing following the announcement. Icahn was the first, and for a long time only, major Wall Streeter to back Trump, who suggested Icahn should be his Treasury secretary shortly after launching his campaign. Carl was with me from the beginning and with his being one of the worlds great businessmen, that was something I truly appreciated, said President-elect Trump in a statement announcing Icahns new role. His help on the strangling regulations that our country is faced with will be invaluable. Icahn said early on that he didnt want the Treasury job. Now hes accepted a role in the Trump administration that promises to be much more lucrative."}, {"date": "2017/01/05", "title": "Trumps D.C.

When the bar opened on September 12, its cheapest mixed drink was $16, Washingtonian food editor Jessica Sidman notes. By October, the drink was up to $20.

The menu has a handful of other cocktails between $24 and $29, along with $9 Bud Lights and $8 Coronas. The most expensive drink comes in at a whopping $100. The ghastly Benjamin, which sounds like a 10-year-olds idea of what rich people like, is a martini with three types of vodka, raw oysters, and caviar. Somehow, that monstrosity isnt even the most froufrou nonsense on this menu. That honor belongs to the flight of wines served by the crystal spoon, which cost as much as $140 an ounce. The scary thing is that the prices for all these absurdly expensive drinks may very well go up. Thats what theyve done since the place opened and Trump hasnt even paid all his bills yet.

That news was not a big surprise since the reconciliation bill last year that served as a trial run for this effort included the Planned Parenthood defunding alongside an Obamacare repeal. These two pet causes for conservatives were, after all, big enough that many of them were willing to shut down the federal government or risk a debt default to achieve both of them in recent years. But until Ryan spoke, it was not entirely a sure thing that the attack of Planned Parenthood had made the first cut as a congressional GOP target in the Trump Era. And you did have to wonder if Donald Trumps own famous flip-flopping over Planned Parenthood was causing problems behind the scenes, leading to pressure on Ryan to show his cards. Now that he has, the door could be wide open for Democrats to offer amendments to the budget resolution during the vote-a-rama in the Senate (a period of frantic back-to-back votes without debate on unlimited amendments that can happen on any budget resolution). Even if none of them pass, they will place Republican senators on the record with votes for or against protecting Obamas most popular provisions, and if the effort gets some attention, could convince congressional Republican leaders to leave some of said items alone. That wont happen with respect to Planned Parenthood, given the many votes Republicans have already cast to kill federal funding for the organization. But if Democrats are smart they will force their Republican colleagues to vote against womens health programs anyway."}, {"date": "2017/01/05", "title": "Trump Picks Dan Coats As Director of National Intelligence", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-picks-dan-coats-as-director-of-national-intelligence.html", "text": " Reports are flying all over Washington today that one of the final cabinet-level positions left open in the Trump administration, the position of director of national intelligence, will be filled by former Senator Dan Coats of Indiana. This is in many ways a safe pick (certainly safer than the flamboyantly mustachioed John Bolton, rumored to be in the mix for the job as well) for a potentially perilous position. Coats just left the Senate at the end of 2016, so his confirmation should be relatively easy. He has significant on-paper credentials, having recently served on the Senates intelligence committee. His international chops were presumably established by a stint as U.S. ambassador to Germany during the period between his temporary retirement from the Senate in 1998 and his return in 2010. And he was reportedly thought of highly enough in GOP national security circles that he was a candidate for secretary of Defense under George W. Bush before the fateful decision to go with Donald Rumsfeld. You have to figure that as a Hoosier he had the enthusiastic backing of the veep-elect. Its not clear exactly where Coats, or indeed anyone Trump might have named, comes down on what has suddenly become the defining challenge of his job: adjudicating strong differences of opinion between the CIA and the FBI, and between both agencies and the White House. Coats does have a reputation for having very good manners, which he will need. There are several potential negatives about Coats. Hes 73 years old, not the best age for launching a new career in managing vicious bureaucratic turf fights. Between Senate terms he spent some time as a Beltway lobbyist, which makes him a living symbol of Washingtons revolving-door syndrome a.k.a. the swamp Donald Trump was supposed to drain. And Coats likely made some permanent enemies back in the day by leading the opposition to Bill Clintons original proposal to allow gay folks to serve in the military. He remains a member of the shadowy conservative Christian organization, sometimes called The Fellowship or The Family, that sponsors the National Prayer Breakfast. One lucky thing for Coats: In a cabinet like Trumps, nobodys likely to even notice his personal wealth. His personal net worth as of 2014 was a paltry $12.3 million."}, {"date": "2017/01/05", "title": "Right-Wing Site Dangles Possibility that Hillary Clinton Might Run for NYC Mayor", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/right-wing-site-reports-hillary-might-run-for-nyc-mayor.html", "text": " After decades of despising Hillary Clinton, a certain obsessive segment of Americans find themselves in an unfamiliar position in 2017 the pantsuited boogeywoman who fed their fears for decades is nowhere to be found.

Shortly thereafter, the Sunshine States chief prosecutor decided that there were insufficient grounds to proceed with a probe of the moguls school. Last summer, the Associated Press revealed that Bondi had personally solicited a donation from Trump  around the same time that her office was debating whether to pursue an investigation of his university. At a 2015 GOP primary debate, Trump boasted of his talent for buying favors from politicians, explaining, When they call, I give. And you know what?

Two people enter the frame, severing the victims sleeve with a knife. That victim, who is bound and gagged, is the focus of the video as his attackers move in and out of the frame. They punch him and shout slurs  Fuck Donald Trump! Fuck white people!  as a woman comments, sometimes laughs, outside of view. At one point, someone takes the knife again and slices the victims scalp. (Warning: The video is very graphic.) The victim is an 18-year-old mentally disabled man from Crystal Lake, Illinois. Four people, two men and two women, have been arrested and charged in connection to his apparent torture, which Chicago Police superintendent Eddie Johnson called sickening. It makes you wonder what would make individuals treat somebody like that, he said at a press conference about the incident. Ive been a cop for 28 years and Ive seen things that you shouldnt see. It still amazes me how you still see things that you just shouldnt. Authorities announced Thursday that all four of the alleged attackers will be charged with hate crimes, along with aggravated kidnapping, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, and aggravated unlawful restraint, and residential burglary, reports the Chicago Tribune. Cops identified the accused as three 18-year-olds  Jordan Hill, Tesfaye Cooper, Brittany Covington; and one 24-year-old, Tanishia Covington. All were from the city of Chicago, except Hill, who was a classmate of the victim. (Hill was also charged with robbery and possession of a stolen vehicle.) Before formal charges were filed, authorities had publicly mulled hate-crime charges because the attackers, who appear to be black, shout racially charged invectives at their victim, who is white. Chicago Police commander Kevin Duffin said investigators were trying to determine how sincere the attackers were in their taunts, and were also considering the fact that the man may have been targeted because of his disability. Police discovered the video after spotting the victim, who has not been named, wandering around Tuesday the West Side of Chicago in shorts. His parents reported him missing Monday, after he disappeared after they dropped him off at McDonalds. The victim did know Hill from school; its not clear, exactly, how he connected with the group of four people. At some point Hill allegedly robbed a van in a Chicago suburb, before he and the victim ended up at a home on the West Side of Chicago, where the group tormented him and filmed the video. One of the alleged kidnappers texted the victims parents, saying that he was being held captive, according to the Chicago Tribune.

Today: Trumps media dodging, the fight over Obamacare, and Megyn Kellys move from Fox News to NBC. Last weekend, despite the U.S. intelligence community having already weighed in on Russian election interference, Donald Trump promised that he would reveal things that other people dont know by Tuesday or Wednesday. After tweeting some support for Julian Assange, it now looks like  just as with earlier promises to address his business conflicts and clarify Melanias immigration status  Trump will be delaying again. How much longer will he be able to outrun these questions?Id say about three more weeks. Of course hell always be able to outrun some questions. We are never going to see Trumps tax returns. We are never going to know the new First Ladys immigration history. (Or we wont unless and until someone in the federal bureaucracy is sufficiently provoked to leak.) But once hes in the White House, he will no longer be able to punt by making the empty promise that Ill get back to you by Tuesday on his plans to, say, address the next Hurricane Katrina or government shutdown or economic cataclysm or foreign threat. He actually will be held accountable by voters, including maybe even the minority of Americans who voted for him on Election Day. Bluffing wont do in a crisis, tweets wont do  only action will do. And it seems that he has no idea that producing concrete action in Washington is not as simple as picking up the phone and browbeating a frightened corporate wuss at Carrier, Boeing, or Ford to save a pittance of American jobs. But lets not forget the other issue here: Of all Trumps idle promises thus far, surely the most bizarre and potentially dangerous is his claim that he will reveal things that other people dont know about the hacking of the Democratic National Committee. Who told him these things? His national-security adviser, the world-class conspiracy-monger Mike Flynn? Rudy Giuliani? Steve Bannon? His marvelous personal physician? Most likely, Julian Assange and/or Vladimir Putin, both of whom Trump trusts more than Americas intelligence agencies. Its no secret that Americas intelligence agencies are quite fallible  in part thanks to a fiasco Trump cites, their imaginary sightings of WMDs in Saddam Husseins Iraq. But for their current findings to be dismissed so cavalierly and publicly breaks new ground for a president-elect. Trump essentially dismisses the intelligence services as incompetent liars  even accusing them of malevolently delaying a briefing this week, which they deny and for which he offers no proof. When George W. Bush disregarded an intel report in August 2001, that Al Qaeda planned an imminent attack on America, at least he listened to it before he rejected it, resumed his idyll on his Texas ranch, and let 9/11 unfold unimpeded. Trump is topping the disastrous Bush example by blowing off his own governments intelligence findings sight unseen in favor of those unidentified other sources telling him things. According to The Wall Street Journal, he will soon be manipulating the intel Establishment to conform with his own theories, just as Dick Cheney did. As was the case last time, this isnt going to end well for the country. It will be fascinating to see if John McCain, who always talks a good game of battling Trumps outrages only to wimp out when it counts most, really steps up to pursue the TrumpPutin axis as he has promised to do in the hearings that began today. House Republicans opened the new term on Capitol Hill with a secret vote to kill the Office of Congressional Ethics, only to walk it back the next day after thousands of phone calls from outraged constituents. What lessons can both sides take from this debacle as the fight over Obamacare heats up?The key element in this story is that it wasnt necessarily just outraged constituents who forced House Republicans to retreat. Trump as well may deserve modest credit for his condemnation of the GOP vote to castrate the ethics office. Trump could not care less about ethics enforcement, but even he recognized what a public-relations fiasco it was for a new Congress to make as its first priority the enhancement of its ability to sexually harass pages and gobble up pay-for-play special-interest money. The lessons of this opening-day debacle are several. First, its clear that Paul Ryan and his deputy, Kevin McCarthy, have scant control over their own caucus: Despite the fact that both leaders argued against the harebrained scheme to gut the ethics office in the dead of night, the vote among GOP House members was 119 to 74 to do so. Second, its clear that Trump and Trumps voters have more power than either the Republican Congress or its leadership: Hardly had the president-elect sounded off in a couple of bursts of 140 characters, then his partys caucus reversed itself completely, scrapping the scheme it had endorsed by a large majority only hours earlier. Third, this farce is potentially good news for Democrats. From all accounts, its clear that the Republican Congress is going to carry through on its plan to repeal Obamacare without having devised the essential legislative endgame, a replacement health-care plan through which, as Trump promised on 60 Minutes last year, everybodys going to be taken care of much better than theyre taken care of now. As Ive said before, lets see what happens when Obamacare unravels for some 22 million clients, many of them Trump voters in red states, and the GOP has to plead for patience while Congress tries (and likely fails) to get its act together. As we saw this week, the ensuing chaos may resemble the Marx Brothers Duck Soup, but with more tears than laughter. Megyn Kelly announced a move from Fox News to NBC, raising questions about the direction of Fox News and Kellys ability to connect with a broader audience. Will NBC also have to change for her to succeed there?Fox News, now fully behind Trump, will not miss Megyn Kelly. Foxs real fears in terms of losing audience should be directed at competitors from its right, including the expanding alt-right media universe of Breitbart. Even by cable-news standards, Foxs audience is exceptionally elderly, and ripe for a challenge from an angry new generation of media-savvy conservative bomb-throwers. What Kelly adds to NBC, meanwhile, is unclear. She is a celebrity, and the author of a best-selling book celebrating her celebrityhood. But if anyone can cite a news story shes broken or an interview that was a must-see, please raise your hand. She is mainly famous for taking on powerful Republican men: Karl Rove (whom she humiliated on camera for his fantasy sightings of a Romney victory on Election Night 2012); the alleged sexual predator Roger Ailes (whose fate was sealed when she added her voice to the chorus of complaints from the female work force at Fox News); fellow Fox star Bill OReilly, whose rating supremacy she threatened; and, needless to say, Trump. How she can stretch this admirable niche into what NBC has promised her, a daily daytime show and a new prime-time program to compete with 60 Minutes on Sunday night, is a mystery. Her one attempt to show a wider, broadcast-network range  a Fox prime-time special where she interviewed a Barbara Waltersesque smorgasbord of Trump, Robert Shapiro, and Laverne Cox  was an awkward bore that drew so-what reviews and a small audience despite the come-on of another round with her No. 1 nemesis. Nor does NBC need her to woo the right. Matt Lauer did a good job of that during the campaign. The Morning Joe hosts are now so associated with carrying water for Trump that Joe Scarborough was moved to write an angry column this week defending his appearance at Trumps New Years Eve bash at Mar-a-Lago, where prominent revelers included the Gambino familylinked mobster (and convicted felon) Joseph Cinque. (The Washington Post media critic Margaret Sullivans takedown of Scarborough on this matter makes for hilarious reading.) For those who care about network news antics, the Kelly move does at least add a new sideshow to follow: the fate of Greta Van Susteren, the former Fox News anchor who is repeatedly rumored to be on a path to land at MSNBC. Van Susteren was conspicuous in defending Roger Ailes right until she left Fox; she disparaged the most prominent anti-Ailes whistleblower, Gretchen Carlson, as a disgruntled former employee. Hard to picture Kelly cheerleading for Van Susteren to now join her as a colleague at NBC News  though an on-camera reunion for the two of them might make for more entertaining television than Kelly doing sloppy-seconds interviews with various Kardashians and the replacement cast of Hamilton."}, {"date": "2017/01/05", "title": "The GOP Just Gave Congress the Power to Cut the Pay of Individual Civil Servants", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/congress-can-now-cut-the-pay-of-individual-civil-servants.html", "text": " This week, congressional Republicans gave themselves the power to slash the annual salary of any individual federal worker to as low as $1  and the budget of any individual federal program right down to zero. They executed this attack on the independence of the civil service by reviving an obscure provision enacted by Congress in 1876: The Holman Rule, named after the Indiana congressman who devised it, empowers any member of Congress to submit an amendment to an appropriations bill that targets the funding of a specific government program or employee. The rule was devised before the advent of a nonpolitical, career civil service and was rarely invoked in the modern era. In 1983, Democratic speaker Tip ONeill laid it to rest. For the past three decades, Congress has had the power to slash any agencys overall budget, but not to target specific projects or civil servants for funding cuts or downsizing. Until now. This is a big rule change inside there that allows people to get at places they hadnt before, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters this week. All agencies should be held accountable and tested in a manner and this is an avenue to allow them to do it. This big change flew under the radar when it was enacted Tuesday, as congressional Republicans (quickly forfeited) attempt to gut the House ethics office sucked up all available media attention. But the Holman Rule could prove more consequential, particularly if the GOP proves eager to deploy its new weapon. Virginia congressman H. Morgan Griffith led the charge for reviving the Holman Rule, after learning about how much the federal government spends on the upkeep of wild horses ($80 million, apparently). When the Washington Post asked Griffith if the new rule would be used to cut huge swaths of the federal workforce, he replied, I cant tell you it wont happen  The power is there. But isnt that appropriate? Who runs this country, the people of the United States or the people on the peoples payroll? Here, Griffith elides the fact that those on the peoples payroll do not pursue programs born of their own individual whims, but rather, work to execute and enforce laws passed by the peoples duly elected representatives. (The House GOP may not approve of the Clean Air Act, but the Environmental Protection Agency does not undermine democracy when it works to enforce existing law.) The rule appears most disconcerting when viewed in the context of the incoming administrations apparent hostility toward the independence of the civil service. Last month, Trumps transition team sent the Department of Energy a questionnaire, which asked agency officials to list the names of employees and contractors who had attended any United Nations climate conferences in the last five years, worked on domestic efforts to limit carbon emissions, or attended any Interagency Working Group meetings to design the measurement known as the social cost of carbon, a metric often used by the Obama White House to justify its regulations of carbon output. The team also requested a list of which programs within DOE are essential to meeting the goals of President Obamas Climate Action Plan. Trump eventually disavowed that questionnaire. But he has also named a series of cabinet nominees who are staunchly opposed to the missions of the departments theyre supposed to lead: The president-elects Labor Secretarydesignate is a fast-food executive whose restaurants are serial violators of labor law; his EPA head is an ally of the oil industry who loves to sue the EPA; his head of Housing and Urban Development has called the Fair Housing Act communist. If confirmed, these selections are bound to create tensions between the agency leadership and the career civil servants whove been tasked with executing laws that Republicans disapprove of, but which they lack the time, political will, and/or Senate votes to repeal. But now, any civil servant whose climate research doesnt produce the findings Scott Pruitt wants to see will, ostensibly, be at risk of having his or her job eliminated. For the next year, passing an amendment slashing an individual workers salary or position will require a simple majority in both houses of Congress. (In deference to intra-party opponents of the rule, Republicans have given it a 12-month expiration date.) While present reporting suggests that House Republicans revived the Holman Rule on their own initiative, the move is of a piece with advice that Chris Christie provided to Donald Trump last summer. In a recording obtained by Reuters, New Jerseys giant reservoir of schadenfreude told a group of Republican donors that he had instructed Trump to immediately ask the Republican Congress to change the civil service laws. Because if they do, it will make it a lot easier to fire Obama appointees. It remains unclear how aggressively Republicans will use the Holman Rule, which inspired some opposition within their own ranks. But the mere existence of the provision may be enough to advance its animating goal: The combination of the Holman Rule, hostile agency heads, rhetorical intimidation from the president-elect, and the Trump administrations reported proposals for reforming the civil service  among them, an end to automatic raises and cuts to pension benefits  could very well inspire many conscientious, left-leaning bureaucrats to self-deport from the public sector."}, {"date": "2017/01/05", "title": "Rupert Murdoch Is Turning Fox News Into Trump TV", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/rupert-murdoch-is-turning-fox-news-into-trump-tv.html", "text": " Rupert Murdoch moved swiftly and unexpectedly to fill the void opened up by Megyn Kellys departure for NBC. Thursday morning, Fox News announced Tucker Carlson is taking over Kellys 9 p.m. slot. Carlsons ascension to prime time is significant in several ways, the most crucial being this: Its another sign that Murdoch is pushing Fox News in a more pro-Trump direction. Carlsons promotion stunned many inside Fox, according to sources. In the hours after Kelly announced Tuesday morning that she was leaving for NBC, senior Fox executives were led to believe the network would take time to fill her slot. There will be a lot of experimenting, one insider told me yesterday. The leading internal candidates were thought to be women. Since Foxs launch, in 1996, a female anchor has held a prime-time position. This morning, Fox co-president Bill Shine called Carlson to give him the news, a source said. Murdoch had personally made the decision to promote Carlson, two senior Fox staffers said. Murdoch is a big Carlson fan, according to sources. This fall, he invited Carlson to lunch at his Madison Square Park penthouse and personally offered him the 7 p.m. show when Greta Van Susteren left the network. Since then, Carlsons show has been a ratings success, posting double-digit gains (in recent weeks Carlsons 7 p.m. show beat Megyn Kellys at 9). Perhaps as important, Carlson has a good relationship with Trump, and his show has been broadly in line with the Trumpian wing of the GOP. Whereas Kelly was all but blacklisted by Trump, Carlson scored more than a dozen interviews with Trump during the campaign. In recent weeks, his show has been sympathetic to Trumps skepticism about the intelligence communitys claims that Russia hacked the DNC and intentionally meddled in the election. Getting 9 p.m. right is crucial for Fox. According to one network insider, Kellys show generated more advertising revenue than Bill OReilly or Sean Hannity. (Veteran Fox anchor Martha MacCallum is taking over at 7 p.m.) Carlsons promotion is one sign of just how much Murdoch wants to appease Trump, Fox insiders say. Murdoch has been intent on forging a tight relationship with Trump since his victory, sources close to both men tell me. One longtime Murdoch confidante told me the two speak by phone at least three times per week. As I reported Tuesday, at Mar-a-Lago over the holidays Trump criticized Roger Ailes and lavished praise on Murdoch. And Murdoch has told Fox executives that Trump asked him to submit names for FCC commissioner. (A Trump spokesperson denied that.) Murdoch has allowed Sean Hannity to turn his 10 p.m. show into de facto infomercials for Trump. People close to Murdoch are surprised by how fast Fox has fallen into line with the Trump administration. This morning, Bill Kristol, a longtime Fox contributor, criticized Hannitys fawning interview with Julian Assange. Im old enough to remember when Fox News was pro-American soldier not pro-anti-American leaker, Kristol tweeted. During the GOP primary, Murdoch veered from neutral to openly hostile to Trumps candidacy. One Murdoch associate told me that over the years Murdoch spoke of Trump as a buffoon. Murdoch was also turned off by Trumps anti-immigration rhetoric. But in the general election, Murdoch came around to backing Trump (after a dtente brokered by Trumps son-in-law, Jared Kushner). Now he seems intent on turning up Foxs support to a new level. Murdochs reversal, the associate said, can partly be explained by Murdochs longtime desire to have a relationship with an American president. Murdoch has met every occupant of the Oval Office since Nixon, but has never had a personal connection with one. The 85-year-old Murdoch may see Trump as his last chance."}, {"date": "2017/01/05", "title": "The Debate Over Whether Trumps False Statements Are Lies Is a Red Herring", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/the-debate-over-trump-lies-is-a-distraction.html", "text": " Last weekend, Wall Street Journal editor-in-chief Gerard Baker sparked a good-sized media uproar with some remarks he made on Meet the Press. Discussing Donald Trumps propensity to say things that arent true, he told Chuck Todd, Id be careful about using the word lie. Lie implies much more than just saying something thats false. It implies a deliberate intent to mislead. He explained that he viewed the best strategy as to present the facts in a straightforward manner so readers could say, as he put it, This is what Donald Trump says. This is what a reliable, trustworthy news organization reports. Many liberal commentators and readers interpreted Bakers response as a call for he-said-she-said journalism, such as a ThinkProgress take which argued that Editor of nations second-biggest newspaper says he will not report Trump lies, even if he lies. Naturally, the outrage spilled onto Twitter and Facebook as well, with many pundits and journalists  most notably Dan Rather  accusing Baker of telegraphing plans for the nations largest paper to enable Trumpian deception for the next four years. That isnt what Baker is arguing for, though. In fact, hes right  journalists shouldnt reach too quickly for the L-word to describe Trumps endless false statements. More broadly, the argument over whether they should is a giant red herring that has nothing to do with the grave responsibility borne by the media during the Trump era. Yesterday, Baker laid out his argument a bit more fully in a column in his paper. He pointed out that Mr. Trump has a record of saying things that are, as far as the available evidence tells us, untruthful: thousands of Muslims celebrating 9/11 on the rooftops of New Jersey, millions of votes cast illegally in the presidential election, President Obamas supposed foreign birth. We can also point out that the circumstances are such that its reasonable to infer that Mr. Trump should know that these statements are untrue. But theres a difference between doing so, he argues, and calling these statements lies: This is correct, and its correctness stems from the simple point that evaluating a statements truth value is different from, and simpler than, evaluating whether the speaker knowingly lied. If I come up to you and tell you Countless Muslims are streaming across the Mexican border as part of a giant terrorist plot, it wont be hard for you to determine, upon fair review of the evidence, that this is a crazy, crazy belief that no one who calls himself a journalist should spread (let alone someone in a position of real power). But am I lying about it? Thats a lot more complicated. Even if you can point me to evidence debunking the claim and I discount that evidence, well, a lot of people arent particularly good at evaluating evidence. We live in a country where staggering numbers of people believe evolution and climate change are hoaxes, and, yes, that almost-exPresident Barack Obama wasnt born in the U.S. This isnt to let actual liars off the hook, but simply to point out that many people genuinely believe false things. Trump is a particularly complicated case for journalists because of the sheer, unbelievable volume of false things that come out of his mouth, and because he has enthusiastically peddled some of those falsehoods, including the Obama birther allegations, for years and years. I myself have written about his propensity for lying. But that was a judgment call; I was happy to make it but would be very leery about leveling judgment against journalists who interpreted things differently  as long as they werent hesitant to assertively point out that false statements made by Trump were false. In other words, aggressive fact-checking can exist regardless of whether or not the fact-checker chooses to then ascribe intent to the utterer of false claims. The Chuck Todd question that sparked Bakers controversial statements conflated the two issues: [P]eople always say, Youve got to fact-check, youve got to fact-check, he said to Baker. There isnt an agreement on what the facts are. And this is yet another challenge for you and everybody here. Do you feel comfortable saying so-and-so lied? You know, if somebody says just an outright falsehood, do you say the word, lie? Is that important to start putting in reporting, or not? In the first half of the quote, Todd is talking about fact-checking; in the second half, hes talking about ascribing intent. Those are two different things. In his column, Baker defended himself in part by pointing to The Wall Street Journals coverage of Trumps false claim that millions of illegal voters juiced Clintons victory in California. The subhed of that piece reads President-elect offers no evidence of claim that he otherwise would have won the popular vote, and the third graf reads Voting is restricted to U.S. citizens, and no evidence has emerged so far of widespread voting by illegal immigrants. In other words, the Journal more or less did what it should: It called out a false statement from Trump. And this seems well in line with Bakers much-ridiculed argument for presenting readers with This is what Donald Trump says. This is what a reliable, trustworthy news organization reports. Was Trump lying when he said that millions of voters voted illegally? Who knows? Such rumors had been percolating through the gonzo fake-news networks where we know he gets a terrifying amount of his information. Maybe he believes them, maybe he doesnt. We can argue all day about what is going on in the extremely unusual and conspiratorial brain of Donald Trump at the precise moment he says something that is false. It just feels like to do so is to miss the point  reasonable people can differ on unanswerable questions about epistemology and psychology. As long as journalists plainly state that false claims he makes are false, we are doing our jobs."}, {"date": "2017/01/05", "title": "China Warns Trump About Its Big Sticks", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/china-warns-trump-about-its-big-sticks.html", "text": " Chinese state media issued a warning to Donald Trump on Thursday in response to his choice of fierce China critic Robert Lighthizer to serve as chief trade negotiator.

Along with Lighthizer, Trump has tapped Peter Navarro to lead the newly created White House National Trade Council and Wilbur Ross to serve as Commerce Secretary. Both have taken hard line against Chinas questionable trade practices, as they wrote in a double-bylined column last July. Lighthizer falls right in line with Navarro and Ross. A veteran of the Reagan administration, Lighthizer won praise from Trump for fighting Japanese imports in the 80s. Since then, hes turned his attention to China. In 2010 congressional testimony, Lighthizer argued that the U.S. trade deficit with China is a major threat to our economy and lawmakers should take a much more aggressive approach in dealing with China.

The revelation came when the Senate Majority Leader was asked to comment on the prospect of Democrats blocking Donald Trumps Supreme Court pick. When McConnell stepped up to the microphone, it had been less than 24 hours since Merrick Garlands Supreme Court nomination had expired after a record-setting 293 days of Republican obstruction. But McConnell appeared to have no recollection of this fact. I think thats something the American people simply will not tolerate, he said, referring to any Democratic effort to prevent the confirmation of a new justice. Well be looking forward to receiving a Supreme Court nomination and moving forward on it. As of this writing, the exact malady affecting the Senate Majority Leaders temporal lobe remains unknown. But the fact that McConnell could not recall a 42-week-long Supreme Court blockade  that he himself had masterminded  testifies to the severity of his condition. And there is no doubt that McConnells memory has, in fact, failed him. For not only did the American people tolerate his unprecedented act of obstruction  they rewarded his party with control of the presidency and both houses of Congress. Whats more, McConnells blockade was far more radical than that which Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is currently proposing: McConnell refused to dignify president Obamas high-court nominee with hearings; Schumer has merely suggested that Democrats would resist the confirmation of a pick who was on the right wing of American judicial opinion. There is simply no credible explanation for McConnells behavior other than cognitive impairment. To make those remarks  in full awareness of his own recent conduct  the Majority Leader would have to be a mendacious cynic who boasts no higher principle than the will to power, and no stronger feeling for the American people than contempt for their intelligence.

Trumps insinuation that his fans will ignore any evidence of his guilt, however plain, has been vindicated. Perhaps no episode has demonstrated the Fifth Avenue Principle more dramatically than the case of the Russian email hack. The very firm conclusion by 19 U.S. intelligence agencies that it was Russia that carried out the email hacks of Democratic emails, as well as the conclusion by both the CIA and the FBI that it did so in order to benefit Trump (a candidate it had openly touted for months) is inconvenient for Trump. We dont and cant know whether Russian hacking tipped the balance of the election, but its possible to believe it did; the election was extremely close, and the emails, while substantively minor, fed into the narratives of embittered Bernie Sanders supporters and generated more news stories with Clinton and emails in their headlines. Trump has thus set out to convince his supporters that Russia did not conduct the hacks. To this end, Trump has employed many of the same techniques he used to attract attention to the cause of disputing President Obamas citizenship. He has exploited popular distrust of institutions, portraying their documentation and conclusions to be suspicious, and promised that he alone either has obtained the real facts, or will soon get to the bottom of them. He has supplied his fans with plausible-sounding alternative suspects  the Chinese, a morbidly obese man, teenage boys  or attributed the issue to the general complications entailed by computers. On December 31, he declared, I also know things that other people dont know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation, and pledged to reveal his secret information on Tuesday or Wednesday. Wednesday came and went without the promised reveal. Trump meanwhile insisted, The Intelligence briefing on so-called Russian hacking was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange! Intelligence agencies deny that they ever delayed a briefing. But whats remarkable about this is not that Trump misstated the facts, but that he presented an alleged delay in the intelligence briefing as evidence that intelligence cant be trusted at the very same time Trump himself had failed to present the briefing he promised the public. The preposterousness of his reasoning is what made it such a perfect example of the Fifth Avenue Principle. Trump wasnt nitpicking some technical aspect of the intelligence case against Russia; he was dismissing the intelligence by falsely claiming its supporters were doing the very thing Trump was in fact doing before our eyes. Trump cited the authority of Julian Assange, who declared that the hacking might have been undertaken by a 14-year-old. For an ordinary politician, this case might have been slightly awkward, since Trump had previously called WikiLeaks disgraceful and called for the organization to receive the death penalty. The simple about-face produced no embarrassment among his supporters. Here are Sean Hannity, Sarah Palin, and Ann Coulter in 2010 lacerating Assange as a virtual terrorist, and mocking the Obama administrations pathetic weakness in failing to bring these enemies to justice: Now Palin is apologizing for ever having doubted Assange. Coulter is citing Assange as a trustworthy source, and calling for him not to be jailed but honored: On and on have conservatives followed in line. Newt Gingrich, who once called Assange an enemy combatant, now praises him as a down to Earth, straight forward interviewee. Right, Assange is just a regular, down-to-earth guy-next-door type, if you happen to live next to the Ecuadorian embassy, and your neighbor is a fugitive hacktivist libertarian with a history of rape allegations and a strange fondness for Vladimir Putin. He probably drives a pickup truck and enjoys NASCAR. Assange turns out to be interchangeably useful in conservative discourse as either an enemy whose continued survival proves Obamas weakness or as a trusted source whose testimony proves Obamas dishonesty. Hannitys logic is straightforward: Assange is taking a position opposite Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, and is therefore to be trusted: Trump made his comment about shooting somebody on Fifth Avenue during the primary, a time when he faced fierce opposition from within his party. Since then, the incentives for conservatives to oppose him have weakened, and the incentives to support his ravings, or to redirect any dissent against his liberal opponents, have grown enormously. Trumps bizarre lies about Russia and Assange are designed not only to defend the legitimacy of his election but also to prove, once again, that his control over the supple minds of the conservative base is total."}, {"date": "2017/01/05", "title": "New York Citys Second-Worst Airport Might Also Get an Upgrade", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/nycs-second-worst-airport-might-also-get-an-upgrade.html", "text": " Governor Andrew Cuomo has already vowed to bring La Guardia into the first world, and now hes going after New Yorks other airport nightmare, JFK International, with a multi-billion-dollar redevelopment plan.

This occurs to distinguished congressional expert Sarah Binder deep in an interview with Voxs Sarah Kliff about how the whole deal might go down. What Binder is referring to is the first vote in the congressional budget process, the budget resolution, which is necessary but not sufficient for an Obamacare repeal. Its an internal congressional device (which is why it does not require the presidents signature) that sets out broad and vague budget targets. It also instructs the relevant committees to draft reconciliation legislation  the second and legally binding step in the budget process that implements the resolution  in this case, by actually repealing the portions of the Affordable Care Act that can pass the test of being germane to the federal budget (such as purchasing subsidies, Medicaid super-matches to finance the expansion in states that pursued it, tax penalties to enforce the purchasing mandate, subsidies to insurers and providers so they dont go broke, tax provisions to pay for it all, etc.). But with both sides describing the votes on the budget resolution as about Obamacare repeal, and with a necessary time lapse as committees prepare the reconciliation bill, which is where a lot of the really tough decisions will have to be made (most especially the effective date for the various repeal measures that will affect real people in a terrible way), you have to figure there will be a strong temptation to just delay, delay, delay taking up the reconciliation bill. Mitch McConnell said just yesterday, Were going to move forward with the Obamacare repeal resolution first and well take the second step a little bit later. How much later is later? Once other issues have grabbed the limelight and the attention of Congress, as they well may (theres a debt-limit crisis looming in the spring), whos going to rush back into an Obamacare crisis? Indeed, if Republicans decide they prefer not to actually change anything, at least until they have an Obamacare replacement plan, whos going to call them out? Probably not Democrats, who would be fine, if a bit chagrined, by an Obamacare repeal that does not actually repeal Obamacare. What would happen next if congressional Republicans actually did just indefinitely put off the moment of decision on repealing Obamacare? Quite literally nothing from a legal point of view, though the problems everyone has been anticipating about insurance companies bailing from Obamacares insurance exchanges once repeal had been signaled might emerge even without an actual policy change. Beyond that possibility, nobody would lose their coverage right away. The key question is whether conservative activists would be at least momentarily satisfied with symbolism, and whether the big guy in the White House goes along with the ruse. The fact remains that the repeal and delay strategy Republicans have been pursuing is a nest of hornets, and as my colleague Jonathan Chait points out, not one that Republicans may ever escape. So why not repeal and delay even as Republicans high-five each other in an imaginary end zone for their imaginary touchdown in voting to repeal Obamacare? Crazier things have happened, and probably will continue to happen in the post-factual Trump Era."}, {"date": "2017/01/05", "title": "Trump Talks to Head of Sad!

Born the humble son of a Yale-educated Goldman Sachs banker, Mnuchin grew up to become a Yale-educated Goldman Sachs banker. After 17 years at that firm, Trumps treasury pick left for bigger things  among them, a hedge fund named after the sand dunes outside his house in the Hamptons, a stint running a bank that specialized in foreclosures, and a key role in the Trump campaign, as the GOP candidates chief fundraiser. Mnuchin has publicly suggested that he took that last gig specifically because he knew that if he provided Trump with campaign cash, he would likely receive in a cabinet-level appointment, as recompense. So, the words most likely to drain the swamp are never going to appear beneath Steve Mnuchins picture. But as Trump has made clear, being the mega-rich son of a millionaire in no way disqualifies one from voice of the working man status. In fact, many voters see exorbitant wealth as a sign of incorruptibility  after all, why would a multimillionaire ever bother stealing chump change from the public till? (Estimates of Mnuchins net worth vary, but Vanity Fairs William Cohan has pegged Trumps treasury pick as a billionaire). But if Mnuchins wealth isnt politically toxic, the details of how he amassed it still might be. In 2009, Mnuchin and a few of his billionaire associates bought the California bank IndyMac, which had collapsed under the weight of its reckless mortgage lending. Their purchase was made on the condition that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation would compensate the newly named OneWest Bank for future losses above a certain threshold. With the risks of his investment partially socialized, Mnuchin proceeded to capitalize on the venture. Under his leadership, OneWest foreclosed on tens of thousands of homeowners and sold their houses at auction.* Mnuchin and his partners sold OneWest for an estimated profit of $1.5 billion in 2015. Mnuchin personally garnered more than $200 million from the sale, according to Bloomberg News. But hey: Profiting from the financial misfortune of others isnt illegal  its practically the American dream! And when borrowers cant make their mortgage payments, banks have no choice but to foreclose on their properties. Dont hate the banker, hate the game (which Trump will de-rig, the first chance he gets). If no laws were broken, Elizabeth Warren must stop crowin. But this line of defense took a hit Tuesday, when the Intercept obtained a memo from the California attorney generals office, which suggests that OneWest repeatedly violated state laws amid its frenzy of foreclosures. The memo  which was drafted by the California AGs Consumer Law Section, following a yearlong investigation  alleges that OneWest was guilty of widespread acts of misconduct, including illegally backdating documents to expedite the foreclosure process and, essentially, gaming foreclosure auctions. These and related actions harmed homeowners by denying them timely and important information about their foreclosures and potentially shortening the amount of time they had available to find a way to become current on their mortgage obligations, the memo claims. The memo also alleges that OneWest obstructed the investigation itself, by ordering third parties to ignore state subpoenas. The investigators recommended that thenAttorney General  and current Democratic senator  Kamala Harris file a civil-enforcement action against Mnuchins bank, with the aim of securing injunctive relief and collecting millions in financial penalties. But Harris declined to pursue the case without offering an explanation of her reasoning, according to the Intercept. This memo is meritless, Mnuchin spokesman Barney Keller told CNBC.com. OneWest was the only bank in the country to complete the grueling independent foreclosure review by the OCC and received the top rating from government regulators for compliance. Steven Mnuchin and OneWest managed to issue over 100,000 loan modifications including thousands that reduced borrower principal, on loans that he did not even originate. Memos like this belong in the garbage, not the news. Notably, OneWest has admitted to mishandling documents in the past. In a deposition from July 2009, one of the companys vice-presidents confessed to robo-signing 6,000 foreclosure-related documents per week, a pace that would have made it impossible for her to verify the accuracy of all relevant information in each case. The companys affinity for cutting corners in the foreclosure process forced it into a consent order with (the now defunct) federal Office of Thrift Supervision in 2011. All this is sure to come up at Mnuchins impending confirmation hearings. Which could prove a trifle awkward for one of the Senates newest Democratic members  the more Kamala Harriss caucus mates make hay over Mnuchins tenure at OneWest, the more scrutiny her decision not to bring an enforcement action against the bank may receive. As the Intercepts David Dayen notes, there are plenty of sound reasons for Harris to have made that choice  the memo, itself, concedes that [w]e face a higher than average risk that the court may choose to award minimal amounts of restitution and/or penalties, since OneWest could argue that homeowners were not harmed by process violations, as they would have defaulted on their mortgages, regardless. California courts have proven themselves amenable to this argument. However, those inclined to distrust Harriss motives can find fuel for their suspicions in her FEC records. Per Dayen: Regardless, Democrats are poised to treat Mnuchin as a testament to Trumps true feelings about working people. After years peddling the kind of dangerous mortgage-backed securities that eventually blew up the economy, Mnuchin swooped in after the crash to take a second bite out of families by aggressively  and sometimes illegally  foreclosing on their homes, Elizabeth Warren seethed in a statement last month. Its unlikely that another viral video of Warren dressing down a plutocrat will do much to change the hearts and minds of Trumps working-class supporters. Except, perhaps, those whom Mnuchin foreclosed on. It has to get out why this man should not be put in charge of Treasury, Teena Colebrook, a (regretful) Trump voter who claims that OneWest deployed illegal tactics when it foreclosed on her, told the Intercept. Nobody minds a billionaire, but not one feeding off peoples misery. *Correction: This story originally included details about a foreclosure against a 90-year-old woman in Florida, as reported by Politico. It now appears that that story is inaccurate, and mention of it has been cut."}, {"date": "2017/01/04", "title": "Kentucky GOP Leader Thinks Fetal Viability Begins at Conception", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/kentucky-gop-leader-fetal-viability-begins-at-conception.html", "text": " In their Long March toward the recriminalization of abortion, the right-to-life movement has been adept in coopting the language of its pro-choice opponents. The classic example involves the appropriation of concerns about the health of the mother  a constitutionally required exception to abortion bans even for late-term abortions  as an excuse for abortion restrictions, as accepted by Justice Kennedy in his famously patronizing opinion in a case upholding a federal partial-birth abortion ban. But Kentucky senate president Robert Stivers has come up with an even craftier bit of legerdemain in defense of a bill to outlaw abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, which is suddenly on the brink of passage following Republican legislative gains on November 8: Fetal viability (the ability to survive outside the womb) is, of course, the linchpin of the constitutional right to abortion. Restrictions prior to fetal viability are never constitutional, though the standard shifted somewhat in the 1992 Supreme Court case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which in recognition of medical advances abandoned the strict trimester system for determining viability. Antiabortion activists would dearly love to secure a judicial standard that significantly reduced the period of pre-viability. But since the medical profession isnt cooperating with that aspiration, right-to-lifers have sought different rationales for banning earlier abortion, most notably the claim (disputed heatedly by most physicians and scientists) that the fetus can feel pain after 20 weeks. But so far as I know, the very different conflation of conception with viability that Stiver (assuming he didnt just mix up his buzzwords) attempted is a new one. If a zygote were in fact viable, then you might have the sort of competing interests that would in theory justify legislative intervention, though even then a health exception (which the Kentucky bill does not provide in its 20-week ban) would be required to pass constitutional muster. But obviously this is to change the word viable into something nonsensical. Stivers goes on, of course, to add insult to ignorance by suggesting that the right to choose is exhausted at the moment the woman involved makes a decision to conceive. From then on, her body belongs to the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Stivers is thus just asserting his property rights on Kentuckys behalf."}, {"date": "2017/01/04", "title": "New York City Had Record-Low Crime Rate in 2016", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/new-york-city-had-record-low-crime-rate-in-2016.html", "text": " The number of shootings in New York City plummeted to 998 in 2016, the first time that rate has dipped below 1,000 since the city began tracking such incidents. Thats a 12 percent decline from 2015, a standout statistic in a year that saw record low crime rates across the city. The citys murder rate also fell from 2015  down from 352 to 335 in 2016. (And a nick above New Yorks historic low, notched in 2014, of 333, and tied for second with 2013.) New York Police Department brass attribute some of decrease in violent crime to gang takedowns (the city saw its biggest bust in April 2016), and according to the New York Times, big reductions in gang-related shootings and killings helped drive the overall numbers down. NYPD chief of crime control strategies Dermot Shea also attributed the new lows to the departments ability to better track crime patterns  linking multiple crimes to one perp, for example  which comes down to improvements in technology and good, old-fashioned police work. All together, the overall crime rate sunk 4 percent, with fewer than 102,000 major felonies  the lowest number of the CompStat era, which the NYPD began using in the early 1990s. New York Citys relatively rosy stats stand out in stark contrast to other big cities, namely Chicago. The Windy City witnessed its bloodiest year in two decades: 762 murdered, and more than 4,300 shot. The increase is staggering. The homicide rate spiked 60 percent from 2015. The number of shootings leapt by more than 1,000. The number of people killed in Chicago is greater than that of New York and Los Angeles, combined. Chicago isnt the only city that logged a violent year. Los Angeles witnessed an uptick in homicides for the third year in a row; Baltimore had 318 homicides, its second deadliest year on record, beaten only by 2015. But Americas third largest city has perhaps garnered the most attention, amplified by president-elect Donald Trumps tweets. Chicagos gangs  loose, fractured cliques whose territory splits city blocks  have fueled the violence, which is concentrated on the South and West sides of the city. Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson, who took over an embattled police force in March, has also criticized lax gun laws and insufficient penalties for repeat offenders as hampering polices efforts to keep the body count in check. But the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, and the release of the video in November 2015, deepened the distrust between cops and community. Some critics say police are stepping back, the department plagued by dismal morale. Mayor Rahm Emanuel has promised to hire 1,000 more officers over the next year, and the city is expediting its body-camera program, to outfit all officers by 2017. Chicago will launch new community initiatives in gun-plagued neighborhoods, and expand technology, such as gunshot spotters. But whether those are real solutions to Chicagos bloodshed is an open question; six people have already been killed, and 54 people shot, not even four full days into 2017."}, {"date": "2017/01/04", "title": "The Second Avenue Subway Is New Yorks Newest World-Class Museum", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/the-second-avenue-subway-is-a-world-class-museum.html", "text": "  Dont worry.

Trump first invited Beijings ire by accepting a phone call from the president of Taiwan. Since 1979, a cornerstone of U.S.Sino relations has been Americas acceptance of the One China Policy  a doctrine that prohibits the recognition of Taiwan as an independent state. By directly communicating with (the pro-independence) president of the island, Trump signaled his disrespect for that policy. Later, Trump confirmed that disrespect, telling Fox News that he felt no compulsion to honor the policy unless China accedes to his demands on trade. After Trumps first affront, China flew a nuclear-capable bomber over its disputed islands in the South China Sea  while also preparing to ship new surface-to-air missiles to those islands. The president-elect was not impressed. Following that display of force, Trump appointed two fierce critics of Chinas trade policies  Peter Navarro and Robert Lighthizer  to top positions in his administration. And, on Monday, he tweeted the following: The Chinese government has never been a fan of Twitter  it banned the platform in 2009. And Trump has proven himself a less-than-ideal brand ambassador for Jack Dorseys company: On Tuesday, Chinese state news agency Xinhua (essentially) advised the president-elect to delete his account. In a commentary titled, An obsession with Twitter foreign policy is undesirable, the media organization wrote. Everyone recognizes the common sense that foreign policy isnt childs play, and even less is it like doing business deals, according to a translation by the New York Times. Twitter shouldnt become an instrument of foreign policy, the article continued, suggesting that Trump is wrong to believe that issuing hard-line comments and taking up sensitive issues over the platform will add to his chips for negotiating with other countries. The Global Times, another Chinese state-run outlet, delivered a similar message last month, deriding Trumps behavior as very childish and impulsive, and proclaiming, China and other powers in the world are not going to be bullied. On Tuesday, a spokesman for Chinas Foreign Ministry addressed the substance of Trumps tweet, arguing that Chinas efforts to curb North Koreas nuclear ambitions have been widely recognized. We hope all sides will avoid remarks and actions to escalate the situation, he continued. Trump isnt wrong to suggest that China has helped prop up Kim Jong-uns regime: As Time notes, China is North Koreas only major ally and accounts for 90 percent of the rogue states trade. Beijing doesnt want its delusional trade partner rattling intercontinental ballistic missiles toward the West. But, above all, the Chinese government wants to keep North Korea on the map, so as to avoid the specter of a unified Korean Peninsula aligned with the United States. Still, China has, on occasion, cooperated with the international communitys efforts to deter North Koreas nuclear ambitions. Last March, Beijing signed onto to U.N. sanctions of the rogue state, following its fourth nuclear test. To make Kim Jong-uns regime pay a higher price for its belligerence, Trump will need to secure further cooperation from its only major trading partner. And to do that, he will need to convince China that it can get tough on North Korea without risking its own strategic interests on the peninsula. It seems unlikely that sarcastic tweets are that the best medium for making such a case."}, {"date": "2017/01/04", "title": "Trump Picks Wall Street Lawyer to Enforce Laws on Wall Street", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-picks-wall-street-lawyer-to-enforce-wall-street-law.html", "text": " Donald Trump won Midwestern swing states in large part by using disaffection with Wall Street as a wedge, both to discredit his opponent as an alleged Wall Street stooge, and to position himself as a populist outsider.

As has been long evident, Republicans plan to use the budget process to do so because its special procedures dont allow a Senate filibuster, usually the main choke-point for controversial legislation (ending a filibuster requires a cloture vote, which in turn takes 60 votes to go into effect). So the GOP can do pretty much anything it wants with 50 votes so long as it is (in the opinion of the Senate parliamentarian) germane to the budget. There has been interminable debate among wonks about which features of the Affordable Care Act are budget-germane, but it is clear Obamacare can be effectively disabled if not entirely swept away through this method. Democrats fighting a budget-enabled Obamacare repeal cant defeat or indefinitely delay the inevitable so long as Republicans remain united. But a quirk in the budget process will enable them to offer a lengthy series of shrewdly worded amendments that at best could split the GOP and imperil final passage of the repeal, or at least could put Republican senators on the record with controversial votes. The knowledge these votes are coming could affect how far Republicans go in demolishing Obamacare, and later on, what they feel constrained to include in the Obamacare replacement bill that would presumably be enacted before the repeal fully takes effect. The flip side of the time limits for Senate debate in the budget process is that the number of amendments voted on without debate cannot be limited at all. This leads to the strange Senate institution of the vote-a-rama, a marathon series of votes on budget measures that can take days or even weeks to conclude. Exploiting the vote-a-rama will be central to the scorched-earth strategy Democrats plan to pursue as Republicans dismantle Obamacare. As Politico reports: Democrats will get two opportunities to dramatize controversial features of the Obamacare repeal via a vote-a-rama, because there are two stages to the budget process. The first is the passage of a budget resolution (as a congressional resolution, it does not have to be signed by the president), which sets broad spending and revenue parameters for the fiscal year, and, more crucially, authorizes the preparation of a budget reconciliation bill to implement the resolution. Yesterday Senate Budget Committee chairman Mike Enzi, a Republican from Wyoming, introduced the budget resolution designed to authorize the repeal of Obamacare. Its a vague, bare-bones measure that really just puts the ball into play. But the first Democratic-generated vote-a-rama, which will occur in a few days when Enzis resolution hits the Senate floor, will flesh out its implications and potentially add details to the reconciliation instructions that guide the next stage of the process. Assuming the budget resolution survives the first vote-a-rama, which it will if Republicans have their act together, it will be briskly passed by the House, where both debate and the number of votes are strictly limited. The goal for that action (according to a timetable written up by Dan Diamond) is to get it done by Inauguration Day. Then, the next stage of the process begins as the House puts together and debates the reconciliation bill that will actually repeal Obamacare. Its at this point that Republicans will have to answer the very tricky question about the effective dates for the various parts of the repeal: Is it two years down the road, or three, or four, or will it depend on the provision? Another key decision is whether the reconciliation bill is strictly limited to Obamacare repeal, or includes other hot-button budget-related measures like defunding Planned Parenthood (which was part of the trial run reconciliation bill Republicans sent to Obama for a certain veto last year). The reconciliation bill will presumably be passed by the House quickly (though Freedom Caucus concerns will influence its shape), and then the drama shifts back to the Senate, where there will be another vote-a-rama before final passage, probably in March. Democrats will do everything possible to coordinate the vote-a-ramas with messaging and grassroots activity. If, for example, Senate Democrats offer seven amendments during each vote-a-rama continuing preexisting-condition protections for people suffering from particular ailments, people suffering from these ailments will show up at the Senate and state offices of Republicans thought to be vulnerable to pressure. Amendments involving the ACAs Medicaid expansion that has covered an estimated 16 million people will be dramatized by protests from governors and state legislators (possibly Republicans as well as Democrats) about the human suffering and state fiscal damage that might ensue. In general, its all about taking an obscure and speedy budget process and creating dozens of lurid, free-frame images of measures that will affect real people in a terrible way. And if Democrats succeed in mobilizing a public backlash to elements of the Obamacare repeal, then its even possible it will produce one of those classic Donald Trump tweets intervening in the process and complicating everything for Republicans. At a minimum we can expect Trump to remind his congressional allies that the whole exercise is a waste of time unless he signs the reconciliation bill that makes it all real. All in all, the process of repealing Obamacare isnt looking like the slam dunk Republicans probably imagined when they were promising it without consequences during the last six years. And Democrats possess the strategic advantage of having very little to lose that they didnt already anticipate on the shocking night of November 8."}, {"date": "2017/01/04", "title": "Republicans Plan to Repeal Obamacare Might Be Collapsing Already", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/the-plan-to-repeal-obamacare-might-be-collapsing-already.html", "text": " The Republican plan to eliminate Obamacare is to repeal the law, delay for a long time, and then, allegedly, create a replacement for it. The replacement is the hardest part of the equation, since Republicans will never support a reform that provides enough coverage to satisfy most Americans. The repeal part is easier. But its still not easy at all. And as Trumps government takes shape, signs are already popping up everywhere that the GOP is reconsidering its plan to repeal the law quicky. Repeal and delay is a plan that sounds attractive in theory, but presents Republicans with enormous political risks. If they pass a law to repeal Obamacare on a time-delayed basis, with no replacement in hand, stakeholders like insurers and hospitals will face huge financial losses, and it will probably disrupt coverage for millions of their customers. The only way to prevent such a catastrophe would be to shore up the system until they can devise a replacement. But patching up Obamacare would enrage some conservatives who oppose bailouts for the insurance industry, and would also have the side effect of proving Obamacare can work, making it harder to repeal. Republicans, like Colonel Nicholson in Bridge on the River Kwai, would have built the thing they had set out to destroy. That Democrats will oppose repeal-and-delay is obvious. But over the last several days, a growing number of Republican, or Republican-friendly, voices have turned against it as well. James Capretta and Joseph Antos of the conservative American Enterprise Institute warn in the journal Health Affairs, The most likely end result of repeal and delay would be less secure insurance for many Americans, procrastination by political leaders who will delay taking any proactive steps as long as possible, and ultimately no discernible movement toward a real marketplace for either insurance or medical services. The American Medical Association, an influential lobby representing an affluent constituency, and which endorsed Trumps right-wing nomination to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, issued a statement opposing repeal-and-delay. Republicans like John McCain, Newt Gingrich, and even Rand Paul have urged their party not to tear down Obamacare without a replacement. (If Congress fails to vote on a replacement at the same time as repeal, the repealers risk assuming the blame for the continued unraveling of Obamacare, writes Paul.) Trump himself, somewhat elliptically, echoes these cautions. In a series of tweets this morning, the president-elect  while calling Obamacare a disaster  warns that repealing it will make Republicans responsible for the chaos that ensues: Republicans need 50 of their 52 Senators to support a repeal bill, plus of course the Presidents signature, to pass repeal. Neither of those seems certain right now. Whats the alternative? Theres no attractive option at hand. A key problem is that Obamacare can be defunded with 50 Republican Senate votes, but replacing it means rewriting the insurance regulations in the law, which needs 60 Senate votes, or at least 8 Democrats. Republicans could try to negotiate with Democrats on changes to the law that would make it more Republican-friendly  which means taxing rich people less, skimpier subsidies to the poor and sick, and cheaper premiums for the rich and healthy  that they could call a replacement for Obamacare. Democrats would not like any of these changes, but perhaps if their scale was small enough, they could accept them in return for a truce in the health-care wars that left most of the laws achievements in place. Or they could stick with their plan to repeal the law, delay its effect, patch up the system enough to keep it afloat, and leave it for another day. Theres no course of action that avoids taking on high levels of political risk. The Republicans have made impossible promises on Obamacare  providing more coverage than Obamacare without anybody having to pay for it  and they are figuring out that the path they take from that promise leads into a political quagmire."}, {"date": "2017/01/04", "title": "Rex Tillerson Will Cut All Ties With Exxon If He Becomes Secretary of State", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/tillerson-wont-take-exxon-stock-with-him-to-state-dept.html", "text": " Rex Tillerson will not be taking his Exxon stock with him to the State Department. Late Tuesday, ExxonMobil announced that it had reached an agreement with its current CEO over the many millions of dollars in shares that the company still owes him. Those shares had been an object of scrutiny, ever since Trump named the energy executive as his pick for secretary of State. Tillerson owns roughly $235 million in ExxonMobil stock  $180 million of which isnt scheduled to vest for years. Which is, as the (woke) kids say, problematic: In the early years of this decade, Exxon made a big play for Russias hardest-to-reach fossil fuels  inking deals to explore the Black Sea, frack the gas out of western Siberia, and drill for oil in the Arctic. These investments were so appreciated by Vladimir Putin, he awarded Tillerson his nations Order of Friendship in 2013. But Americas sanctions against Russia  following the invasion of Crimea  sidelined all of those lucrative projects. Were Trump to pursue a Putin-friendly foreign policy, however, Exxon could resume its Siberian adventure. And Tillersons shares would (almost certainly) increase in value. This reality  combined with the fact that Trump leaked word of Tillersons nomination hours after he disparaged a CIA intelligence assessment about Russias involvement in election interference  led the GOPs most hawkish senators to advertise their ambivalence about the Exxon CEO. But now Tillerson has eliminated his most conspicuous liability. If his appointment is confirmed, Exxon has agreed to let Tillerson transfer the value of his two million deferred ExxonMobil shares  which, at present, are worth $180 million  into an independently managed trust thats barred from investing in Exxon. Tillerson would also sell the 600,000 Exxon shares he already owns, which are currently valued at around $55 million. Finally, the Exxon CEO would forfeit the $4.1 million in cash bonuses he was scheduled to receive over the next three years, along with a host of retirement benefits. The arrangement was developed with the aid of ethics regulators, according to Exxon. And, by all appearances, it affirms the principle that Americas top public servants shouldnt be in a position to profit (directly) off their power. But unlike cabinet appointees, the president is not bound by federal conflict of interest laws. And Donald Trump has shown little deference to that aforementioned principle: While Tillerson would forfeit partial ownership of his company upon joining the State Department, our next president is set to retain his, upon entering the White House."}, {"date": "2017/01/04", "title": "Four Potential Stumbling Blocks for the New Republican Congress", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/four-stumbling-blocks-for-the-new-republican-congress.html", "text": " The 115th Congress opened at noon on Tuesday with all House Members (including 52 new ones) and 34 Senators (7 newbies) being sworn in. The latter ceremony featured outgoing Vice-President Joe Biden performing what will likely be his last significant official function. Biden aside, the day belonged to Republicans, who will enjoy for only the fourth time (they actually had it and lost it at the start of the George W. Bush administration, and regained it in the 2002 midterms) in the last 86 years control of the White House and both chambers of Congress  a status commonly called the trifecta. In this era of partisan gridlock, a trifecta is rare and priceless. And so there is all sorts of excitement in the GOP that years and even decades of pent-up conservative policy dreams can now be realized. Some of these dreams simply involve dismembering and desecrating Obama administration initiatives from universal health coverage to bank regulations to a shift away from dependence on fossil fuels to expanded overtime pay. Others go much deeper, to the gradual transformation or abolition of New Deal and Great Society programs that conservatives believe have sapped America morally and economically. Put it all together and you have what the Washington Posts David Weigel calls the most ambitious conservative policy agenda since the 1920s. Republicans do not have overwhelming majorities in either congressional chamber. But thanks to the party-line voting habits of the House, and a budget device that enables simple majorities to avoid filibusters in the Senate, it is on paper entirely feasible for the GOP to conduct a brisk domestic-policy revolution that could be more or less consummated this calendar year. Most of the raw material for this revolution has already been drafted in serial Ryan budgets that have won the votes of virtually all congressional Republicans. Procedurally last years budget reconciliation legislation repealing Obamacare and defunding Planned Parenthood, a bill Obama vetoed, offers a template. What could go wrong? Specifically, there are four pitfalls facing congressional Republicans: A curveball from Trump: Republican hopes for Trump on domestic legislation are almost entirely expressed by a famous quote from super-lobbyist Grover Norquist that he first made about Mitt Romney in 2012, but that is in the air everywhere right now: Many congressional Republicans have convinced themselves that Trump has passed the working digits test and is getting his signing pen ready: Thats a remarkably confident attitude to have toward the most unpredictable politician in American history. Ask yourself this: Is the goal cherished by Trump senior counselor Stephen Bannon to talk his boss into getting out of the way and letting Paul Ryan design the future of the federal government and the Republican Party? I dont think so. Bannon and the Trump base aside, the mogul is not very likely to react well to a scenario where hes perceived as the puppet of the Republican Establishment. And given the complex and inter-dependent nature of the legislative agenda for Ryan and McConnell, in which if anything goes wrong the whole year could go south, the vulnerability of congressional Republicans to a single hostile Trump tweet is hard to overstate. Trumps apparent lack of interest in the budget process  the vehicle for most of the biggest GOP plans for 2017  could be taken as a sign that hell stay out of the way and let Congress run the country while he focuses on intimidating individual business executives, foreign leaders, and the media. He reportedly may not even submit a budget of his own in 2017, and after putting off selection of an OMB director until fairly late in the transition, chose a House Republican for the job. But that indifference could cut both ways, and if Trump signals hes not interested in a big high-stakes budget bill in 2017, Republicans will be right back to square one. Discord and disagreement among GOP members. Narrow Republican margins in both houses of Congress mean there is not much of a margin for error, which gives ambitious or seditious individual members potentially enormous leverage. In the House, the Freedom Caucus is ever-ready to accuse the leadership of ideological treachery, perhaps on the very issues (e.g., the speed of Obamacare repeal, and the fateful question of whether to touch Medicare and Social Security) that cause the party as a whole the most political heartburn. In the Senate, the GOPs two-vote margin (amplified by Vice-President Pences tie-breaking ability) makes very small coalitions of rebellious Republicans potentially very powerful. And you have cranky lame ducks like John McCain and Orrin Hatch who are relatively invulnerable to grassroots conservative (or Trumpite) pressure, plus right-wing ideologues like Rand Paul and Tom Cotton who may see an advantage in going rogue now and then. Paul is already making noises about opposing any budget actions (and pretty much every GOP initiative in 2017 is going to be styled as a budget action to take advantage of rules that prohibit filibusters) that dont aim at a balanced federal budget. The possibility of defections has already led Mitch McConnell to hold off on any contentious Senate votes until Pence is in place. If this fear persists Republicans may have to try to bring a few Democrats across the line, and on some issues the ten Democratic Senators up for reelection in 2018 in states Trump carried could be seducible. But the very act of packaging huge batches of legislation into budget bills, which is necessary to avoid Democratic filibusters, could make picking off individual Democrats difficult. Every bill will be loaded with poison pills for Democrats. Successful Democratic resistance: Speaking of Democrats, they have gone to school for the last six years on the politically successful use of obstruction by congressional Republicans, and are generally not making the sort of billing and cooing noises a lot of them (and their predecessors) made when George W. Bush took office 16 years ago. It appears that Democratic resistance to the putative GOP policy revolution will rely on two tactics: creating wedge issues that divide congressional Republicans or (more likely) divide a significant number of congressional Republicans from the Trump White House, and exploiting GOP overreach on hot-button issues like Medicare and Social Security where Republicans are simply on the wrong side of public opinion, even among their own partisans. An ancillary Democratic tactic designed to undermine GOP morale and potentially feed divisions in their ranks will be an incessant drumbeat of information on GOP and Trump administration ethics violations and conflicts of interest: a rich vein of material in a billionaire-heavy administration working with an interest-group-dominated Congress to make life immensely easier for plutocrats at home and abroad. The intimacy of the 45th president and several of his key appointees with Vladimir Putin is a line of attack that could help revive the once-powerful conservative angst over Trump, particularly if he disappoints them in other important ways. Whether or not they manage to actually deny confirmation to any members of Trumps Cabinet, confirmation hearings should be viewed as a trial effort by Democrats to explore potential GOP fault lines and depress Trumps already-low approval ratings from the get-go. The goal would be to slow down or even stop any revolutionary domestic legislation and make the new regimes first 100 days a failure or a wash, and the 2018 midterms potentially a big Democratic comeback. The boundaries of objective reality. Perhaps the single biggest long-term pitfall for giddy congressional Republicans is that facts are not friendly to many of the assumptions on which they are relying. And even with a post-truth administration in the White House, objective reality has a way of popping up and spoiling things. The most glaring and regularly recurring problem for the GOP has to do with its fiscal math. You cannot produce big high-end tax cuts and a defense-spending increase and move toward a balanced budget without cutting wildly popular entitlement programs. And even though Republican pols and conservative elites are capable of astonishing hypocrisy and magical thinking on this subject, broken promises over fiscal goals will cause some political problems, as they did for Ronald Reagan late in his presidency and did again for George W. Bush. More broadly, Republicans are once again buying into the pixie dust of supply-side economics (see my colleague Jonathan Chaits fine book on the subject) and its regularly refuted theories of economic growth. Nothing about its flaws has changed since its last failure. And to cite a specific example thats very much on the minds of Republicans today, objective reality is making a hash of their hopes to repeal Obamacare without having a workable replacement plan consistent with their ideology  because there will never be one. None of these pitfalls (other than the last) are certain to trip up Republican plans. In an ideal GOP world the Ryan budget will be enacted and signed by a President Trump who is distracting attention with wild but politically nonfatal behavior in other arenas. And perhaps the negative consequences of finding out, finally, what life would have been like had Barry Goldwater won in 1964 can somehow be sloughed off or blamed on a future Democratic regime. But the odds are the giddiness among congressional Republicans will give way to a grim and even fearful set of challenges."}, {"date": "2017/01/04", "title": "Schumer Says Hell Fight to Keep Supreme Court Seat Vacant", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/schumer-says-hell-fight-to-keep-supreme-court-seat-vacant.html", "text": " Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell officially won his effort to deny President Obama another Supreme Court pick on Tuesday at noon, when U.S. Circuit Judge Merrick Garlands nomination expired.

We are not going to settle on a Supreme Court nominee. If they dont appoint someone whos really good, were gonna oppose him tooth and nail. Schumer said earlier this week that he wishes Democrats hadnt triggered the nuclear option in 2013, reducing the number of Senate votes needed to confirm cabinet picks from 60 to 51. But since the 60-vote threshold is still in place for Supreme Court appointments, eight Democrats would have to side with all 52 Republicans for a new justice to be confirmed. We are not going to make it easy for them to pick a Supreme Court justice, Schumer said."}, {"date": "2017/01/04", "title": "NAACP President Arrested at Sit-in Protesting Jeff Sessions for Attorney General", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/naacp-president-arrested-at-protest-of-sessions-for-ag.html", "text": " As opposition to Senator Jeff Sessions nomination to serve as Donald Trumps attorney general grew louder on Tuesday, six people were arrested following an eight-hour sit-in organized by the NAACP at the senators Mobile, Alabama, office. The protest began around 11 a.m., when nearly two dozen activists occupied Sessionss office, accusing the senator of being hostile to the Voting Rights Act and other civil rights issues. The demonstration was part of a larger action by the Alabama NAACP, which held press conferences opposing Sessions at his other district offices on Tuesday. Demonstrators in Mobile vowed to remain in the office until the senators nomination was pulled or they were arrested. We are asking the senator to withdraw his name for consideration as attorney general or for the President-elect, Donald Trump, to withdraw the nomination, Cornell William Brooks, the national president of the NAACP, said during the sit-in. In the midst of rampant voter suppression, this nominee has failed to acknowledge the reality of voter suppression while pretending to believe in the myth of voter fraud. The demonstrators asked to speak with Sessions, but according to USA Today they were told he was unavailable. They were also unable to speak with his D.C. policy staff. Updates on the protest were posted on social media, and many offered messages of support. The protest ended around 6:30 p.m. local time when the group refused to leave as the office closed for the day. A Facebook Live broadcast showed the arrests of five men and one woman, including Brooks and Alabama NAACP President Benard Simelton. The six were taken into custody peacefully, with Brooks shaking hands with the officers who arrived on the scene. We all are aware of the laws of trespass. We are engaging in a voluntary act of civil disobedience, Brooks told the police. The demonstrators were allowed to kneel and pray before they were handcuffed and led to a police van. They were charged with misdemeanor criminal trespass and released on bond, according to the AP. Simelton said everyone was very polite and hospitable during the sit-in, and Sessions even sent them pizza for lunch. But Sarah Isgur Flores, spokeswoman for Sessionss confirmation, issued a statement strongly denying the accusations of racism that have dogged the senator throughout his career. Jeff Sessions has dedicated his career to upholding the rule of law, ensuring public safety and prosecuting government corruption, Isgur Flores said in the statement. Many African-American leaders whove known him for decades attest to this and have welcomed his nomination to be the next attorney general. The statement included a list of black lawyers and officials who have endorsed Sessions for attorney general. The U.S. Senate rejected Sessionss nomination for a federal judgeship in 1986 after several former colleagues accused him of making racist remarks while serving as U.S. attorney in Mobile. They claimed he called a black prosecutor boy, agreed with a description of a white civil-rights lawyer as a traitor to his race, called the NAACP un-American, and joked that he thought the Ku Klux Klan was okay until I found out they smoked pot. Sessions acknowledged making some of the remarks, but said many were taken out of context. During the sit-in, Simelton said civil-rights advocates arent opposed to Sessionss nomination merely owing to a handful of racist remarks he may have made several decades ago. He has not been a champion for civil and human rights or been on the battle front fighting for civil and human rights, Simelton said. We need someone who has a background in that and who will continue to do that. In 1985, when he was a federal prosecutor, Sessions pursued voter-fraud charges against three activists working to register black voters, including Albert Turner, who helped lead the voting-rights march in Selma in 1965. The presiding judge threw out half of the charges for lack of evidence, and a jury quickly acquitted the Marion Three on the remaining charges. On Tuesday, Deval Patrick, the former Democratic governor of Massachusetts, sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee opposing Sessionss confirmation over his handling of the 1985 case. Patrick was part of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund team that represented the Marion Three, and he said Sessions should not have prosecuted the activists for trying to help voters, many of whom were poor, illiterate, or elderly. Pursuing that case was an act of extraordinary quasi-judicial activism, wrote Patrick. To use prosecutorial discretion to attempt to criminalize voter assistance is wrong and should be disqualifying for any aspirant to the Nations highest law enforcement post. The incident was also cited in a letter to Congress from a group of more than 1,200 law-school professors from 176 law schools opposing Sessions for attorney general. We are convinced that Jeff Sessions will not fairly enforce our nations laws and promote justice and equality in the United States, the letter states. Last month, news outlets and advocacy groups found Sessions omitted many records from the questionnaire he filled out for the Senate Judiciary Committee, including his failed bid for a federal judgeship. In a Washington Post op-ed published on Tuesday, three former Justice Department civil-rights lawyers accused Sessions of exaggerating his role in four civil-rights cases, listing them on the questionnaire as significant cases he litigated personally. They wrote: The attorneys concluded, Sessions knows that his real record on race and civil rights is harmful to his chances for confirmation. So he has made up a fake one. Sessionss confirmation hearings are scheduled for January 10 and 11, and other groups are planning protests to keep him from becoming attorney general. Were calling on citizens of this country to not accept as fait accompli the nomination of attorney general, Brooks said on Tuesday. Its not a political coronation, its a democratic confirmation. Were calling on people to tweet, e-mail, show up at the senators office and voice their opinion, wisely, thoughtfully."}, {"date": "2017/01/04", "title": "Trump May Have Facts Wrong in Tweet Knocking Intelligence Officials", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-may-have-facts-wrong-in-jab-at-intelligence-officials.html", "text": " Most presidents do not publicly pick fights with the U.S. intelligence community, but if theyre going to go there, they should probably have their facts straight.

On New Years Eve, Trump reiterated that he isnt confident in the agencies findings due to the intelligence communitys role in justifying the war in Iraq. Well, I just want them to be sure, because its a pretty serious charge, and I want them to be sure, he said. And if you look at the weapons of mass destruction, that was a disaster, and they were wrong. He added that he also knows things that other people dont know about the hacking, and when asked to elaborate, he said, Youll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday. Its unclear what Trump was referring to, but a senior intelligence official told NBC News that the president-elects meeting with the heads of the NSA, CIA, and FBI, and the director of national intelligence was always scheduled for Friday. Senior administration officials also told the New York Times that no meeting was scheduled for Tuesday. A spokesman for the director of national intelligence declined to comment on Trumps assertion. CIA director John Brennan pushed back at Trumps questioning of the officials conclusion during an interview that aired Tuesday on PBS NewsHour. I would suggest to individuals who have not yet seen the report, who have not yet been briefed on it, that they wait and see what it is that the intelligence community is putting forward before they make those judgments, Brennan said.

The answer: in the Reagan administration! A big part of Ronald Reagans Teflon reputation is a result of conservatives ability to forget the many, many times he abandoned conservative orthodoxy on issues ranging from abortion to taxes to nuclear disarmament  to trade. Heres a former Reagan deputy USTR correcting the record about the Gippers trade policies: The author of this 2008 New York Times op-ed was none other than Robert Lighthizer. And he does provide a useful reminder that free trade has been respected in rhetoric more than reality by Republican administrations. Back in the day, powerful GOP representatives of textile-producing states like Jesse Helms and Strom Thurmond were forever extorting protectionist policies from Republican presidents. Indeed, an agreement to hammer textile imports was a key solvent in the famous deal between Thurmond and Richard Nixon that was the basis for the original GOP Southern strategy (not coincidentally, the grand patron of the South Carolina GOP for many years was textile baron Roger Milliken). Having someone like Lighthizer at USTR resolves another problem for Trump: the traditional rivalry over trade policy between that agency  typically a big trade proponent in most administrations  and the Commerce Department, which has long represented the interests of manufacturers yearning to be protected. And Trump has made trade policy in his administration even more complicated than usual, as Zeeshan Aleem notes at Vox: But all these worthies, including Commerce Secretary-designate Wilbur Ross, are singing from the same protectionist hymnal. So it may be that Trump is simply building a broad and deep team  himself included  to focus on his highest and most controversial economic priority. He probably hopes that with enough time and effort, the free-trade views of his immediate Republican predecessors (and of most Republican members of Congress, and of most conservative policy wonks and business groups) will be understood as a brief interruption of an anti-free-trade tradition on the right that stretches back to Henry Clay, and beyond him to Alexander Hamilton.

But apparently he underestimated Woodss obsessive desire for vengeance. First, Woods famously responded to Lists ridicule by suing the tweeter for defamation, seeking $10 million in damages against John Doe, as he was named in the suit. Does lawyer, Ken White (who writes about legal and free-speech issues under the pen name Popehat on his website and on Twitter), filed an anti-SLAPP motion seeking the cases dismissal, arguing that cocaine addict was a constitutionally protected political insult in a Twitter context and shouldnt be viewed as a statement of fact  especially given that Woods had used similarly inflammatory language to insult others on the social-media platform. The judge denied that motion in February, meaning the case could continue. Doe appealed that decision, but subsequently died, causing White to withdraw the appeal. On Twitter, Woods celebrated. The slime who libeled me just dropped his appeal contesting my victorious SLAPP motion, he tweeted. Then, after someone replied noting that Woods had been victorious because his adversary had died, Woods tweeted (and later deleted), Learn this. Libel me, Ill sue you. If you die, Ill follow you to the bowels of Hell. Get it? He also expressed a hope that Doe died screaming my name. He meant it! Woods decided not to let Does death slow down the lawsuit, and at a deposition in mid-November, White refused to give up his clients name, so Woods pressed yet further, filing a motion to compel him to. Now, reports The Hollywood Reporter, the presiding judge has ruled on that motion  White will have to reveal Does identity. That is: the name of his client, who is dead, who was sued for $10 million for tweeting something mean at a celebrity. Woodss lawyers had also sought sanctions against White for refusing to give up his clients identity, but that attempt was rebuffed. In free speech litigation, sometimes the bad guys win, said White via DM. You dust yourself off and get ready for the next fight. Im pleased that the court denied Mr. Woodss frivolous demand for sanctions, and that the court refused the request to compel responses to several other questions that would have violated the attorney-client privilege. For now, I remain proud to have represented Abe Doe and opposed James Woods, a classic bully who can dish it out but cant take it. Woodss lawyers, of course, see it differently. This is a significant step forward in our ability to recover the millions in damages caused by John Does cowardly Tweet, Michael Weinsten of Lavely & Singer told the Reporter. It also sends a message to others who believe they can hide behind the anonymity of online social media to falsely accuse public figures of heinous behavior without recourse to themselves.

With her last show set to air on Friday, Kellys departure raises a new series of questions about how transferrable her talents are and where Fox News is headed now that the network has lost its biggest star and one of its few hosts with serious mainstream credibility. For Kelly, the jump from a primetime perch at Fox to a multifaceted role at NBC carries a high degree of risk. Shell be giving up the most loyal audience in cable news for new set of platforms that shell have to largely build herself. At NBC, Kelly will anchor an Oprah-like daytime show, launch a new Sunday night news magazine, and contribute to the networks political coverage. The track record for talented anchors launching daytime programs hasnt been good (see: Katie Couric, Meredith Vieira, Anderson Cooper), and no Fox News star has successfully crossed over to the mainstream before. But Kellys prodigious talents as a broadcaster, not to mention her canny media instincts, could help her defy the trend. Sources close to Kelly told me today that her departure is an indication of just how unhappy she had become at Fox in the wake of her high-profile feud with Donald Trump and revelations she had accused Ailes of sexual harassment. Her relationships with Bill OReilly and Sean Hannity in particular had completely broken down, one Fox host told me. Bill hated her, the host said. As Kellys contract negotiations dragged on during her much-publicized book tour, things also grew strained with Rupert Murdoch, two sources said. One Fox insider told me Murdoch balked when Kelly asked for $25 million late in the talks. (A person close to Kelly disputed this, saying that said Kelly never asked for a specific dollar amount but that Fox had offered $25 million.) Inside Fox News, staffers are speculating over who will replace Kelly. According to insiders I spoke with today, the consensus seems to be that the Murdochs will choose a woman to fill her 9 p.m. time slot. The leading internal contenders include Trish Regan, Shannon Bream, Sandra Smith, and Martha MacCallum. Two sources said Kimberly Guilfoyle is lobbying for the job. The one thing Fox insiders are in agreement on is that whoever replaces Kelly will be a pro-Trump conservative. In the wake of Ailess ouster, some media observers speculated that 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch wanted to reposition Fox to the center, bringing it more in line with his moderate political views. But the selection of a pro-Trump host to fill Kellys slot would suggest that Fox is instead doubling down on its right-wing politics and planning to align itself with the new administration. After initially being hostile to Trump, Murdoch has made moves to curry favor with the president-elect. Fox insiders told me that Murdoch personally named pro-Trump anchor Tucker Carlson to replace Greta Van Susteren at 7 p.m. Murdochs relationship with Trump has greatly improved since the depths of Trumps battle with Kelly last year. I really like Rupert Murdoch! Trump told guests at Mar-a-Lago over the holidays, according to an attendee. Roger Ailes was a friend of mine, but Foxs coverage is so much better since he left. If Fox News politics ultimately solidify as more pro-Trump than they were during the campaign, that might be to the benefit of Murdochs business interests. According to a well-placed source, Trump has asked Murdoch to submit names for FCC Chairman. Murdoch, another source said, also wants conditions put on the AT&T-Time Warner merger, and he could lobby Trump to make that happen. That Murdoch might choose to align his news network with Trump shouldnt come as a surprise. Throughout his career, Murdoch has tended to support the officeholder in power, whether it was Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair, or George W. Bush. He even flirted with endorsing Barack Obama in 08, but at the time backed off when Ailes complained."}, {"date": "2017/01/03", "title": "With Sanders at His Side, Cuomo Proposes Free-Tuition Plan at State Schools", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/with-sanders-cuomo-proposes-free-tuition-plan-at-sunys.html", "text": " New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, fresh off the fanfare of the Second Avenue subway opening, made another splashy announcement Tuesday, this one about education. Cuomo proposed giving free state- or city-college tuition for accepted students whose families make less than $125,000 per year. The governor outlined his plan at La Guardia Community College in Queens, where he was joined by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, the very person who made this a campaign issue in 2016. He got a chance to try out the old stump speech again, and, spoiler, hes still got it: Cuomo is calling for a 2019 start date for these Excelsior Scholarships, which will apply to four- and two-year schools under the CUNY or SUNY banner and could benefit hundreds of thousands of students in the nations largest public-university system. The governors administration estimated the program to cost about $163 million  though thats a very, very rough estimate and will vary depending on how many students take advantage of the potential scholarships. Besides the question over cost, this plan isnt exactly a done deal, as implementing free tuition will require a vote in Albany, which could be a tough sell among Republican lawmakers who control the State Senate. According to the Albany Times Union, Governor Cuomo is trying to spice up the State of the State Address in 2017, delivering six separate policy speeches across New York  with just one near Albany  instead of one big presentation in front of the Legislature. (Things didnt go over so well last year.) This free-tuition plan is reportedly the first preview in what well call the State of the State series, one that the governor probably hopes still sounds good when 2020 rolls around."}, {"date": "2017/01/03", "title": "Guilty White Liberals Are Purchasing Racial Indulgences", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/guilty-white-liberals-are-purchasing-racial-indulgences.html", "text": " Its a fairly paralyzing time to be a guilty white American liberal. With Donald Trump elected on the basis of one of the race-baitiest presidential campaigns in modern American history, Republicans firmly in power, and mounting evidence that progress toward racial equality has been stalled out for years if not decades, it feels like theres little chance of substantive progress anytime soon. What can the conscientious white ally do? One answer, according to a recent Vice News Tonight segment: Spend between $25 and $100 a month to receive a box that helps you be a better ally. Thats the business plan set up by Grand Rapids, Michigan entrepreneurs Marissa Johnson and Leslie Mac, at least. Every month, they send their subscribers the Safety Pin Box, which Vice reporter Evan McMorris-Santoro describes as being designed to wake up white people to the realities of being black in America. In the first half of the short segment, McMorris-Santoro meets with the founders as they pack up the first batch of boxes. They say theyre hoping to move beyond the mostly toothless symbolism of post-election safety-pin-wearing. It really isnt active, Mac tells him. So were looking to move that into action. That is, into more substantive forms of education and activism. In the second half, McMorris-Santoro sits with Safety Pin Box subscriber Barat Ellman, a Park Slope rabbi and Jewish studies professor, as she opens her first delivery. Among other things, the box contains a request that Ellman give higher tips to black people and explains that the months theme is combating white supremacy through radical compassion. Some of the other content is about media habits  This week, I take a look at the media I consume on a regular basis and evaluate it for bias and worthiness, Ellman reads aloud from one of the included slips of paper. She also offers some revealing details about why she subscribed. It embarrasses me, honestly, that I just dont have a world where I encounter, naturally, people of color, she explains. McMorris-Santoro asks her how shes hoping shell feel after shes received all 12 boxes from her yearlong subscription. Id like to think  Wow, I will be so incredibly sensitized, she replies. Thats probably unrealistic. Its important to keep all this in perspective: The Box has only a few hundred subscribers (it would be fun to do a pool estimating how many of them are white Brooklyn liberals), Johnson and Mac are donating some of the proceeds to black female activists, and liberals and lefties themselves have been highly critical of the exercise. So this shouldnt be slotted into any sort of overheated activist liberalism run amok storyline. Plus, there are worse things in the world than the voluntary donation of money from wealthy white liberals to presumably less wealthy black small-business entrepreneurs and activists. That said, the Safety Pin Box is a very interesting glimpse at a certain strain of woke white slacktivism. This is a form of slacktivism which holds that if only privileged white people were better educated and more conscious of their own privilege, racial progress would ensue  in many senses, it puts liberal, privileged white people and their own inner battles at the center of the struggle. This form of slacktivism doesnt, as a rule, talk all that much about power structures or even power, really, except at the level of individual privilege. In a certain sense, its a form of slacktivism perfectly constructed for an age in which politics feel futile, inequality is rampant, the prospects for meaningful redistribution are moribund, and a lot of liberal white people who are the winners in the winner-take-all economy are performatively conscious of racism, but also not all that into the idea of living in truly integrated neighborhoods, or sending their kids to truly integrated schools. This form of slacktivism allows white people who live in wealthy enclaves of Brooklyn, technically surrounded by black people in every direction but thoroughly disconnected from them sociologically, to feel like part of a broader struggle  and to broadcast their enthusiasm about that struggle  without actually giving up anything much materially.

The corporate types make an investment or employment decision that appears to benefit a particular place, maybe because it makes sense generally, maybe in response to government inducements (maybe disclosed publicly, maybe not). And then they cooperate by giving credit to a friendly politician, who gets to announce a ribbon-cutting or ground-breaking or jobs saved claim which is supposed to symbolize the pols economic development chops. Usually the economic impact of the deal is small potatoes, and may even be offset by the cost of inducements. And in most cases the positive development would have probably happened anyway. But it is in not in the interest of any of the players in the game to admit that its all a shuck. It is increasingly apparent that one of the distinctive features of the Trump administration will be raising that particular game to the national level. The first such Trump-brokered deal involved the Carrier Corporation, of course. But since that was a particular company Trump bashed during the presidential campaign for its outsourcing practices, and because Trumps own running mate Mike Pence was in a position to create inducements as governor of Indiana, it looked like it could be a unique event. Not any more. The automaker Ford has announced Trump is responsible for a decision to make certain cars in Michigan rather than Mexico. Ford claims they didnt get any public subsidies or concessions to make this showy about-face, from Trump or anyone else; no, it was just a vote of confidence in the moguls plans to make America a lean, mean, job-creatin machine. Never mind that Trump attacked Ford for its Mexican plans during the campaign, or that he threatened to slap a 35 percent tariff on the companys Mexican-produced vehicles  thats apparently just a coincidence. Now, aside from the rather ludicrous suggestion that Trumps threats were not a factor in this decision, it is important to note that it involves 1,000 jobs (or so Ford claims, anyway). Yes, there are spin-off effects, and sure, if you are an unemployed or potentially unemployed autoworker living in Flat Rock, Michigan (the site of the plant now blessed by Ford and Trump) its a big deal. Having said that, these 1,000 jobs or the alleged (though disputed) 1,100 jobs saved by the Carrier deal are not the stuff of a national economic strategy. Its more like a Tinkertoy substitute for a national economic strategy at best, and a cynical exploitation of public misapprehensions about how the economy works at worst, with Lord only knows what kind of concealed price down the road. Is the President of the United States going to bribe or browbeat enough individual companies to double GDP growth? Or is this just a display for the benefit of Rust Belt Trump voters to keep them from concluding their hero has betrayed them when he kills Obamacare or plunges us all into a trade-related recession? If Trump wants to keep this game credible, hed better step it up and interact with companies a little more broadly. How he keeps his conservative free-market allies from freaking out publicly over this grossly primitive way of thinking about economics is another mystery altogether. Cutting taxes and killing regulations will presumably cover a lot of sins.

Republicans blamed their loss of Congress in 2006 on a wave of corruption scandals  Mark Foley, Jack Abramoff, Bob Ney, and many others  rather than on any policy failures. If you look at the exit polling, the No. 1 issue, particularly among swing voters, was corruption and behavior, said Karl Rove following the 2006 midterms. After Foley, people said, Its just too much. After that, spending was the No. 2 issue. Representative Tom Coburn insisted, This election was not a rejection of conservative principles per se, but a rejection of corrupt, complacent, and incompetent government. The off-loading of the partys failures onto a few bad actors absolved it of any serious introspection. Indeed, conservatives eventually decided that the Bush administrations agenda of fanatical tax cutting and deregulation, which they had celebrated at the time, if anything had abandoned the true conservative faith. The idiosyncratic scandals were a lesson, and by losing power, the party deemed the lessons to have been learned. The putatively reformed Republicans made ethics a central theme of their opposition to the Obama administration. Conservatives were quickly consumed with indignation at the disgusting sight of finance veterans being allowed to serve in the administration and interest group bargaining over legislation. If a Republican administration, staffed with cronies from Goldman Sachs and Citibank, were cutting special deals for its political allies, I suspect wed be hearing fewer FDR analogies and more nouns ending with the suffix gate, wrote National Reviews Jonah Goldberg in early 2009. (Yes, imagine! Goldman veterans and special deals for allies!) Of course, Trump himself used Hillary Clintons ethical shortcomings as his central campaign theme. And yet it should hardly come as a surprise that Republicans would make it their first order of business to take down the ethics watchdog. After George W. Bush won reelection in 2004, House Republicans immediately voted to weaken the ethics committee. And when the Democrat-controlled House voted to create the Office of Congressional Ethics in 2008, it did so over the almost-unanimous objections of the Republican caucus. If you have a single ounce of self preservation, you will vote no, said GOP Representative Todd Tiahrt, and most of his party did, voting 159-33 against creating the new office. Crippling the ethics office is the restoration of longstanding party principle. Indeed, Donald Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway explains the office has been guilty of overzealousness in its ethics enforcement. The incoming Trump administration is already engaged in self-enrichment on a staggering scale, and Republicans in Congress have displayed no interest whatsoever in asserting any oversight over the potential for graft. The party is instead working cooperatively to dismantle any mechanisms for accountability or self-restraint. What is most telling is how little complaint Trumps behavior has generated on the right. Yes, some peeps of protest have been uttered; The Wall Street Journal published one editorial urging Trump to sell off his business, but it based its case entirely on the need to protect Trump from unfair political damage, without considering the possibility that he might actually do something unethical. The Journal, like most conservatives, has left the subject alone since. Trump objected to a decision by House Republicans who have given him complete latitude for his non-disclosure of income taxes and refusal to sell his business empire. Republicans loaded the entire weight of the failure of the last Republican-controlled government onto ethical shortcomings, then used the issue to regain power, and are now rapidly dismantling safeguards against corruption in the Executive and Legislative branches. The distinction between kleptocracy and conservatism matters enormously to conservatives when they have no political power. When they do have power, the distinction collapses. And so a new era of corruption begins.

North Korea regularly threatens to attack the United States with nuclear weapons, and experts say its possible theyre making progress on their long-stated goal of developing that capability. North Korea has never flight-tested an intercontinental ballistic missile, but they have conducted five nuclear tests in the past ten years, as well as more than 20 ballistic-missile tests in the past year. The Obama administration condemned this latest bit of saber-rattling. We call on all states to use every available channel and means of influence to make clear to the [Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea] and its enablers that launches using ballistic-missile technology are unacceptable, and take steps to show there are consequences to the DPRKs unlawful conduct, State Department spokesman John Kirby said. Perhaps recognizing that cold, diplomatic language wont calm anyones nerves, the president-elect offered his own assessment of this delicate situation on Monday evening: Thats not exactly what Kim Jong-un said (he claimed theyre close to testing an ICBM, not a nuclear-tipped ICBM). But Americans dont need to sweat the details because that simply wont happen. The tweet did not elaborate on Trumps plan to prevent North Korea from developing nuclear weapons that can reach the U.S., and during the campaign he wasnt very clear on his policy toward the rogue state. Trump has called Kim Jong-un a bad dude and a maniac, but he also said you have to give him credit for his brutal rise to power, and that hed be willing to meet with him. At other points, Trump said South Korea should pay more for U.S. protection, and suggested that hed be open to South Korea and Japan having their own nuclear weapons. Trump has also claimed that China could make the North Korea problem disappear, a point that he reiterated Monday on Twitter: China disputed this, saying in a state-run tabloid that Trump is pandering to irresponsible attitudes. The Global Times newspaper also said Pyongyangs nuclear program stokes the anxieties of some Americans who blame China rather than examining their own nations actions. Still, theres no denying that this is pretty encouraging news about the global threat posed by North Korea (if you get all your information from the president-elects tweets)."}, {"date": "2017/01/03", "title": "House Republicans Kick Off 2017 by Gutting Independent Ethics Office", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/house-gop-starts-2017-by-gutting-independent-ethics-office.html", "text": " If youre anxious to see how federal ethics standards will be eroded in 2017, you dont have to hold your breath until January 20. On Monday night, House Republicans voted behind closed doors to gut an independent ethics office, which was established eight years ago after bribery and corruption scandals landed several members of Congress in jail. The measure would transform the Office of Congressional Ethics  a six-member board of private citizens  into the Office of Congressional Complaint Review, and put it under the control of the House Ethics Committee, which is comprised of sitting members of Congress. The move is expected to be approved on Tuesday when the full House votes on a package of rules changes for the incoming 115th Congress. Republican congressman Robert Goodlatte, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, announced on Monday evening that the House Republican Conference approved the change by a vote of 119 to 74, according to the Washington Post. There was no public notice that the effort to weaken the ethics office was under consideration, and Republicans reportedly approved the measure even though House Speaker Paul Ryan and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy spoke out against it during the conference meeting. Goodlatte said in a statement that the amendment merely builds upon and strengthens the existing Office of Congressional Ethics by maintaining its primary area of focus of accepting and reviewing complaints from the public and referring them, if appropriate, to the Committee on Ethics. But the proposed changes would significantly curtail the ethics watchdogs activities. Currently, the Office of Congressional Ethics can investigate anonymous tips or news stories accusing lawmakers of wrongdoing by conducting confidential interviews and collecting documents. According to the New York Times, the board votes on whether the incident should be referred to the House Ethics Committee, which then conducts its own investigation. The House Ethics Committee can ignore the recommendation, but it must release the boards report on the allegation. Under the new rules pushed by Goodlatte, members of Congress would oversee all investigations by the Office of Congressional Ethics. The ethics board could not accept anonymous tips, make its findings public, investigate incidents that took place before January 3, 2011, or refer criminal acts to law enforcement. Per Goodlattes statement, Any matter that may involve a violation of criminal law must be referred to the Committee on Ethics for potential referral to law enforcement agencies after an affirmative vote by the Members. This is huge, Bryson Morgan, a lawyer who worked for the Office of Congressional Ethics from 2013 until 2015, told the Times. It effectively allows the committee to shut down any independent investigation into member misconduct. As the Washington Post notes, for decades, the House Ethics Committee was accused of protecting members of Congress, acting only when lawmakers committed egregious acts of misconduct. The Office of Congressional Ethics was created by Democrats in 2008 after Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff pleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe public officials. Investigations conducted by the ethics board were generally considered more robust than those carried out by the House committee. Both Republicans and Democrats targeted by the board have complained that it was too aggressive, but watchdog groups have dismissed those complaints. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington said the move is actually risky for lawmakers. If the 115th Congress begins with rules amendments undermining OCE, it is setting itself up to be dogged by scandals and ethics issues for years and is returning the House to dark days when ethics violations were rampant and far too often tolerated, the watchdog group said. The current effort to remove the boards independence was orchestrated by several Republican lawmakers who felt they had been wrongly accused of ethical misconduct, according to Politico. Democrats were already opposed to the package of rules changes, which includes measures introduced by Ryan in an apparent attempt to prevent protests from the House floor, like the Democrats sit-in against gun violence last year. Many said hobbling the ethics board shows Republicans actually have no intention of following one of Donald Trumps key campaign promises. Republicans claim they want to drain the swamp, but the night before the new Congress gets sworn in, the House GOP has eliminated the only independent ethics oversight of their actions, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. Evidently, ethics are the first casualty of the new Republican Congress. Other Democrats echoed her sentiments on Twitter: It should be clear by now that Donald Trump  already the most corrupt and conflicted President-elect in history  is betraying his promise to drain the swamp, said Democratic National Committee spokesman Eric Walker. Now Republicans in the House are following his example, attempting to cripple the independent entity that deals with ethics in Congress. To be clear, Trump has no direct role in the House GOPs effort to curtail ethics investigations of its members. The president-elect recently insisted that his effort to drain the swamp is still on, and he could prove it by calling on members of his party to leave the Office of Congressional Ethics alone. On the other hand, Trump probably doesnt want to start a war with the body thats supposed to hold him accountable for ethics violations."}, {"date": "2017/01/02", "title": "Trump Shouts Out Dubai Business Partner in New Years Eve Speech", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-shouts-out-business-partner-in-new-years-eve-speech.html", "text": " During a ten-minute speech delivered to 800 guests at his New Years Eve party in Florida, Donald Trump called the press garbage, said the beautiful generals hes met with make Tom Cruise look like dirt, and repeatedly praised a Dubai-based business partner, according to CNN.

Build It Back is reportedly completing work on 75 homes each week, three times the pace it was moving in October. De Blasio also signed a law in early November that sped up the process. The law made it easier for contractors and homeowners to cut through red tape that often held up work on homes in need of repair. Even with those improvements, the program was nowhere near reaching the ambitious goal of completion by the end of 2016. Blame for the delay has been spread around and include particularly complicated rebuilds, difficulty finding temporary housing for those living in homes that need repair and mismanagement of the program.

During this entire time, President Obama has held power. This has afforded them the luxury of posturing against the status quo  and, indeed, doing everything in their power, at both the federal and the state level, to make it worse. Republicans could denounce the messy negotiations in Congress, and then the messy reality of American health care, while promising that giving them power would let them start over and design a new reform that would protect everybody without having any objectionable features. After the election unexpectedly put them in full control of government, I predicted they would follow a repeal and delay plan, because it is the only way to keep the lie going. The closer they get to taking action, the more clear it becomes to Republicans that their own propaganda has trapped them and given them no escape. Railing against Obamacare was easy, but the responsibilities of power have taken all the fun out of denying medical care to the poor and sick. From the standpoint of the most ideologically committed elements of the conservative base, destroying Obamacare was always the most salient pledge. Republican rhetoric treated the law as an existential threat to American freedom  the worst thing since slavery, as incoming Trump cabinet member Ben Carson put it. But from the standpoint of the electorate as a whole, the pledge to replace it with something terrific, as Trump put it, mattered just as much. A large number of Trump voters who get coverage through Obamacare simply felt Trump couldnt repeal a law that had done so much good for them, reports Sarah Kliff, who spoke with many of them. But any plan to replace Obamacare with something terrific, or even something almost as good as Obamacare, will violate conservative dogma. Theres no way around this. Despite the apparent complexity of the issue, its a very simple problem of resource allocation. In a free-market system, tens of millions of Americans will not be able to afford medical care because the cost of their treatment exceeds their income, either because theyre too poor, or because theyre too sick. A Kaiser Family Foundation analysis finds that 52 million Americans under the age of 65 have preexisting conditions that would make it impossible for them to purchase health insurance in the individual market that existed before Obamacare. An insurance-industry study from 2008 found that 13 percent of people who applied for coverage in the individual market were rejected  a figure that doesnt even count the 34 percent of people who had to buy policies that excluded coverage of treatments for their preexisting conditions, let alone those who didnt even bother applying because they knew they couldnt afford it. Covering people who cant afford to pay for their own medical care means making other people pay for it. You can do that through direct tax-and-spend transfers, or through indirect regulatory methods (like making insurance companies overcharge healthy people and undercharge sick ones). Republicans oppose these methods because they oppose redistribution in general. And yet politics requires them to promise a plan that does not deprive Americans of access to treatment. This is the reason none of their plans has advanced beyond the white-paper concept phase either they contain too much redistribution to be acceptable to the GOP, or too little coverage to be acceptable to the public, or both. The health-care plans people like are ones such as Medicare, or employer-sponsored insurance  plans in which all customers pay the same rates regardless of age or preexisting conditions, and which dont put them at risk of paying out huge costs if they get sick. Obamacare is less popular than those kinds of insurance because it has more market features. Theres more age discrimination, and higher deductibles designed to force consumers to be price-conscious. Republican health-care plans go much, much farther in this direction. They offer threadbare, catastrophic coverage with enormous deductibles. The English, vernacular term for the kind of insurance Republican health-care plans would offer is crappy. There is no world in which Republicans are going to give people something terrific or even close to it. Some Republicans appear to have convinced themselves they can muddle through the dilemma somehow. Congressional staffers tell Philip Klein, a staunch Obamacare critic, that they plan to repeal the law quickly, and then replace it not all at once but with a series of legislative changes that could be enacted in a series of shorter bills  for instance, one bill could theoretically be passed to address individuals with preexisting conditions. This plan is so laughably hopeless its difficult to believe Republicans would attempt it. Its impossible to gauge the impact of one change to the health-care system without knowing what other changes will be enacted. None of the stakeholders in the health-care system is going to support any discrete changes that could dramatically alter their business models without knowing what other changes may or may not follow. Preexisting conditions are an obvious example of this problem. If insurers will be required to provide below-cost plans to people with expensive medical needs, they need to know what other measures will be put in place to compensate them: Subsidies? Regulations on healthy customers? Hospitals need to know how many uninsured patients they should expect to show up in their emergency rooms. In particular, popular parts of health-care reform (like benefits people get) need to be attached to unpopular parts (like ways to pay for it). You cant address it in pieces. During the debate in Congress over health-care reform, Republicans ginned up a talking point about how reform should be done in small steps, but no serious person of any ideological perspective would construct a reform by passing a bunch of bills one at a time, without knowing whether the next bill will pass. Blowing up Obamacare, and then bringing up a series of small bills in the hope that they add up to something decent is not a strategy. Its what Homer Simpson came up with when he faced a test he knew he couldnt pass. (Ive been working on a plan. During the exam, Ill hide under some coats, and hope that somehow everything will work out.) Even some very conservative Republicans, who have spent years denouncing Obamacare as a socialist monstrosity, have acknowledged the political impossibility of throwing 20 million people off their insurance. If Republicans blow up Obamacare, the media and the left will blame the repeal vote for any turmoil in insurance markets, editorializes The Wall Street Journal, Republicans will own health care, like it or not. John Goodman, a conservative health-care-policy activist, concedes, Its not going to be politically possible to throw 20 million people out on the street without health insurance. Repeal-and-delay is the ultimate backhand acknowledgement that the party has no answers. Their wan hope is that by repealing the law, they can satisfy the blood lust of conservative activists. The repeal wont take place for years. Then they can hide under some coats and hope it all works out. But even this step has proven extremely tricky. If Republicans repeal Obamacare without creating a replacement, insurers will have little reason to stay in the marketplace. Theyll start canceling plans immediately, and the news will be filled with stories of Americans being thrown off their medication and, in some very real cases, dying. Repeal-and-delay will actually require taking additional action to prevent a meltdown. Insurers have begun negotiating behind-the-scenes with Republicans in Congress for concessions that would allow them to continue to cover their existing customers. Hospitals are also warning Republicans that blowing the system up without a replacement would expose them to massive financial risk. Obamacare financed its coverage expansion in part by reducing payments to hospitals that have to treat uninsured customers who show up at the emergency room, on the grounds that there would be fewer of them. If Republicans create millions more uninsured people, theyll start showing up in emergency rooms, and the hospitals will be on the hook. Republicans can certainly patch up the exchanges and keep them going during a transition period. All it would require is halting their relentless efforts to blow up the law and start trying to make it work. (They want to pump money back in to the insurers without appearing like theyre giving them a handout or bailing them out, one insurance lobbyist explains.) But if they do this, then theyll have essentially proven that they can fix Obamacare. And if they can fix it, why would they let it expire? Especially when the deadline for the replacement approaches and, inevitably, Republicans have still failed to produce a replacement? The most likely answer is that Republicans never craft a replacement. They repeal Obamacare, but delay the effective date of the repeal, and then Obamacare becomes a cliff that Congress votes to keep extending. There is no majority in Congress behind any one specific plan to replace Obamacare, but there is probably a majority against blowing it up immediately. That will likely become the new status quo. Theres no transition to a new plan. The transition is the plan. Or, at least, it will be. Sahil Kapur reports that Republicans in Congress are contemplating a transition period that could last as long as four years. It is obviously ludicrous to rush to repeal the law while delaying the effective date of the repeal for four years. Arch-conservatives in Congress are already lobbying to move up the repeal date for this reason  but even if they succeed in phasing out Obamacare over two or three years rather than four, it just means that Congress will have to pass another extension. The most likely outcome is that Republicans keep extending the law until Democrats have the presidency again, at which point theyll no longer have an incentive to prevent mass suffering, and can go back to opposing anything Democrats try to do to make the system work. Republicans just need to keep the system from collapsing on their watch. If Republicans truly believed Obamacare creates more victims than beneficiaries, they would blow it up immediately. And if they really had an alternative that was more popular, they would wait to write it before they eliminated it. Repeal-and-delay proves that neither one of these is true. They have no better plan. All they can do is promise some better plan lies over a horizon that will never arrive."}, {"date": "2017/01/02", "title": "ISIS Calls Istanbul Shooter a Heroic Soldier As Manhunt Continues", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/isis-calls-istanbul-shooter-heroic-as-manhunt-continues.html", "text": " The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the New Years Eve attack at an Istanbul nightclub that left at least 39 people dead and another 69 wounded.

Wrynn, an MTA employee, wears a blue hat with the agencys logo for his visit to the brand-new stop. Its never as nice as day one, he says. He would know  and not just because he works the G train. He went to the Hudson Yards debut, and though its been awhile, he saw the opening of the Jamaica Center and the F train station at 21st StreetQueensbridge in Long Island City in the late 1980s. Im a train buff, he adds. Hes not the only subway enthusiast among those lined up at the entrance to the 96th Street Subway entrance, waiting for the station to officially  and finally  open at 11:45 a.m., ahead of the first departure of the re-branded Q at noon. Most are bundled in puffy coats, and there are plenty of kids wriggling at their parents feet. Theres some festive gear: a pair of hard hats; a few Q-train-themed ones; and a guy in 2017 glasses paying tribute to the New Year and the brand-new subway thats arrived with it. Others, like Brad Balfour, an Upper East Sider who lives around the corner from the 96th Street entrance, the lines opening is more a consolation than a celebration. It was torture from the minute it started, he says. The Second Avenue line may be notorious not just for its expense, but also for its delays  its an infrastructure project dreamed up nearly a century ago  and those who stayed in the neighborhood have dealt with almost a decade of construction  a chorus of digging and drilling and the occasional unsettling blast. Im glad its here now that its done, Balfour says, but it was a boondoggle. In keeping with that tradition, the clock ticks a few minutes past 11:45 a.m. before Governor Andrew Cuomo arrives, joining MTA chair Tom Prendergast at the 96th Street stations entrance. Cuomo, who presided over the lines swank inaugural ride and party the night before, welcomes the crowd, though his greeting doesnt reach the back. Shut up and open the subway, a man yells. Lets go, screams a woman. And then the crowd jams forward: The Second Avenue subway is open. Smartphones and small digital cameras float above heads like satellites as people cross the threshold of the station, recording their descent down the escalators to the station below. A Metrocard swipe is the price of admission into the station, which at 96th Street is outfitted with a mural, Blueprint for a Landscape by Sarah Sze. Everyone goes down another flight from the mezzanine to the tracks. The trains wait. Their silver sides are plastered with the new Second Avenue logo; the insides are uncharacteristically clean and plastered with proSecond Avenue PSAs. The first train fills up on Track 2, rush-hour-delay packed. The doors close and it takes off, cameras following its path out of the station. An MTA station agent applauds, and other bystanders join in. One woman cries out: Finally. Another MTA platform agent, standing in front of the yet-to-be-opened train still in the station, assures the people left behind. Youll be the first, he says, on Track 1. The doors open and people board the Q, grabbing seats or spots near the windows. Stand clear of the closing doors, please, says the PA. The doors ding shut. Straphangers erupt in cheers and applause as the train lurches forward, headed south. Its wonderful, like being a kid in a candy store, says Rebecca Cruz, an Upper East Sider who nabbed a seat. Everyone is talking to each other. Beajea Payne, who lives in East Harlem, brought her three kids for the ride. Her 7-year-old son, Jamari, is autistic and a train fanatic. Weve been anticipating this for a long time, she says. Her son wears a red hat and grips the subway pole while cradling an A train figurine. I love the Q, Jamari adds, with wonder, as the train departs. After 86th Street, the Second Avenue subway becomes, well, the subway. We are delayed because of train traffic ahead, crackles the PA. People laugh  of course, theyre halted in a train tunnel already. But the novelty of being the first to be delayed on the Second Avenue line wears off fast.

A man in a blue jacket leans his forehead against the subway pole, closes his eyes. As the train crawls to the next station, Sylvia Rivera, who lives in East Harlem, says she had to ride the train because she and her husband had been waiting decades for the line. Her husband, however, had missed it. He passed away. He never got see it. The ride was beautiful, she insists, before getting off at the next stop. Bernice Canadate, a 54-year-old Upper West Side resident, grabs a seat when the train empties out. I wanted to see if it was worth the wait. It was, for the most part, except for the delays. It was a longer ride than I expected, she says. I guess theyre testing us. By 57th and 7th Avenue, whatever spell that had made New Yorkers turn into tourists for a brief afternoon breaks. The train clears out. A woman opens a book and pages through it. A pile of crumbs has appeared near the car doors. A man with a rolling suitcase wedged between his legs says he is actually trying to get somewhere. But back up at the new stations on Second Avenue, crowds are still pouring in. They didnt get on the first train, maybe, but being there on opening day is good enough. Everyone needed a Second Avenue subway selfie  in front of Lou Reed, one of Chuck Closes Subway Portraits at 86th Street, or the new subway maps, or even the waiting trains. At 96th Street, Steve Bloom, a native New Yorker who lives in Bensonhurst, snaps a few photos. He had traveled the entire Q line, from Coney Island, to get here. He says he didnt doubt that the Second Avenue subway would open.

Politico says that Hurt, who wrote the now-out-of-print 1993 biography Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump, was at the club playing golf with his friend, billionaire and conservative-cause financier David Koch, and two others. Its not totally clear what exactly went down regarding the ejection, since there are four versions of the story between Hurt, an unnamed Trump transition-team official, a Koch associate, and GOP donor John M. Damgard, who was also part of Hurt and Kochs four-person golfing group. According to a third-person post on Hurts Facebook page, he approached Trump at a practice tee to wish him congratulations on his election as president, and Trump took the opportunity to criticize the veracity of Hurts biography. Hurt says he replied that his book was all true (it reported, among other allegations, that Trumps ex-wife Ivana had accused him of rape in court documents pertaining to their divorce  a claim she later recanted). The testy exchange then ended with Trump telling Hurt, youre out of here (per the Trump transition official) and/or Trump telling Hurt it was inappropriate for him to be present at the course (per Hurt). The author then says he, David Koch, and the other members of their group were then escorted to the clubs parking lot by security personnel, and went on to play at the Emerald Dunes golf course instead, which is a much, much better golf course than Trump International, according to Hurt. He also said that Koch called Trump petty and vulgar on account of the incident. According to the unnamed Trump transition official who spoke with Politico, the exchange went as Hurt described it, but added that Hurt was trying to instigate a confrontation with Trump, suggesting that the author was looking for publicity. The official also said that Hurt didnt leave after he was told to, but rejoined his golfing group, and that course security actually had to go and tap him on the shoulder and tell him to leave, and after Koch protested, they told the billionaire GOP donor that he could either leave with Hurt or play without him. (Hurt said the reason they didnt immediately leave was because they had to collect their belongings, but that they werent forced out either.) According to Damgard, another golfer in the group, they never even interacted with club security, and just decided to depart together after hearing that Hurt had been told to leave  though he added that Hurt didnt detail his exchange with Trump at the time. Damgard also said that Hurt had approached Trump because he was with a young lady who was a friend and he thought it would be fun to introduce her to the president-elect. He said he only learned of the bad blood between Trump and Hurt afterwards. According to one of David Kochs associates who was briefed on the incident and spoke with Politico, Hurt only went up to Trump as a courtesy. Koch is a member of Trumps golf club, and when Hurt, a longtime golfing buddy, offered to leave the group after the Trump incident so they could keep playing, Koch replied, No, we came as a foursome and well leave as a foursome. Damgard insisted that Koch would have tried to avoid the incident if he had known it were possible beforehand, since he loves golfing at Trumps club so much. Koch and his brother Charles sat out the 2016 presidential election, as both were publicly displeased with the available candidates after Trump won the Republican nomination. Hurt no longer writes books and now apparently teaches high school and college courses. Over the summer, he asked his publisher for Lost Tycoon, W.W. Norton, to republish the biography in light of Trumps presidential campaign, but they declined, citing legal risks and expenses. Hurt tried to self-publish the book on Amazon, but apparently sold only 60 copies. He and a small publisher then ran a modest Kickstarter campaign to republish a limited run of the book and framed the fundraiser as a way to help prevent Trump from becoming president. It successfully raised $5,392."}, {"date": "2017/01/01", "title": "Istanbul Nightclub Attack Kills 39, Gunman Still at Large", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/istanbul-nightclub-attack-kills-39-gunman-still-at-large.html", "text": " At least 39 people are dead and 69 wounded after a gunman attacked a popular Istanbul nightclub on New Years Eve in Turkey. A manhunt is currently underway for the gunman, and no terrorist organization has yet claimed responsibility for the attack, which struck the upscale Reina nightclub on the coast of the Bosphorus in the European part of Istanbul. The gunman, armed with a Kalashnikov assault rifle, struck around 1:15 a.m. Sunday, first killing a police officer and civilian outside the club, then entering and opening fire on the as many as 700 partygoers inside. Initial reports that the attack was carried out by three gunmen dressed in Santa Claus suits appear to have been incorrect. Instead, the apparently lone attacker was dressed in black, and reportedly shouted Allahu Akbar during the assault, according to witnesses. Some reports indicate that the assailant may have been armed with bombs as well. Panicked revelers rushed for the exits once the attack started, and some apparently jumped from the clubs patio into the Bosphorus in order to swim away from the carnage. Witnesses said they saw dozens of bodies on the floor of the club, and many of the survivors apparently had to climb over the fallen to escape. Some witnesses reported seeing multiple attackers, but Turkish authorities have said they are currently looking for only one assailant, and video footage of the attack appears to show only one perpetrator. At least 24 of the dead were foreign nationals, according to a Turkish MP, including seven Saudi Arabians, three Iraqis, and others  some of whom were dual-nationals  from Lebanon, Tunisia, India, Syria, Israel, France, Belgium, and Kuwait. At least 11 Turkish nationals were killed as well. Four of the 69 people who were injured remained in critical condition on Sunday. One American is reportedly among the injured. The Reina club, which has a patio which overlooks the Bosphorus in the Ortakoy district of Istanbul, caters to an affluent secular clientele, including foreigners and Turkish celebrities. The clubs owner said they had bolstered security in advance of the New Years Eve celebration after American intelligence officials had warned Turkish authorities and Americans in Turkey of a possible large-scale attack by Islamist terrorists. President Obama offered his condolences over the attack while on holiday in Hawaii. Other world leaders have done the same and swiftly condemned the attack as well. The BBC reports that some 17,000 Turkish police officers were already on duty in Istanbul following the numerous terrorist attacks that have been carried out in Turkey over the past year, as well as a failed military coup in July. A bombing in early December killed 44 people, mostly police officers, outside a soccer stadium in Istanbul. That attack was likely carried out by Kurdish separatists, who typically target Turkish military or police personnel. Large-scale attacks on civilians, like the one in June at Istanbuls Atatrk airport, or the August bombing of a wedding party in the city of Gaziantep, were conducted by ISIS-linked terrorists. At least 152 people have been killed across six attacks in Istanbul over the past year, and many other cities in Turkey have suffered similar violence as well:"}, {"date": "2017/03/10", "title": "Trump Suggests Obama Always Wanted Obamacare to Collapse in 2017", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/trump-suggests-obama-designed-the-aca-to-collapse-in-2017.html", "text": " Donald Trump has spouted a lot of baseless conspiracy theories about Barack Obama. In fact, theres a strong case that Trump would never have won the White House, were he not such a shameless disseminator of delusional lies about Americas first black president. At various points, Trump has accused Obama of lying about his birthplace, secretly aiding ISIS, secretly being a Muslim, and wiretapping Trumps phone. On Friday, the president added another charge to his indictment: Obama deliberately designed the Affordable Care Act to fall apart  and cause massive suffering  as soon as he left office. 2017 would be a disaster for Obamacare, Trump said in a meeting with the Houses GOP leadership. Thats the year it was meant to explode, because Obama wont be here. Thats when it was supposed to be, get even worse. As bad as it is now, itll get even worse. The ACA was meant to explode and supposed to  get even worse, the year that Obama left the White House. Why, exactly, Obama would design his signature domestic achievement to collapse at the end of his (then, hypothetical) second term is unclear. Maybe he knew a Republican would succeed him, and he wanted to stick them with the blame? Or, perhaps, he wanted to inflict grievous harm on the American people  but escape responsibility for it? Regardless, its worth noting that Trump could try to use the powers of the executive branch to make his own prediction come true. If the Department of Health and Human Services actively works to undermine sign-ups for the ACA  as it considered doing this year  its not inconceivable that Trump could engineer the (currently nonexistent) death spirals he promises. Which would, ostensibly, make it easier to push Paul Ryans deeply unpopular Obamacare replacement through Congress. Then again, it seems highly unlikely that the public would blame Democrats for a health- care crisis that happened under a Republican presidents watch. As the Washington Posts Greg Sargent notes, Trumps best bet, politically, is probably to just pass nothing, let the ACA continue as is  and keep blaming Obama for everything that Americans dont like about their health-care system: Out: Repeal and replace.

The real Schwarzenegger is considering doing something similar in 2018, when he might run for the U.S. Senate so he could be a thorn in President Trumps fleshy side. Politico reports that the former California governor is eyeing the Senate seat currently occupied by Dianne Feinstein, who will be 85 next year, when shes up for reelection. Its unclear whether Schwarzeneggers potential run would be with the GOP or as an independent, but what is clear is that he would be anti-Trump. Unlike those in the GOP who aligned against Trump in the Republican primaries only to slink over to his side in the general election, Schwarzenegger remained steadfastly against him. A month before the election, Schwarzenegger put out a statement saying that he would not vote for the Republican in a presidential race for the first time since becoming a citizen. Asked about Schwarzeneggers 2018 plans by Politico, his spokesperson didnt deny that the former Governator may try to become a Senatator. Right now Gov. Schwarzeneggers focus is on using his platform to bring some sensibility and coherency to Washington by fighting for redistricting reform, like we did in California, Daniel Ketchell told Politico. We are keeping all of our options open as far as how we can accomplish that. While Politico quotes one expert who believes Schwarzenegger would become an instant player should he run for office, its worth remembering that he left Sacramento in early 2011 with a 23 percent approval rating and a $28 billion budget shortfall. The economy was to blame for some of his unpopularity, but so too were his efforts to balance the budget by cutting spending on programs that helped the states most vulnerable populations. He was so unpopular by the time his term was ending that current governor Jerry Brown was able to sink his opponent, former eBay CEO Meg Whitman, by suggesting that she was the second coming of Schwarzenegger. On top of his political shortcomings, Schwarzenegger is also an oft-accused groper who fathered a child with a household worker. Trump may have proved that sexual impropriety isnt the impediment to higher office that it once was, but it sure seems like California could do better."}, {"date": "2017/03/10", "title": "State Department Reportedly Didnt Know the Mexican Foreign Minister Was in Town", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/report-state-dept-didnt-know-mexican-minister-was-in-d-c.html", "text": " Rex Tillerons State Department cannot catch a break.

The latest evidence came Thursday, when the State Departments acting spokesman Mark Toner said, that he was unaware that the Mexican foreign minister Luis Videgaray was in Washington, D.C., for discussions. Videgaray, instead, met with White House officials, and it appears he might not have given his counterpart Tillerson a buzz to let him know he was in town  a departure from the usual protocol. And Im not sure  I cant speak to whether theres going to be any meetings at the State Department at any level, Toner added, when asked if Videgaray would meet with agency officials. Videgaray did meet with top White House aide and President Trumps son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has reportedly worked behind the scenes before with the Mexican minister. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and Trump financial adviser Gary Cohn also sat down with Videgaray. According to the Los Angeles Times, Videgaray later said that he did call Tillerson to inform him of his D.C. visit, perhaps indicating some confusion or miscommunication at the upper levels of State. (Toner is a holdover from the previous administration; he will reportedly be replaced by Fox & Friends anchor Heather Nauert.) Videgaray added that he and Tillerson  who made the trip to Mexico City in February with Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly  would meet in the coming weeks, but that, on this particular trip, he had a specific issue to discuss with the White House: a suggestion from the Department of Homeland Security that the U.S. would consider separating children from parents who were caught crossing the border illegally, as a deterrent to families.

According to the Washington Post, Mulvaney was the deal-closer in a key White House meeting on Friday that built (or forced) consensus among congressional Republican leaders who will be jointly unveiling Obamacare legislation any day now  even as the ostensible administration point man, HHS Secretary Tom Price, was hanging out with Paul Ryan and Mike Pence in Wisconsin. Heres how the Post explained the switcheroo: Aside from his personal credibility from being a member of the Houses conservative wing until he was confirmed on February 16, Mulvaney could be useful as a protector of the presidents right flank on Obamacare in two very important ways. He illustrated the first during a wide-ranging interview this morning with radio host and conservative opinion-leader Hugh Hewitt. Mulvaney was questioned closely on two subjects: his commitment to Trumps defense buildup (he seemed to pass Hewitts test despite much grumbling from hawks like John McCain that he cared too much about deficits and too little about giving the Pentagon whatever it wants), and his willingness to buck Trumps promises to protect entitlement programs. Mulvaneys rap on entitlements was revealing: You have to appreciate that every proposal to cut and/or privatize Social Security and Medicare is invariably packaged as an effort to protect and save the programs. So what Mulvaney is really promising to do is to help show Trump how to invert what everyone understood at the time to be the candidates commitment on entitlements and make it a rationale for doing the exact opposite. Better yet, from the conservative ideological point of view, Mulvaney suggested that the first step toward entitlement reform and the hallowed goal of decimating the New DealGreat Society legacy would be to repeal and replace Obamacare as quickly as possible: To translate this into conservative talk, that means if you want to protect and save Social Security and Medicare, youd better get onboard the first train that comes along to protect and save Medicaid via a block grant or per capita cap. And so, conservatives, get over your scruples about any particular Obamacare bill and understand its all part of Gods plan to undo the work of FDR and LBJ and get rid of the welfare state. Its a pitch Mulvaney is well-equipped to make. But theres another way in which Mulvaney can be even more useful to the cause of keeping the GOPs right flank under control as the sausage gets made on Obamacare: as a counter to any inconvenient numbers the Congressional Budget Office might come up with in scoring Republican repeal/replace legislation. This has become a huge issue, as explained by conservative writer Christopher Jacobs: If CBO winds up projecting that any given Obamacare bill will massively increase the budget deficit or greatly erode health-care coverage  for the country as a whole or for politically important constituencies like older and/or non-college educated white folks  wont it be useful to have OMB at the ready to dispute the numbers and offer their own, er, alternative facts? Indeed, nothing in law requires Congress to use CBO estimates to begin with. If congressional leaders choose to go with better OMB numbers, who is going to stop them? It would not be the first time its happened, as those old enough to remember Ronald Reagans OMB cooking the books can attest. Perhaps some of the concerns Trump loyalists had about Mulvaneys selection as OMB director got it wrong. Instead of being a fanatical deficit hawk throwing sand into the gears of the Trump machine, perhaps he is a double agent selling Trumps agenda to his old allies by hook or by crook."}, {"date": "2017/03/06", "title": "First State Department Press Briefing of Trump Administration Canceled", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/first-trump-state-department-press-briefing-canceled.html", "text": " The State Department hasnt held a daily press briefing since January 19, the last full day of the Obama administration. That nearly six-week break was supposed to end Monday, March 6  but the wait continues for at least another day. The first daily press briefing under Trump was canceled so as reportedly not to compete with the announcement of the White Houses new executive order on travel. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson appeared with Department of Homeland Security secretary John Kelly and Attorney General Jeff Sessions for the rollout of the new measure to restrict travel from six majority-Muslim countries and to temporarily suspend resettlement of refugees. The State Department daily briefings date back to the Eisenhower administration. The sessions are seen as a key communication tool for Americas diplomatic agenda, giving guidance to those in foreign service representing the U.S. abroad and broadcasting policy priorities to allies and adversaries and to the few people watching the televised sessions on C-Span. According to the Washington Post, former secretary of State John Kerry had in his first month given a welcome address when he assumed the role of top diplomat, a speech at the University of Virginia, and 15 readouts. Tillerson reportedly will not do anything similar. Acting spokesman for the State Department Mark Toner confirmed to Politico that he will lead the press briefing. But Toner, who is a career civil servant, might not even be at his post much longer; he will reportedly soon be replaced by Fox & Friends news anchor Heather Nauert. The lack of public communication from the State Department, and Tillersons relative silence  he addressed State Department employees after he was sworn in, and delivered very brief remarks after meeting with his Russian counterpart in Bohn, but has mostly dodged questions from reporters  has led to speculation that Tillerson has been sidelined by a White House that is reluctant to let its State Department take the lead on foreign-policy decisions. Trump is expected to slash the State Department budget  perhaps by a third. Such drastic cuts will likely face bipartisan opposition, and have gotten pushback from retired military leaders  and from Secretary of Defense James Mattis."}, {"date": "2017/03/06", "title": "Trumps Wiretap Charge Seems to Be a Fabulist Take on Murky Legal Proceeding", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/trump-wiretap-charge-fabulist-take-on-murky-legal-proceeding.html", "text": " The weekends of many a journalist and lawyer were disturbed by the 45th presidents tweetstorm alleging that the 44th president went so low as to tapp my phones [sic] at Trump Tower prior to the election. It would be a shocking coincidence if the Trump tantrum was not spurred by a Breitbart story the very day before charging that Barack Obama sought to execute a silent coup against Trump utilizing surveillance operations. Separating fact from fiction and mischaracterization is difficult in a situation that involves highly classified operations and incredibly arcane legal processes. But the best guess we can make is that Breitbart picked up and significantly distorted some earlier British reporting on FBI surveillance requests related to its ongoing investigation of possible Russian interference with the 2016 election, and then Trump added his own distinctive twists to the story as he imagined it. What does actually seem to have happened is this, as explained by Julian Sanchez: In Breitbarts account, the FBI became the Obama administration, and in Trumps, it was Obama himself. This is not a small detail, since any White House knowledge about, to say nothing of direction of, this type of surveillance would be illegal. Similarly, the approved surveillance in October was aimed at Russian banks, not anyone in the Trump campaign, and was very likely limited to stored financial records to determine whether money changed hands with respect to the 2016 elections. In the Breitbart version, this became wiretaps and monitoring an opposing presidential campaign using the high-tech surveillance powers of the federal intelligence services. Trump simplified it all to Obama tapp[ing] my phones. So while it is probably not accurate to say the whole brouhaha is a Trumpian fabrication, it sure appears to be a fabulist interpretation of murky events. The alternative explanation is a blatantly extralegal surveillance operation orchestrated by Barack Obama, who despite all appearances to the contrary was able to use James Comey and the FBI as his pawns. The events surrounding FISC proceedings are, by the way, murky by design, which leads to another can of worms: Trump may be incidentally declassifying large swaths of secret information via his Twitter tirades. The laws surrounding covert surveillance are meant to ensure thorough review of requests to make sure the silent coup Breitbart is alleging cannot occur  but for obvious reasons the proceedings are indeed silent. If the president himself can blow all this up on social media, then we really are at risk of a system where political whim is the only law."}, {"date": "2017/03/06", "title": "White House Staffers Blame Reince Priebus, Not Erratic Boss, for Chaotic Start", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/reince-priebus-blamed-white-house-chaos.html", "text": " President Trump spent the weekend steaming, raging mad, according to the Washington Post.

Comey apparently argued that Trumps false allegation, which could not be supported by evidence, implied that the FBI had broken the law and had to be corrected.

No evidence has been provided by either Trump or the White House to back up the wiretap claim, which almost certainly entered Trumps head via a conservative radio hosts conspiracy theory. Nonetheless, the White House is pushing forward with the idea, and the president has even called on Congress to investigate the matter, though the wiretap claims have done little to distract from the investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Indeed, one of the concerns put forward by senior FBI officials to the Times is that Trumps false allegation will actually make the public more suspicious of the president, in that officials are also said to be worried that the notion of a court-approved wiretap will raise the publics expectations that the federal authorities have significant evidence implicating the Trump campaign in colluding with Russias efforts to disrupt the presidential election.

Then news broke that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had likely lied during his confirmation hearings about not having had any contact with the Russian government during Trumps presidential campaign, forcing Sessions to recuse himself on Thursday from any further investigation of the campaigns ties to Russia  an outcome which reportedly made Trump livid. On Friday, the president started lashing out at Democrats, demanding an immediate investigation into Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumers sharing of donuts with Vladimir Putin 14 years ago. Then, in a trademark early-morning Twitter rant on Saturday, Trump went a big step further and claimed  without citing any evidence  that President Obama had ordered a wiretap of him during the campaign: President Obamas spokesperson, Kevin Lewis, rejected Trumps claim on Saturday afternoon: So where did Trump come up with his allegations? The prevailing theory is that by saying just found out, Trump really meant I just heard about a Breitbart story detailing a conservative radio hosts conspiracy theory that Obama had staged a silent coup against me  though Trump did not cite the Breitbart story or any other source. The New York Times originally reported that none of Trumps staff was willing to offer an explanation for the claim, though the Times later reported that White House counsel Donald McGahn was working on Saturday to secure access to what [a senior White House official] described as a document issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court authorizing surveillance of Mr. Trump and his associates, though they add that the official offered no evidence that such a document even exists, and that any such request would be considered unprecedented White House interference in an ongoing investigation at the Justice Department. Meanwhile, other government officials appear to be scratching their heads: As far as how other Republicans are reacting to the story, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, when asked by Fox News Brett Baier on Friday whether or not he was worried that the Obama administration had been surveilling members of the Trump campaign, said I dont think thats the case. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, asked about the story during a town hall meeting with constituents on Saturday, acknowledged that if Trump was correct, it would be the biggest political scandal since Watergate, and said he was worried if, in fact, the Obama administration was able to obtain a warrant lawfully about Trump campaign activity with foreign governments. Senator Ben Sasse, however, went much further. In a statement released on Saturday, the Nebraska Republican demanded that Trump back up such serious claims, insisting that we are in the midst of a civilization-warping crisis of public trust, and the Presidents allegations today demand the thorough and dispassionate attention of serious patriots: Assuming Trumps claim is just another right-wing conspiracy theory, heres a good walk-through from CNNs Brian Stelter on how the Breitbart story may have led to Trumps tweets: Then again, if Trumps outburst was indeed the result of information he received at six in the morning from U.S. law-enforcement officials, he would thus seem to be confirming media reports that the Justice Department had collected enough evidence to convince a judge to issue a FISA warrant in the Russia investigation  meaning that there was probable cause that the Trump campaign had ties to Russia, or that Trump himself was culpable. Aside from the fact that calling attention to such a possibility probably isnt the best way to deflect attention from your campaigns potential Russia ties, Trumps conclusion is also suspect due to the fact that the alleged wiretap would have been extremely difficult to set up legally without cause. Heres what a former senior intelligence official told the Washington Post in response to Trumps tweets: None of this means a FISA warrant wasnt issued to tap members of the Trump campaign. It has already been widely reported that there is an ongoing FBI investigation into some of Trump campaign officials alleged ties to Russia, and its possible that wiretaps of those officials have been a part of that investigation. (Trumps Russia-linked former campaign manager Paul Manafort, for instance, has an apartment at Trump Tower in Manhattan.) In addition, the phones of Russian officials are routinely monitored by U.S. intelligence agencies, which is how Trumps former national-security adviser Michael Flynn was recorded having a conversation with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak  surveillance which ultimately led to Flynns downfall. But the allegation that Trump made on Saturday was that President Obama had ordered a wiretap on him, which would have been either incredibly hard to do legally, or illegal, as there are laws and procedures in place which are designed to prevent presidents from surveilling political rivals. So, Trump may have been carelessly passing along a baseless conspiracy theory without confirming its veracity with government officials, and thus using the bully pulpit of the White House to accuse a former president of a criminal act. Or, if President Obama did personally order a wiretap on Trump as the new president alleges, that would indeed be an enormous Watergate-level scandal. Or, if the Justice Department was operating independently as designed, and law-enforcement agents gathered enough evidence linking Trump campaign officials to Russia for a judge to authorize a wiretap, that is also a big deal, and even bigger news if agents gathered enough evidence to get a warrant to tap Trump himself. The most likely explanation, however, is still that Trump probably had no informed idea what he was talking about. Indeed, there are reports that numerous Trump aides were surprised by Trumps allegations on Saturday, even though its also been reported that the Breitbart story was being passed around by White House staff on Friday. Then again, Trump, who on Tuesday told Congress that the time for trivial fights is behind us, did have another, far less surprising concern to air his thoughts about on Saturday morning: This post has been updated throughout to incorporate additional information and context."}, {"date": "2017/03/04", "title": "Interstate Insurance Sales Probably Wont Work, But If They Do Were in Trouble", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/the-problem-with-interstate-health-insurance-sales.html", "text": " The call for interstate health-insurance sales is the most ritualistic part of every conservative plan for reforming health care or replacing Obamacare  even more automatic than Health Savings Accounts or going after malpractice lawsuits  and there it was again in President Trumps February 28 speech to Congress: It sounds good, even noncontroversial: Why shouldnt people be able to shop for whatever health-insurance policy they want, wherever it is issued? Isnt competition a good thing? Yes and no. What advocates of interstate sales rarely acknowledge is that sweeping away state restrictions on policies also sweeps away state standards for minimum benefits, pricing, marketing, and all sorts of other safeguards. As Catherine Rampell notes in the Washington Post, that might be all right if the legislation authorizing interstate sales set new national rules for insurance policies. That is what the Affordable Care Act did, which is why that legislation authorized (as Republicans somehow never acknowledge) interstate sales so long as the states involved sign off on it. The thing is, insurance companies decided not to take up on the offer: Republican proposals to repeal and replace Obamacare would typically sweep away the ACAs national regulations, and particularly those that mandate certain benefits. So what interstate sales in that context would mean is being able to set up in low-regulation states and then steal the most profitable customers in high-regulation states. So by virtue of a race to the bottom, interstate sales would create a massive death spiral for insurance pools in states that didnt immediately abandon all their standards. Thats if insurance companies decide its all worth the trouble. Otherwise, the scheme would simply be worthless. As Rampell concludes: Too bad its so complicated."}, {"date": "2017/03/04", "title": "Trumps New Russia Scandal Defense Is to Pose As the Victim of Obama", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/trumps-new-russia-scandal-defense-pose-as-obama-victim.html", "text": " It is usually a mistake to read Donald Trumps tweets as reflecting any course of action more considered than dyspeptic gut responses to whatever news has flashed across his face at the moment. Donald Trumps splenetic Saturday morning tweets, alleging that Barack Obama wiretapped his phones came as a surprise to his advisers. Accusing the former president of serious crimes, and threatening legal action against him, is the sort of step that most presidents would not take without some advance planning. And indeed, not long after alleging that the former administration had consummated a Watergate-esque scheme to subvert the democratic process and destroy him, Trump was moving on to beef with the successor as host of his old reality-television show. Still, elements of a long-term strategy, accidental or otherwise, could be gleaned from the rant. The president may well have previewed the line of argument that may emerge as his primary defense. Before this morning, Trumps message on the Russia scandal has emphasized his innocence. He and his associates have done nothing wrong, and all the charges reflect baseless Democratic attempts to make excuses for Crooked Hillarys sad defeat (i.e., Russia talk is FAKE NEWS put out by the Dems, and played up by the media, in order to mask the big election defeat and the illegal leaks!). His new line of argument ignores the question of his own guilt or innocence and turns the accusation against his predecessor, who  Trump alleges  ordered Trumps phones to be wiretapped. The apparent source of this theory is a radio rant by right-wing talk-show host Mark Levin, which was aggregated by the pro-Trump conservative ethnonationalist site Breitbart, and which (Robert Costa reports) came to the attention of the White House staff. Since wiretaps must be legally approved by a special court and would require a high standard of evidence, it is highly unlikely that Levins theory is correct. (Or, at least, the theory assumes an act of breathtaking illegality by Obama for which Levin has produced no evidence.) It is also fairly ironic that Trump has chosen to compare Obama to Richard Nixon and Joseph McCarthy, given that Trump was closely mentored by the key architect of McCarthys smear campaign, and deliberately patterned his own campaign on Nixons. But intellectual coherence or consistency are not baseline requirements for the messaging task Trump needs. If the Russia scandal continues to produce revelations of unethical or unpatriotic behavior by his campaign, he will need a response that can rally the conservative base behind him (and thus make Republicans in Congress reluctant to support independent investigations or even impeachment proceedings). Turning the charge against Obama does that for him. It reframes the issue as a matter of the hated Obama abusing his power to discredit Trump. Any information flowing from the scandal is therefore presumptively tainted by its association with the former president. The benefit of this line of reasoning is that it does not require conservatives to actually defend Trumps behavior. All thats needed is for their distrust of Obama to overcome their misgivings about Trump  a condition that describes virtually the entire Republican base. Notably, Mark Levin himself had lined up behind Ted Cruz against Trump during the presidential primary, calling Trumps attacks on Cruz Nixonian and  even using the strongest rebuke in the conservative movement lexicon  Alinskyite. Now Levin is back on the team and, having forgotten his earlier diagnosis of Trumps character and honesty, redirecting his anger against the Democrats. Conveniently for Trump, while unifying his base, attacking the alleged crimes of Obama also attracts support from left-wing sources like the Nation and the Intercept, which have consistently dismissed the Russia scandal as neo-McCarthyism. A crucial element to Trumps success during the campaign was his ability to position himself as an insurgent, marshalling the support of Americans who had a wide range of discontent with the status quo under a single antiestablishment candidacy. Every populist who wins an election has to deal with the tricky problem of converting a political style that requires a lack of power or responsibility to the condition of having both. By making himself a victim of Obamas alleged abuses of power, Trump revives and extends his status as insurgent indefinitely. The most powerful person on earth will remain the victim of a conspiracy so vast."}, {"date": "2017/03/02", "title": "Team Trump Scrapped Ethics Training Program for Incoming White House Staffers", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/team-trump-scrapped-ethics-training-for-white-house-staffers.html", "text": " Unlike the staffers serving under Presidents Bush and Obama, White House officials working for President Trump were not treated to an ethics course that could have helped them avoid some of the upheaval in the first month of Trumps presidency, Politico reports.

True love for our people requires us to  cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future. According to Axios, a senior administration official confirmed that parts of Trumps speech sounded like Ivanka for good reason: Ivanka helped write them. A week ago, Ivanka and Dina Powell met with the president on those parts of the speech with [Stephen] Miller and Hope [Hicks], and talked about those issues and how they would resonate in an important way, the official said. She reportedly worked with Miller on Tuesday afternoon to get the paragraph just right. This is far from the first time Ivanka has used her status as her dads favorite to push for issues she cares about. She and Powell are reportedly lobbying hard for a child-care deduction to be included in Trumps tax plan; she spearheaded a meeting with Justin Trudeau to address barriers facing female entrepreneurs; and she stood right behind the presidential desk when her dad signed two laws to encourage women to enter STEM fields.

Just yesterday, the conservative Washington Examiner explained that these are precisely the positions someone like Trump needs to fill if he is serious about draining the swamp in Washington: So using these top positions to achieve reductions in the size of the bureaucracy, as Trump seems to suggest is his rationale, is a pretty classic unforced error. Its like trying to reduce overcrowding in schools by firing most of the teachers. One might be tempted to think the president misspoke out of a desire to avoid admitting his team hasnt gotten its act together just yet. Earlier he tried to blame the slow pace of appointments on Senate Democrats obstructing confirmations, before it was pointed out how few nominations had been made in the first place.

And while Trump says his White House is running like a fine-tuned machine, members of Congress are still unclear on his policy objectives for everything from tax reform to infrastructure. Uncertainty over his plans for Obamacare repeal in particular has left Republican lawmakers exposed and uneasy. On Tuesday night, President Trump will attempt to address these issues and refocus his administration in his first address to a joint session of Congress. The official theme of the speech is renewal of the American spirit. Technically it isnt a state of the union address, but it will look exactly the same  though presumably Trump will put his own twist on his first prime-time speech as president. Heres a rundown of what we know about the address. Its scheduled from 9 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., Eastern time. The speech will be broadcast on every major TV network and all the cable news channels. For those who dont have access to a TV, it will also be livestreamed by multiple media outlets. You can watch YouTubes broadcast here, and the PBS NewsHour/Twitter stream here. On Monday the White House gave media outlets  including the conspiracy-theory website Infowars  a preview of the speech consisting of 11 bullet points (the presidents preferred style). Most of the points are vague. It says Trump will explain how hes keeping his promises to the American people, call on Congress to act, and look to the future and talk about what we can achieve if we come together. But it also lists elements of the bold agenda Trump intends to work with Congress to achieve. These include:  Tax and regulatory reform to get relief to hardworking Americans and American businesses. Making the workplace better for working parents. Saving American families from the disaster of Obamacare. Making sure every child in America has access to a good education. A great rebuilding of the American military. Fulfilling our commitments to our veterans and making sure they have access to the care they need. The Trump administration hasnt offered many details, but the president is expected to make his case for a $54 billion increase in military spending and a corresponding cut to domestic and foreign-aid programs, including big cuts to the EPA, the IRS, the State Department, and social safety-net programs (but not Social Security or Medicare). Trump said on Sunday that he would lay out specifics on how he wants to replace Obamacare, a surprisingly complicated topic that he appeared to be rethinking as recently as Friday. Despite a recent report that Trumps infrastructure plan would be put off to 2018, on Monday the president told governors visiting the White House that hed lay out his plans in Tuesdays address. Were going to make it easier for states to address their infrastructure, and Im going to have a big statement tomorrow night on infrastructure, Trump said. Were going to start spending on infrastructure big. While the speech will be written by Stephen Miller, who crafted Trumps dystopian inaugural address, the White House said the tone will be optimistic. Though, as NPR notes, Previews from Trump aides have not always panned out. For instance, we were told his inaugural address would focus on unity. It didnt. The White House released a list of six people who will be seated with the First Lady during the speech. Guests include a school-voucher success story, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalias widow, and three people whose family members were killed by an undocumented immigrant. Four Democratic lawmakers plan to bring undocumented immigrants who were given permission to live and work in the U.S. under President Obamas Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Senator Dick Durbins guest will be Aaima Sayed, who left Pakistan as a toddler and is now a third-year medical student at Loyola University. I hope her presence reminds President Trump whats at stake in the debate over DACA: the lives of more than 750,000 innocent young people and the wellbeing of entire communities, the senator said. Representative Luis Gutierrez hopes to highlight the effects of Trumps immigration ban by bringing a Chicago immigration attorney who is the daughter of refugees from Gaza.If he looks up during the speech, Gutierrez said, I want Trump to see the face of a woman, the face of a Muslim, and the face of someone whose family has enriched and contributed to this country despite starting out as refugees. The Democrats went with a risky choice for their rebuttal: former Kentucky governor Steve Beshear. The 72-year-old has been out of office for more than a year, but he presided over one of the Affordable Care Acts biggest success stories  and in a deeply conservative state. The selection of Beshear is a sign that Democrats intend to stay focused on health care on Tuesday, no matter what drama unfolds around Trump."}, {"date": "2017/02/27", "title": "Trumps Justice Department Drops Opposition to Texas Voter-ID Law", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trumps-doj-decides-texas-voter-id-law-is-actually-good.html", "text": " Poor, nonwhite Americans are disproportionately likely to lack a government-issued photo ID.

They also tend to insist that this policy preference has nothing to do with the voting habits of poor, nonwhite people  when they remember that theyre supposed to do that, anyway. This has made voter-ID laws a perennial source of civil-rights litigation. But the legal fight over Texass voter-ID law has been especially fierce. There are a few reasons for this. For one, there may be no other state where Republicans have more to lose from a sharp uptick in voter participation among nonwhite voters: If Texass Hispanic citizens turned out at the same rate as its non-Hispanic whites, it would (almost certainly) be a swing state by now. For another, the states vast geography makes the ID requirement more onerous than it is in other areas  civil-rights groups claim that some Texas residents would need to drive more than 100 miles to reach the nearest office where a valid ID could be obtained. Whats more, one aspect of the Texas law seems to tip Republicans hand  firearm licenses are listed as a valid form of voter identification, but student IDs (even those issued by public universities) are not. Anyhow, Texass law has been tied up in the courts for six years now. Last summer, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the law did, in fact, have the effect of discriminating against minority voters. But it was unable to determine whether such discrimination had been the laws intended purpose. So, the appeals court blocked enforcement of the law during the 2016 election, and sent the case back to a district court for further review. This Tuesday, that district court will hear the case for believing that the law was intentionally discriminatory. But the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department will not be making it: After six years of leading the fight against the ID law, the DOJ has realized that Texas Republicans couldnt possibly have intended to inconvenience minority voters. By all accounts, the facts of the matter havent changed. But the attorney general has. And civil-rights hero Jeff Beauregard Sessions just doesnt think the DOJs case holds up.

Now CNN reports that the White House asked the FBI to say that the stories were untrue, and there had been no contact  a request that violates longstanding procedure memos that limit communications between the White House and the Justice Department about ongoing investigations. The FBI refused to publicly refute the reports because the investigation into communications between Trump associates and the Russians is ongoing. Late on Thursday night, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer disputed CNNs characterization of the request, though he confirmed that the White House discussed the reports with FBI officials on February 15. We didnt try to knock the story down. We asked them to tell the truth, Spicer said. A U.S. law enforcement official said White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus first raised the issue with FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe during an unrelated meeting at the White House a day after the stories were published. An unnamed White House official told CNN that Priebus then reached out to McCabe and FBI Director James Comey. If they wouldnt publicly refute the story, he wanted them to dismiss it in talks with reporters on background. Its unclear what McCabe told Preibus, but a law enforcement source said he did not discuss the case with the chief of staff. Comey refused to push back against the story as well, citing the ongoing investigation. The White House claims that McCabe initiated the conversation with Priebus to express that they reports were overblown. To be clear, it was the FBI that contacted the White House to rebut the New York Times story, Spicer told Politico. We merely asked them to inform journalists of the same point that they were making to us. Priebus refuted the story himself on the Sunday shows, calling it complete garbage on Face the Nation, and declaring, I think that the media should stop with this unnamed source stuff. On Fox News Sunday, he claimed that top levels of the intelligence community assured him that the reports were wrong: When Chris Wallace pressed Priebus on who told him that, he refused to identify his source. Wallace pointed out that Priebus had just complained about the use of anonymous sources. Well, because I didnt ask for approval to use their name, Priebus said. But let me tell you when I say top-level people, I mean top-level people. Days earlier Preibus had also urged the FBI to anonymously leak to reporters, according to CNN, but the important revelation here isnt that Preibus said something hypocritical on TV  its the claim that the Trump White House tried to persuade the FBI to refute a story for political purposes. Justice Department procedure memos issued in 2007 and 2009 say that the FBI should only discuss pending investigations with the White House when its vital to the presidents duties. The 2009 memo says: For an explanation of why the White House shouldnt communicate with the Justice Department about a pending investigations, just look at the reaction Trump and other Republicans had to Bill Clinton chatting with thenattorney general Loretta Lynch on a tarmac last summer as the FBI probed Hillary Clintons emails. Trump suggested, with no proof, that Bill Clinton told Lynch that Hillary would keep her on as attorney general if she covered up the email investigation. Republican Senator John Cornyn said of Clintons conversation with Lynch: This incident does nothing to instill confidence in the American people that her department can fully and fairly conduct this investigation, and thats why a special counsel is needed now more than ever. In recent days Cornyn has said Flynns resignation should be investigated by the House and Senate intelligence committees. Thats further than many of his Republican colleagues were willing to go, but far short of joining calls to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the Trump teams connection to Russia. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is resisting Democratic calls to recuse himself from such investigations. In response to CNNs report on Priebuss FBI request, a Department of Justice spokesman said Sessions is reviewing the procedural memos and the Department is following the guidelines in its communications with the White House. On Thursday night, Representative John Conyers, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, renewed his call for Sessions to recuse himself. The need for an independent, bipartisan investigation into these matters has never been more clear, he said.

She was taken to Texas Health Huguley Hospital in Burleson, Texas, and diagnosed with a brain tumor. On Wednesday afternoon, lawyers representing the woman, who was identified only as Sara, said she was expected to undergo surgery soon. Her attorneys and family members, who are in New Jersey, told the Daily Beast that they could not speak to her on the phone owing to ICEs limitations on communications with hospitalized detainees, though they feared she would die before their request to speak with her was processed. A local attorney who visited Sara on Tuesday over the objections of two guards said she wasnt allowed to speak with the hospital chaplain either. Hours later, the Hill reported that Sara was discharged and taken to Prairieland Detention Center against her will. She told us they tied her hands and ankles in her condition, said Melissa Zuniga, one of Saras attorneys. Shes complaining of a lot of pain. Saras condition and the reasons for her transfer back to the detention center are unclear. (Zuniga said the hospital doesnt want the case because theyre getting hounded by calls and a potential lawsuit.) But stories like hers are adding to the fear thats gripped undocumented immigrants after the Trump administration revealed its plan to step up deportations. While previous administrations focused on undocumented immigrants convicted of serious crimes, under the guidelines released this week, federal agents are to target anyone in the country illegally  with the exception of those granted protection from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Even before the new rules were fleshed out, a nationwide surge in immigration raids put the undocumented on edge. The New York Times reports that, across the country, many have gone into hiding. Suddenly, there are more empty seats in classrooms, fewer day laborers are gathered on street corners looking for work, and restaurants that serve large undocumented populations have seen a sharp drop off in business. Per the Times: According to federal rules, there should be places where undocumented immigrants are unlikely to be arrested. The Department of Homeland Security says the sensitive locations policy  which directs federal agents to avoid enforcement actions at places like schools, places of worship, and hospitals  is still in effect. The policy allows for exceptions in exigent circumstances, and some worry thats being interpreted broadly. Last week, an alleged domestic violence victim was arrested at an El Paso, Texas, courthouse after she was granted a protective order, and two men in Fairfax County, Virginia, were arrested as they exited a church homeless shelter. A woman told officials at an elementary school in Centreville, Virginia, that her sons father was arrested after dropping him off at school. Nevertheless, school districts across the country  including Chicago and Los Angeles  have tried to allay parents fears by declaring they will not let ICE agents on campus without a warrant. Theres also been a sharp increase in the number of religious communities offering shelter to undocumented immigrants. Reverend Noel Andersen, the national grassroots organizer for Church World Service, told The Tennessean that there were 400 congregations offering sanctuary before the election, and now there are more than 800 congregations in 45 states. Some religiously affiliated groups are even organizing volunteers to quickly assemble to document and peacefully disrupt ICE raids. The broader strategy is to shine a light on what ICE is doing, Peter Pedemonti, director of the New Sanctuary Movement of Philadelphia, told Mother Jones. We want ICE to know that if they come into our neighborhoods and try to drag away our friends and neighbors, we are going to be there to slow it down and disrupt it."}, {"date": "2017/02/23", "title": "Secretary of State Tillerson Looks to Media to Get Presidents Attention", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/tillerson-looks-to-media-to-get-presidents-attention.html", "text": " Rex Tillerson may be fourth in line for the presidency, but Americans could probably identify President Trumps chief strategist, chief of staff, and Education secretary more easily than his secretary of State. The immediate reason for Tillersons low public profile is that hes yet to make any public speeches, and in the past month the State Department hasnt offered any daily press briefings, a tradition that dates back to the 50s. While the former Exxon CEO speaks with Trump regularly and has had meetings with various foreign ministers, he was not present during the presidents recent meetings with foreign leaders. While the State Department has been the leading voice on foreign policy matters in previous administrations, it appears the department has been sidelined, with top Trump advisers taking diplomatic matters into their own hands. Chief strategist Stephen Bannon attends National Security Council meetings and the Washington Post reports that he recently spoke with the German ambassador. Jared Kushner, Trumps adviser and son-in-law, has been tasked with smoothing over relations with Mexico and brokering a Middle East peace deal. Tillerson isnt being purposefully sidelined; hes just caught up in an administration with too many competing power centers and a president whos unwilling or unable to decide who he wants to play the lead role in implementing his foreign policy, Aaron David Miller, a former diplomat who advised Republican and Democratic presidents on the Middle East, told the Post. The problem is letting a thousand flowers and tweets bloom isnt the best way to run the foreign policy of the worlds most consequential power. Since Tillerson spent his entire career at Exxon, its no surprise that its taking him some time to get up to speed. However, it appears the president is making the process more difficult. As in other federal agencies, many positions have yet to be filled, and Trump nixed Tillersons choice of Elliott Abrams for deputy secretary of State (because he opposed Trump during the campaign, not because of his previous involvement in covertly selling weapons to Iran and promoting genocide). Politico reports that the career civil servants in the State Department are worried about cutbacks, and they arent getting a lot of direction from the new Trump appointees who are in place. Its like high school, said one state official. The Trump people all sit together at the tables at lunch. Now Tillerson is looking for a way to signal to both staffers and foreign governments that the State Departments influence isnt waning. Politico reports that hes asked aides to draft a paper explaining ways that he can increase his access to reporters and boost his media presence. Previous reports suggest media appearances are a key way of communicating with the TV-obsessed president, but its a risky move. Trump is said to pay close attention to aides missteps on TV, and even how theyre portrayed on SNL. Kellyanne Conway disappeared from the airwaves in the last week after claiming National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had the presidents full confidence hours before he was fired.

People like that can be described as political commissars, to use the term made famous in the Soviet Union for the agents sent to impose ideological discipline, particularly in military units. The practice by no means proves authoritarian leanings in Trump World, but it is safe to say it is consistent with an approach to government that values power more than performance. For sure, it slows the fine-tuned machine down to a crawl."}, {"date": "2017/02/22", "title": "Iowa Legislator Proposes Hiring Quotas for Republican College Faculty", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/legislator-proposes-hiring-quotas-for-gop-college-faculty.html", "text": " Whenever conservatives achieve, as they have achieved at present, a dominant political position, some of them continue to whine that the culture is in control of godless liberals beyond their reach. Exhibit A for the permanent secular-socialist Establishment is the news media, that great enemy of the American people, as Donald Trump puts it. But close behind it is higher education, that great bastion of political correctness where dedicated Alinsky disciples poison the minds of the children of the Heartland. No wonder a college education is inversely associated with support for our president! In Iowa, however, a state where the GOP obtained trifecta control of the governorship and the legislature last November, a lawmaker has finally come up with a practical way to do something about the leftist tyranny on campuses, redeploying one of the Lefts own weapons, affirmative action. The bill would require the secretary of State to provide voter-registration data on all faculty at public universities for purposes of establishing the baseline for calculating balance. Job applicants could, of course, evade the witch hunt by changing their registration to the minority party (likely the GOP) or to No Party, or better yet, by declining to register to vote. I dont know if the bills sponsor has thought that through and considered follow-up methods for ensuring balance  you know, examining applicants to determine association with un-American ideas like Obamacare and Agenda 21, perhaps using enhanced interrogation methods  but that could come later. Technically, of course, the legislation does not favor either party, just as the Trump administrations travel ban does not specifically target Muslims. But everyone knows who and what this is about. I normally do not make a habit of drawing attention to the legislative offerings of random wing nuts, but there is something about Chelgrens idea that makes me fear it will go viral and pop up in Republican-controlled legislatures everywhere. Ultimately, a lot of the more militant conservative activists would like to abolish government schools altogether and let education from pre-kindergarten through graduate school become the preserve of religious organizations and for-profit businesses. In the meantime, why not mess with the operation of public institutions as much as possible, vindicating the natural desire of hard-working American that their tax dollars only subsidize old-school instruction in the eternal verities, plus maybe football? In certain circles, it would be a definite crowd-pleaser."}, {"date": "2017/02/22", "title": "What Its Like to Live in a Trump Building", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/what-its-like-to-live-in-a-trump-building.html", "text": " For the past 34 years, Trump Tower has been the principal symbol of our new presidents real-estate empire and the embodiment of his brand: husky security guards stationed at every doorway, the vast lobby gleaming with marble and gold, and, more recently, lots of photos of power brokers (a reluctant Mayor de Blasio, a triumphant Steve Bannon) boarding the gold elevators for conferences with the then-president-elect. Missing from those photos: Trump Tower residents coming home after a day at work, saddled with Citarella bags. Then there are the thousands of New Yorkers living in Trump-branded towers that span the city from Soho to the Upper West Side. The buildings vary widely in design and type of resident (and in Trumps relationship to them  he does not own the majority of the properties but manages most), but glimpses beyond the revolving door are rare, so that few outside the real-estate world know the differences between, say, the Miesian modernist architecture of Trump World Tower and the Art Deco remnants of Trump Parc or between the rose-colored walls and vaulting doorways of Trump Palace and the sleek, steely look of the lobby at Trump Place. In an effort to learn more about life inside and whether its changed since Trumps election, we went directly to the residents. Their responses were surprisingly diverse: Some love Trump and his politics; others loathe him. Some think their property values are about to tank; others expect them to rise. Some say theres been no discernible change in atmosphere; others claim to feel the tension in the hallways. But theres one thing every single resident we spoke to agreed on: The buildings are very, very clean. Cleanliness is like an obsession: They clean in the morning, they clean in the afternoon, and its always perfect. So when I heard he was running for president, I thought, Well, if he does one-third of the good job that he does running the building, we will be in very good shape. When you leave in the morning, of course, you have your newspaper at your door. If for any reason its not delivered, you just call downstairs. No problem! Within 20 minutes, youve got a paper. One Sunday here, my neighbor upstairs had a guest. Her bathtub was draining, and I had water coming from the ceiling of the bathroom. The guest had left, and the owner of the apartment wasnt there. I had important people coming over for my business that week. I was literally hysterical. I called the staff and said, I have Venice in my bathroom. I have the Niagara Falls coming from the ceiling. Tuesday afternoon, when I came home, my bathroom was painted, and it was cleaner than my cleaning lady leaves it. It was spotless. Susana Galli, media producer The security and rules here at Trump Parc are ironclad  youre not allowed to drive a nail into your wall anytime after 4 p.m.; you cant make any noise  but the construction is shoddy. Thin walls. Plumbing is terrible. Everything was done to cut corners but to make it look really beautiful. I mean, the apartments are gorgeous. But that doesnt mean that youd look underneath. If you have a plumber come look at it, hes going to say, Who the hell did this? This is like spit and chewing gum. I said to a friend that if you sneeze in Apartment 4A, they say God bless you in 37C. I think the name Trump, whether its on the marquee or off, is completely and totally irrelevant. Ive heard that people like his name on there. They can call it Tarantula Arms for all I care. At the end of the day, its a terrific apartment, and its a wonderful, wonderful place to live. Ive seen people in the elevator with a real-estate agent, and they say, Do you live here? And I say, Yes. Buy now. Buy now. It will be Christmas, or Hanukkah, whichever it is, every day of your life. Thats one of the most descriptive things I can say: Every day is Christmas. Anonymous We not only have an indoor pool and a gym and a childrens playroom and a lounge and business center, but right next to the condominium is a nine-story parking garage. Its owned by the City of White Plains, but on top of that parking garage, on the rooftop, the condominium owns that, and we have this gigantic recreation deck, which has two tennis courts, an outdoor swimming pool, ten barbecue grills, a basketball court, a big playground for the kids, and a putting green. We have heard that there are certain buildings in Manhattan where there are demonstrations, but no one has ever demonstrated here. There have been some unit owners who have come forward expressing their desire to have the name removed from the building, but its a minority. Everybody that lives here  its a lot of IBM and MasterCard employees and widows, way more women than men  likes the building the way it is, so no one wants to rock the boat.Alan Neiditch, retired lawyer I got to know Donald from being in the building. We knew him when he was married to Ivana, we saw the kids growing up. Melania speaks a little Italian, not so much, but she understands, and so we became friends also with Melania. I was with Trump at a tea-party rally way back, I think it was 2011, in Boca Raton.I helped him start various Facebook groups: Women for Trump, Mothers for Trump, Working Mothers for Trump, the Genius Women for Trump, and a whole host of other ones. During the primary, the atmosphere at Trump Tower did not change so much. But unfortunately, right after the nomination, it started to. Especially toward the end, when the Secret Service started to get involved and then the mayor closed the street, it started to become very uncomfortable for a lot of people. I personally dont care. But some of the ladies, especially the ones that come from a different country or a different background, theyre not used to that kind of treatment, and so some of them are very, very upset. As for property values, in the last 15 to 20 years, Trump Tower has gone up 5, 6, 7 percent almost every year. Its always gone up. Even in 2008 and 2009, it went up 2 percent, and then it went down because of the crisis. I know because Im on the associations board. The prices are good. There might be a little break between now and when people are going to start to feel more comfortable about the building, just because of this uncertainty. There are a couple of people who are selling their units because they dont particularly care for all the protesters. But also because they dont particularly agree with Mr. Trumps position. But theres always been units for sale at one point or another, so its not a big thing.Guido Lombardi, real-estate developer, who also has a unit in Mar-a-Lago There are now Secret Service members all over the building. They sit in the stairwell. And now you have to drive to Madison Avenue to have your car sniffed before you can drive it in and drop off any packages. Theres a scanner on 56th Street. If youre walking in there with packages, you have to put them through, like an airport. And you know what? That may be a little trouble, but it sort of becomes fun. Ive got five people with machine guns on one side of me while the protesters are screaming. It makes me feel very important. Ive never had that kind of protection in my life. Plus, Trump has been really cool, like at one board meeting I attended: People were complaining about some expensive wallpaper he wanted to put in the hallways. He said, Look, Im going to put wallpaper on one of the floors, and I want you to go and look at it, and next time tell me whether its beautiful or not. And, of course, now we have the wallpaper. Elaine Rigolosi, Columbia professor I wasnt crazy about the Trump name when I bought it, but I just thought the apartments were so great. I had been seriously thinking about selling before Trumps candidacy, and it clarified things when he started running. I am worried that the Trump name has hurt its value. My family says, You have to get out of that building. Its just not appropriate. I send out emails when people are coming here, saying, Please dont blame me for the name on the door. And they understand when they get here. I never refer to it as the Trump Tower; I only refer to it by its address. Ive discussed this with a few neighbors  I felt safe  who feel the same as me. But I have found myself talking in the elevator to somebody about Trump, negatively, and seen somebody else scowling at me. But I cant say anything but good things about the staff. Not only are they always there to help, but they do it with a really warm, welcoming, and caring attitude. James Tufenkian, carpet designer It used to be that in every taxi I took to my house, Id say, You know he does not own this building. Hes got nothing to do with it. My husband would laugh at me, saying, They dont care. I said, Well, I care. Every single taxi, I used to tell them, Trump doesnt own it, and not only does he not own it, he has nothing to do with it, because he didnt for years anyway. Ill tell you, I was proud when we were on the news because we got his name off the front of the building. Now I dont have to feel embarrassed in front of taxi drivers who drop me off, because it just plain old says 140 Riverside. I will tell you one other thing, though: Knowing how everybody in New York hates Donald Trump, Ive been thinking to myself, Oh, maybe they wont raise my rent as much this year. Ill be getting my new lease any minute now, and well see. Susan Klausner, semi-retired home stylist Politics are not discussed in my circle. When I tell people I live here, it kind of ends the conversation. Its a one-liner without a response. I say, Yeah, we still live in a Trump building. Thats the end of that discussion. I didnt sign the petition to get Trumps name removed. Who cares, you know? Its a building with a name on it. I didnt rent here because it was a Trump building. What if he ends up doing okay as president? Theres always that option. Then everybody would want the name back on the building. Jack Rouse, design-firm owner Most of his properties were built in the late 80s and early 90s as luxury buildings, but what defined luxury then is not what defines luxury now. So the buildings from that era  Trump Palace, Trump International, Trump Parc  are on the upper end of the mid-tier or at the lower end of luxury. That means that theyre actually positioned well in terms of whats selling now. But for Trump Tower, where you have to go through security to get to the front door, this might become an issue. The rental market is much more responsive to outside changes [like Trumps becoming president] because of faster-moving transactions  so if these apartments go up or down in value, youre going to see it in the rental market first, and youre going to see it starting about now. Jonathan Miller, appraiser Im getting people anticipating a bit of a bump because of his prominence. Everybody likes to hear about Trump when they come in. Does he come here often? How often does he come around? This and that. I think people only see it as an extra edge. Maybe before he was elected, people might have been worried about it, that he wouldnt succeed, and then its got the name of Trump. Once he became president, demand just shot up to a whole other level. Neil Singh, broker for Trump Parc Trump World Tower is a quiet building. Its surrounded by parks. And the Trump brand is still very popular globally. But the luxury market has just fallen off. I had my best year last year, and this year its nothing. Nothing! Ive lowered an apartment from $6.4 to $5.6 million. Ive never seen it drop like that. And yet the economy is cruising along. The stock market is fine. Debra Stotts, broker for Trump World Tower Trump International Hotel & Tower1 Central Park West Trumps Involvement: Managed by the Trump Organization. History: It was built in 1969 to house the offices of Gulf and Western. In 1995, Trump converted it into a residential space: The architects Costas Kondylis and Philip Johnson did away with the dark glass walls and installed columns and spandrels with gold-bronze glass. A 1950s International Style glass skyscraper in a 1980s gold lam party dress, said the New York Times. The Apartments: The lower 17 floors are hotel condos, while the upper floors are traditional two- and three-bedroom condos. Amenities: Room service and cleaning for condo residents; swimming pool, gym, and Jean Georges delivery from downstairs. On the Market: Apartment 47BC, a six-bedroom, for $34.5 million. Trump Tower725 Fifth Avenue Trumps Involvement: Managed and partly owned by the Trump Organization. History: Built on the site of the Bonwit Teller department store, which Trump purchased in 1979. When he had it demolished, Trump destroyed two Art Deco friezes that the Metropolitan Museum of Art had wanted to preserve. Preserving them would have delayed the process by two weeks.The Apartments: The condo owners consist largely of investors who rent them out and moguls from overseas. Trump himself lives in a penthouse on the 66th floor, and his corporate office is on the 26th. It was also the setting of The Apprentice and the site of his campaign headquarters. Amenities: Terraces, 60-foot waterfall, various Trump restaurants. On the Market: Apartment 50B, a two-bedroom for rent for $10,000 a month. Trump Place120, 200, 220, and 240 Riverside Boulevard Trumps Involvement: Managed by the Trump Organization. History: In 1974, Trump first optioned this stretch of land along the Hudson River between 59th and 72nd Streets. His dream of a Television City never materialized, and he ceded a controlling interest to Chinese investors. Construction began in 1997, and Trump held onto a 30 percent stake. His company still manages each building, except 120 Riverside. The Apartments: Mostly two-bedrooms, but the older structures  200 and 220  have more family-friendly four-bedrooms. Where most of the Trump buildings have gold finishes, in these buildings its platinum.Amenities: Pet spa and roof deck (at 120 Riverside), pools, fitness centers, valet garage. On the Market: Apartment PHA, for $12.1 million. Trump Parc106 Central Park South Trumps Involvement: Managed by the Trump Organization. History: Trump bought the Barbizon Plaza Hotel (built in 1930) in 1981 with the intention of tearing it down, but that provoked an uproar. He ultimately relented and instead converted its 1,400 rooms into 340 condos. The Apartments: The first 21 floors have smaller units and are uniform, but the upper 17 vary in design. (One broker says they were cut up like a jigsaw puzzle during the conversion.) Owners range from globe-trotters who use the studios during visits to the city to year-rounders in the penthouses. Amenities: Maid service, valet, proximity to Central Park. On the Market: Apartment PH, with a private elevator landing, for $9.5 million. Trump Soho246 Spring Street Trumps Involvement: Managed by the Trump Organization. History: Construction plans were announced on The Apprentice and supervised by the winner of the shows fifth season, Sean Yazbeck. Since more than two-thirds of the hotel-condos units went unsold when it opened in 2010, the developers lost the building in a foreclosure. The new buyer, CIM Group, announced in 2015 that it would essentially treat the building as a hotel. The Apartments: Because of the hotel-condo setup, the buildings units (mostly studios and one-bedrooms) can be inhabited by their owners for only 120 days a year. The rest of the year, theyre rented out as hotel rooms. Amenities: Bocce court, spa, seasonal pool deck. On the Market: Apartment 2108, a 500-square-foot studio, for $790,000. Trump Palace Condominiums200 East 69th Street Trumps Involvement: Managed by the Trump Organization. History: The New York Foundling Hospital occupied the site from 1959 to the mid-80s, when its administrators decided to downsize. Trump purchased the site for $60 million and had the ten-story hospital building razed with the intention of building a small cinema in its place. (When the zoning permit didnt come through, he built a 54-floor granite tower instead.) The Apartments: The condos range from studios to penthouses, and even most of the smaller ones have balconies. Residents are perhaps the most varied of any Trump building: young folk and pied--terre owners in the studios, families in the larger units. Amenities: Health club, storage spaces, rooftop deck. On the Market: Apartment PHC, the full-floor penthouse, for $9.95 million. Trump Park Avenue502 Park Avenue Trumps Involvement: Managed by the Trump Organization. History: It opened in 1929 as the Viceroy Hotel but was quickly renamed the Cromwell Arms. It has been occupied over the years by Delmonicos, the disco Regine, and Christies. Trump bought it in 2001 for $115 million. The Apartments: The 525 rooms were made into 120 condos and eight penthouses, each with oak floors and marble countertops. Units on the third and fourth floors, where the hotels ballrooms used to be, have 15-foot-tall ceilings, and it feels like a classic prewar apartment building. Amenities: Fitness center, maid and laundry service. On the Market: Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushners starter apartment, 6G, for $4.1 million. (They still own the penthouse, where they were living until they moved to D.C.) Trump Parc East100 Central Park South Trumps Involvement: Managed by the Trump Organization. History: Built the same year as the adjacent Barbizon and snapped up by Trump in the same 1981 transaction. The Apartments: It has a similar design and feeling as the old Barbizon but with fewer units per floor and a smaller lobby. It feels more boutique, said Ginger Shukrun, a broker who has shown condos there. But like its sister building, it appeals to out-of-towners who drop in to New York City infrequently. Amenities: Bike room, cold storage (for groceries), wood fireplaces in some apartments. On the Market: Apartment 6A, a two-bedroom with views of Central Park from every room and a wood-burning fireplace, for $2.995 million. Trump World Tower845 United Nations Plaza Trumps Involvement: Managed by the Trump Organization. History: Trump bought the site from the United Engineering Trustees in 1997. Over the objections of neighbors and the Municipal Art Society, the developers started construction on a 72-story building there in 1999. For a short time after it was finished in 2001, it was the tallest all-residential tower in the world. The Apartments: It has large condos, with ceilings up to 17 feet high in the penthouses. Many residents come and go for U.N. business, and others are families lured by the amenities (which were meant to compensate for the noncentral location). Amenities: Vaulted wine cellar, pool, and spa (with massages). On the Market: Apartment 11H, a one-bedroom with limestone floors, for $2.195 million. In addition to marble walls, gold fixtures, and crystal chandeliers, zebra print (pillows, rugs, chaise longues) seems, based on current real-estate listings, to be ubiquitous at the citys various Trump buildings. Before the tourists, before the Secret Service. By Christopher Bonanos When Trump Tower opened, it rode the fine edge between really tacky and really nice  the New York Times Paul Goldberger wrote a surprised review saying that he kinda liked it  but there was no argument that it was expensive. Ninety-one of the apartments were over $1 million, with one at $6 million, at a time when the typical two-bedroom luxury apartment was about $300,000. Retail space was the highest-priced on Fifth Avenue, $150 to $400 per square foot, and Asprey and Cartier had stores in the atrium. Today, Gucci rents the big street-level store, but in the atrium, one organization has the lions share of space. Trump Grill, Trump Bar, Trumps Ice Cream Parlor, and the Trump Store (one of two in the building; the other closed last year because it was in violation of the zoning code) now occupy much of the retail square footage. That, and a big Starbucks. And that escalator. *This article appears in the February 20, 2017, issue of New York Magazine."}, {"date": "2017/02/21", "title": "When Will Trump Announce a Policy Agenda? Maybe Never.", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/when-will-trump-announce-a-policy-agenda-maybe-never.html", "text": " Even after the presidents rally this weekend in Florida came and went, it was difficult to grasp the fact that after just a month in the most powerful position in the world, Donald Trump was eager to get back on the campaign trail. Of all the possible explanations for this odd development, the most plausible  and alarming  is that the lack of interest in policy details that was so apparent in Candidate Trump has carried over to President Trump. We will know for sure on February 28, when Trump addresses a joint session of Congress. As conservative policy wonk James Capretta reminds us, these first-year presidential addresses are usually the occasion for highly detailed and polished presentations of the new administrations agenda. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama released policy tomes of more than 140 pages laying out their plans; George W. Bushs document was 207 pages. For a politician who normally communicates in 140 characters rather than pages, that would be an astonishing feat. And its not like he has a large army of underlings in place who know the presidents mind and have nothing else to do but to bring order to his vague wishes. As John Nichols points out, Trump has only made nominations for 34 of the 549 positions requiring Senate confirmation. And it certainly seems the White House staff itself is juggling too much dynamite to do any deep thinking or extensive writing. Chief speechwriter Stephen Miller, for example, has been busy telling diplomats and airlines what to do with refugees and other immigrants. He probably doesnt have time to write up an agenda, and he works for a boss who doesnt much like to read, either. Unfortunately, the congressional Republicans who have a lot more interest than Trump in governing the country could really use some extremely detailed executive guidance. Their plans for the year require precision timing, and nobody wants to run even the slightest risk that Trump will suddenly tweet out objections to an appropriations bill, much less one of the two giant budget-reconciliation bills designed to repeal Obamacare and cut taxes, among other big priorities. As Capretta explains, the time when rhetoric could be substituted for decisions is long past: Maybe he will somehow rise to the occasion on February 28. But Trump has certainly shown no inclination to follow the usual templates up until now, judging by his belligerent Inaugural Address and his bizarre first presidential press conference. It may perhaps miss the point to talk about the man returning to the campaign trail. He may never have left it. Before he took office, there was some speculation Trump might just focus on the ceremonial aspects of the presidency, or stick to a few big thematic topics, and let Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell basically run the country. But the trouble with a narcissist in this job is that even if he refuses to use his power, hes not about to let anybody usurp it. And if that means Congress grinds to a halt and America doesnt get made great again in the next four years  well, thats what a second term is for! No wonder Trump keeps campaigning!"}, {"date": "2017/02/21", "title": "Selfie-Taking Teens Rescued After Falling Through Ice in Central Park Pond", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/teens-rescued-after-falling-through-ice-in-central-park-pond.html", "text": " A group of teens and kids were attempting to take a selfie Monday evening when they fell through thinning ice in a Central Park pond near 59th Street and Central Park South.

On Monday, Trump named Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster as his replacement for former NSA Michael Flynn and called the 54-year-old a man of tremendous talent and tremendous experience. Trump made the announcement while sitting on a golden couch at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, where he also said that acting NSA Keith Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general, will serve under McMaster as chief of staff. Additionally, Trump said that former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, a candidate for the NSA job, will be asked to work with us in a somewhat different capacity. A career Army officer, McMaster previously served as the director of the Army Capabilities Integration Center, described by USA Today as an internal think tank that looks at future threats and how to deal with them. In 2014, he was named to Time magazines 100 most influential list and called the architect of the future U.S. Army. In the magazine, retired Lieutenant General Dave Barno described McMaster as an iconoclast who repeatedly bucked the system and survived to join its senior ranks. The West Point graduate also has a Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His dissertation was turned into the 1997 book Dereliction of Duty, which CNN said in 2006 is considered the seminal work on militarys responsibility during Vietnam to confront their civilian bosses when strategy was not working. While McMasters academic bona fides may stand in contrast with Trumps  the Times says hes seen as one of the Armys leading intellectuals  he shares the presidents opinion that the U.S. military is too small. We are outranged and outgunned by many potential adversaries, he said at a 2016 hearing of the Air-Land subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Our army in the future risks being too small to secure the nation. McMaster, who has been described as a blunt-spoken bulldog, joins Defense Secretary James Mattis, whose nickname is Mad Dog, and Homeland Security head John Kelly, a no-nonsense pragmatist, as one-time generals who have signed up to work in the Trump administration."}, {"date": "2017/02/17", "title": "Upper East Side Parents Are the Latest Trump Resisters", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/new-york-post-uncovers-upper-east-side-parents-trump-revolt.html", "text": " Add another Trump-brand boycott to the list: ice-skating in Central Park.

The Dalton Schools parent group sent a letter that the event was canceled because of the cost of funding the trip with significantly lower attendance. No one associated with the parents association or the Dalton administration commented on this, but one anonymous parent, the Post reported, called the skating-outing boycott insane.

Johnson finally broke the awkwardness with a quip: Good try. And then there are his lodgings. Tillerson was apparently late to RSVP for this G20 meeting, and by the time he did, the Bonn hotels were booked solid. Instead, Americas top diplomat is staying at a sanitarium.

Tillersons stay on the outskirts of the G20 is somewhat symbolic of his first diplomatic journey. He appears to be adjusting still to the job, and since he doesnt have his State Department staff fully in place, is traveling with a small team, many of them Obamaera holdovers. So far, he has largely remained on the sidelines, which isnt helping already tentative allies who are still trying to get a read on the Trump administration. Tillerson gave a short statement after meeting with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov  his first public address since he was sworn in earlier this month. He took no questions from the press. Tillerson does have a jam-packed schedule; in addition to meeting with the foreign ministers from Russia and the U.K., he has sessions with his counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Oman, and Italy. He will also be in listening mode during discussions on Syria and Yemen. And it just might take some time for the former Exxon CEO to adjust to life as a lowly civil servant. As Tillerson told the Saudi Foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir, his trip into Bonn Wednesday night wasnt ideal. Im not used to traveling like that, you know, he said. Im used to getting on at night, spending the night on the plane, and then going to work.

The Wall Street Journal reports that during a recent meeting with a top Time Warner Inc. executive Jared Kushner, Trumps son-in-law and adviser, complained that the networks coverage is biased against the president. Kushner is a longtime friend of Gary Ginsberg, whos an executive vice-president of corporate marketing and communications at CNNs parent company. During a wide-ranging discussion at the White House, Kushner reportedly complained about specific anti-Trump CNN contributors, including Van Jones, a Democrat who worked in the Obama administration, and Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist. They did not discuss Time Warners proposed $85.4 billion sale to AT&T, which is awaiting government approval. In an October speech, President Trump said his administration would not approve the merger because its too much concentration of power in the hands of too few. Bloomberg reported that Trumps opposition to the deal actually comes partly from his frustration with CNN, which is owned by Time Warner. President Trumps wild press conference on Thursday included several lengthy and inaccurate attacks on CNN. At one point he told CNNs Jim Acosta, Okay, well ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job  we do have a lot of people in here, and your ratings arent as good as some of the other people who are waiting here. As New Yorks Gabriel Sherman reported last month, sources say Trump feels personally betrayed by CNN Worldwide president Jeff Zucker, who put The Apprentice on the air when he was president of NBC Entertainment. Trump thinks his recommendation to Turner Broadcastings then-CEO Phil Kent got Zucker the CNN job, though Turner had reportedly already decided to hire Zucker. Shortly before Trump bashed the network at Thursdays press conference, Zucker dismissed the effect of the presidents criticism at a meeting with reporters in New York. Zucker admitted that he was initially concerned, and even commissioned a survey of public attitudes about CNN last month. It found there has been no diminution whatsoever in the strength of our brand, he said. In the beginning of 2017, the networks ratings have also been up 51 percent from the year before. Zucker said, despite what the president claims, CNN is not out to get Trump  nor are its reporters bothered by his constant jabs. They wear those insults as a badge of honor, because it means they are doing their jobs, he said of the networks reporters and employees. I would say that morale is incredibly high  They are not being intimidated, they are not backing down, they know they have my full support and it is a very exciting time, frankly, to be a journalist at CNN.

He added that Russia must live by international law and will have to prove itself before the U.S. military will work alongside Russias. Earlier Thursday in Moscow, Putin said, Its in the general interest to establish a dialogue with the special services of the United States and other member countries of NATO. He also said Russia needs to establish cooperation at a new level in the anti-terrorist sphere with foreign partners. Mattiss very public denial of Putins request stands in contrast to comments made by President Trump, who repeatedly said on the campaign trail that the U.S. and Russia could potentially work together in the fight against ISIS. When Trump and Putin spoke on the phone in January, they discussed the possibility, according to the White House. One topic Trump and Putin did not discuss on that phone call, at least according to the White Houses readout, is Russias habit of attempting to influence foreign elections. Mattis, however, did bring it up in his speech Thursday. Theres very little doubt that they have either interfered or theyve attempted to interfere in a number of elections in democracies, he said.

Does that mean the 33-year-old is behind the murder of his half-brother? Yes, almost certainly, North Korea expert Van Jackson told Bloomberg. He lives a nightmare version of Machiavellian court politics every day, and bloodline is still the strongest claim to legitimate rule in North Korea: Eliminating potential centers of power is cold but shrewd. Though Kim Jong-nam had been living in exile for more than decade by the time of his murder Monday, his role as Kim Jong-uns elder and his occasional criticism of his younger brother made him a possible alternative if elites ever moved to oust Dennis Rodmans biggest fan, Bloomberg says. As The Wall Street Journal reports, Kim Jong-nam was the object of persistent speculation that China was grooming him as a kind of ruler-in-waiting. Lee Byung-ho, the leader of South Koreas National Intelligence Service, reportedly told lawmakers in Seoul Wednesday that Kim Jong-un has had a standing order to kill Kim Jong-nam since he took over North Korea in 2011. This is not a calculated action to remove Kim Jong-nam because he was a challenge to power per se, but rather reflected Kim Jong-uns paranoia, Lee Byung-ho reportedly said in a meeting with South Koreas National Assembly. While Kim Jong-un is widely considered to be behind his brothers murder, the only person in trouble so far is a 28-year-old woman, who allegedly attacked Kim Jong-nam while wearing a shirt that said LOL. Now, Kim Jong-un has only three living siblings, none of whom are seen as threats to his power. Neither of his sisters, who are thought to be part of the North Korean government, would stand much of a chance of rising to power in the highly patriarchal country. And older brother Kim Jong-chul isnt seen as a main threat to usurp power, Bloomberg says. In fact, hes not seen much at all, except for that time in 2015 when he showed up at an Eric Clapton concert in London."}, {"date": "2017/02/14", "title": "How Michael Flynn Went From Full Confidence to Former Adviser in About 7 Hours", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/michael-flynns-hours-long-path-to-resignation.html", "text": "  Dont worry.

Conways free commercial for Ivanka prompted a watchdog group to file a complaint with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics and White House Counsels Office, and on Tuesday OGE responded by recommending she be formally disciplined. There is strong reason to believe that Ms. Conway has violated the Standards of Conduct, a letter written by OGE director Walter M. Schaub Jr. and signed by Rep. Jason Chaffetz and Rep. Elijah Cummings reads. After rehashing the circumstances of Conways comments  that she appeared in the White House briefing room in her official capacity as counselor to the president  Schaub wrote that these facts, if true, would establish a clear violation of the prohibition against misuse of position and recommended that the White House investigate Ms. Conways actions and consider taking disciplinary action against her. The letter also notes that so far, she seems to have avoided any punishment at all: Although Press Secretary Sean Spicer stated during a press conference on February 9, 2017, that Kellyanne has been counseled, and thats all were going to go with, OGE has not yet received notification of any disciplinary or other corrective action against Ms. Conway. Conway originally made the comments in reference to the news Nordstrom was dropping Ivanka Trumps line. The president, who reacted to the news by rage-tweeting at Nordstrom, reportedly objected to Spicers use of the word counseled because he thought it was unfair and made it sound like she was in trouble. But other sources said Ivanka herself wasnt happy about the whole thing, as Conways remarks dragged her brand further into the political fray. The letter comes after hundreds Chaffetzs angry constituents assembled for a rowdy town hall to chant things like do your job and to ask why Chaffetz wasnt investigating Trump with the same level of enthusiasm as, say, Hillary Clintons emails. At the time, Chaffetz said it was wrong, wrong, wrong, clearly over the line, unacceptable for Conway to promote Ivankas business on air. He was less definitive about things like Trumps tax returns, but lucky for him, calling out Kellyanne doesnt seem to have a political downside."}, {"date": "2017/02/14", "title": "Jury Convicts Man in Nearly 40-Year-Old Etan Patz Murder Case", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/jury-convicts-man-in-40-year-old-etan-patz-murder-case.html", "text": " On May 25, 1979, 6-year-old Etan Patz disappeared from his Soho neighborhood on his way to the school-bus stop, his first time walking the few blocks alone.

A jury found 56-year-old Pedro Hernandez guilty after more than a week of deliberations in the fraught, four-month trial. Hernandez was arrested in May 2012, after giving several videotaped confessions about how, as worker in a bodega, he lured Patz to the basement of a shop with a soda, and then choked the boy, putting his body in a plastic bag and a box, which he tossed in a garbage pile a few blocks away. Prosecutors had no physical evidence, and Patzs body was never found.

Manhattan prosecutors decided to retry the case, which hinged  as the first one did  on those confessions.

Why Did Nothing Happen?", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-lawyer-knew-flynn-was-lying-why-did-nothing-happen.html", "text": " The two rationalizations we are already hearing from the Trump defenders about the Michael Flynn-Russia fiasco are that hes the victim of some sort of media and intelligence-community sting that he was too nave to avoid, and that, conversely, hes a bad dude who misled Mike Pence and other Trump pooh-bahs, so hes gone and its time to move on. But the trouble with either effort to avoid deeper questions about Flynns communications with Russians is that Obama administration officials knew Flynn was lying about the contacts and their content, and informed the Trump White House. Specifically, shortly before she was fired for her refusal to defend Trumps travel ban in court, Acting attorney general Sally Yates told White House counsel Donald McGahn that a routine FBI tap on Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak had turned up one conversation that most definitely included discussion of the Obamas administrations impending sanctions on Russia for its interference in the U.S. election. Flynn would continue to lie about whether this conversation had occurred, before backtracking and admitting it but denying sanctions were discussed, and then pleading general amnesia before the hammer came down. So what happened in the White House between Yatess call to McGahn and the explosion Monday night? After all, most of Flynns brief tenure as national security adviser fell into this period when his colleagues, including the president and vice-president (himself ensnared in Flynns deceptions via public assurances the former general did nothing wrong), should have been aware the man was hiding his tracks over actions that made him vulnerable to blackmail. Its hard to imagine this matter getting lost in the bureaucratic haze given widespread suspicions the new administration had a Russia problem that could undermine its very legitimacy. At Lawfare, Jack Goldsmith poses the obvious question about what McGahn did with Yatess disclosure, and notes the attorney often described as unconventional does not seem to have a very good grip on his responsibilities: And thats aside from McGahns central role in the disastrous rollout of Trumps travel ban. As Goldsmith notes, it is likely that either McGahn is not very good at his job, or has too little access to the president to do his job of keeping him and his closest associates out of trouble. There is, however, a troubling third possibility: Thats all the more reason the Flynn mess needs to be explored further, not blamed on the administrations enemies or brushed under the rug as we all move on to the next crisis emerging from this administration. Maybe Flynn is simply the erratic fellow so many people described in horror when he emerged as Trumps top national-security adviser during the campaign. But quite possibly Flynns behavior is the string that when pulled will unravel a much larger ball of yarn."}, {"date": "2017/02/10", "title": "Prosecutors May Purge Some Low-Level Warrants Dating Back Decades", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/d-a-s-may-purge-some-low-level-warrants-dating-back-decades.html", "text": " New York Citys five district attorneys are mulling a plan to purge potentially thousands of low-level warrants dating back decades, reports the New York Times. Most are tied to unpaid fines for so-called quality-of-life crimes such as loitering or riding a bike on a sidewalk, a consequence of broken windows policing that tends to disproportionately affect low-income, minority communities. The details and the scope of the plan are still being worked out, but district attorneys have at least agreed to get rid of warrants that date back at least 20 years ago and older, which comes out to about 200,000 warrants, according to court figures obtained by the Times. The top prosecutors in the Bronx and Brooklyn, however, want to move that figure up to at least 10 years or older, which would account for about 800,000 warrants and include a chunk of the Bloomberg administration and beyond. But right now, that 20-year period seems to be the starting point, and a standard thats workable with City Hall and the NYPD. There is consensus among all the parties that a 20-year period works and I think its important we achieve consensus if we can, Manhattan D.A. Cyrus Vance Jr. told the Times.

But if I were to rank Trump cabinet secretaries by their level of offensiveness, she would not come close to the top. Yes, she lacks the requisite policy knowledge and had a weird line about bears. But at least education is the issue she knows the most about  unlike, say, cabinet novices Rick Perry or Ben Carson. When you compare DeVoss shortcomings to, say, Putin crony Rex Tillerson, self-dealer Tom Price, robber baron Steve Mnuchin, vote-suppression aficionado Jeff Sessions, scandal-tinged social Darwinian maniac Andrew Puzder, or fossil-fuel-industry sock puppet Scott Pruitt, she seems positively benign. Democrats have wildly oversold the damage DeVos could wreak in office. She would single-handedly decimate our public education system if she were confirmed, exclaimed Senator Charles Schumer, in an example of the kind of apocalyptic hyperbole Republicans routinely threw around against Barack Obamas agenda in 2009. DeVos could not decimate the public-education system even if she tried. Her department doesnt have that kind of power. The federal government contributes less than 9 percent of all spending on education. DeVos has advocated a $20 billion-a-year private-voucher subsidy system, but Republicans are unlikely to finance a costly new scheme like that  they prefer tax cuts  and even if they did, it would still be a drop in the national education bucket. Education is overwhelmingly controlled and financed at the state and local level. The fear that has gripped many liberals, of an overweening Department of Education laying waste to established public schools across the land, is not a realistic account of how education policy actually plays out. In actuality, education politics tend to cut across party lines. Republicans usually favor local control and oppose reforms that threaten the property-based system favored by affluent suburban parents, who dont want to risk losing exclusive access to the school district they bought their way into. The last major fight in Congress featured the Obama administration and civil-rights groups against an alliance between Republicans and teachers unions, both of whom opposed an Obama plan to supply new funds for low-income students, because it threatened local control. Its important to understand what is actually concerning about DeVos. In addition to lacking policy heft, she is in the grip of simplistic ideas about education and she sees parental choice as a panacea. If parents can choose which school to send their children to, she believes, competition will inevitably force improvement. From the standpoint of center-left education reforms, this is dangerously simplistic. On the whole, based on the conclusions of the most rigorous studies that compare equivalent students, charter schools do a better job than neighborhood-based schools of educating urban students. (As Ive noted on multiple occasions, my wife works for a public charter school in Washington.) But the performance of charters varies widely across the country. The best public charter systems have strong oversight to regulate and close down ineffective schools. Michigan  the system DeVos helped shape  has extremely weak oversight and ranks among the worst-performing charters in the country. DeVos has favored not only public charter schools but public financing for private schools  which, unlike charters, have no public accountability mechanisms. This weakness by DeVos has been drowned out by the peculiar quality of attacks from the right and the left, which have taken essentially the same position. Conservatives have mocked pro-reform liberals who oppose DeVos on the grounds that opposing DeVos must mean opposing the concept of charter schools. National Review, the Wall Street Journal editorial page, and Breitbart have attacked Cory Booker, an advocate of education reform, for opposing DeVos despite having once spoken at a meeting held by her organization. Jacobin has made essentially the same attack on Booker and other pro-reform liberals from the left. Both the right and the left have a shared interest in defining the liberal pro-reform position out of existence, and treating support for DeVos and support for any kind of education reform as synonymous. For unions, the campaign against DeVos offered a unique opportunity to organize on favorable terms. The Obama administration support for education reform placed the unions in an awkward spot, in which they were reluctant to make a villain of a president adored by their own members. (Their typical solution was to pretend Obamas education secretaries, Arne Duncan and John King, had somehow taken control of his education policy against his will.) DeVos relieves them of the dilemma, allowing them to associate policies they oppose with an administration their members also oppose. Even though most liberal reformers  like Democrats for Education Reform  opposed DeVos, critics of reform from the left have sought to associate them with her views and her record. But the unions did not whip up opposition to DeVos on their own. Her candidacy struck an authentic note of fear in the Democratic grassroots. And while it is a good thing that activists mobilized opposition against a bad nominee, liberals ought to find it disquieting that the brunt of their organizing was brought to bear upon a member of the Trump cabinet who is among those with the least power. DeVos frightened middle-class Democrats because she seemed to pose a threat to their children and their schools (a threat she is unlikely to carry out). Meanwhile, Price will be trying to snatch health insurance away from millions of Americans too poor or sick to buy it, Puzdar will be grinding labor rights into dust, Sessions will be attacking voting rights and protections from police abuse for minorities, and Pruitt will be turning the EPA into a vassal of oil and coal interests. All these are policy fields where federal law mostly reigns, unlike education, which remains overwhelmingly local in its governance. And all of them put at risk the most vulnerable Americans. Trumps critics dont have to choose which Trump nominees or policies or scandalous behavior to oppose. They can oppose all of it. But mass opposition is a resource that cannot be rallied against every single cause. The resistance to Trump has shown it can muster enormous political energy. But does it know how to allocate it?"}, {"date": "2017/02/09", "title": "Watchdog Hits Kellyanne Conway With Formal Ethics Complaint", "url": "http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/02/watchdog-hits-kellyanne-conway-with-formal-ethics-complaint.html", "text": " Kellyanne Conway was hit with a formal ethics complaint on Thursday, shortly after the counselor to the president urged viewers of Fox & Friends to buy products from Ivanka Trumps line. Filed by the watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington with the Office of Government Ethics and White House Counsels Office, the complaint claims Conways remarks violated federal law and ethics regulations. Conway appeared on the Fox program the day after Donald Trump lashed out at Nordstrom on Twitter for dropping Ivankas line. During the interview, Conway called Ivanka a champion for women empowerment, women in the workplace, before adding the line, Im going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody. According to the complaint, Conway made the comment while acting in her official capacity, since she was introduced as special counselor to President of the United States. Conways interview was also filmed in the White House briefing room, with the presidential seal visible behind her. The law is clear that public officials should not use their offices for their own private gain or the private gain of others, CREW Executive Director Noah Bookbinder said in the statement. Its hard to find a clearer case of that kind of misuse of office than we saw today. The complaint states, Federal ethics regulations concerning the use of office for private gain clearly prohibit any employee from endorsing any product, service or enterprise. On top of that, an example provided in the regulations specifically says a government employee may not appear in a television commercial in which she endorses a product. By explicitly endorsing Ms. Trumps products, Ms. Conway appears to have violated these regulations, according to the complaint. The watchdog also states that it is concerned by a pattern that appears to be developing, as the White House and Executive Office of the President seem to be using official offices for the private business gain of President Trumps family and supporters. We hope you will act not only to respond to this apparent violation, but to reverse the pattern, the group wrote, adding that an investigation into Conways conduct should be launched, and any necessary disciplinary actions should be taken against her."}, {"date": "2017/02/09", "title": "Scenes of a Thundersnow Day in New York City", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/scenes-of-a-thundersnow-day-in-new-york-city.html", "text": " New York City is getting walloped by a February snowstorm.

The New York Times reported that Yemen has withdrawn permission for the U.S. to conduct ground missions against terrorist targets in the country. Yemen will still allow U.S. drone attacks, and the decision does not affect American military advisers providing support in Yemen. Drone strikes were previously halted for a time in 2014 after several operations that killed civilians. Yemenis were incensed by photos of children killed in the 50-minute firefight. Nawar Al-Awlaki, the 8-year-old daughter of American Al Qaeda leader Anwar Al-Awlaki, was reportedly among those killed in the attack. Its unclear if the Trump administrations decision to temporarily ban immigrants from Yemen factored into the decision. Nearly everything went wrong during the operation. Al Qaeda fighters seemed to know U.S. forces were coming, and a MV-22 Osprey had to be destroyed after a hard landing. Last weekend, Qassim al-Rimi, the head of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, released a recording taunting President Trump, and NBC News reported that he was the missions real target. Trump has taken flak for authorizing the mission over dinner, and anonymous U.S. military sources accused him of giving the go-ahead without sufficient support in place. On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer denied that the purpose of the mission was to target a specific Al Qaeda leader. The raid that was conducted in Yemen was an intelligence-gathering raid, Spicer said. It was highly successful. It achieved the purpose it was going to get, save the loss of life that we suffered and the injuries that occurred. However, Senator John McCain, chair of the Armed Services Committee, had a more pessimistic characterization of the raid. Following a classified briefing on Tuesday, he initially called the operation a failure. Later he dialed back his assessment. Every military operation has objectives. And while many of the objectives of the recent raid in Yemen were met, I would not describe any operation that results in the loss of American life as a success, McCain said in a statement.

In retrospect, I should have, and this is all on me, by the way, I should have delayed it just a bit, Trumps head of DHS told the House Homeland Security Committee. So I could talk to members of Congress  to prepare them for what was coming. As a general rule, with executive orders, the buck stops with the president (who is, after all, the executive). And, in this particular case, its rather difficult to see how the hasty implementation of Trumps travel ban is all on Kelly  according to the New York Times, he was in no position to delay the order: Kelly has disputed that story, but the Times sticks by its reporting. Regardless, Kelly didnt think he or the president had much to apologize for. The DHS secretary predicted that the courts would eventually reinstate the administrations executive order temporarily barring refugees and visitors from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States. The administration will make its case before three federal judges on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday night. Kelly further suggested that the judges who had stayed the order were guilty of academic detachment from the life-or-death realities of national security. Of course, in their courtrooms, theyre protected by people like me, Kelly said. The secretary testified that it is entirely possible that dangerous people are pouring into the country now that the ban has been lifted, as the president has repeatedly claimed. And its true: It is entirely possible that a wave of jihadist refugees (who made it through Americas rigorous vetting process) happened to be on the cusp of immigrating when Trump took office  just as it is entirely possible that you will slip and crack your skull the next time you take a shower. As ten former high-ranking diplomatic and security officials  including former CIA director Leon Panetta, secretaries of State John F. Kerry and Madeleine Albright, and National Security Agency director Michael V. Hayden  said Monday, Trumps executive order serves no national security purpose. Since the Refugee Act of 1980 established the current regime for vetting applicants, no refugee accepted into the United States has committed a major fatal terrorist attack on U.S. soil, according to an analysis by the Cato Institute. Further, no visa holder from any of the countries on Trumps blacklist has carried out a fatal terrorist attack in the United States since 1975. Asked if he could provide evidence that inadequately vetted immigrants were entering the United States, Kelly told the committee, Not until they act and blow something up, or go into a mall and kill people  We wont know until then. More substantively, Kelly said that he was at a total loss to understand how we can vet people from various countries when in at least four of those countries we dont even have embassies, referring to five of the seven countries on the blacklist as nearly failed states. Nonetheless, Kelly maintained that the travel ban was only temporary, and that no additional countries would be added to the current blacklist. At other points in the hearing, Kelly tempered the presidents more aggressive proposals for immigration enforcement. The secretary said that the federal government would only cut funding to sanctuary cities on a case-by-base basis  and suggested that, even then, the administration would only revoke funds specifically earmarked for immigration enforcement. If we are specifically giving grants for cooperation on the removal of illegal aliens and the department or city is no longer doing that, it seems irresponsible to me to continue giving them the money, but it will be case by case, Kelly said. The secretary also said that he did not expect to meet Trumps ambitious hiring goals of 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and 5,000 U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials within two years. Finally, while Kelly had told Fox News that Trumps border wall would be finished within two years, the secretary told Congress that he merely expects its construction to be well under way by 2019. Oh, and the wall may not cover the whole border  and may include stretches of fence. (Much like the border barrier we already have.)"}, {"date": "2017/02/07", "title": "Trump Is Right: No One Ever Talks About the Obama-Khamenei Bromance", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/why-dont-we-ever-talk-about-the-obama-khamenei-bromance.html", "text": " President Trump has received a great deal of criticism for his coziness with Vladimir Putin. And much of that criticism has been deserved. But on Tuesday morning, the president made an incisive point in his own defense: While the media has taken him to task for kissing up to Russia, it has said virtually nothing about Barack Obamas love affair with the Islamic Republic of Iran: This is a very good argument and it makes a lot of sense. Without question: Trump has a long history of publicly praising Putin and excusing the autocrats crimes. But couldnt you say the exact same thing about Obamas history with Sayyed Ali Hosseini Khamenei? In the interest of journalistic fairness, heres a quick history of Obamas years-long bromance with Irans grand ayatollah. In reading it, you might find it hard not to conclude that the media has judged Donald Trump using a double standard. May 2009: Just before his first major address to the Islamic world, Obama wonders over Twitter whether the speech will mark the beginning of his beautiful friendship with Khamenei. (Imagine the reaction if Trump said such a thing about Putin). January 2010: Just months after the Iranian government brutally suppressed the Green Revolution, Obama offers the ayatollah this bizarre, self-deprecating praise. (Trump, by contrast, has never gone so far as to compare America unfavorably with its enemies.) February 2010: One month later, Obama (jokingly?) claims that Iran is aiding U.S. troops in Iraq, because of Khameneis personal affection for the American president. (I shudder to think how the liberal media would react if Trump said something like this about Russia hacking the DNC.) December 2010: Obama argues that Khamenei has a much higher approval rating than American soldiers. (Say what you want about Trump, but hes never touted the popularity of a foreign autocrat.) January 2011: In a preSuper Bowl interview with Bill OReilly, Obama argues that the United States and Iran are morally equivalent. OReilly: Khamenei stones adulterers.Obama: There are a lot of adulterers. We stone a lot of adulterers. Well, you think our country is so innocent?(Trump may make excuses for Putin, but he definitely doesnt suggest that our liberal democracy is morally equivalent to Russias autocracy.) October 2012: Asked about suspected Iranian involvment in the hacking of the RNCs email account, Obama implores Tehran to dig up embarrassing information on his electoral rival. Iran, if youre listening, I hope youre able to find those binders full of women that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.(This in no way recalls more recent political history.) October 2012: At the final presidential debate, Romney confronts Obama on his coziness with Khamenei. The president flies into an incoherent rage. Obama: If Iran and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good. He has no respect for him. He has no respect for Mitt.Romney: Well, thats because he would rather have a marionette as president of the United States. Obama: No marionette. Youre the marionette.(If you think Hillary Clinton and Trump had an exchange like this, you are wrong.) December 2012: The CIA releases a report suggesting that Iran interfered in the 2012 election with the aim of aiding Obamas candidacy. The president releases a combative statement that disparages American intelligence. (Donald Trump has never had a feud with the CIA.) January 2017: Following an Iranian test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, Obama publishes his first tweet as an ex-president.

If everyone in American politics can agree on anything, its that. Sure, Bernie Sanders resents judges for finding that corporations are people, while Louie Gohmert resents them for inviting God to rain hell on our modern-day Gomorrah  but both agree that judicial wisdom is not infallible. Nonetheless, when Barack Obama revealed that he held this all-but-universal opinion, by criticizing the Citizens United decision in his 2010 State of the Union, conservatives were scandalized. And not entirely without reason: The quickest path to a constitutional crisis is a rift between the Executive branch and the Judicial, so we generally expect our president and Supreme Court justices to play nice. Obama acknowledged this norm in his carefully worded rebuke. With all due deference to separation of powers, last week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that, I believe, will open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections, the president said. And I urge Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps correct some of these problems. Obama prefaced his remarks with a nod to the legitimacy of the courts power, and then called on legislators to pass reforms that might mitigate the substantive harms of the Citizens United ruling. In his first run-in with the law, our new president has taken a different approach. Donald Trump spent much of his presidential campaign promising to use executive power to discriminate against Muslims. Upon election, he promptly banned immigration from several Muslim-majority nations, via an executive order that was Breitbart-tested but not cabinet-agency-approved. This led to chaos at airports, on-the-fly revisions to the governments interpretation of its own order, and a bevy of legal rebukes. Last week, judges in New York, Massachusetts, Virginia, and California stayed the order  or aspects of it  on a variety of legal grounds. Then, on Friday night, U.S. District Judge James Robart delivered the body blow. Unlike other plaintiffs, the state of Washington did not challenge discrete provisions of the executive order, or merely the process by which it was implemented. Rather, the state argued that the order was in fundamental tensions with both federal law and the Constitution. Robart ruled that Washingtons argument was likely to succeed on the merits  and ordered a halt to nationwide enforcement of the travel ban. In his response to the ruling, the president did not preface his displeasure with a hat-tip to the separation of powers. It was more than a little disconcerting to see the president frame judicial independence as a threat to law and order, while questioning the legitimacy of a dissenting judges claim to legal authority. But, at least, Trumps outrage was focused on a single judge and judicial opinion. Further, the president suggested that he would seek vindication through proper legal channels. But hours later, Trump upped the ante  framing the existence of judicial review as a sign of national decline. Still, superficially, Trumps complaint was with an individual judge, not the Judicial branch, itself. But then the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the White Houses request for an emergency stay of Robarts decision  and the president made his contempt for the courts explicit. Six years ago, the president expressing dismay over the consequences of a Supreme Court decision  while stipulating his respect for the rulings legitimacy  was treated as cause for concern. Imagine if Obama had instructed the American people to blame the next financial crisis on the court system  since it had allowed bad campaign donations to come pouring in. There is no doubt that such a statement would have made for front-page news and talk of impeachment. But we have already become so desensitized to our new presidents 140-character authoritarianism, the fact that Trump characterized the court system as a national-security threat did not qualify as headline news Monday morning. We should not gloss over this. This was not merely an intemperate tweet. It was the president instructing the American people to view the next terrorist attack on U.S. soil as an indictment of the judiciary. And it isnt just Trump himself whos pushing this line. In its legal challenge to Robarts ruling, the White House argues that the federal judge was in no position to rule on the propriety of the executive order, because he lacks access to classified intelligence. This is an argument for allowing our fear of terrorism to overwhelm our commitment to the rule of law  a line of reasoning that poses a far greater threat to the American form of government and way of life than any closeted-jihadist refugee ever could."}, {"date": "2017/02/06", "title": "Heading to the Airport With the New York Times ISIS Expert", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/rukmini-callimachi-new-york-times-isis-expert.html", "text": " Around 7:30 p.m., three hours before she is scheduled to depart on an overnight flight to Jordan, Rukmini Callimachi sends me a text message. Im so sorry but Im running really late, it reads. Callimachi, one of journalisms foremost experts on the grisly activities of ISIS and other extremist groups, is still at home, waiting for a last-minute load of laundry to dry. By the time she picks me up, on a corner outside her office at the New York Times Building, it is just two hours until takeoff. She is unperturbed, greeting me with a warm smile as I join her in the back seat of the Kia sedan. A backpack, stuffed to a rocklike density, is wedged between us. Shes rushing off on a monthlong reporting trip to the Middle East  her first since President Trump injected the region with even more chaos and mistrust. The previous Friday, Trump had issued his executive order banning travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations, including the ISIS strongholds of Syria and Iraq. In the shocked aftermath, Callimachi, whose Twitter account is usually devoted to discussing national security and ISIS  and sometimes debating the groups many online sympathizers  posted that she found herself in tears at the news. She says she thinks the order is flawed from so many angles, one of which is intensely personal for her. She was once a refugee. As our Lyft driver, a bearded young man named Nejat, navigates through Times Square, Callimachi tells the story. In March 1979, when she was 5, Rukmini, her mother, and her grandmother boarded a train out of Romania. The communist regime of Nicolae Ceausescu tightly restricted travel, but her mother had managed to obtain passports by citing the need to visit an ill relative in Paris. What she believes is that the authorities made the calculated decision that Oh, two women and a child, that seems legit, they really are going to just go and come back, she says. My dad basically sacrificed himself. He stayed back. After a stressful passage through Hungary, where they were nearly detained by authorities, they ended up in Switzerland, where they were awarded asylum. The Romanian government punished her father, a skilled pediatric surgeon, by transferring him to a remote village. The five years of my life in Switzerland was a pretty dark time for us, Callimachi says. We suddenly had a label on us. We were refugees, and we were immigrants, and the worst of all was that we were from Romania. In conservative Lausanne, she would hear the Swiss yell at her mother, cursing about ces putains de roumains  those fucking Romanians. But her disquieting immigrant experiences have since informed her reporting on jihadists, many of whom grew up in Europe, relegated to the fringes  as she was  by ethnic prejudice. Theres something about their life where theyre at some level not fitting in, she says. And that seems very human to me. To Callimachis mind, the United States  she moved to California after her grandmother married an American  always seemed different from Europe: a place, she wrote on Twitter, where *anyone* from anywhere can arrive and can belong/thrive. She became a citizen and later a foreign correspondent, earning a finalist nomination for the Pulitzer Prize while reporting for the Associated Press in West Africa. She was living there when Barack Obama won the presidency in 2008, thrilling the continent. The next day, when I walked to work, and we were walking past the vegetable sellers and the taxi vendors, everybody was doing that Lamricaine! and thumbs-up, she says. She recalls being summoned to a press conference by the newly reelected president of Senegal, who delivered an hours-long harangue against the press for suggesting he might lose. I remember sitting there as a young American reporter, seeing this spectacle and thinking, This would never happen at home. The events of the past year, though, have shaken such assumptions of superiority. The night after Trump signed the travel ban, Callimachi went to the home of a friend who was hosting a dinner for a Syrian refugee couple. The husband, trained as a chef back home, had prepared a Middle Eastern banquet. The Arabic speakers at the party tried to explain to the perplexed refugees what was happening at airports all around the country, where people like them were being detained and outraged protesters were rallying. But no one could quite believe the news. Ive gotten emails and messages from dismayed friends who are trying to get some clarity on what this means, and of course I dont have clarity myself. I dont understand where this is going to lead, Callimachi says. Though she often travels into the field, Callimachi is best known for her investigations into the ways ISIS recruits fighters and spreads propaganda via online social networks. It used to be that would-be terrorists traveled to remote camps to be trained to carry out acts of violence, but today, a jihadist never has to leave his computer. That is why Callimachi, like many terrorism experts, thinks the travel ban is likely only to aid the extremist cause. Although ISIS has yet to release an official statement, the militants she monitors were celebrating on Twitter and in their Telegram channels. Some were happy that Trump appeared to be tearing down American democracy from within. The other line of commentary, Callimachi says, is that this just shows the great evil of America for what it really is. This is what they knew America always was, and now the mask has been taken off. To those who long for an apocalyptic war between Islam and the secular West, Trumps confrontational moves look like the fulfillment of a prophecy. The Kia swings up a concrete ramp and stops in front of the terminal, and I help Callimachi wheel a pair of large suitcases to the counter for Royal Jordanian Airlines. Women in head scarves are clustered around the elastic entrance to the check-in line. Families are hugging, saying good-bye. When you look at President Trumps tweet where he says that we didnt tell anybody because otherwise the bad guys would come in, she says. Who are these bad guys? The vast majority of people who have been arrested in America for ties to ISIS have been citizens or permanent residents; since 2001, there have been few cases of terrorist attacks mounted by foreign visitors. Omar Mateen: born here. San Bernardino, half of the couple was born here, the other was from Pakistan  a place thats not on the list, she says. The point is to keep us safe, but the people who are doing this are overwhelmingly not from these countries. And at the same time we are aggravating our relationship with the very partners that we need. Callimachi is a reporter, but she knows that once she lands in the Middle East, she will be the one facing questions. You know, when youre an American living overseas, your countrys foreign policy is basically tattooed to your forehead, she says. In December, shortly after Trumps election, Callimachi visited the city of Mosul, where the Iraqi army is engaged in a bloody street-by-street battle to drive out ISIS. Iraqi troops are dying in large numbers, she says. And now the United States, their supposed ally, has labeled these allies personae non gratae. Ive been with Iraqi troops and with the Peshmerga and have seen how they are fighting for Mosul and the price that theyre paying, she says. Its got to be pretty insulting to have a place on this list. Now Callimachi is returning to witness the consequences. Her flight is boarding, and she gets in the security line, American passport in hand. *This article appears in the February 6, 2017, issue of New York Magazine."}, {"date": "2017/02/04", "title": "White House Backing Down on Renewed Use of Torture, Black Sites", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/white-house-backing-down-on-revival-of-torture-black-sites.html", "text": " It seems as though the White House is, at least for now, abandoning its attempt to revive the use of torture and CIA black site prisons, following the revision of a controversial draft executive order. The Associated Press and New York Times are both reporting that sections of that order which had originally pertained to the black sites and torture have been deleted, following widespread bipartisan outrage over the original draft, which was leaked a few weeks ago. The original order, titled Detention and Interrogation of Enemy Combatants, sought to revoke an executive order by President Obama in 2009 that banned the CIA from operating prisons and required U.S. interrogators to stick to techniques approved for the Army Field Manual. The original order also sought to resurrect a 2007 executive order by then President George W. Bush which identified which torture techniques counted as war crimes under the Geneva Conventions in an attempt to create legal wiggle room for interrogators who wanted to use other techniques (which were still torture). That order was later rescinded by Obama. The original draft also revoked an Obama directive allowing the Red Cross access to all detainees in American custody, and opened the door to policy reviews which would make reopening CIA black sites a possibility. It seems that all of this language has reportedly been removed from the revised order, which the White House distributed to members of the National Security Council on Thursday. Remaining in the revised order, however, is the expanded use of the infamous Guantnamo Bay military prison, which President Obama tried and failed to close during his two terms in office. President Trump, of course, is an avowed fan of torture techniques like waterboarding, which he has falsely described as an effective interrogation method, and which he repeatedly promised to bring back during his presidential campaign. A few days after the original executive order leaked, President Trump maintained his support for waterboarding, but deferred to the judgment of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on the matter. Mattis is opposed to the use of torture during interrogations and has sought to convince Trump that it is an ineffective way of obtaining information. Congress also banned the use of Bush-era torture techniques in 2015, and it was never clear how Trump and his advisors intended to get around that law."}, {"date": "2017/02/03", "title": "NYCs Bodega Rally Was a Testament to Solidarity and Patriotism", "url": "http://www.grubstreet.com/2017/02/scenes-from-new-york-citys-bodega-rally.html", "text": " Bodegas are de facto community centers in New York, and yesterdays citywide shutdown of more than 1,000 delis, grocers, and other small businesses was a humble but powerful reminder that the Trump administrations new immigration policies have affected large swaths of New Yorkers. As word of the shutdown spread, so did interest in the rally, which was held yesterday at Brooklyn Borough Hall. Thousands showed up: Muslims, Americans with roots in other Middle Eastern nations, and people just generally opposed to the new policies. Men clambered on bus shelters drinking coffee and smoking to catch a view of speakers; groups of elderly bodega owners yelled and waved American flags; children climbed on their parents shoulders holding neon signs to show their support for Muslims across America. A pair of Brooklyn high-school teachers wearing North Face jackets came at the insistence of their Yemeni students, many of whom have parents who work in bodegas. In the wake of Trumps executive order on immigration, the rally was meant to express both unity and resistance, as well as show the world exactly whos affected: neighbors, friends  everyone. This wasnt a calm, docile protest. The crowd was, for good reason, fired up and impassioned, talkative, greeting and hugging friends. Chants of U.S.A! U.S.A! frequently broke out. Following a call to prayer, a string of speakers was introduced, including organizers Rabyaah Althaibani and Summer Nasser, who introduced herself as the daughter of two great Yemeni immigrants and most importantly  the daughter of deli owners. Nasser talked about her experience being stuck in Yemen when the civil war broke out. Althaibani spoke directly of how the ban had affected her, sharing her story of marrying a Yemeni national in Goa, India, and now being unsure of what will happen, despite his immigration having been approved last November. Eighteen-year-old Abduelah Mohamed, a contractor, showed up despite being exhausted after spending the weekend at JFK, where his aunt was detained by immigration. Mohamed moved to New York from Yemen when he was a toddler, and has many relatives who have just been told their long-awaited visa interviews have been canceled  indefinitely: This is the first time Ive seen an action like this and its scary, he said. There are children who are separated from their family because their parents have green cards and they dont  thats frightening and cruel. He had come to the rally with some Yemeni friends for support: People are already wary of me and they will look at me with even more suspicion now. Theres going to be a big problem if this continues. We came here to be united and to be seen, said Ishraq Almontaser, a 20-year-old Yemeni-American makeup artist from Brooklyn. She still has family in Yemen, and Trumps actions have shaken her identity. This is all about basic humanity. We were born and raised here. We are American and yet we are called terrorists. We pay our taxes. We go to school. We work. We are the future and we want him to see that we wont put up with this. When Almontaser heard about the strike, she immediately tweeted and put it on Instagram. I wanted Trump to see as many of the young generation as he can, because we will not stand for this. Althaibani, one of the rallys organizers, discussed her own family: I have an uncle who is in Jordan; he and his family escaped the war. Hes been a refugee there for almost two years  He was cleared to resettle in Michigan, but what happened the night Donald Trump signed the executive order? My uncle called me and said, Rabyaah, this is not the America you told me about. He was so heartbroken. Originally from Yemen, Fateh Sharhan works in New Jersey and has been in the United States for 35 years. The ban has fractured his family. My kids, I just got them a month ago. Whats going on back home, with the war, they had to travel to three different countries, spent four months getting their visas. But I still have my wife back home, he explained. This situation is really hurting everybody. I have a lot of relatives in countries all over. Were suffering, were suffering. I dont have any problems. No issues with police. I came out here to say Im not okay with this, were not okay with this. Yasmeen Alnajar, a second-generation Yemeni-American from Brooklyn, said she was astonished by the executive order and explicitly referenced the presidents registry rhetoric. She was at the protest with her mother, Amal Mohammed, carrying a sign that expressed the cruel irony of a ban on refugees from a country that American backed forces are bombing. Still, the sense of belonging  of being Americans, proud if threatened  reverberated through the protest. Weve always been proud to be American, Alnajars mother added. And this is just horrifying. To me, it feels like were unwanted or hated or banned.

Still, in line with Trumps more general claim that the skies brightened and investors everywhere rejoiced the moment his election was assured back in November, you can expect flacks for the new administration to take credit for the good things in the report while deflecting blame for anything bad. But the thing is: Its a mixed report, as many have been in recent years (that may be why as of this writing Donald J. Trumps Twitter feed is silent on the subject). Net new-jobs growth was robust at 227,000, significantly above the consensus expectation of 180,000. The official unemployment rate (which Trump has attacked as a phony yardstick for employment) ticked up very slightly, to 4.8 percent. But wage growth seemed to flatten; a downside surprise on wages led to some negative market reactions. As always, though, tepid economic indicators are good news for those who dont like interest-rate hikes, and the report is being deemed as providing too little evidence of overheating to support another Fed rate hike in March. The broader political question is when Americans begin to stop thinking of the economy as something Trump inherited and begin thinking of it as something he is creating. All the hype about a Trump rally in equity markets is certainly hastening the transition of economic ownership. But without question, any bad economic news that pops up will be treated by Team Trump as proof positive that whatever they are doing needs to be accelerated."}, {"date": "2017/02/03", "title": "Trump Adviser: Hard to Envision Smoother Rollout of Immigration Order", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/trump-adviser-no-regrets-on-immigration-order-roll-out.html", "text": " In the past week, President Trumps immigration executive order has sparked confusion worldwide, as well as large protests at airports across the U.S. and resistance from hundreds of government employees. Even some Republican lawmakers said that the order is too broad and was implemented poorly. However, Stephen Miller, the young adviser who reportedly crafted the order along with Steve Bannon, cant think of a thing he would have done differently. Thursday on ABC News Powerhouse Politics podcast, Miller said that, considering the large bureaucracy involved, it is hard to envision a smoother rollout from an implementation standpoint. Miller explained that the Trump administration believes the next Trojan horse is just waiting to come in, so quickly suspending the entrance of refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations was imperative to national security (though there are already elaborate vetting procedures in place, and thats not where the largest terror threat to the U.S. is coming from). While the Washington Post put the number of those affected by the travel restriction at around 90,000, like others in the White House, Miller emphasized that only 109 people were detained for extra screenings at airports, not counting, obviously, people who were turned away overseas. The reality is that, for virtually the entire country, the only disruption that occurred was the disruption created by protesters, Miller claimed. A few hours of inconvenience prior to a lifetime of entry should not be viewed as an overly consequential event, Miller said of those detained, adding that there shouldnt be so much focus on immigrants anyway. Whats really broken is we dont ask ourselves the question enough about how  immigration policies are designed for the benefit of Americans, he said. Yet new reports on Thursday highlighted that, for many foreigners and Americans, the travel restriction is more than a few hours of inconvenience. The State Department has provisionally canceled visas already issued to citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. Waivers can be granted on a case-by-case basis, and the visas may be reinstated once the review period is over. As the New York Times explains: The American Medical Association also warned this week that the restrictions could hurt seriously ill patients and international physicians, many of whom practice in underserved areas of the U.S. The AMA is concerned that this executive order is negatively impacting patient access to care and creating unintended consequences for our nations health-care system, the letter said. It is vitally important that this process not impact patient access to timely medical treatment. Among those already affected are a 4-month-old Iranian girl whose family is trying to get her to Oregon for emergency heart surgery, and an 18-month-old Syrian refugee girl who was born without an eye. Shes undergone several complex operations in Barcelona, and her family had cleared the security checks to settle in the U.S. before the order was implemented.

The easement  essentially, the permission to build  doesnt appear to have been officially been granted yet, but is reportedly imminent. The news comes one week after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that reversed Obama-administration blocks to the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and environmental activists have sought to block the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline, which they say passes through sacred tribal lands and threatens drinking water. Tense demonstrations raged last year, and though numbers have dwindled and cleanup of the protest site has begun, a few stragglers still remain camped out. Jan Hasselman, an attorney for the Standing Rock tribe, told the Guardian that he expects the easement to come, which would allow part of the pipeline to be built under Lake Oahe in North Dakota  the contested piece of real estate. Hasselman indicated that the fight will continue in the courts. North Dakota Republican Senator John Hoeven said in a statement that the easement would enable the completion of the project, which would be built with the necessary safety features to protect the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and others downstream. The Army Corps of Engineers, under the Obama administration, halted the project so that the agency could investigate alternative routes and conduct more environmental-impact assessments. That move significantly delayed  but did not permanently terminate  the pipeline construction, as those studies were expected to take years to complete. According to the Guardian, the Army Corps of Engineers had filed a notice of intent to complete those studies on the very last days of the Obama administration. Even if the easement is coming soon, the timeline isnt clear on exactly when  and that goes for the resumption of the pipeline construction as well. This will likely shape up to be a legal battle among the pipeline company, the government, and the Standing Rock tribe.

Senate Democrats spent much of the last year describing Donald Trump in similar terms. But they also spent much of last week voting for Trumps cabinet nominees. While Democrats do not have the power to block Trumps cabinet picks, they can delay the confirmation of those nominees and/or deny them the imprimatur of bipartisan support. But the Democratic caucus has declined to exert this power over Trumps every appointment. There are reasonable arguments for this tactical choice: Opposing all the cabinet picks would dilute the symbolic impact of united opposition to the most odious nominees; both parties have an interest in upholding the norm of deference toward the president on cabinet selections; and some nominees, like James Mattis at Defense, seem like they could be moderating influences on the new administration. But none of these rationales resonated with the most engaged liberal voters. And the spectacle of a supposed progressive firebrand like Elizabeth Warren voting to hand Ben Carson the keys to the Department of Housing and Urban Development  an agency he has no qualifications to run, and whose work he has decried as communist  was too much for many lefties to stomach. But this week, the Democratic leadership is heeding its bases cries for obstructionism. Apparently, all it takes to get Senate Democrats in a fighting mood is a needlessly cruel (and possibly illegal) executive order, protests at all major American airports, and ostensible acts of perjury from multiple cabinet nominees. On Tuesday, every Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee decided to play hooky: By boycotting votes on Steve Mnuchins nomination for Treasury Secretary, and Tom Prices bid to lead Health and Human Services, Democrats denied their Republican colleagues the quorum required for advancing both nominations. Their reason for doing so was simple: Both Price and Mnuchin appear to have spouted demonstrable falsehoods while testifying to the committee. Everyone agrees that Congressman Price traded medical stocks while working on legislation that could have affected their value (which, in a less kleptocracy-friendly era, might have been disqualifying by itself). And everyone acknowledges that one such trade was a bulk purchase of discounted shares in an Australian biotechnology company  less than a week before Price introduced legislation that would directly benefit that company. But Price testified that he had received no special deal from that Australian firm, explaining that the discounted price was available to every single individual that was an investor at the time  a claim that was subsequently contradicted by The Wall Street Journal. In a report published Monday, the paper shows that only a limited number of U.S. investors were privy to that discount. Senate Democrats feel like Price should be asked to account for that. Senate Republicans disagree. We did not inflict this kind of obstructionism on President Obama, Pat Toomey, a Republican senator and apparent amnesiac, said at the Senate Finance Committees sparsely attended meeting. Meanwhile, after Mnuchin had assured the Senate Finance Committee that his former bank had never used robo-signing on mortgage documents, bank records obtained by the Columbus Dispatch proved the opposite. Until questions are answered, Democrats believe the committee should not move forward with either nomination, Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden said Tuesday. This is about getting answers to questions, plain and simple. Ethics laws are not optional, and nominees do not have a right to treat disclosure like a shell game. Down the hallway, at a meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democrats tied would-be Attorney General Jeff Sessions to the Trump administrations executive order barring refugees and immigrants from a list of Muslim-majority countries. On Monday night, deputy attorney general Sally Yates refused to defend the executive order from legal challenge and was promptly fired for her insubordination. At Tuesdays hearing, California senator Dianne Feinstein said that Yatess act of defiance took guts. That statement said what an independent attorney general should do. That statement took a steel spine to have the courage to say no. I have no confidence that Senator Sessions will do that, she continued. Instead, he has been the fiercest, most dedicated, and most loyal promoter in Congress of the Trump agenda.Democrats deployed such complaints to drag out debate over Sessionss nomination, thereby kicking his committee vote to Wednesday. Democrats also tried (unsuccessfully) to delay a vote to advance Betsy DeVoss nomination for Education Secretary to the full Senate. The push came amid new revelations that DeVos may have plagiarized some of the written testimony she submitted to the committee. Still, Democrats arent pursuing a policy of maximum obstruction. Trumps picks for Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, and Interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, both cleared the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. And Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao was confirmed by the Senate with only six Democrats declining to endorse her appointment. But last week, it looked like Chaos confirmation vote would be unanimous. And when you add Tuesdays acts of obstruction to Mondays promise of Supreme Court filibuster, it certainly looks like Democrats no longer feel compelled to bring a knife to the next four years of gunfights."}, {"date": "2017/01/31", "title": "Hill Aides Helped Craft Travel Ban, Werent Allowed to Tell Their Bosses: Report", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/congressional-aides-secretly-helped-craft-travel-ban-report.html", "text": " While only a handful of GOP lawmakers have publicly come out against President Trumps executive order restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations, according to multiple reports Republicans are furious that the White House gave them no notice about the travel ban, then offered them little guidance as the policy was haphazardly implemented. Trump advisers Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller reportedly drafted many of last weeks executive orders on their own, without consulting anyone responsible for implementing or defending the policies. According to the AP, Defense Secretary James Mattis, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, and Rex Tillerson, Trumps pick for secretary of state, have complained that they were kept in the dark about the immigration ban. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker said congressional leaders learned about the ban from media reports. It appears that the Trump White House actually did work with several Republicans on Capitol Hill  but they were House Judiciary Committee staffers, not members of Congress. They couldnt tell their bosses because the Trump team had them sign nondisclosure agreements. Politico reported on Monday night that a small group of senior staffers on the House Judiciary Committee began working on the immigration order during the transition period. Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte was not consulted by the administration on the executive order, according to one committee aide. Two sources said all of the staffers signed nondisclosure agreements, which is standard for Trump employees but unheard of for congressional aides. Like other congressional committees, some staff of the House Judiciary Committee were permitted to offer their policy expertise to the Trump transition team about immigration law, a House Judiciary Committee aide said in a statement. However, the Trump administration is responsible for the final policy decisions contained in the executive order and its subsequent rollout and implementation. Following the uproar this weekend, the White House has reportedly dispatched aides to keep congressional Republicans in the loop on future policy moves. But the idea that their subordinates may secretly know more about White House policy than they do probably wont calm Republican members of Congress."}, {"date": "2017/01/30", "title": "Trump Administration Reverses Itself, Exempts Green-Card Holders From Travel Ban", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/homeland-security-secretary-green-card-holders-will-be-admitted-to-u-s.html", "text": " Department of Homeland Security secretary John Kelly has issued a statement declaring that all lawful permanent U.S. residents, known as green-card holders, are to be allowed into the country regardless of their native country, reversing a previous Trump administration position on the issue. The statement, which comes amidst a second day of increasing nationwide backlash and protests against Trumps new travel ban, is surely meant to eliminate the considerable confusion around how Trumps vaguely worded order (which temporarily banned citizens of seven majority-Muslim nations, as well as refugees, from entering the United States) applied to lawful permanent residents. The Trump administration is also facing legal challenges to the ban that were originally filed after U.S. visa holders were detained or deported after arriving at U.S. ports of entry following Trumps order. Those challenges have resulted in two federal court orders temporarily blocking parts of Trumps executive action. In DHS secretary Kellys statement, which was released early Sunday evening, he deems the entry of lawful permanent residents to be in the national interest, so that the judgment complies with the text of Trumps executive order, which said that exceptions to Trumps travel ban could be issued on a national interest basis. In this case, it seems to be some kind of blanket waiver judgment regarding all permanent residents affected by the order. The only stipulation, as included in the statement from Kelly, is that the entry of green-card holders is only guaranteed absent the receipt of significant derogatory information indicating a serious threat to public safety and welfare and that lawful permanent resident status will be a dispositive factor in our case-by-case determinations. Whether or not a significant number of permanent residents have been barred from entering the U.S. or subjected to additional screening as a result of that language remains to be seen. The statement also further proves that not even the Trump administration seemed to understand what the presidents order, which was immediately implemented on Friday with seemingly no legal or logistical preparation done beforehand, was supposed to mean for green-card holders. Its been reported that a hastily conducted DHS analysis on Friday night originally concluded that permanent residents were exempt from the entry ban, but that conclusion was then overruled by the White House, with Trump administration officials later indicating that green-card holders were in fact barred, a position a DHS spokesperson even confirmed, and that permanent residents from the seven listed countries would need to face secondary screening and/or some kind of waiver-application process  the details of which were never made clear. Then, earlier on Sunday, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus added in an interview that moving forward, the travel ban would not apply to green-card holders, appearing to reverse the Trump administrations position on the matter for at least a third time, though it was not clear if his vague remarks reflected an actual policy change. For instance, Priebus also suggested that green-card holders would be barred if they had visited their native countries, should those countries be on the banned list. Now, following Kellys statement, it seems that the Trump administration is indeed reversing their position regarding green-card holders, which begs the question as to why anyone in the White House ever thought banning the permanent residents was a good idea in the first place. Furthermore, the damage is already done for the innocent weekend travelers who were affected by the chaos resulting from the order. Mixed signals seem to have been sent to government-agency employees and airline companies on Friday and Saturday regarding how permanent residents should be treated. Originally, green-card holders were being barred from even boarding U.S. bound planes, and then it was eventually explained that they were supposed to be allowed to travel to the U.S., only to face the additional scrutiny at the border. There have also been some unconfirmed reports that green-card holders were detained and their computers and social-media accounts searched, presumably as part of some additional screening deemed necessary by border agents, federal officials, the White House, or whomever. This is all on the top of the fact that green-card holders have already gone through a lengthy U.S. screening process in order to be granted permanent residence in the first place. Meanwhile, the two-day confusion has additionally meant that hundreds of thousands of legal permanent U.S. residents suddenly didnt know if their permanent-resident status in the country was actually permanent, or if they would be allowed to reenter should they opt to leave the country during the ban. Those now-legitimate fears may not subside anytime soon. In light of Kellys statement, it seems that all the upheaval, extra attention, and distress that the affected green-card holders have gone through was for no other reason than Trump administration officials inability to understand the details, intentions, or implications of their own actions. The statement also does nothing to address the status of other foreigners from the seven countries, or refugees from anywhere, who have had their once-valid U.S. visas now invalidated by Trumps order."}, {"date": "2017/01/29", "title": "Priebus Says Green-Card Holders Exempt From Entry Ban, Contradicting White House", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/priebus-says-green-card-holders-exempt-from-entry-ban.html", "text": " Sunday morning on NBCs Meet the Press, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus appeared to reverse the Trump administrations new policy on whether or not legal U.S. permanent residents, or green-card holders, were exempt from President Trumps executive order banning citizens of seven majority-Muslim nations (Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen). CNN reported on Saturday that the Department of Homeland Security, which was apparently not prepared for Trumps order to immediately take effect on Friday, had quickly conducted its own legal analysis of the Trump order and concluded that green-card holders would be exempt from the new policy. That conclusion was then promptly overruled by Trump advisors Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller, according to CNN, leading to chaos as contradictory instructions were given out on how to deal with travelers possessing permanent U.S. residency. On Sunday, Priebus denied that the White House had overruled the DHS, and insisted that green-card holders were not affected by the order  unless they had traveled to one of the seven countries on the Trump administrations ban list. Or thats what Priebus sort of said, considering he essentially reversed himself, in reversing the White House policy, first remarking that We didnt overrule the Department of Homeland Security, as far as green card holders moving forward, it doesnt affect them. He later added, under pressure from Meet the Press host Chuck Todd, that of course the executive order impacts green-card holders, since if youre traveling back and forth [to the banned countries], youre going to be subjected to further screening. Priebus additionally said that it was up to Customs and Border Patrol agents to exercise their discretionary authority on how to handle permanent residents who had traveled from the seven banned countries. At one point, Priebus also indicated that the additional discretion might simply entail a few more questions. That all seems to contradict Gillian Christensen, the acting Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, who told Reuters on Saturday that Trumps executive order will bar green card holders. He also claimed the implementation of the ban wasnt chaos and that the White House apologizes for nothing, adding that the rapid implementation of the order was the best plan because sometimes  youve got to rip off the band-aid. Of course, contrary to Priebuss assessment, over the weekend there were numerous reports of U.S. green-card holders being barred from flights or detained at U.S. ports of entry, indicating that whatever the White House does intend as the new policy for legal U.S. residents who are citizens of the listed countries, the communication and implementation of that policy has failed. Priebuss comments on Sunday seemed to add to the confusion; though, perhaps he is outlining a new policy, as he says, moving forward. Looking back, it wasnt just unclear, in the immediate aftermath of Trumps executive order, whether or not green-card holders were exempt. Once the White House reportedly overruled the DHS on the issue, it was also not clear if green-card holders were even allowed to travel to the U.S., and many airlines were apparently told that they should not allow those travelers to board planes bound for the U.S. Later, the settled DHS policy then apparently became that green-card holders could travel to the U.S., but would be subject to secondary screening after arriving and be approved their reentry to the U.S. on a case-by-case basis. Still, other reports, per Trump administration officials, indicated that green-card holders would have to apply for a waiver for reentry before returning to the U.S., but the details of that waiver process, should the process actually exist yet, were not detailed. Now, according to Priebus, it seems that green-card holders should be allowed both to fly to and to enter the U.S., provided they havent traveled to their home country, should it be one of the seven listed under the Trump ban. If thats the case, then they will face an indeterminate amount of additional scrutiny. The White House Chief of Staff, echoing an unnamed Trump administration official who spoke with CNN on Saturday, also indicated that the seven countries on the ban list were just a starting point, and more countries may be added to the list in the future, pending a Trump administration review process."}, {"date": "2017/01/29", "title": "Judge Blocks Part of Trumps Ban on Citizens From 7 Muslim Nations and Refugees", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-bans-citizens-from-7-muslim-nations-and-all-refugees.html", "text": " On Saturday night in Brooklyn, New York, a federal judge temporarily blocked part of President Donald Trumps sloppily implemented executive order banning citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries and all refugees from entering the United States. Trump signed the order for the temporary bans on Friday, apparently without adequately preparing government agencies for the change, which in turn stranded an unknown number of U.S. visa holders abroad, threw hundreds of thousands of permanent U.S. residents into legal limbo, and prompted a swift and widespread backlash amidst the sudden chaos. Trumps executive order also indefinitely bans entry for all Syrian refugees and establishes a religious test for refugees moving forward, prioritizing Christians and members of religious minority groups in Muslim countries. On Saturday, after as many as 200 inbound foreigners with once-valid U.S. visas were detained at U.S. ports of entry on account of the ban, which was enacted while they were en route to America, the ACLU and other organizations filed for a class certification and argued against the ban in front of Judge Ann M. Donnelly of Federal District Court in Brooklyn. She subsequently ordered that the detained immigrants not be deported; though, she neither allowed them into the country nor ruled on the constitutionality of Trumps executive action. During the signing ceremony on Friday, Trump, who at one point during his presidential campaign said that all Muslims should be banned from entering the U.S., tried to frame the executive order as a way to establish new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. We dont want them here, said Trump. We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. The executive order also directs the secretary of State, secretary of Homeland Security, director of National Intelligence, and director of the FBI to come up with new immigration-screening procedures to meet Trumps demand for what he has previously called extreme vetting measures. Among the criteria Trump ordered were that foreign nationals should not be admitted to the U.S. if they do not support the U.S. Constitution, place violent ideologies over American law, engage in acts of bigotry or hatred, or would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation. The previous U.S. vetting process for visas  and especially for refugee visas  was already among, if not the most, stringent in the world, and the Trump administration has provided no evidence that this preexisting process had in any way failed. The Muslim-majority countries included in the 90-day ban are Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen  all countries which a previous federal law had linked to concerns about terrorism. The order thus means that at least an estimated 134 million people are now temporarily barred from entering (or reentering) the United States, additionally affecting as many as hundreds of thousands of current U.S. visa holders. Dual nationals, or those who were born in one of the listed countries, but also have citizenship in another unlisted country, are also included the ban. Furthermore, the text of the order indicates that the seven countries are only the first to be included in the ban, and that additional countries may be added later. According to CNN, a Trump administration official indicated the list would indeed grow and promised they would be very aggressive in determining which other countries would be added. That evaluation process will include a mandated 30-day review to determine which countries around the world do not provide adequate information about their citizens to the U.S., and the ban may thus become permanent for some or all of the affected countries should the Trump administration decide that those countries governments are unable or unwilling to provide that information. In the case of a country like Iran, which the U.S. has no formal diplomatic ties to and no way of exchanging such information, the ban may very well become permanent. In the meantime, Trumps ban list is also notable for the countries it excludes. Though Trump says the order is aimed at stopping foreign Islamist terrorists from gaining entry to the U.S., the ban does not include the countries from which terrorists who have already conducted terrorist attacks in the U.S. are from. Omitted from the list are Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Lebanon, Kuwait, and Russia  despite the fact that, starting with the attacks on September 11, 2001, citizens from those countries have been linked to terrorist attacks in the U.S. (Also missing from the list are Turkey and Afghanistan, countries in which multiple high-profile terrorist or militant attacks have been carried out in recent years; Pakistan and Egypt fit that bill as well.) In fact, as NPR points out, no citizens from the seven countries listed in the current ban have conducted any terrorist attacks in the U.S. over this same period. And as Bloomberg notes, the list also excludes Muslim-majority countries in which the Trump Organization, which Trump refused to divest from before becoming president, has business ties. At present, the Trump Organization has done or pursued business in Turkey, the U.A.E., Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Azerbaijan. The order also suspends the admission of all refugees for 120 days, during which time the Trump administration plans to do its own analysis on which countrys citizens pose the biggest supposed threat. The order additionally cuts the total number of refugees allowed into the U.S. during 2017 to 50,000 (down from more than 110,000 in 2016), and instructs the Homeland Security secretary to propose ways to allow states and localities a say in whether or not refugees are allowed to be settled in their jurisdictions. The only people currently exempted from the blanket ban are holders of certain diplomatic visas, though the order indicates that individuals can be approved for entry by federal officials on a case-by-case basis. One law enforcement official told the Associated Press that there was also an exemption for foreigners whose entry is in U.S. national interest. Trump can extend both temporary bans as he sees fit, as well. The Trump administration clearly did not have a plan in place regarding how to actually implement the vaguely worded executive order after it was signed. Instead, by all accounts, the rollout was a ham-fisted disaster. Reports indicate that government agencies werent made aware of the specifics of Trumps order until Friday, which lined up the resulting chaos, confusion, and for many foreigners with U.S. visas, heartbreak. Agencies were instead left to scramble to interpret and apply the order on their own, and that not only led to dramatically different outcomes for different foreigners, but conflict with the inexperienced Trump administration. CNN adds that the order was drafted by a White House policy team, skipping over the typical guidance that would be provided by government officials with working knowledge of Americas immigration system. The White House didnt even release the list of impacted countries until hours after the order had been signed. By late Saturday afternoon, however, it was clear that Trumps order would be interpreted by U.S. authorities in the broadest possible terms, with all foreign nationals from the seven countries, including current U.S. visa holders like green-card-carrying lawful permanent residents being unable to enter or board transportation for the U.S. There were quickly numerous reports from various countries of distraught people with previously valid U.S. immigration documents being barred or removed from flights to the U.S., or being detained at U.S. ports of entry after having already been en route to America when the executive order went into effect. The New York Times reported Saturday afternoon that an official message had gone out to all American diplomatic posts in the world instructing them to halt interviewing and cease issuance and printing of visas to people from the affected countries. Existing visas seem to have already been indefinitely suspended as well. Though it appears that anyone already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay, they may not be able to reenter the country if they travel abroad during the ban. According to the Associated Press, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency has also been notifying airlines about passengers whose visas are now suspended, and has told them to keep legal U.S. residents from the ban-listed countries off of U.S.-bound flights, though that instruction may have been a mistake. A Trump administration official then told Politico on Saturday that affected green-card holders who are outside the country will have to go through a review process and apply for reentry waivers on a case-by-case basis, apparently after being allowed to travel to the U.S., though many hadnt been allowed to make that trip as of Saturday. It is also not clear how long that secondary screening process will take, or if the Trump administration has yet established guidelines or staffing levels to handle it. As it turns out, CNN reports that the decision to bar legal permanent residents was made by Trump advisors Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller, who seem to have been the driving force behind the order, and who overruled an earlier DHS legal interpretation that permanent residents were exempt from the ban. As a result of the conflict and confusion, mixed messages to the airline companies from confused federal agencies exacerbated the chaos, and agencies and airlines werent on the same page until sometime on Saturday. Propublica reports that hundreds of thousands of legal U.S. residents may be impacted, and could be permanently unable to return to the U.S. should they already be abroad, or choose to leave the country during the ban. According to DHS reports, 500,000 citizens from the seven countries have received green cards from the U.S. over the past decade alone, and 25,000 citizens from the seven countries have been issued temporary employment or student visas in the last few years. Iran and Iraqi nationals, who account for nearly half the green cards over the ten-year period, look to be particularly hard hit by the ban. Two Iraqi citizens  both refugees who had been granted admission to the U.S. and were already en route to the U.S. when Trumps ban went into immediate effect  were detained at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York early Saturday morning. One of the Iraqi men, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, had worked for the U.S. Army as an interpreter following the 2003 invasion, and had been targeted by militants as a result. Lawyers for the two men quickly filed a writ of habeas corpus demanding their release, and along with several organizations including the ACLU and the National Immigration Law Center, also filed a motion seeking class certification for all refugees and immigrants who had been suddenly detained at ports of entry on account of Trumps order. Exactly how many people have been caught in such limbo remains unknown, but the ACLU estimated in court on Saturday night that as many as 200 people had been detained due to the ban. Indeed there were reports from several U.S. cities of numerous other individuals and families being detained or deported, and many of those stories did not have happy endings for the would-be immigrants: On Saturday afternoon, Darweesh was subsequently released from detention, apparently having been approved for entry via the aforementioned case-by-case scenario. Darweesh told reporters outside J.F.K. that America is the land of freedom and celebrated those who came to the airport to support him: The other Iraqi man, who had been granted a visa to join his wife, who had worked for a U.S. contractor in Iraq, was also released on Saturday evening, but not before a large protest against the detention of immigrants at the airport had amassed and continued into the evening. Similar protests in support of the immigrants, and in opposition to Trumps order, sprung up at other American airports on Saturday as well. In addition, the ACLU and others case against Trumps order resulted in an emergency hearing on Saturday night in Brooklyn. During that hearing, Judge Donnelly agreed with ACLU lawyers that deporting the detained immigrants could cause irreparable harm to the travelers, and issued a stay in the case, temporarily blocking the U.S. government from deporting any more of the detained immigrants. This does not mean the immigrants can leave the airport, nor does it permanently block their deportation, but it was a momentary win for opponents of Trumps order and bought them and the detained immigrants some much needed time. The ruling did not, however, weigh in on the overall constitutionality of Trumps order. To that end, the Council on American-Islamic Relations says it will challenge the constitutionality of the executive order, noting that there is no evidence that refugees  the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation  are a threat to national security, and insisting that Trumps act is based on bigotry, not reality. It is not clear how Trumps order will stand up to legal scrutiny as the Immigration and Nationality Act both allows the president to suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or non-immigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate while also stating that no person shall receive any preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the persons race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence. CNN reports that the White House never even submitted the order to the Office of Legal Counsel for legal guidance, so if the order has any legal liabilities, the White House may not even be aware of them yet. As Politico highlights, the sloppiness of the order was also apparent in its imprecise language. For instance, the reference to religious minorities could or could not apply to sects of majority religions, like in the case of Shiite Muslims, who are often persecuted in majority Sunni-Muslim countries. Then there is the citing of foreign nationals in the order but not dual-nationals, making it unclear whether or not someone with citizenship to both one of the banned countries and another non-banned country will be allowed into the U.S. The State Department eventually confirmed that no, dual-nationals would not be exempt from the ban, meaning it would affect an even larger set of people. The executive order also attempts to add an unprecedented religious test to Americas refugee-admission process. Per the order, the secretary of State and DHS secretary are directed to make changes, to the extent permitted by law, to prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individuals country of nationality. Looking at President Trumps comments on the campaign trail, as well as in an interview on the Christian Broadcasting Network on Friday, priority status will be awarded to Christians in Muslim-majority countries. We are going to help them, Trump insisted of persecuted Christians in Syria. Trump then falsely claimed that it was impossible, or at least very tough for Christians to gain entry into the U.S., but much easier for Muslims, under the previous refugee policy. Neither Trump nor his administration provided any evidence to support that argument. According to the Pew Research Center, nearly half of the refugees the U.S. admitted in the 2016 fiscal year were Christian (and the rest were mostly Muslim). About one percent of the Syrian refugees that the U.S. admitted were Christian, though there is no clear evidence that Syrian Christians were discriminated against in the process, and Syrias Muslim majority has faced the brunt of the wars violence and upheaval. The vast majority of Syrians admitted to the U.S. in 2016 were women and children and already faced the U.S. governments most intensive and complex background-check process, which typically takes as much as two years to complete. Unlike an earlier leaked draft of the executive order, the final order signed on Friday did not include any language about establishing safe zones to house Syrian refugees either inside Syria or in another Middle Eastern country  something Trump has promised to do to address the plight of Syrian refugees trying to escape their countrys brutal civil war. Meanwhile, Iran has now responded in kind, barring U.S. citizens on Saturday from entering the country in retaliation for Trumps executive order. It remains possible that other countries may follow suit, either making it harder for Americans to obtain visas, or banning them outright. Another possibility is that affected countries will refuse to accept their citizens if and when they are deported by the U.S. Looking at response from the business community, Google has reportedly told its traveling staff members, abroad for either work or vacation, to return to the U.S. immediately on account of fears over Trumps order, which may impact nearly 200 Google employees. Facebook president Marc Zuckerberg has also spoken out against the order, and many other companies which rely on foreign talent, particularly in the tech sector, are starting to speak out against Trumps order. Dating back to Trumps numerous Islamophobic comments during his presidential campaign, anti-terrorism analysts have also repeatedly warned that any move by the U.S., or comments from its leaders, that could be interpreted as anti-Islam may become useful fodder for Islamist recruiting efforts, and its possible they could damage Americas standing with key Middle East allies as well. In other words, Trumps order, rather than reducing terrorism against the U.S., as it is supposedly intended to do, may have the opposite effect. In addition to the legal challenges, condemnation of the executive order has been swift. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the order backward and nasty, adding that tears are running down the cheeks of the Statue of Liberty tonight as a grand tradition of America, welcoming immigrants, that has existed since America was founded, has been stomped upon. Celebrated Pakistani humanitarian Malala Yousafzai, who survived an assassination attempt at the hands of Taliban militants when she was 15, said she was heartbroken that Syrian refugee children were being singled out for discrimination. Numerous advocacy and aid groups are expressing their outrage as well. Oxfam America president Raymond Offenheiser, speaking with the the Times, warned that the refugees affected by the order are among the worlds most vulnerable people  women, children, and men  who are simply trying to find a safe place to live after fleeing unfathomable violence and loss. Also, thousands of academics, including 12 Nobel laureates, have signed a petition against the order, calling it inhumane and detrimental to the national interests of the United States in that it damages American leadership in higher education and research. The order, which was signed on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, also angered some Jewish organizations and drew the ire of Anti-Defamation League president Jonathan Greenblatt who called it tone deaf. Asked by reporters for his thoughts about the first full day of the ban after another signing ceremony on Saturday, President Trump dubiously claimed that everything was going according to plan. Its not a Muslim ban, but we were totally prepared, Trump insisted. Its working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over.

Officials from both countries confirmed the chat, and issued a nearly identical joint statement, except the White House version left out one key detail about the conversation that appeared in the official statement from the Mexican presidents office. Nietos administration said that the two leaders agreed to stop sounding off about the wall, and who (or who isnt) paying for it in public. The Trump administration did not say this. Specifically, Mexican officials said, with respect to the border wall, that the two presidents also agreed for now not to speak publicly about the controversial issue. The White House statement is the same when translated except for that part. (U.S. here, and Mexico here.) El Universal reports that the White House has not provided any information about this alleged omission on a statement that apparently should be the identical. What both the Mexican and U.S. administration officials did both say about the wall was that both presidents recognize their clear and very public differences on this sensitive issue, and they agree to resolve these differences as part of a comprehensive discussion on all aspects of the bilateral relationships. Mexican and U.S. officials described the call as constructive and productive, and Trump sort of echoed that sentiment when the question came up at his press conference with British prime minister Theresa May. We had a very good call, Trump said. I have been very strong on Mexico. I have great respect for Mexico. I love the Mexican people. I work with the Mexican people all the time. Then, he added: But as you know, Mexico with the United States, has outnegotiated us and beat us to a pulp through our past leaders. Theyve made us look foolish. We have a trade deficit of $60 billion dollars with Mexico; on top of that the border is soft and weak, and drugs are pouring in, and Im not going to let that happen. So if a moratorium did exist, it wouldnt have lasted long, though Trump technically did not use the word wall. Acording to El Universal, Nieto and Trump did discuss some of the touchy issues between the two countries, including trade, and the need for the two countries to work together to stop drug- and arms-trafficking across the border. They also, reportedly, talked about the importance of the friendship between these neighbors. It sounds as if the call, which took place around 9:30 am, struck a markedly different tone than the one Donald Trump tried out when he began his morning tweeting ritual: Trump threw in the latest comment after tensions between the countries, summed up by a few 140-character barbs, hit a crisis point Thursday, when Nieto bailed on a White House meeting with Donald Trump scheduled for next week. He did so after the U.S. president signed an executive order calling for the immediate construction of a border wall, said again Mexico would pay for this wall, and then insulted Mexico on Twitter after its leader repeated the country wasnt going to pay for a wall it didnt want in the first place. After Nieto canceled, Trump spoke to GOP lawmakers and made it seem as if scrapping the meeting had been his idea, saying it would have been fruitless. Then, in a conversation with reporters, White House press secretary Sean Spicer suggested a 20 percent import tax could be used to finance the wall. The White House clarified that it was a policy option in line with a popular GOP tax proposal, called a border-adjustment tax. The Mexican media, seizing on the tariff-that-wasnt along with the U.S. press, was still quick to point out that American consumers, not Mexico, would mostly end up paying for this wall if such a policy went through. As the New York Times points out, Nieto has had to walk a difficult line in his dealings with Trump, saying Mexico would not foot the bill for the wall, but signaling a willingness to work with its northern neighbor  which was driven in large part by necessity. Yet Trumps barbs have galvanized Mexico  and Nieto, who is a really unpopular president  is seeing the country unite around the perceived bullying from the north. The Mexicans press  often describing it as el huracn Trump (the hurricane)  have characterized these escalating tensions, fueled by Trumps nationalistic and offensive rhetoric, as a new era of hostility. Former Mexican president Vicente Fox, who has been very blunt in his criticism of Trump, said the president had brought back a very strong Mexican spirit.

As PolitiFact explained back in November, when this rumor was first circulating, VoteStand is an app that purports to help people track voter fraud (it has a grand total of six reviews in Apples app store). Phillipss Twitter profile indicates he is the founder of that app and a board member of True the Vote, an organization dedicated to exposing the supposedly rampant voter fraud that a number of rigorous investigations, including a concerted and motivated effort by George W. Bushs Justice Department administration, have failed to turn up. After the election, Phillips gained viral attention from some explosive-seeming tweets: As PolitiFact, the Daily Beast, and other outlets have noted, Phillips, a former executive deputy commissioner at Texass Health and Human Services Commission who was embroiled in corruption allegations there, has not provided any evidence to back up his assertion. Two and a half months later, we know nothing about his methods, and there is no sign of True the Vote having initated legal action. Moreover, Phillips launched his claims well before some states had even certified their results. That didnt stop those claims from getting picked up by Alex Joness conspiracy-theory cauldron Infowars, where an article by Paul Joseph Watson  Report: Three Million Votes in Presidential Election Cast by Illegal Aliens  helped amplify them greatly, especially after the piece got picked up by the Drudge Report. Since Trump first floated his 3 million number, several journalists have pointed out the very high likelihood that it came from Phillips, given that Trump is a known gonzo-news connoisseur and a fan of Jones and his site (though the White House has denied Joness claim he was offered press credentials there). In public, though, Trump and his staff have generally instead referenced two studies from mainstream sources, one from Pew and one from Old Dominion University researchers, to support the claim, despite the fact that neither study does so. As of two days ago, the Daily Beast said that Phillips was the apparent source of Trumps belief  there was still a bit of uncertainty. So Trumps tweet this morning marks a shift: Hes acknowledging explicitly that the basis for his belief in a massive, unprecedented voter-fraud episode is a couple of tweets from a questionable source  tweets that have never been backed up in any way with solid evidence."}, {"date": "2017/01/26", "title": "Trump Leaves Republicans in the Dark About His  and Their - Plans", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-leaves-gop-in-the-dark-about-his-and-its-plans.html", "text": " The congressional Republican retreat in Philadelphia this week was supposed to foster highly efficient private discussions and briefings, and let the solons emerge from their labors revealed as a lean, mean, legislating machine. From reports at the end of the first day, however, they looked more like lost sheep, disappointed at the inability of their leaders to provide clear direction on how they would negotiate the tangle of health care, budget, and tax legislation theyve committed to enact. There is particular anxiety about the very first item on everyones agenda: the repeal and replacement of Obamacare. They sure didnt get that kind of guidance. Heres an example: Thats clear as mud, isnt it? Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan tried to generate a sense of decisiveness and momentum by talking about the timetable for one reconciliation bill to repeal (and replace?) Obamacare, another to cut taxes, and additional actions required on appropriations. But the content of all this frenetic activity was left maddeningly vague. The big problem Republicans face, of course (beyond the unpopularity and the fiscal unfeasibility of much of what they want), is that theyve chosen a partisan strategy to enact their agenda, which means precision timing and, most of all, advance assurances their own president is onboard are critical. Nobody wants to be halfway through an amendment vote-a-rama on a budget-reconciliation bill repealing Obamacare to find out via Twitter that Donald Trump has changed his mind or finally understood some key issue thought to be long resolved. So the Republicans in Philadelphia expected some guidance and feedback from the president, scheduled to address them on the second day. Instead, Trump gave them a ton of headaches even as they arrived in Philadelphia, with a bunch of executive orders on hot-button issues. It was painfully clear nobody at the gathering had been given a heads-up on what he planned to do while they were away from Washington, and new issues to grapple with were absolutely the last things they needed. But the senators and congressmen dutifully cheered the new boss during his pithy remarks today, even as many inwardly cringed at his cavalier disregard for their needs, and his insistence on pursuing entirely imaginary priorities like voter fraud, a reminder that he is still upset about losing the popular vote last November. What they did not get from Trumps speech was even an ounce of guidance. His comments on tax reform amounted to one vague sentence. On Obamacare, he spent most of his time making the strange and incredible claim that he had thought seriously about letting the present system stay in place until it collapsed, but instead decided to help out Democrats by putting it to the sword. He did mention his interest in a big fat infrastructure spending binge, which most Republicans, worried about the red ink he seems determined to spill, would love just to go away. All in all, it was a sort of unplugged version of a 2016 Trump campaign speech. Sure, Trump or his underlings could convey more concrete hopes, wishes, and instructions informally whenever they wanted. But listening to Republicans in Philadelphia and elsewhere, it sure sounds like thats not happening, at least not yet. And so they rush toward the deadlines theyve set for themselves, without the slightest assurance any of their complex legislative maneuvers will turn out well. Its probably an understatement to say that few of the women and men gathering in Philly had any idea, on the morning of November 8, theyd be where they are now, waiting to see whether Donald J. Trump will consummate or squander the best opportunity Republicans have had in many years to realize their most avaricious dreams."}, {"date": "2017/01/26", "title": "De Blasio Gears Up for Fight Over Trumps Sanctuary Cities Executive Order", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/de-blasio-gears-up-for-fight-over-sanctuary-cities.html", "text": " No stranger to lawsuits, Donald Trump might get slapped with one as president, this time from his hometown. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city would sue its former-ish resident over his newly inked executive orders to strip funding from sanctuary cities. We think its very susceptible to legal challenge, de Blasio said on CNN Thursday morning, less than 24 hours after Trump signed the mandate. If they make an attempt to pull that money, it will be from NYPD, from security funding to fight terrorism. The mayor added that the orders  which Trump described as an issue of public safety  would achieve the opposite in New York, not just because the NYPD might take the biggest hit, but because it would erode law enforcements trust with immigrant communities. New York City has half a million undocumented people, the mayor said. We want them to come forward and work with the police if they see a crime, if theyre a victim of a crime. If they believe by talking to a police officer they will get deported and be torn apart from their family, theyre not going to work with police. NYPD Commissioner James ONeill echoed similar sentiments at a press conference Wednesday, which de Blasio held after Trump signed the executive order. I think theres a very delicate balance in New York City right now, he said. I think thats why were doing so well, and to do anything that would eat at that trust, I think, would be a disservice to the people of this great city. About 10 percent of the New York Citys budget this year  about $8.5 billion  comes from the federal government, an amount thats been decreasing in recent years. Next years proposed $84.7 billion budget, which de Blasio presented this week, relies on about $7 billion in federal money. De Blasio warned, though, that the budget didnt contain Trump-specific adjustments, saying without the details it was too soon to see where the gaps might be. But, he said, his team drew up the preliminary budget with the assumption of profound challenges from Washington. Its unclear exactly how much federal funding would be at risk. In this years budget, the bulk of federal monies go to programs that serve low-income and vulnerable New Yorkers through housing vouchers, and social, mental-health, and homeless services, which might be protected from such cuts by a recent Supreme Court decision, de Blasio hinted Wednesday. So any federal-funding losses would most likely apply to the law-enforcement arena. According to a preliminary analysis from Scott Stringers office, it appeared that $156 million in Urban Area Security Initiative grants from the Department of Homeland Security and about $9 million from the Department of Justice  about $165 million in total  could immediately be at risk, reports Politico. But a big chunk of that DHS money is for counterterrorism and security efforts, which, at least this year, included the cost of protecting Trump Tower (at a cost of $500,000 per day  for which the city hasnt been totally reimbursed yet.) The stroke of a pen in Washington does not change the people of New York City or our values, de Blasio vowed, a promise shared by mayors and officials of other sanctuary cities, from Chicago to Boston to Los Angeles."}, {"date": "2017/01/25", "title": "Will McCain Sue Trump for Trying to Bring Back Torture?", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/will-mccain-sue-trump-for-trying-to-bring-back-torture.html", "text": " People worried about Donald Trumps respect for the law and the Constitution have often wondered if the presidents political party and the federal courts would restrain him if he crossed too many lines.

Back in November, Senate Armed Services Committee chairman John McCain responded to the thenpresident-elects frequent praise for the use of torture in interrogations by threatening litigation: Now that he is in office, Trump is reportedly (according to a leaked draft order) going to put McCain to the test: McCain has now fired off a statement reminding Trump that the enhanced interrogation methods Trump is pining for are in violation of a law passed by Congress in 2015, and commenting: With respect to the CIAs black sites, McCain noted that Trumps choice for CIA director, Mike Pompeo, had publicly committed in confirmation hearings that the intelligence agency would comply with military standards for interrogations, which ban waterboarding and similar enhanced techniques. So will Trump go ahead, and then will McCain see him in court? Well see. I suppose it is possible the review Trump is ordering will conclude that torture is both morally repellant and an unreliable way to procure information, and everybody will be happy.

Last year Chicago saw its worst violence in 20 years, and 2017 is already off to a bad start. So far there have been 228 shootings, up from 216 during the same period last year, according to the Chicago Tribune. There have been 42 homicides in 2017, compared to 34 by this time in 2016. Trump often painted a grim picture of inner cities on the campaign trail, and he tweeted about Chicago earlier this month. But it appears the presidents tweet on Tuesday was inspired by a segment on The OReilly Factor. Just before it was posted, Trump praised Fox News via Twitter for having higher inauguration ratings than fake news CNN. (Another potential inspiration: Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel knocked Trump on Monday, saying, You didnt get elected to debate the crowd size at your inaugural.) In the Fox segment, OReilly and Horace Cooper of the National Center for Public Policy Research discussed how Trump could take federal action to combat violence in Chicago, and used the word carnage. Cooper said: OReilly suggested Trump could also send in the National Guard, adding, The governor wont. The governor is afraid, the governor is a coward. Trump has not elaborated on what he meant by send in the Feds, but the Tribune notes that the idea of sending the National Guard into Chicago has been raised repeatedly in the last decade as gun violence has worsened in the city. In August, Illinois governor Bruce Rauner, a Republican, said hes discussed the idea with community leaders, police, and the National Guard, but no thoughtful leader thinks thats a good idea or would really provide a solution."}, {"date": "2017/01/20", "title": "Donald Trump Declares America a Democracy Again, in Populist Inaugural Address", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/donald-trump-declares-america-a-democracy-again.html", "text": " As a light rain fell on the modest crowd scattered across the National Mall  and pedestrians gawked at shattered storefronts a few blocks away  Donald J. Trump announced that the United States had become a democracy again. Today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people, the new president declared. January 20, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. The first notes Trump sounded as leader of the free world were more strident than most had expected. The opening passages of his remarks assailed the bipartisan congregation of political elites arrayed in front of him as a parasitic cabal, whom the American people owed little more than contempt. For too long, a small group in our nations capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost, Trump said. Politicians prospered, but the jobs left and the factories closed. The Establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs. And while they celebrated in our nations capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land. The Republican standard-bearer argued that the differences between Americas two major political parties were insignificant, when compared to the differences between the people and the Establishment, saying, What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people. It was not always clear who, precisely, these people were. While Trumps speech was filled with paeans to a national unity that transcends the divisions of race, region, and religion, at times, the you he was addressing became decidedly less diverse. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer, the president said. You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement, the likes of which the world has never seen before. At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction, that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Trump then defined what it means for a nation to serve its citizens in starkly protectionist terms, promising to guard our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. The president went on to describe the decrepit America that he would be inheriting after decades of globalist rule  a country where rusted-out factories are scattered like tombstones across the landscape, our young and beautiful students are deprived of all knowledge, and the crime and the gangs and the drugs rob our nations unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now, Trump promised, proceeding to argue that by restoring a vigorous nationalism  both civic and economic  the American peoples financial hardships and bitter divisions would swiftly end. As, for that matter, would the threat of Islamic terrorism and the miseries of disease. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth, Trump said. We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and hire American. When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice, the president continued. Its time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget, that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots. This was not a conservative speech. While Trump softened the undertones of white resentment that infused his campaign-trail improvisations, the populist, nationalist, and quasi-authoritarian themes of those stump speeches were, if anything, accentuated. On Friday, a Republican president did not come to power. Donald Trump did  and, with him, the people.

This is absolutely a political revolution for America. Its very exciting, he said. What we did with Brexit is amazing. But as Trump said himself, his election is Brexit plus-plus-plus. Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party, was in Washington on the eve of Trumps inauguration for a party to celebrate the publication of The Daily Mail writer Arron Bankss book, The Bad Boys of Brexit, which chronicled Farages role leading last summers Brexit vote  a political shock that augured Trumps own win. Im very English, Trumps very American. But our missions have been remarkably similar, Farage told me. Plus, were the two most demonized people in the West! It might seem odd that heartland Republicans would fete an English member of the European Parliament, but since the Brexit vote, Farage has become an unlikely celebrity in Trumps movement. Hes a close ally of Trump adviser Steve Bannon and attended the Republican National Convention in July, where he ran into members of Mississippi Governor Phil Bryants staff at a hotel bar at 4 a.m. After bonding over a round of drinks, Bryants staffers invited Farage to deliver a speech at a Trump rally in Jackson the following month. Hes been back to the States eight times since then. I saw remarkable parallels with the United Kingdom. When I went into the crowd afterward, they were the same people who voted for Brexit, Farage said. They were ordinary people, some of them hadnt voted for years, and they thought nows a chance to actually change things. Shortly before we spoke, Farage waded through the crowd that included conservative talk-radio host Laura Ingraham and Iowa Congressman Steve King. Im going to get a reload! he said, swishing an almost-empty gin-and-tonic as he headed toward the bar. With a fresh drink in hand, he made his way to the stage to deliver a rousing speech honoring Trump. Theres still a level of disbelief that Trump has won. Its time to end that disbelief and say, we did it! he said, thrusting his arms skyward. The crowd roared. When I look back, perhaps the greatest joy was watching as state after state in the Midwest went red, just to see the faces of those CNN presenters! The crowd roared again. Afterward, well-wishers thronged Farage to congratulate him and snap selfies. Its gonna be our house now, Governor Bryant gushed as he nodded at the White House. Were back. Farage beamed."}]
