The Capitol Hill spending watchdog has agreed to a request from Democratic lawmakers to look into the way the president\u2019s transition team spent federal funds appropriated to ensure a smooth handover between the Obama and Trump administrations.\n\nThe decision to have the transition team rent office and event space from businesses owned by the Trump Organization caused many ethics experts to express concern about potential ethical violations. At the time, a Trump spokesman said that none of the money appropriated by Congress would go to Trump organizations. (The transition team was also allowed to accept private donations.)\n\nRelated: Trump Hands Democrats Another Reason to Shut Down the Government\n\nThe team also raised eyebrows with the unorthodox way that it facilitated contact between Trump and foreign officials.\n\nThe review was launched at the request of Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) back in November. In their request, they said, \u201cWe are writing today to request that the GAO conduct a review of President-Elect Trump's taxpayer-funded transition. We are concerned about reports of \u2018disarray\u2019 within a \u2018chaotic\u2019 transition, and ask that your review address several concerns, including conflicts of interest related to business holdings of Mr. Trump and his family; potential violations of protocol and security precautions related to Mr. Trump's communications with foreign leaders; and transparency related to the use of taxpayer funds in the transition.\u201d\n\nThe GAO, last week, responded with a letter confirming that it had accepted the request and would work toward producing a preliminary report on its findings by June.\n\nAmong the areas that the agency proposes to explore:\n\nWhat laws guide the transition process, who enforces them and what \u201cethics-related provisions\u201d apply to members of a presidential transition team?\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are the funds appropriated by Congress for the transition accounted for, and how was the money spent? How much private money did the transition accept?\n\n\n\n\n\nDid the transition team consult with the Office of Government Ethics or otherwise take advantage of its services in relation to identifying conflicts of interest and facilitating financial disclosures? How did that compare to previous transitions?\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, GAO will ask, \u201cWhat information and services related to communication with heads of foreign governments were made available to the President- and Vice President-Elect and transition team?

A literal blank piece of paper, and say, \u2018If you were going to rebuild the executive branch, what would it look like?\u201d\n\nMulvaney didn\u2019t hazard a guess as to what a futuristic federal workforce would look like, exactly, other than to say it would be a big part of Trump\u2019s call for \u201cdraining the swamp\u201d and initially at least would mimic the spending priorities spelled out in the president\u2019s recent budget submission to Congress for fiscal 2017 and 2018.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, then it\u2019s a good bet a reconstituted bureaucracy would be top heavy with civilian workers at the Pentagon, the VA and Department of Homeland Security, which all got major spending boosts for the coming years. The Environment Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the State Department and other agencies whose past policies ran afoul of Trump\u2019s vision for America would most likely be scaled back.\n\nAnother concern is how Mulvaney\u2019s efforts dovetail with those of Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and a former real estate and media executive who is heading up a new White House office of American Innovation in the West Wing. Kushner has assembled a team of strategic consultants and former business executives to generate fresh thinking in government and eliminate wasteful or duplicative programs.\n\nRelated: The Five Biggest Winners and Losers in Trump\u2019s Fiscal 2018 Budget\n\nPresumably, Mulvaney and Kushner are working in concert, yet the potential for overlapping efforts and tension are great. Moreover, there are numerous political and legal obstacles to any major overhaul and downsizing effort, as previous administrations have discovered.\n\nMax Stier, an authority on the federal workforce, said in an interview that the Trump administration might be on the right track if they approach reforms as a way of re-aligning government services to the president\u2019s policies, and not as an excuse for slashing the size of government.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the big question in my mind,\u201d said Stier, president and CEO of the non-partisan Partnership for Public Service, a federal government advocacy group. \u201cIf the goal is to downsize, then it\u2019s a mistake. If the goal is to align your human resources against your priorities and it as efficient as possible, then it\u2019s hard to argue with. It\u2019s the right thing to do, and ought to be done on a regular basis.\u201d\n\nAll this activity stems from Trump\u2019s Jan. 23 executive order imposing the temporary hiring freeze and calling for long-term planning to overhaul and downsize the federal government.\n\n\n\nRelated: Team Trump Wants to Sell Unused Federal Buildings, But it Won\u2019t Be Easy\n\nHowever, with the exception of substantial shrinkage during the Clinton administration, the size of the civilian workforce is around 2.8 million. Technological advancements should have replaced a vast number of clerical and administrative workers. In addition to its full-time workforce, the federal government paid close to $240 billion to its top 100 contractors in 2015.\n\nMulvaney was careful not to say yesterday how much lower the workforce number would go. He also had nothing to say about the mushrooming of private contract employees who constitute a shadow government of sorts, at a great cost to taxpayers.\n\nThe federal government is largely funded by Congress through annual appropriations bills, and lawmakers on key committees and subcommittees with jurisdiction over agencies and programs can block spending cuts and reorganization efforts they disagree with.\n\nRepublican and Democratic lawmakers including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) already have raised objections to some of Trump\u2019s proposed spending cuts. And many Democratic lawmakers are likely to object to steep cutbacks in the ranks of federal workers \u2013 including many who are constituents.\n\nRelated: The Federal Government Really Does Need an Overhaul: Can Trump Get It Done?\n\nStier stressed that Congress would have a lot to say about the ultimate success or failure of the Trump workforce initiatives. \u201cYou can\u2019t dance alone on this,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have Congress involved from the get-go. Not only do they make the budgets themselves and appropriate the money, but they also are fundamental to most consequential changes you might want to implement.\u201d\n\nAlso, the new administration must cope with a maze of federal civil service rules that greatly complicate efforts to downsize agencies through a reduction in force (RIFs), firing and retirement.\n\nRobert Shea, a former OMB executive during the administration of George W. Bush, told Federal News Radio that Mulvaney was undertaking a herculean effort to integrate all or part of 22 different federal departments and agencies.\n\n\u201cIf they try to do that, they\u2019ll fail,\u201d said Shea, now a principal with Grant Thornton. \u201cIf they break it into manageable parts, it might not just be the most ambitious reorganization in the last 20 years or more; it could also be the most successful.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/04/12", "title": "Should Cheap and Lethal Barrel Bombs Be the New 'Red Line' in Syria?", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/04/12/Should-Cheap-and-Lethal-Barrel-Bombs-Be-New-Red-Line-Syria", "text": "Senator Lindsey Graham, a frequent critic of President Trump but a supporter of his strike last week against the regime of Bashar al-Assad, said on Tuesday that barrel bombs should be the new \u201cred line\u201d in Syria.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I would tell President Trump,\u201d the South Carolina Republican said in a CNN interview. \u201cYou did a great thing by enforcing the chemical weapons violation.

The drums are filled with explosives and pieces of metal such as nuts, bolts and nails and dropped on enemy positions from helicopters or planes.\n\nThe unguided bombs are indiscriminate weapons that explode on impact and can kill or wound anyone within the range of the flying metal.\n\nRelated: Here's What Firing 59 Tomahawk Missiles at Syria's Airfield Cost\n\nBut barrel bombs, which can be constructed for a few hundred dollars, can contain lethal material other than metal shards.

The shootings at the Pulse nightclub left 49 dead and 53 wounded.\n\nThe sole perpetrator of the Pulse attack \u2013 the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history \u2013 was an American-born security guard of Afghani origins named Omar Mateen who is said to have pledged his allegiance to ISIS.

Republicans are no doubt frustrated by a lack of progress on health care and tax reform, apparent infighting in the West Wing and, for many Trump supporters, the specter of another round of foreign policy adventures.\n\nAbove it all, workers of all political stripes must be frustrated by the fact that the economic expansion has yet to deliver the kind of wage gains that have been long promised. That, to individual Americans, is the ultimate measure of whether the economy is \"good\" or not. Despite an unemployment rate that has fallen to just 4.5 percent (lowest since May 2007), wage gains remain lukewarm.\n\nRelated: How Much Money It Takes to Be in the Top 1% In Every State\n\nNo wonder the post-election ebullience hasn't translated into \"hard data\" gains in terms of things like auto sales or GDP growth. Indeed, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow real-time estimate of first-quarter growth stands at just 0.6 percent.\n\nWhat, exactly, is it going to take to get take-home pay moving higher?\n\nDeutsche Bank economist Joseph LaVorgna says the problem is that ongoing labor market slack may not be fully captured by the data. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen echoed this sentiment in a speech in Michigan on Monday, noting that the decline in the labor participation rate might be a hidden unemployment measure since these folks could, conceivably, reenter the workforce once they see upward pressure on wages.\n\nThus, LaVorgna believes the unemployment rate will need to fall even further to get wages to move meaningfully. Back in 2007, when the unemployment rate was last at current levels, average hourly earnings were growing at a 3.5 percent annual pace, compared to just 2.7 percent now. Moreover, the current pace represents a slight decline from this cycle's peak wage growth of 2.9 percent seen in December.\n\nRelated: The Most Overpaid CEO in America\n\nOne clue to the lingering labor market slack could be the broader U-6 measure of unemployment, which includes those working part-time but desiring full-time work as well as other marginally attached workers. This unemployment rate stands at 8.9 percent now vs. 8.2 percent in May 2007.\n\nUS Unemployment Rate data by YCharts\n\nFinally, the lack of labor productivity growth means that businesses are resisting wage gains as much as possible right now in an effort to protect profit margins.

Compare this to the 2.2 percent annualized rate posted in the five years ending in 2007.\n\nThinking optimistically, here's how things need to play out: LaVorgna believes the narrow U-3 unemployment rate will need to fall to 4 percent or below for average hourly earnings growth to accelerate to the 3 percent to 4 percent range, where most American workers would finally start to feel good about their income gains. Productivity growth would likely follow, since businesses would be forced to invest in labor-saving technology to minimize the hit to the expense line."}, {"date": "2017/04/12", "title": "Budget Chief Admits Trump Can\u2019t Wipe Out $20 Trillion in Debt in 8 Years", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/04/12/Budget-Chief-Admits-Trump-Can-t-Wipe-Out-20-Trillion-Debt-8-Years", "text": "If ever there was a campaign promise that rang bogus from the start, it was President Trump\u2019s vow to wipe out the entire national debt \u2013 now inching close to $20 trillion \u2013 within eight years.\n\nTrump made that promise last April during a wide-ranging interview with The Washington Post\u2019s Bob Woodward and Robert Costa.

The website reported Wednesday morning that Mick Mulvaney, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, is telling GOP lawmakers that the administration wants a rider added to the spending bill that would bar federal funding from flowing to so-called sanctuary cities.\n\nSanctuary cities are loosely defined as municipalities that don\u2019t fully cooperate with federal authorities to enforce immigration law. Policies differ from city to city, but typically they encourage undocumented immigrants to report crimes without fear that they will be handed over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In New York City, those crimes might include acts of terror. Some refuse to hold undocumented immigrants who are arrested until they can be picked up by immigration officials or even to report that they have an undocumented person in custody in the first place.\n\nTrump has been particularly incensed by sanctuary cities since the beginning of his presidential campaign in 2015 and has repeatedly called for federal funding to be withheld from them as punishment. Last month, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that states and municipalities that fail to demonstrate compliance with federal requests for assistance in immigration cases would be ineligible for grants from the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Justice Programs.\n\nMulvaney\u2019s demand, though, goes considerably further than that, Politico says, encompassing a much wider range of programs.\n\nRelated: The Clock Is Ticking on a Government Shutdown \u2014 5 Things You Need to Know\n\nIf Republicans block federal funding to sanctuary cities, most of which tend to be heavily Democratic, the prospects of bipartisan cooperation on the bill would most likely dry up instantly.\n\nNancy Pelosi, the leader of House Democrats, represents a district wholly within the sanctuary city San Francisco. She and fellow Democrats who support large urban areas would never get behind a bill with a funding ban that hit their constituencies. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, likewise, comes from New York, which is also a sanctuary city. In the Senate, the Republicans will need to assemble 60 votes to avoid a filibuster, and Schumer wouldn\u2019t be inclined to help find them for a bill shutting off funds to major cities.\n\nThe pressure from the White House to include the rider, while plainly in line with Trump\u2019s view of how sanctuary cities ought to be treated, may also be an effort to bring the Freedom Caucus on board with the rest of the Republicans in the House GOP conference when it comes to the spending bill, something that would allow the GOP to pass it without any Democratic votes.\n\nThe roughly three-dozen-strong Freedom Caucus, if it withholds its support, can deprive Republican leadership of a majority of floor votes if Democrats refuse to cooperate.\n\nRelated: How Trump's Latest Twitter Tantrum Could Shut Down the Government\n\nWhether a sanctuary city\u2019s rider would be enough to get Freedom Caucus support is unclear.

Many just hung up.\n\nThe Veterans Affairs Department\u2019s much-derided suicide hotline goal was to have no more than 10 percent of calls routed to overflow can centers.

The Left, enabled by groups like We Will Replace You, is threatening to mount a primary challenge to any Democrat that \u201ccolludes\u201d with Trump\u2026on anything.\n\nRelated: Think Trump Will Make Your Taxes Easier Next Year? Don\u2019t Get Your Hopes Up\n\nConsequently, some think Republicans should attempt a more limited tax overhaul, in hopes that it could attract some Democrat supporters. For example, they propose combining a one-time opportunity for U.S. firms to bring home profits stashed overseas, paying only a modest tax, with an infrastructure program.\n\nAn estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates at least $2.6 trillion is held overseas by U.S. firms. If a 10 percent \u201crepatriation\u201d tax was levied on those funds, the Treasury would collect a $260 billion windfall. Those revenues could provide funding for a private-public program to rebuild our tunnels and airports. That popular idea would be tough for Democrats to resist.\n\nThe repatriation opportunity received bipartisan encouragement in the past, but that was then. There\u2019s no assurance Dems would go along, and in any case, the GOP wants more than a quick fix to our dysfunctional 75,000-page tax code; they want to \u201cgo big.\u201d They campaigned on lower taxes for individuals, not just corporations, and they need to deliver.\n\nAs a result, Republicans will try to pass broad tax reform as part of the budget \u2013 a process called \u201creconciliation.\u201d The trick here is that they must follow the so-called \u201cByrd\u201d rule governing that approach, and come up with a plan that is \u201crevenue neutral for ten years and beyond.\u201d Trump and his team want to slash individual and corporate tax rates; policy makers need to find extra revenues to avoid blowing up the deficit. Ways and Means Chair Kevin Brady\u2019s solution is the border adjustment tax (BAT), which aims to encourage exports.\n\nRelated: The Fed, the Reality of Tax Cuts, and Donald Trump\n\nThat idea has not won the backing of the White House. Trump initially called it \u201ctoo complicated;\u201d members of his economic team are searching for alternatives. Gary Cohn, who is White House Economic Council Director, has apparently taken the lead in this pursuit, even though the former Goldman Sachs president is new to tax policy. He reportedly suggested a carbon tax to balance the books, but that idea was almost immediately shot down. (He has since denied that he considered such a levy.)\n\nOther administration players reportedly weighing in on tax strategy include National Economic Council member Shahira Knight, Steven Mnuchin and his Treasury colleagues Craig Phillips and Justin Muzinich as well as advisors Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner. Only Knight, a former lobbyist for Fidelity Investments, is a tax policy wonk. Others are still early on the learning curve.\n\nComplicating the consensus-building at the White House is a profound split in ideology. Gary Cohn, Mnuchin and Phillips lean left; all have contributed to Democrats, and their take on tax reform (and everything else) is viewed with suspicion by their Republican colleagues.\n\nMeanwhile, GOP tax architects were dealt a heavy blow when the Freedom Caucus nuked the healthcare plan. Contained in the AHCA was a trillion-dollar tax cut. That was the total amount, stretched over a decade, expected to be saved by rolling back the different fees and levies contained in Obamacare. (Apparently the Freedom Caucus didn\u2019t get that memo.)\n\nSince that trillion-dollar cut to taxes did not come through, cutting tax rates will result in considerably higher lost revenues. The quest for a balancing mechanism becomes even tougher.\n\nRelated: Trump Team Could Pull the Plug on Obamacare Subsidies for 2018\n\nBrady\u2019s BAT, which would slap a 20 percent tax on imports, creates winner and losers and is therefore controversial. Americans for Prosperity, funded by the Koch brothers, is running an ad campaign opposing the BAT focused on how the levy might drive up the cost of living. It fails to mention that lower tax rates are expected to offset higher consumer prices, or that some expect currency values to adjust for the import fee. It powerfully warns the tax will harm lower and middle-income Americans.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s David Perdue picks up that refrain and is a leading critic of Brady\u2019s approach in the Senate. Formerly the CEO of a discount retail chain, Perdue wrote in a letter in February, \"this 20-percent tax on all imports is regressive, hammers consumers, and shuts down economic growth.\" Tom Cotton of Arkansas, home to Walmart, also opposes the measure, which is considered damaging to retailers.\n\nAssuming the border tax fails, Republicans need to either find another revenue source or change the rules governing reconciliation. The latter is more probable. They can move the goalposts; instead of \u201cten years and beyond,\u201d they can determine that any change will not increase the deficit over 15 years, or 20. In 2001, Congress changed the window from 5 years to 10, because legislators didn\u2019t want the Bush tax cuts to expire after only five years.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Tax Plan Could Affect Your Social Security\n\nTax reformers can argue that if the goal is to entice companies to make long-lasting investments in the U.S., the changes should extend beyond a decade. Extending the timeframe would also accomplish this: now that the CBO is allowed to use dynamic scoring, it can project growth from tax cuts extending farther into the future. This will help portray tax reform as revenue neutral.\n\nThis is where we are. It isn\u2019t pretty. The central players in this drama confront numerous obstacles, including many of their own making. They will get it done, but those working behind the scenes now see success at best by the end of this year. Beyond that, voters will run out of patience, markets could falter, and the GOP could take a serious licking in the midterm elections."}, {"date": "2017/04/11", "title": "The 13 Least Popular Senators in America", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Media/Slideshow/2017/04/11/13-Least-Popular-Senators-America", "text": "13.

He\u2019ll also try to sell federal property that no one uses, but that costs taxpayers a fortune to maintain.\n\nThat last idea \u2013 to unload surplus or underutilized federal buildings and land and funnel the profits into the federal coffers \u2013 has long been a dream of Republican and Democratic administration. Yet for decades the effort to shed surplus and abandoned real estate \u2013 both in civilian and military government \u2013 has proved to be an elusive goal.\n\nAnd for all the energy and determination that the former Tea Party conservative House member from South Carolina brings to his new job as budget czar, Mulvaney is likely to run into the same brick wall.\n\nRelated: Government Wastes More Money than You Think\n\nWith more than three billion square feet of real estate under its aegis, the federal government is far and away the largest landlord in the country. Much of that property \u2013 acquired over the years to help agencies fulfill their diverse missions -- is of little or no use to the government today. Yet Congress has appropriated billions of dollars over the years simply to preserve the unneeded and unwanted property that agencies can\u2019t unload.\n\nIn fiscal 2010 \u2013 the last year for which accurate data is available \u2013 the government spent $1.67 billion operating and maintaining 295,000 underutilized or vacant buildings. The annual cost of preserving the surplus property has steadily added to the deficit.\n\nPresident Obama was the last chief executive to try to do something about the problem. He launched an effort in 2012 to reform federal real estate management practices, with an eye toward culling the stock of underutilized or surplus property.\n\nThe OMB later issued government-wide guidance \u2013 known as the National Strategy for the Efficient Use of Real Property \u2013 but ended up with relatively little to show for the effort.\n\nRelated: The Five Biggest Winners and Losers in Trump\u2019s Fiscal 2018 Budget\n\nThe General Services Administration \u2013 which manages about 15 percent of federal government holdings -- insists that it has made important strides in recent years. Between fiscal 2011 and 2015, the agency said it disposed of 947 properties managed by both the GSA and other federal land-holding agencies that generated $289 million in proceeds.\n\nLast April, GSA sold the Metro West facility in downtown Baltimore for more than $7 million in a public property auction. The previous year, GSA sold the Federal Reserve Building in Seattle for $16 million at an online auction with eight bidders competing.\n\nWhile these and other transactions suggest progress, the proceeds from the sales are relatively paltry. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) said in a report last year that despite the best efforts of the Obama administration and some lawmakers, \u201csignificant challenges persist\u201d for 23 government agencies and departments in managing their surplus real property.\n\n\u201cDespite implementing policies and systems that may help federal agencies manage real property, the federal government continues to maintain too much excess and underutilized property,\u201d Dave Wise, GAO\u2019s Director of Physical Infrastructure, said in congressional testimony last year.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s \u2018Hard Power\u2019 Budget Gives Billions to Defense, Guts Domestic Programs\n\nIn the District of Columbia, for example, the old Cotton Annex, an 118,000-square-foot aging hulk located just two blocks from the National Mall, has been vacant since 2007. It has taken many years for the government to dispose of portions of the old St. Elizabeths mental hospital campus in Southeast Washington. And the GSA for years has left numerous vacant warehouses throughout the city.\n\nThese problems are duplicated in cities and states throughout the country. The Baltimore Sun reported in July 2013 that two years after the Obama administration had rebooted the government\u2019s efforts to dispose of surplus federal buildings, almost all of the excess property identified in Maryland remained in government hands.\n\n\u201cRed tape, lack of congressional action and inadequate funding have left federal agencies stuck with at least 200 vacant or underutilized properties in the state, from closet-size storage sheds in Beltsville to an eight-story, historic office building a block from Baltimore's Inner Harbor,\u201d the newspaper reported.\n\nThere are no reliable figures for the total market value of vacant or underutilized federal property, although it is likely to be in the hundreds of billions. However, cashing in on that property is problematic at best. That\u2019s because the GSA and other government agencies face numerous obstacles in disposing of federal property that a commercial realtor doesn\u2019t routinely face.\n\nFor instance, there are legally prescribed steps in the disposal process that can take months to complete, according to GAO. This process includes requirements that the property is screened first for potential use by other federal agencies, then by homeless providers and state and local governments for other public uses.\n\nRelated: Congress to Pentagon: Don\u2019t Even Think About Closing Military Bases\n\nAlso, aging government properties may not appeal to potential buyers or lessees if they require substantial repairs or environmental remediation \u2013 work that the federal government usually can\u2019t afford to do in advance. The required environmental assessments and remediation can be highly expensive and time-consuming, a fact that often scares away would-be buyers.\n\nFinally, key stakeholders involved in the process \u2013 such as local governments, non-profit organizations, environmentalists, tribal governments and business\u2014often fight over how best to dispose of the property.\n\nIn the case of the Department of Veterans Affairs, veterans\u2019 organizations frequently insist on being consulted on plans to reuse or demolish the VA\u2019s historic buildings and how those plans impact the services provided to the nation\u2019s veterans.\n\n\u201cFinal decisions about a property may reflect competing interests and broader stakeholder considerations that may not align with what an agency views as the most cost effective or efficient alternative for a property,\u201d according to the GAO report.\n\nThe Trump administration could, of course, change those barriers to sale to save taxpayers money. If, for example, property has been on the market for 5 years, and no one has come forward to purchase it or tried to reconcile any dispute, then it could become a free and clear sale in accordance with the laws of the state.\n\nIf you want to see what the government is selling right now, including four Rolex watches, click on GSA Auctions."}, {"date": "2017/04/11", "title": "Will the Best-Liked Senators Please Step Forward?

In advance of his arrival in the Russian capital, Tillerson told reporters at a meeting of the G-7 countries in Italy that Russia must choose whether to align itself with Syria, Iran and Hezbollah, or to be a partner to the United States and the West. Either way, he said, Assad must go.\n\n\u201cIt is clear to all of us that the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cBut the question of how that ends and the transition itself could be very important in our view to the durability, the stability inside of a unified Syria.\u201d\n\nRelated: Russia Walks Back Threats of Retaliation If the US Strikes Syria Again\n\nSyria has been engaged in a complex civil war since mid-2011, and the Assad regime has earned international condemnation for indiscriminate attacks on civilians in rebel-held areas, including the use of chemical weapons and \u201cbarrel bombs.\u201d A chemical attack on the city of Idlib last week killed dozens, including many children, and spurred President Trump to order airstrikes on the base from which the assault was launched.\n\nTillerson\u2019s de facto ultimatum was issued after the secretary of state participated in a side meeting at the G-7 that involved representatives from a number of countries, including multiple Middle Eastern nations such as Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cWe want to relieve the suffering of the Syrian people -- Russia can be a part of that future and play an important role,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cOr Russia can maintain its alliance with this group, which we believe is not going to serve Russia's interests longer term.\u201d\n\nBut persuading Russia to abandon Assad will not be simple. Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime is running short on allies, after his invasion of neighboring Ukraine in 2014 and the Kremlin\u2019s continued support of armed rebels fighting the government in that country\u2019s Donbas region.\n\nRelated: Why The US Can't Just Take Out Assad\n\nIn Syria, Russia has its only substantial military base in the eastern Mediterranean and its largest concentration of troops anywhere outside of Russia. The prospect of losing that foothold if Assad is overthrown may not be acceptable to the Kremlin from a strategic perspective.\n\nIn addition, Russia has put its reputation as an international power on the line in Syria. By supporting the Assad regime it has laid down a marker that it would be exceedingly embarrassing to back away from under US pressure, both internationally and domestically.\n\nIn a statement issued in advance of Tillerson\u2019s arrival, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that the meeting\u2019s purpose, \u201cfirst and foremost\u201d would be to assess the United States\u2019 willingness to seek \u201cstabilization and normalization\u201d of the two countries\u2019 increasingly contentious bilateral relationship.\n\n\u201cIn connection with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2019s working visit to Russia beginning later today we would like to point out that we hope for productive talks,\" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement reported by the government-run TASS news agency. \"This is important for the prospects of our bilateral interaction and for the general climate in the international scene.\"\n\nRelated: Team Trump Still in Search of a Coherent Syria Policy\n\nThe TASS report made no mention of the conflict in Syria.

According to multiple reports, the administration is entertaining the possibility of eliminating the 12.4 percent payroll tax, which would require it to find a new dedicated funding source for the retirement checks that millions of Americans count on in their old age.\n\nThe plan, first reported by the Associated Press, would be part of a major overhaul of the tax code that would make the US system look much more like that of many European nations, which long ago adopted a Value Added Tax model. A VAT is a form of consumption tax that falls on consumers rather than producers.\n\nRelated: Think Trump Will Make Your Taxes Easier Next Year? Don\u2019t Get Your Hopes Up\n\nThe VAT model under consideration would generate significantly more revenue than the current corporate tax, allowing the elimination of the payroll taxes that fund Social Security and, all other things equal, giving workers a considerable boost in their take-home pay. (The 12.4 percent payroll tax is split evenly, with 6.2 percent paid by the employer and 6.2 percent paid out of the worker\u2019s gross wages.)\n\nBut as former president George W. Bush learned, people start getting nervous when politicians in Washington mess with Social Security.\n\nFor better or worse, the system was set up by design to be funded by a dedicated tax that appeared on every worker\u2019s pay stub throughout their working lives. One thing that did was create a sense of ownership of the benefit -- a sense of \u201centitlement,\u201d though not in the pejorative sense of the word as it is commonly used today.\n\nSocial Security is an entitlement not because people feel they are due to something that they didn\u2019t earn, but because they believe, rightly, that they have paid for it directly from their wages throughout their working lives.\n\nRelated: The Fed, the Reality of Tax Cuts, and Donald Trump\n\nIf the payroll tax is eliminated, and the system is funded by Congressional appropriations, the link between work and the Social Security check that one receives in retirement will be weakened, and that could have real ramifications for future debates about the program.\n\nThere are multiple reasons why it is easier for Congress to propose cuts in Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or other social safety net entitlement programs than it is to talk about cutting Social Security benefits. One of them is that many people view the recipients of social safety net spending as undeserving of a government handout, while Social Security recipients are merely collecting what they are owed.\n\n(The fact is that most Americans who live long enough to collect Social Security will actually get far more back from the system than they paid into it. So, while they may not be getting something they don\u2019t deserve, they\u2019re definitely getting more than they deserve.)\n\nThe Trump team\u2019s tax plans are in the formative stages at this point, and the suggestion that Congress should get under the hood of Social Security and change out the funding mechanism may be nothing more than an attempt to see how receptive, or not, the public is to the idea of Trump and Congressional Republicans tinkering with the program.\n\nEventually, though, some president and some Congress are going to have to find a way to change the Social Security system to ensure long-term solvency. The reaction to this proposal could provide some indication of whether that\u2019s a possibility during the Trump presidency."}, {"date": "2017/04/10", "title": "Will Trump\u2019s $600M Fighter Plane Sale to Nigeria Mean More Civilian Deaths?", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/04/10/Will-Trump-s-600M-Fighter-Plane-Sale-Nigeria-Mean-More-Civilian-Deaths", "text": "The Trump administration is closing a $600 million deal to permit the sale of a dozen highly sophisticated turboprop fighter planes to Nigeria to combat the Boko Haram Islamic terrorists despite the Nigerian air force\u2019s repeated bombing of civilian targets.\n\nWithin the next few weeks, the White House is expected to formally notify Congress of its controversial decision to sell as many as 12 Embraer A-29 Super Tucano aircraft equipped with special targeting and surveillance equipment.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s \u2018Hard Power\u2019 Budget Gives Billions to Defense, Guts Domestic Programs\n\nNigeria \u2013 a strong African ally of the U.S. -- has been attempting to purchase the highly versatile aircraft since 2015.

Most recently, as many as 236 civilians and aid workers were killed on January 17 when a Nigerian fighter jet repeatedly bombed a camp at Rann, near the border with Cameroon, where civilians had fled to escape Boko Haram.\n\nAmnesty International has also accused Nigeria's military of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the killings of an estimated 8,000 Boko Haram suspects.

Within 24 hours, it went from calling out the Assad regime for using chemical weapons to launching missiles at military targets. As limited as the strikes were, there are also statements that plans are in the works to target Syrian President Bashar al-Assad: It \u201cwould seem there would be no role for him to govern the Syrian people,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said of Assad on April 6.\n\nAs costly as inaction has been in the six years since the Arab Spring uprisings first took hold in Syria, recent history suggests that removing Assad in a hurry would be an even bigger mistake. In 16 years studying and working with complex conflicts like Syria, I have yet to see an exception to this rule.\n\nRelated: Team Trump Still in Search of a Coherent Syria Policy\n\nWe know where this goes next\n\nTargeting Assad would likely give birth to the same kind of catastrophe we saw in Libya after Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s fall. In Libya, with no true civil governance to hold the structure together, tribal alliances collapsed and a four-way fight for power emerged. It continues even now, accented by a growing presence of the Islamic State. The power vacuum that would follow the sudden and unwise removal of Assad could be worse than the current warfare, and nourish the already fertile growing conditions for violent extremist and paramilitary actors.\n\nAssad shouldn\u2019t remain in power \u2013 he\u2019s been proving that for six years. The recent Sarin gas attack is only the most recent on a long list of other human rights violations. But he should be part of a political and legal process that removes him. That process must come from the Syrians themselves, not from the outside. His departure should be negotiated with Syrian civil society leadership to legitimize the claim to power of a civilian government. Justice for his crimes should be served by Syrian courts.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\nNature abhors a vacuum: Unlike in a game of chess, in war removing the king is not the end, but only another beginning. The idea that Syria still exists as it looks on the map is a fantasy. Part of its territory is held by the government, part is lost to the Islamic State, part of it is in rebel hands. It won\u2019t come cleanly back together should the fighting suddenly end tomorrow. Tensions among rebel groups \u2013 which are already high \u2013 and between pro- and anti-IS forces will only increase with one combatant removed from the field. We can only attempt to predict where Assad\u2019s loyalist forces will go with their leader removed.\n\nRelated: Here's What Firing 59 Tomahawk Missiles at Syria's Airfield Cost\n\nIn order for Assad\u2019s withdrawal to be beneficial, it needs to come in the context of a sound Syrian-driven plan to move from immediate containment of violence to a return of civilian Syrian leadership and security. That plan currently doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nOutside solutions never work: In the international development world, it\u2019s been repeatedly shown that solutions to complicated problems can\u2019t be imposed from outside. They won\u2019t be sustainable and often do harm. Solutions have to come from inside a country\u2019s own civil society. Otherwise, the result is to undermine the legitimacy of the same systems of politics and justice that are necessary to hold a population together in the long term. At present there is little left of Syrian civil society, but local councils continue to provide the connective tissue that holds the country together in areas not held by Assad. These organizations can jump-start efforts to create new democratic institutions.\n\nWhat\u2019s the endgame? The classic underpinnings of our own strategic doctrine stress that military action should never be taken without a clear goal for a desired end-state. Of all the possible actions the U.S. could take, regime change is the most deceptively simple \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t qualify as an end-state. In fact, it would usher in a more chaotic and violent environment that would be hard to contain even by several countries working together militarily.\n\nLibya and Iraq both demonstrated this all too clearly. They fell into chaos despite the efforts \u2013 or perhaps because of the efforts \u2013 of multinational coalitions. Thursday\u2019s strikes only increased the sense of crisis and confusion, as everyone from the Syrians to the Russians to America itself wonders what the next move will be. Most worrisome, it\u2019s unclear whether Trump himself has a firm grasp on what he\u2019s doing next or why.\n\nRelated: America's Strike in Syria: The Generals Are Taking Charge\n\nWhither the ship of state? Most of America\u2019s high-level diplomatic positions are still unfilled. These are positions that manage complex State Department processes, and which have the political heft to hold their own with the Department of Defense in fights over direction and leadership. They coordinate with international partners to ensure there are no miscommunications and that missteps are minimized. They provide much-needed analysis about dynamics and changes in conflict zones. They also help to mitigate the heightened probability of accidental clashes with international actors such as Russia in the confusion and increased tension that follows military action.\n\nThe infrastructure through which Assad mounts his offensives cannot be decisively destroyed by anything limited and quick. They are too dispersed and numerous. Unless the United States is willing to commit to a sustained and substantial campaign or to throw its weight behind a political end to the war, Thursday\u2019s strikes are an empty gesture. At the same time, it\u2019s also true that even a sustained and substantial military campaign would not bring about peace and security, and would put American troops on a battlefield that\u2019s essentially one big crossfire. It\u2019s a catch-22.\n\nThe fact that the U.S. has now literally fired its opening salvo limits the American government\u2019s options \u2013 but the political process is a sustainable path that offers a way out of the catch, and there\u2019s still time to put our weight behind that. It does neither the Syrian people nor our own security any good to find urgency overnight, only to make a bad situation worse.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Conversation.

He also promised to greatly simplify the process of filing taxes by eliminating many deductions and loopholes.\n\nAs in the case of reforming the health insurance market, though, it seems tax reform will be more complicated that the president anticipated.\n\nThe Trump White House has already suffered one major legislative setback in the failure of its promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. In that case, the administration adopted a plan that was largely concocted by House Republican leaders, and Trump officials found themselves in the position of advocating an immensely unpopular bill that couldn\u2019t even pass with a GOP majority in the House.\n\nRelated: Chair of Freedom Caucus Open to Deficit-Expanding Tax Cuts\n\nThere seems to be an effort underway to avoid repeating some of those problems with the tax legislation. For one, the White House has signaled that it plans to play an active role in the development of the proposal, and unlike its previous legislative effort, it will bring some people with relevant experience to the task.\n\nThe White House is staffed with former investment bankers who are bound to have strong opinions on the question of business taxes. Trump also just named Kevin A. Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute to chair his Council of Economic Advisers. Tax policy is one of Hassett\u2019s main areas of interest.\n\nSo far, the existing tax plan has been a smorgasbord of disparate ideas and trial balloons, many of which appeal strongly to people with strong ideological points of view but might struggle to find broad support on their own.\n\nThere is wide agreement among both the White House and lawmakers on the need to slash or even eliminate corporate taxes. House leadership, for example, has been pushing a plan to replace the tax on corporate profits with a tax on imported goods and raw materials intended to spur domestic production.\n\nRelated: Will Trump Gamble on a Border Tax and Anger Millions of Walmart Shoppers?\n\nTrump himself has said that he is interested in imposing import taxes on goods on a country-by-country basis, generally in line with how fairly he believes other countries treat exports coming from the United States. Both of those proposals would likely drive up some prices for U.S. consumers.\n\nAnother factor that may have worked itself into the decision to start from scratch and hammer out a bill with Congress was the warning from the House Freedom Caucus last week that it is not willing to tolerate another major bill \u2014 like the health care proposal \u2014 that is written behind closed doors.\n\nIn an obvious shot across the bow, Freedom Caucus Chair Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina toled Republican leaders not to spring a bill on his members at the last moment: \u201cWhen a member sees the text for the first time in a leaked draft from Politico, therein is a problem.\u201d\n\nBecause the Freedom Caucus has the power to scuttle any bill the GOP tries to pass with only Republican votes, it\u2019s going to be difficult to deny them a seat at the table, and this delay may be a way for Trump and House leadership to signal that they are letting multiple factions within the party have a voice from the beginning of the process.\n\nRelated: Why Budget Hawks Want to Keep Obama\u2019s \u2018Cadillac Tax\u2019\n\nWhatever the motivation, restarting the process in April with the hope of wrapping it up by year-end seems extremely optimistic, given the legislative knife-fight that any major tax reform proposal is guaranteed to become once plans start to produce winners and losers.

With many details to be fleshed out and negotiated, entrepreneurs are hoping for tax changes to encourage business start-ups, which have been sluggish.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics says creation of new businesses hit about 679,000 in 2015, up from the Great Recession low of 561,000 in 2010 but still shy of the record 716,000 in 2006. Even worse, jobs created by businesses less than one year old, though rising in recent years, have lagged, hitting about 3 million in 2015 compared to more than 4.7 million a year in 1998 and 1999.\n\nRelated: All Those Warnings About the National Debt May Understate the Problem\n\nIn fact, many \"new businesses\" created in recent years are really just one-person shops set up by individuals who have lost their jobs, says Enrolled Agent Steven J.

But tax policies are culprits, too, according to start-up experts.\n\nSo what's on their tax wish list?\n\nRelated: The Worst States for Property Taxes \u2013 and the Best\n\nAll sorts of things, of course, ranging from eliminating the alternative minimum tax and estate tax that hit many small-business owners, to offering tax credits for new hires, to eliminating the IRS's ability to judge whether executive compensation is appropriate. But here are the four broad categories that come up most.\n\nTax cuts\n\nMost start-up experts endorse Trump's campaign proposal to cut the business tax rate to 15 percent. Currently, corporations face a top rate of 35 percent, while owners of many small businesses \u2014 typically set up as sole proprietorships, limited liability companies, partnerships or S corporations \u2014 pay income-tax rates topping out at 39.6 percent, plus a 3.8 percent Medicare surtax to fund Obamacare.\n\nSlashing business taxes could spur start-ups by raising after-tax earnings, making it worthwhile for prospective entrepreneurs to give up regular salaries to strike out on their own, says accountant Dominique Molina, founder of the American Institute of Certified Tax Planners.\n\nThe self-employment tax is another obstacle to start-ups, since an entrepreneur has to pay both the employer and employee's share, says Tom Wheelwright, CEO of ProVision Wealth of Tempe, Arizona.\n\nRelated: Is This a Sign of a Looming Stock Market Correction?\n\n\"An employee pays 7.65 percent in Social Security tax. As soon as she becomes self-employed, that rate doubles to 15.3 percent, and when she starts earning real income, Obamacare raises that rate to 16.2 percent,\" he says. \"Reducing or eliminating that extra self-employment tax would be huge for new entrepreneurs.\"\n\nFaster deductions\n\nMolina and others interviewed would also like businesses large and small to be able to deduct the cost of new assets, like equipment in the year they are purchased instead of spreading them over decades through depreciation allowances.\n\nThe tax code, she says, is not kind to start-up costs, like feasibility studies and expenses for things like professional advice.\n\n\"Under the current guidelines, just $5,000 of (this type of ) expense can be deducted in the year incurred, while the remainder is deducted over a 15-year period,\" she says. \"In the event costs exceed $50,000, taxpayers may not even be able to deduct the entire $5,000 of first-year expenses.\"\n\nEqual treatment for equity and debt\n\nStart-ups typically have little or no track record and may lose money for years, making it hard to borrow significant sums. So many raise money instead by selling stock. The tax code allows deductions for interest paid on debt but nothing comparable for stock, putting the stock-dependent start-up at a disadvantage.\n\nRelated: Will Unwinding the Fed\u2019s $4.5 Trillion Balance Sheet Kill the Bull Market?\n\nThe Tax Policy Center, a think tank devoted to tax issues, has found that partnerships, S corporations and other tax structures commonly used by start-ups face an effective marginal tax rate of 20 percent on stock, while a corporation using debt has a rate of \u20136 percent, meaning the tax code effectively subsidizes companies using debt.\n\nA level playing field\n\nCurrently, deductions for investments and losses are not all treated equally. The tax code \"favors investments in equipment, software and intellectual property over those in structures and inventories,\" according to the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, which studies entrepreneurship and business start-ups.\n\nR&D expenses are deductible in the year incurred, for example, while spending on equipment and structures is deducted over many years through depreciation.\n\nThis makes it harder, for example, for wholesale or retail start-ups that have little to write off. In fact, the Tax Policy Center found that a retail business faces an effective tax rate of 31 percent, while a chemical or pharmaceutical company would pay 9 percent to 11 percent. The higher rate is a stiff headwind for someone trying to open a store on Main Street.\n\nAlso, the Tax Policy Center says that a start-up that has yet to book profits doesn't get as much tax benefit from its losses and other write-offs as an established firm. Losses can be \"carried forward\" to offset future profits, but that doesn't provide much relief for a start-up struggling in the present.\n\n\"Such carry-forwards provide less value than immediate tax savings because of the time value of money, as well as the possibility that the firm will never report sufficient income to take advantage of them,\" the Tax Foundation says.\n\nNo one expects tax reform to be easy, given entrenched interest groups and the government's enormous appetite for tax revenue, but start-up advocates feel reform would pay off through more business and job creation.\n\n\"Our results illustrate the need for thoughtful tax reform,\" the Kauffman Foundation says. \"There is no reason to favor debt over equity, for example, and many differences across assets and industries appear difficult to justify.

He disdains globalism, espouses \u201ceconomic nationalism,\u201d has contempt for the corporate elite that puts profits before patriotism and doesn\u2019t think the U.S. needs to police the planet.\n\nHis path to power \u2014 not-so-rich kid from Richmond, Naval officer, investment banker, filmmaker, conservative zealot \u2014 has been as idiosyncratic as his boss\u2019s road to the Oval Office. Beyond that, Bannon is rumpled, profane, bombastic, sixtysomething and has been accused \u2014 probably unfairly \u2014 of being an anti-Semite.\n\nRelated: Steve Bannon Makes His Case for Economic Nationalism at CPAC\n\nKushner is a man on a mission to fix everything that ails the country and the world, thereby proving he is the smartest Harvard grad in the global room. Like his father, Charles, who did time for being too enthusiastic in his donations to Democrats, he is a real-estate developer who helped restore the family empire while Dad was in the slammer. He also ran a low-circulation, quirky New York newspaper, The Observer.\n\nHe derives his newfound political power from his closeness to his father-in-law, the president. He is smooth, sleek, soft-spoken, well-dressed and until the campaign, a thirtysomething with presumably Manhattan Democratic values \u2014 save for his hard-right support of Israel (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu once bunked in his room during a stay with the Kushner family).\n\nNow, many media stories say, Bannon and Kushner are at opposite ends of White House conference tables. Bannon and his lieutenants (including former Breitbart staffers) are lined up against Kushner, ex-Goldman Sachs President and Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and ex-Goldman exec Dina Powell.\n\nRelated: Team Trump Still in Search of a Coherent Syria Policy\n\nIn the middle are Chief of Staff Reince Prebius, Press Secretary Sean Spicer (who worked for Prebius when he ran the Republican National Committee) and perhaps senior counselor Kellyanne Conway, who joined the campaign around the same time as Bannon. She has other ties to Bannon but is basically a political operative for hire (early in the election cycle when she worked for Sen. Ted Cruz, she wasn\u2019t above bashing Trump).\n\nWhat has so many members of the press so giddy is that Bannon has been booted from the National Security Council, where he had installed himself while downgrading the roles of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nThis weekend, Bloomberg reported that K.T. McFarland, a Fox News commentator and veteran of the Reagan White House installed by disgraced former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn, was also stepping down, further depoliticizing the NSC.\n\nThose developments are seen as new NSC chief Gen. H.R. McMaster exerting his influence. But besides restoring the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, Gen. Joe Dunford, and intelligence overseer Dan Coats, Powell has been made a Deputy National Security Adviser \u2014 a win for the Kushner/Cohn cabal, which Bannon reportedly calls the \u201cWest Wing Democrats.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps the Republican faction most alarmed by Bannon\u2019s economic nationalism is Washington\u2019s military hawks,\u201d Robert Draper wrote in The New York Times Magazine on April 2.\n\nRelated: America's Strike in Syria \u2014 The Generals Are Taking Charge\n\nOn Meet the Press yesterday, Times Pentagon correspondent Helene Cooper said that the military \u201cthinks that Kushner is where their future is.\u201d\n\nThat may be so, but while Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d message was all Bannon and the strategist is said to have argued against the strike on Syria last Thursday, it might be a mistake to conclude he is against U.S. military might.\n\nBannon has a degree in national security from Georgetown, served as a special assistant to the chief of Naval operations at the Pentagon during his years in the Navy and has a daughter who graduated from West Point.\n\nIt might also be a mistake to think Bannon will be out like Flynn sometime soon.\n\nIn a discussion of the infighting at the White House on Meet the Press, Danielle Pletka of the conservative think tank the American Enterprise Institute said: \u201cBannon is the one who is expendable.\u201d And according to reports, Bannon threatened to quit when he was removed from the NSC but was talked out of leaving by Rebekah Mercer, daughter of billionaire Trump backer Robert Mercer and the person who brought Bannon and Conway into the Trump campaign.\n\nRelated: Feuding Trump Aides Meet and Agree to End 'Palace Intrigue': Source\n\nFor now, Kushner and Cohn \u2014 who has been talked about as a possible replacement for Prebius as chief of staff \u2014 appear to be in the ascendancy (and as Ivanka\u2019s husband, Kushner is unlikely to ever be demoted), though with as mercurial a president as Trump, there are no guarantees of anything. Bloomberg quoted McMaster as saying of Bannon\u2019s departure from the NSC: \u201cThis is not as significant as it appears. Steve Bannon provides the president with advice on a broad range of issues and will continue to do so.\u201d\n\nReuters and others have reported that warring White House factions are working to repair relations, and there are two big reasons Bannon won\u2019t be toast: The Mercers and the base \u2014 the blue collars championed by Bannon who voted for Trump and will be needed again in the future.\n\nThere is also the fact that were he not in the White House, Bannon untethered to Trump could be a serious danger to his presidency as it goes more, um, mainstream.\n\nAs Lyndon Johnson is said to have remarked about FBI Director J.

Publicly held debt \u2013 the amount the Treasury borrows to keep the government afloat, currently about $14.5 trillion \u2013 is already at post-war high of 77 percent of GDP, and the CBO sees it doubling over the next three decades.\n\nThe CBO outlook paints a fairly grim picture, but a well-known spending watchdog says the national debt may be in even worse shape. A new analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget finds that given the right set of policies and economic circumstances, the debt could actually rise as high as 225 percent of GDP over the next three decades.\n\nRelated: A Military Buildup and Big Tax Cuts - Is the Debt Set to Soar Under Trump?\n\nOf course, predicting economic performance and the size of the cumulative public debt over the next 30 years is no easy task. Some might say it\u2019s a fool\u2019s mission.\n\nEven so, at a time when the gross national debt is fast approaching $20 trillion and the Treasury is bumping up against the limits of its borrowing authority, this exercise by the CRFB is worth considering.\n\nThe crux of the difference in the forecasts by CBO and CRFB is this: CBO uses a baseline reflecting \u201ccurrent law,\u201d which means that the agency\u2019s numbers crunchers assumes that no new legislation will be passed in the future other than what is needed to keep the government operating at a normal pace. That includes approving budgets, enacting appropriations bills, funding government agencies and programs and financing needed public works projects.\n\nWhile other legislation will no doubt be proposed and enacted, CBO says it\u2019s impossible to predict what might happen, so they don\u2019t try to anticipate major changes in policy. But the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget takes a different approach.\n\nRelated: How GOP Conservatives Could Make Tax Reform Impossible\n\nAnalysts for the anti-deficit research organization go out on a limb in making predictions. They assume, for instance, that a number of temporary tax cuts and business loopholes will be made permanent at some point. Also, they are counting on Congress to permanently repeal three Obamacare taxes currently in abeyance \u2013 the medical device tax, the health insurers\u2019 tax and the \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on high-end health insurance policies offered by employers.\n\nAdditionally, the CRFB makes the not unrealistic assumption that Congress will permanently repeal the spending caps on defense and domestic programs mandated by the 2011 Budget Control Act. Those discretionary spending caps have been partially repealed in each of the past four years, but are scheduled to come back in 2018. President Trump has proposed lifting the defense spending cap again next year to make way for a huge military buildup, and there\u2019s a good chance he\u2019ll get his way, especially in the wake of the recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria.\n\nThese anticipated policy changes would reduce taxes by $752 billion over the coming decade, boost general spending by $1 trillion and increase interest costs on the debt by $260 billion, according to CFRFB.\n\n\u201cThe result would be $2 trillion higher debt, which would bring debt to 96 percent of GDP by 2027 as opposed to 89 percent,\u201d the group\u2019s report states. \u201cBy 2047, along with a slight decrease in GDP growth, these policies would bring debt to 180 percent of GDP compared to 150 percent under current law.\u201d\n\nFinally, the CRFP considers an \u201calternative fiscal scenario\u201d in which revenues are lower after tax cuts and non-health care spending increases to its historical norm of about 10 percent of GDP. Under this scenario, debt would rise to 225 percent of GDP by 2047, nearly three times higher than the current level."}, {"date": "2017/04/10", "title": "The Fed, the Reality of Tax Cuts, and Donald Trump", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/04/10/Fed-Reality-Tax-Cuts-Reality-and-Donald-Trump", "text": "For many years, Republicans argued that tax cuts for the wealthy pay for themselves. Cutting taxes on the wealthy, according to Republicans, allows them to keep a larger share of anything new they create and this leads to new economic activity and new innovation \u2013 so much that the resulting increase in economic growth and tax revenue fully offsets the budgetary effects of the tax cuts. Everyone is better off as income \u201ctrickled down\u201d from the top.\n\nWhat actually happened is that the tax cuts had very little, if any, impact on economic growth. Deficits went up, and somehow income never trickled down \u2013 if anything, it trickled up. Today, Republicans are less likely to argue that tax cuts pay for themselves, though you still hear it, but they still insist tax cuts for the wealthy magically increase economic growth and offset much of the revenue loss.\n\nRelated: It\u2019s a Ruse: Tax Cuts Can\u2019t be Financed by Reducing Government Waste\n\nBut even in the very unlikely case that Trump\u2019s proposed tax cuts are successful (beyond increasing the income of the wealthy which many argue is the true goal), the economic growth rates Trump has promised are unlikely to be attained. In fact, if the economy is near full employment as it is now, output growth is unlikely to go up at all except briefly. To see why, it\u2019s important to consider how the Federal Reserve will react to upward pressure on output.\n\nWhen the Fed sets interest rates, it reacts to the \u201coutput gap,\u201d the difference between actual output and something known as the natural rate of output. The Fed also reacts to inflation, but for the moment let\u2019s focus on the output gap.\n\nThe natural rate of output is the rate of economic activity that keeps labor and all other inputs to production fully employed and is sustainable in the long-run. When the economy begins to push above the natural rate, the Fed worries that inflation will rise above its target level of 2 percent. To guard against this, the Fed increases interest rates to slow economic activity and reduce the inflationary pressure, and it will keep raising interest rates until output stabilizes at the natural rate. No matter how much Trump tries to increase economic growth, the Fed will not let output rise above the natural rate, at least not for very long.\n\nRelated: The Big Risk in Trump's Plan to Cuts Taxes and Boost Spending\n\nBut if the natural rate of output is consistent with full employment \u2013 if labor and other resources are fully employed \u2013 how can output go above that level? The key is the word sustainable in the definition of the natural rate of output. Think of it this way. Over the course of a semester in college, there is only so much studying that can be done day-to-day and week-to-week \u2013 there is a maximum sustainable level of effort. But when exams approach, it\u2019s possible to work for, say, 20 hours or more to get ready. The students\u2019 output rises above the natural rate in the short-run, but it will fall back to the natural level over time.\n\nThe same is true for labor and capital. For awhile, when demand is high (due hypothetically to tax cuts, but this can happen for other reasons as well), labor can be pushed beyond 40 hours per week. A trucking fleet can pull trucks out of maintenance and put them on the road to meet the increased demand. The factory floor can be run full-time instead of stopping at intervals for the maintenance it needs. But to do this, workers must be paid overtime. Trucks and factories that do not get the maintenance they require will be more costly down the road, all of which force the firm to raise prices to cover the higher costs. That is, inflation will begin to go up.\n\nThe alternative to pushing labor and capital beyond their sustainable levels of use is to hire more workers, purchase more trucks, or build new factory capacity. But since the economy is already at full employment, labor, capital, and the resources needed to expand capacity must be bid away from other firms. The firm must be willing to pay more than other firms that are also attempting to expand and meet the increase in aggregate demand. Bidding labor, capital, and other inputs to production away from other firms raises costs and hence prices too, and would also be inflationary.\n\nRelated: US Debt Is Going to Soar Over the Next 30 Years: CBO Report\n\nThe only way for the increase in demand to be non-inflationary is for the natural rate of output to increase as a result of the tax cuts, that is, for aggregate supply to go up and match the increase in demand. But that is the essence of supply side economics, to increase our productive capacity, and we know how well that has worked out in the past. Somehow, however, it doesn\u2019t stop Republicans from continuing to make supply side arguments to justify the tax cuts for the wealthy.\n\nThere may be a way for tax cuts to increase our productive capacity, but they would need to be very different from the tax cuts that have been proposed by the Trump administration. For example, well-targeted and well-constructed investment tax credits can enhance our ability to produce goods and services.\n\nTrump has promised to increase economic growth substantially, but it\u2019s unlikely he will succeed based upon evidence of similar tax cuts in the past. Even in the unlikely event he does succeed in stimulating demand, the Fed will not let economic growth reach the levels he has promised. Wonder who he\u2019ll blame for his failure?"}, {"date": "2017/04/09", "title": "One Major Obamacare Insurance Company Is Close to Break Even This Year ", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/04/09/One-Major-Obamacare-Insurance-Company-Close-Break-Even-Year", "text": "Despite high premiums and diminished consumer choices that might deter consumers from enrolling in Obamacare, a new financial analysis concludes that the individual health insurance market has shaken off its early losses and will likely break even this year.\n\nThe analysis by S&P Global Ratings of the performance of scores of Blue Cross plans in nearly three dozen states also predicts that insurance companies providing millions of Americans with subsidized coverage under Obamacare will begin showing modest profits in 2018.\n\nRelated: Insurer\u2019s Message to Trump: Fix Obamacare or We\u2019re Out\n\nThe Standard & Poor\u2019s report describes a \u201cfragile\u201d market that has begun to stabilize after a shaky launch in 2014 and that appears on the road to profitability in the coming years -- unless Republican lawmakers pull the rug out from under it.\n\nThat\u2019s just when President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) are hoping to replace Obamacare with a GOP alternative that so far has gained little traction on Capitol Hill.

Humana, Blue Cross-Blue Shield, and Anthem have either pulled out of some states or are threatening to do so after incurring millions of dollars in losses.\n\nAnd based on recent announcements of more departures by insurers, some states like Tennessee and Iowa may have counties with no insurers on the exchange in 2018. The situation could worsen in the coming months if uncertainty over the future of Obamacare persists, the report says. Insurance companies must file their initial rates and products for 2018 in May and June, and more may decide to pull out of the system if they consider the situation too risky.\n\n\u201cHaving them decide without adequate information may result in either higher-than-expected premium rate increases, or a few insurers hesitating to remain in the market,\u201d according to S&P.\n\nRelated: It Looks Like Americans Are Blaming Paul Ryan for the Health Care Debacle\n\nThe report suggests that after several years of turmoil and losses in the Obamacare markets, many insurers are beginning to better understand how the new subsidized individual markets work.

Gen. H.R. McMaster, the White House National Security Adviser all appeared on the Sunday talk shows, and presented seemingly contradictory and at times, frankly incoherent explanations of what the United States\u2019 role in the Syrian conflict will be moving forward.\n\nRelated: Trump Bombed Syria\u2019s Airfield. Now, Here Comes Putin\u2019s Response\n\nTillerson, for example, in an appearance on ABC's This Week, said that the US stands prepared to take additional action against Assad if he uses chemical weapons again, while at the same time making the plainly incorrect claim that this represents no change in US military policy toward Syria.\n\nAsked by host George Stephanopoulos if he was saying that there had been no change in US posture on the use of force against Assad, he agreed. But then, he said, \u201cThe strike was a message to Bashar al-Assad that your multiple violations of your agreements at the UN, your agreements under the chemical weapons charter back in 2013 that those would not go without a response in the future.\u201d\n\nOf course, the strikes themselves were a major reversal for Trump, who campaigned as a non-interventionist \u201cAmerica First\u201d candidate, and who has for years argued against getting involved in the Syrian civil war. And the promise of further attacks if chemical weapons are used again is plainly an escalation beyond a one-off \u201cmessage\u201d strike.\n\nUntil Thursday, the Trump administration seemed to be following the president\u2019s original policy against greater involvement in Syria. As recently as March 30, both Tillerson and Haley had made public comments that seemed to suggest that removing Assad from power was at best a secondary goal for the United States and that his remaining was one possible outcome.\n\nRelated: America's Strike in Syria: The Generals Are Taking Charge\n\nAt the time, Tillerson said that \u201cthe longer-term status of President Assad will be decided by the Syrian people.\u201d\n\nOn the same day, Haley said, \u201cOur priority is no longer to sit and focus on getting Assad out.\u201d She added, \u201cDo we think he's a hindrance? Yes. Are we going to sit there and focus on getting him out? No.\u201d\n\nBy April 6, the day of the missile attack, though, the language was notably different.\n\n\u201cAssad\u2019s role in the future is uncertain, clearly, and with the acts that he has taken, it would seem that there would be no role for him to govern the Syrian people,\u201d Tillerson said in a brief press conference.\n\n\u201cThe process by which Assad would leave is something that requires an international community effort both to first defeat ISIS within Syria, to stabilize the Syrian country to avoid further civil war and then to work collectively with our partners around the world through a political process that would lead to Assad leaving,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: Here's What Firing 59 Tomahawk Missiles at Syria's Airfield Cost\n\nAsked if he and President Trump would \u201corganize an international coalition\u201d to remove Assad, Tillerson responded, \u201cThose steps are under way.\u201d\n\nOn the same day, Haley also signaled that the US planned to lead an effort to remove Assad from power.\n\nThe immediate catalyst for the US decision to about-face and rain 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles down on an airfield as Trump sat down to dinner on Thursday night was the Syrian regime\u2019s apparent use of the deadly nerve agent Sarin in the attack on Idlib earlier in the week. The gas attack killed dozens and produced images of small children dead on the ground and others gasping for breath as they struggled to survive the effects of the noxious gas.\n\nBut what many found puzzling was that the attack on Idlib was different only in degree from what Assad\u2019s regime has been doing, with some consistency, for years. The list of chemical attacks on rebel-held parts of Syria is long and detailed, and as Tillerson pointed out in interviews on This Week CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, the Syrian military used chemical weapons twice in the week prior to the Idlib attack.\n\nRelated: Trump Just Strengthened His Hand on Defense Spending\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear why gassing civilians drew such a dramatically different response than indiscriminately blowing them up with conventional explosives and the Assad regime\u2019s \u201cbarrel bombs.\u201d\n\nIt was a question that McMaster struggled to address in an appearance on Fox News Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re prepared to do more,\u201d McMaster said. \u201cWe were prepared to do more two days ago as well. What\u2019s significant about this strike is not that it was meant to take out the Syrian regime\u2019s capacity or ability to commit mass murder of its own people but it was to send a very strong signal to Assad and his sponsors that the United States cannot stand idly by as he is murdering innocent civilians\n\nHost Chris Wallace followed up by pointing out that Assad is still committing mass murder, just with different weapons, and asking if the US is now prepared to retaliate against him for attacks on civilians with conventional weapons as well.

Today, 42 states have privately managed Medicaid, and 73 percent of the 81 million beneficiaries are now covered by private managed-care health plans, according to Price Waterhouse Cooper (PWC). By comparison, just 55 percent of beneficiaries were in managed care programs in 2012.\n\n\u201cOverall, things are going pretty well, as evidence by the fact that more and more states seem to add private coverage options, and states that already have it continue to expand the share of the population that is actually eligible for private coverage,\u201d said Ari Gottlieb, a health care industry analyst with PwC.\n\n\u201cThere are always some challenges,\u201d he added, noting that states frequently missed their start-up schedules and insurers and health care providers lost money in the early going. \u201cThat said, there are not a lot of states moving in the other direction.\u201d But it\u2019s not always a slam dunk to make that switch.\n\nRelated: Why the GOP Plan for Medicaid Could Be a Bad Deal for the States\n\nAlabama officials stumbled recently in their effort to join most other states in privatizing their Medicaid coverage for the poor and disabled. Their mishaps offer a cautionary tale of some of the budgetary challenges facing state officials down the road if the Trump administration and Congress succeed in sharply reducing federal assistance for the massive health care program.\n\nAlabama legislators and Republican Gov. Robert Bentley had been pushing for several years to replace their state\u2019s traditional Medicaid fee-for-service system with a managed care system that would force hospitals and doctors to deliver services to the poor and elderly within fixed per-capita costs, or absorb the financial losses.\n\nMore than 650,000 of the state\u2019s one million Medicaid recipients would receive care through this approach. But Alabama couldn\u2019t raise enough up-front funding to organize and launch the program last April. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services offered as much as $748 million over five years to help launch the pilot project, but it wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nAnxious to keep the project alive, officials say they will begin enrolling beneficiaries into managed care by October 1. CMS responded in a March 30 letter approving the delay but is insisting on onsite inspections before allowing Alabama officials to move ahead.\n\nRelated: With Medicaid Costs Soaring, Republicans Plan Dramatic Eligibility Changes\n\nModern Healthcare says Alabama\u2019s start-up snafus come on the heels of widespread problems in Iowa\u2019s Medicaid managed-care program since it was launched early in 2016. Former Republican governor Terry E. Brandstad rushed through a fundamental transformation of the state\u2019s traditional Medicaid program to a private managed-care model a year ago, before he left office to become U.S. ambassador to China.\n\nBrandstad insisted the new approach would save the state money. Instead, critics complain about inadequate patient access to health care, shoddy administration and revenue shortfalls for three insurers who are now demanding that the state assume more of the risk. A Des Moines Register editorial from April 1 described the state\u2019s ongoing \u201cordeal\u201d with managed care as \u201can April Fool\u2019s joke with no end.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/04/07", "title": "Trump Just Strengthened His Hand on Defense Spending", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/04/07/Trump-Just-Strengthened-His-Hand-Defense-Spending", "text": "In the wake of U.S. missile strikes against Syria, President Trump\u2019s call for huge increase in defense spending is suddenly looking more likely to succeed.\n\nOvernight, the new president was transformed into a war-time commander-in-chief, one who received widespread kudos for his action from lawmakers as diverse as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Armed Services Committee Chair John McCain (R-AZ), both frequent critics of the president.\n\nRelated: America's Strike in Syria - The Generals Are Taking Charge\n\nMcCain, the most prominent defense hawk on Capitol Hill, on Friday praised Trump for standing up to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Russian President Vladimir Putin, a key Syrian ally.\n\n\u201cPeace through strength,\u201d McCain said during an appearance on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe program. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to rebuild our military.

If you\u2019re at war, your requests for defense budgets are generally approved with a speed that would blind you.\u201d\n\nTrump has ambitions to preside over a Reagan-era-style military buildup, and ordered Defense Secretary James Mattis to come up with a comprehensive plan to improve overall readiness in the armed services by fiscal 2019, including updating the nuclear arsenal and strengthening defenses against a possible nuclear attack by North Korea or Iran.\n\nRelated: Here's What Firing 59 Tomahawk Missiles at Syria's Airfield Cost\n\nHe is also calling for a major buildup of all four branches of the military, including more troops, jet fighters, ships and other weaponry.\n\nTrump on March 16 formally asked Congress for $54 billion of additional defense spending in fiscal 2018 \u2013 a 10 percent increase -- by lifting a statutory cap on the Pentagon budget while cutting deeply into practically every government agency to offset the increased cost. While he has received pushback from a number of senior Republican and Democratic lawmakers on the scope of the cuts he is seeking in domestic programs -- especially at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the State Department, Housing and Urban Development and National Institutes of Health -- Trump is likely to win most of the defense spending increases he is seeking for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.\n\nUntil now, however, his request for an additional $30 billion for defense in the current fiscal year and the offsetting cuts in domestic programs has generally been met with derision. There are only three weeks remaining before a continuing resolution expires and Congress could be faced with another partial government shutdown. Lawmakers in both parties are eager to finish up work on the fiscal 2017 appropriations without have to try to shoe-horn in extra defense spending and cuts to popular programs.\n\nNow, however, it is far more likely that Trump could wind up with all the fresh defense dollars he wants if he decides to escalate U.S. military involvement in Syria. And if the country is suddenly put on war-time footing and (more) American troops are put in harm\u2019s way, Congress may be open to rewriting the 2017 appropriations bill or accepting an emergency supplemental to meet Trump\u2019s defense spending demands for this year.\n\nRelated: A Military Buildup and Big Tax Cuts: Is the Debt Set to Soar Under Trump?\n\nAdams, a professor emeritus at American University, said a lot will depend on Trump\u2019s next moves and how aggressive he becomes in challenging Russian and Iranian influence over the course of the Syrian civil war. \u201cIf we see more direct involvement in the civil war in Syria as a consequence, a repeated use of American Tomahawks and fighter aircraft, a decision to create or maintain some kind of a safe zone in northern Syria patrolled or policed by American military power, all of these things are steps down the road to deeper engagement.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd any deeper engagement that involves putting American men and women at risk and firing real things, strengthens the president\u2019s hand when it comes to budget time,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s axiomatic, practically.\u201d\n\nStan Collender, a budget expert and executive vice president of Qorvis MSLGROUP, thinks that it would take more than a single missile attack on a Syria air field to make Congress completely pliant on defense spending issues. Moreover, while Trump\u2019s actions have generally been applauded, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) and a handful of other lawmakers complained that Trump launched the attack without consulting with Congress and must seek congressional authorization.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a one-time activity, I don\u2019t see it making much of a difference at all,\u201d said Collender. \u201cBy the time Congress gets back in two weeks from recess, this will largely be forgotten. But if it continues in some form \u2013 if there\u2019s another bombing strike, if there\u2019s saber rattling and he wants to commit ground troops to it, then I could see there being some need by Congress to provide extra dollars for 2017.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/04/07", "title": "Why March\u2019s Shockingly Weak Jobs Report Is No Reason to Panic", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/04/07/Why-March-s-Shockingly-Weak-Jobs-Report-No-Reason-Panic", "text": "The relatively weak jobs numbers reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday are no reason to worry about a sudden slowdown of the U.S. economy.\n\nThe 98,000 jobs added in March \u2014 well shy of the 180,000 economists had been expecting \u2014 may have come as a shock to people who have become accustomed to monthly gains in the neighborhood of 200,000, but economists believe the disappointing headline number was largely due to a major snowstorm that hit the country during the week the survey was conducted.\n\n\u201cAfter the unseasonably warm January and February, which pushed monthly job gains back above 200,000, there was always going to be some pay back in March, when the weather snapped back to seasonal norms, including some heavy snowstorms,\u201d wrote Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics.\n\nRelated: Why the 2020 Census Could Blow a Huge Hole in the Federal Budget\n\nOne piece of evidence for that theory is that the fall-off in job growth was accompanied by a drop in the unemployment rate from 4.7 percent to 4.5 percent, a level the U.S. hasn\u2019t enjoyed in nearly 10 years.

The Fed has dramatically quickened its pace of rate hikes. Officials are becoming increasingly aggressive in their speeches, talking up the chances of as many as three or four rate hikes this year. And now, as revealed this week in the release of the March meeting minutes, policymakers are preparing to start shrinking the Fed\u2019s balance sheet \u2014 which swelled from $1 trillion before the recession to some $4.5 trillion worth of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities now \u2014 as soon as this year.\n\nRelated: The Federal Reserve Bank, Explained\n\nThis is a big deal.

Within the meeting minutes, it was noted that some members believed stock market valuations were \"quite high.\" This is a rare admittance for a body that, for years, has preferred to let the animal spirits roar.

About half of the Fed policymakers have factored such stimulus into their forecasts.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch economists expect the Fed to start drawing down its balance sheet once the federal funds rate hits a range of 1.25 percent to 1.50 percent, which would require another two quarter-point hikes, widely expected in June and September.

The Obama administration spent eight years proving this.\n\nTrump could have made his mark by improving on the pointlessly tense relationship Obama left him with, notably on the South China Sea issue. Instead, he\u2019s on track to make Obama\u2019s mistakes again and some of his own\u2014worsening ties while getting little or nothing for it.\n\nOn NATO, Israel, Iran, and other questions, Trump\u2019s rhetoric has proven one thing, his policy framework another: This administration\u2019s more about continuity than change\u2014and transformation is out of the question.\n\nRelated: Trump Says Chemical Attack In Syria Went 'Beyond A Red Line'\n\nThat\u2019s a very mixed blessing.

But the urgent matter of making sure the federal government doesn\u2019t have to shut down after the current Continuing Resolution under which it is authorized to spend money expires at midnight on April 28 is still on the back burner. That\u2019s a problem because when lawmakers get back to town later this month, they aren\u2019t going to have much time to solve a problem that has proved very tricky in the past.\n\nRelated: How Trump's Latest Twitter Tantrum Could Shut Down the Government\n\nWhere is everybody going?\n\nBoth houses of Congress are leaving town for \u201cdistrict work periods.\u201d The House is leaving on what is generally referred to as a \u201ctwo week\u201d break, but at 18 days, it\u2019s closer to three. When it returns, there are four scheduled \u201clegislative days\u201d before the federal government will be forced to shut down. The Senate, which doesn\u2019t leave town until Friday, will have five legislative days to work before the federal government runs out of spending authority.\n\nWhat is expiring?\n\nCongress never managed to pass the spending bills necessary to authorize the departments of the executive branch to pay their bills and their employees\u2019 salaries for Fiscal 2017, so since last fall, the government has been operating under a \u201cContinuing Resolution\u201d that allows spending set, for the most part, at levels established a year before.\n\nThat CR, as it is called, was renewed in December of last year, with an expiration date of April 28. At the time, then-Appropriations Committee Chair Hal Rogers said, \u201c[T]his type of short-term spending absolutely should not be the final answer to funding the federal government for the year. It is imperative that Congress complete its work on the remaining 11 Appropriations bills to ensure the proper and responsible use of tax dollars, to provide necessary resources for important programs and services, and to hold federal agencies accountable to the American people.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Another Government Shutdown Is Suddenly in the Cards\n\nSpoiler alert: It never happened.\n\nWhat happens if the CR expires?\n\nThe Constitution of the United States is pretty explicit on the topic. Article I, Section 9 says \u201cNo money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law.\u201d In other words, if there is no appropriation passed by Congress, it is generally illegal for the executive branch to spend money. That means that any government agency funded through the appropriations process -- and that\u2019s most of them -- must shut down. An exception is made for people and offices that are deemed essential to protecting \u201cthe safety of human life or the protection of property.\u201d\n\nIf the government shuts down, most federal employees would be allowed into the office briefly on the next workday to prepare for an orderly shutdown, but would afterward be barred from their places of employment until the shutdown ends.\n\nThen what?\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that April 28 is a Friday, so by midnight on that day, most federal employees will have started their weekend, effectively giving Congress an extra two days before the full effects of the shutdown become apparent to most Americans.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s no guarantee that there will be a speedy resolution. A dozen shutdowns dating back to the Reagan administration averaged five days in length, with many resolved in a single day. However, the last two -- under Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, lasted 21 and 16 days, respectively.\n\nRelated: How Trump and the GOP Are Handing Congress Back to the Democrats\n\nCongress will eventually have to come to some sort of agreement to allow the government to continue spending money, but what that will look like is anybody\u2019s guess.\n\nThe simplest method would be to authorize another CR, keeping spending locked at its current levels. But influential members of Congress, like Arizona Sen. John McCain, have promised to fight for a full year funding plan so that the armed forces can take advantage of proposed budget increases.\n\nAnother potential stumbling block is that more extreme members of Congress recognize that their leverage is greatly magnified in a crisis, and have in the past used moments like this to make extraordinary demands to secure their votes. Must-pass legislation like debt ceiling increases and appropriations bills have often been subject to attempts to tie them to things like defunding of the Affordable Care Act or making Planned Parenthood ineligible for federal funds.\n\nWhen will we know if a shutdown is coming?\n\nShutdown negotiations are, almost by definition, an exercise in political brinkmanship, so it will be no surprise of there is no resolution reached until late on the 28th or, given the buffer of the weekend, sometime before federal workers would be expected to show up on the following Monday morning.\n\nAs House members were getting ready to leave on Friday, Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said that there were ongoing negotiations among the members of the Appropriations Committees. However, she told reporters, a daunting number of issues remained to resolve.\n\n\u201cThe number I know is 115,\u201d Pelosi said, according to The Hill. \u201cIt went from 200 to 115, and now we\u2019ll see.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/04/06", "title": "The Big Risk in Trump's Plan to Cuts Taxes and Boost Spending", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/04/06/Big-Risk-Trumps-Plan-Cuts-Taxes-and-Boost-Spending", "text": "President Donald Trump's spending reform agenda could turn out to be a \"recipe for disaster\" and a significant risk to the U.S. economy if more attention is not paid to the implementation process, NYU business professor Edward Altman has warned.\n\nDescribing the policies as \"risky,\" Altman said that President Trump and some of his advisers are too reliant on as yet unrealized growth in order to fund proposed tax cuts, which could hurt the economy.\n\n\"We have to be careful, very much, of overheating the economy very quickly with infrastructure financing and lower taxes,\" Altman told CNBC Thursday.\n\n\"That, in many cases, could be a recipe for disaster if, in fact, the deficit financing and the amount of debt that has to be raised to finance it is excessive.\"\n\nRelated: Donald Trump Still Doesn\u2019t Understand the Unemployment Rate\n\n\"I personally think that's going to be risky because the timings not going to be coherent.

A draft of the amendment making the rounds Thursday morning indicated that the aim is to create a new $15 billion reinsurance fund called the \u201cFederal Invisible Risk Sharing Program\u201d to compensate insurance companies for covering people at high risk of incurring large medical costs.\n\nIn theory, the move would push premiums down for healthy individuals -- something the conservative House Freedom Caucus had been demanding -- by eliminating some of the risk within the universe of people covered by a particular insurer. However, the description of the plan in the brief amendment were so vague that it was difficult to know exactly how the program would work, especially given the confusion around whether the GOP plans to try to eliminate the ACA\u2019s ban on discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions and the requirement that all non-smokers of the same age be offered identical coverage and pricing options.\n\nRelated: New Obamacare Repeal Plan Would Leave the Hard Decisions to the States\n\nIn general, when an insurer identifies a consumer within its coverage pool who presents a risk (or a certainty) of very high costs, they would be able to apply to the risk sharing program for assistance. The company would remit a percentage of the premiums paid by those individuals to the agency administering the risk sharing program in exchange for a promise to pay the insurer back for costs of covering that patient above a certain threshold.\n\nOn Thursday morning, the plan was being widely referred to as creating \u201crisk pools,\u201d but experts point out that risk pools have typically involved states or the federal government setting themselves up as insurers of last resort for high-risk patients. This proposal is more properly viewed as a \u201creinsurance\u201d plan, in which the state promises to, in effect, insure the insurance companies.\n\nLike risk pools, the program would be designed to operate at a loss: insurers, on average, would be getting more money back in compensation than they paid in by transferring premium revenue to the program, with the government making up the difference.\n\nThe amendment being circulated Thursday would provide $15 billion over nine years to fund the program. But Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow for health reform and private insurance at the Kaiser Family Foundation, warned that is not even close to the amount of money a program like this would likely cost.\n\nRelated: Looks Like the GOP Is Breaking Their Promise to Repeal and Replace Obamacare\n\n\u201cBack in 2011 there were 35 states that had high-risk pools -- this program is a kind of cousin of high risk pools. The 35 state high risk pools combined covered a little over 200,000 people and the losses for those people was then about $1.2 billion per year.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, a number of populous states including Ohio, Georgia, and North Carolina didn\u2019t even have high-risk pools. In addition, many of the states that did have them imposed waiting periods, annual and lifetime dollar limits on coverage, and enrollment caps in order to keep costs down. Most of those tactics were eliminated under the ACA, and would be politically difficult to reinstate.\n\nBottom line, Pollitz said, the Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program would be trying to cover many more people than the old risk pools did, and to do it without the cost control measures that those pools put in place.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t add up,\u201d she said, adding that for a program like this one, \u201c$15 billion really isn\u2019t a lot of money.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why the GOP Could Flip-Flop on Obamacare and Save the Floundering Program\n\nIt was unclear on Thursday just how much the addition of the risk sharing program to the AHCA would change the math in the House, where conservative Republicans who wanted to pull the bill farther to the right and more moderate ones who were afraid it went too far currently have enough votes to prevent House leadership from assembling a majority in favor of the legislation. The bill currently has no Democratic support whatsoever.\n\nOn Thursday, House Speaker Paul Ryan said the change, \u201cgets us closer together, closer to that consensus.\u201d However, he added, \u201cI want to be clear: we still have more work to do.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/04/06", "title": "Why the 2020 Census Could Blow a Huge Hole in the Federal Budget", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/04/06/Why-2020-Census-Could-Blow-Huge-Hole-Federal-Budget", "text": "The 2010 Decennial Census --the last time the government sought to count every person and household in the country -- proved to be a rocky and costly venture.\n\nChaotic operations and mounting staff needs drove the budget through the roof. Plans for census takers to use state-of-the-art, hand-held devices to record data in the field had to be scrapped when the devices proved unreliable. The Census Bureau had to quickly hire thousands of more workers and train them to record their findings the old fashion way -- on paper forms.\n\nRelated: Uncle Sam\u2019s Environmental Cleanup Bill: $447 Billion and Rising\n\nAt the same time, the rate of return of census questionnaires by mail, historically the primary method of collecting data, sharply declined from 78 percent in 1970 to just 63 percent in 2010 -- a telltale sign of declining cost-effectiveness.\n\nIn the end, the 2010 Census proved to be the costliest census in U.S. history, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The $12.3 billion spent on that venture was 31 percent higher than the $9.4 billion cost of the 2000 Census, adjusted for inflation.\n\nIncredibly, the average cost for counting a single housing unit surged from about $16 in 1970 to roughly $92 in 2010, measured in 2020 constant dollars.\n\nSmall wonder, then, that the 2020 Census operation now just a few years off is getting close scrutiny by government watchdogs and was included recently in the GAO\u2019s latest report listing \u201chigh risk\u201d government programs and agencies.\n\nThe 2020 Census was one of three programs or functions added to the list, along with management of federal programs that service Indian tribes and the federal government\u2019s environmental liabilities.

Census takers will be attempting to contact and interview people in more than 140 million housing units.\n\nTo get an accurate count, the Census Bureau must build an accurate address list for every housing unit, find ways to maximize the number of people taking it upon themselves to respond to requests for information, and then follow up with people and families that don\u2019t respond.\n\nThe 2017 Commerce Department budget plan for the 2020 Census will include \u201csweeping design changes in four key areas:\n\nNew methodologies to conduct address canvassing.\n\nInnovative ways of optimizing self-response.\n\nThe use of administrative records to reduce the nonresponse workload.\n\nAnd the use of technology to replace manual tasks.\n\nCommerce officials believe the new approaches will save the government more than $5 billion compared to the previous census costs. Yet given past costly snafus and mission creep, there is no assurance the 2020 census will cost far more than the last one.\n\nThe challenges will be many \u2013 not the least of which will be overcoming the reluctance of many undocumented immigrants to cooperate with a census taker when immigration agents are rounding up illegal immigrants for deportation.\n\nWith the Trump administration pressing for major cuts in most domestic programs to offset the cost of a $54 billion increase in defense spending next year, the Census Bureau could feel increased pressure to curtail spending and hiring.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s \u2018Hard Power\u2019 Budget Gives Billions to Defense, Guts Domestic Programs\n\nStill, the administration signaled in its new budget proposal the need to get the census right. While the White House Budget Office proposed a 16 percent overall cut in the Commerce Department\u2019s spending in 2018, it provided $1.5 billion for the Census Bureau \u2013 an increase of more than $100 million from the previous year to continue to prepare for the new census.\n\n\u201cThis additional funding prioritizes fun\u00addamental investments in information technology and field infrastructure, which would allow the bureau to more effectively administer the 2020 Decennial Census,\u201d Trump\u2019s budget document declared.\n\nIn 2010, the bureau operated 506 census offices throughout the country with 550,000 staff on the ground.

Some of the sources for the concerns over political interference come from leaked transcripts of conversations apparently monitored by the National Security Agency (NSA), an agency with heavy restrictions on surveillance involving domestic communications, especially when involving \u201cUS persons\u201d \u2013 American citizens and legal residents at home or abroad.\n\nFBI Turns Up the Heat on Russian Election Hacking Investigation\n\nBefore the passage of the Patriot Act and its controversial Section 702, the NSA could not collect such data even if incidentally captured. Since then, it has become permissible in some circumstances, but analysts redact the names of those inadvertently captured from transcripts of such conversations unless a specific FISA warrant allows for their collection. The fact sheet for Section 702 published by the NSA to argue for its renewals every five years notes that dissemination of surveillance data involving US persons is prohibited in all but a narrow set of circumstances:\n\n\n\nThe dissemination of any information about U.S. persons is expressly prohibited unless it is necessary to understand foreign intelligence or assess its importance; is evidence of a crime, or indicates a threat of death or serious bodily harm.\n\n\n\nEven then, that information would be only disseminated to agencies with jurisdiction over those issues, not publicly released. The leaking of transcripts identifying Michael Flynn in a conversation with Russian ambassador Sergei Kirlyak in December did not meet any of those conditions, and neither did subsequent leaks of similar material naming other US persons. This led Republicans in Congress to demand investigations into the leaks themselves; FBI director James Comey declined to tell Congress whether such an investigation was underway. Rep. Trey Gowdy demanded an investigation, calling the leaks \u201cthe felonious dissemination of classified material.\u201d\n\nThat brings us back to one big question: how did the names of US persons get back into the transcripts in the first place, after being redacted? When former national security advisor Susan Rice was asked by PBS two weeks ago about incidental surveillance of Trump campaign members, she demurred on the topic altogether. \u201cI know nothing about this,\u201d Rice replied. \u201cI was surprised to see reports from Chairman Nunes on that account today.\u201d\n\nHowever, Bloomberg\u2019s Eli Lake reported that not only did Rice know about the collection of this data, she specifically requested to be provided the unredacted transcripts \u2013 and had done so as a \u201cpattern\u201d discovered by the National Security Council. While those requests fall within the jurisdiction of a national security advisor, it flatly contradicted what Rice had claimed to PBS in March. When confronted with Lake\u2019s reporting, Rice cemented the contradiction, claiming that although she had seen the transcripts, \u201cI leaked nothing to nobody.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump Told the New York Times that Susan Rice Might Have Committed a Crime\n\nThat\u2019s quite the memory boost in a two-week span, but strangely enough, media outlets began rushing to let Rice off the hook. At CNN alone, Jim Sciutto assured viewers that a source \u201cclose to Rice\u201d insists that there was nothing to this story, and both Sciutto and anchor Don Lemon proclaimed it a \u201cdiversion\u201d from the Trump-Russia scandal. Fellow anchor Chris Cuomo called it \u201cfake news.\u201d The Washington Post declared it \u201cginned-up \u2026 a fake scandal.\u201d\n\nNBC News argued that Rice couldn\u2019t have gotten the transcripts without permission from the agencies, an explanation that didn\u2019t explain why she just didn\u2019t explain that when first asked. The New York Times buried mention of Rice\u2019s extraordinary flip-flop on page A16, prompting a round of laughter from the panel on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe on Tuesday, and a provocative question from host Joe Scarborough.\n\n\u201cWhat if Dick Cheney had asked for the unmasking of names for Barack Obama\u2019s incoming administration?\u201d Scarborough continued, \u201cThere are a lot of things we don\u2019t know. A lot of questions we don\u2019t know. I do know this, though, I heard the hallelujah chorus come and immediately on cue last night saying\u2026nothing to see here. Move along, move along.\u201d\n\nRelated: Major Donor Set Up Secret Meeting to Create Trump-Putin Back Channel\n\nThis display of aggressive incuriosity was all the more remarkable given its immediacy. Not only did the national media want to instruct people to ignore Lake\u2019s report, but they also wanted to make sure they were seen as completely unwilling to ask questions on the basis of it. Rather than investigate it and ask tough questions of former Obama administration officials about the approval and dissemination process that gave Rice access to unredacted information about US persons, they wanted to paint the questions themselves as illegitimate.\n\nFurthermore, every one of these pushbacks painted the Rice story as an either/or decision for coverage with the Trump-Russia probe. Major media outlets can cover more than one story at a time, however, and the possibility that an administration might have used intelligence data for political purposes would be just as big a story \u2013 if not perhaps even bigger. That, after all, was a key component in the Watergate scandal that brought down the Richard Nixon presidency, a scandal largely uncovered under media pressure.\n\nPerhaps further investigation would demonstrate that Rice and other Obama administration officials did not use intelligence for political purposes. The information from those unredacted transcripts got leaked by someone, though, and Rice is the first major figure known to have accessed them outside of the agencies that collected the data in the first place. After having demonstrated such drive to connect dots between Russians and Trump, the lack of curiosity from the same media to follow up on such an obvious lead on a major leak lends itself to the conclusion that the media only has an interest in intrigue when it involves Republicans."}, {"date": "2017/04/05", "title": "IRS Chief Warns: Budget Cuts Could Cost the US Billions", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/04/05/IRS-Chief-Warns-Budget-Cuts-Could-Cost-US-Billions", "text": "Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen on Wednesday offered a bleak assessment of what will happen to the national debt if his agency continues to face funding shortfalls and is prevented from replacing most of the employees who retire or leave for other reasons. The end result, he predicted, will be lower rates of compliance, less revenue for the federal government and larger federal budget deficits.\n\nKoskinen, who came out of retirement to take over the agency four years ago, was speaking at the National Press Club in Washington when he reminded his audience that the IRS has been operating under a virtual hiring freeze since 2011, which left the agency powerless to replace the 17,000 employees who have left government service since then.\n\nRelated: The Best and Worst States for Sales Taxes\n\nThe agency\u2019s enforcement arm has been particularly hard hit, he said. As an example, he noted that the ranks of revenue officers -- people who go out into the field to find delinquent taxpayers and arrange for them to make payments -- has been cut by more than half since 1996. There were 7,400 revenue officers 20 years ago, compared to only 3,500 now. This is despite the fact that the number of annual tax returns filed by Americans has gone up many millions over the same period.\n\nKoskinen said that the percentage of taxpayers who are audited on an annual basis is at a decade-long low. He warned that continued cuts that make it difficult for the IRS to do its job extend well beyond a revenue shortfall.\n\n\u201cIf someone who is paying their fair share of taxes sees other who don\u2019t, and those others get away with it, that taxpayer may be a lot less motivated to be tax compliant the next time around,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the situation continues, the risk is to the nation\u2019s overall compliance rate.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAs the notion takes hold that the tax system is unfair, reversing that notion and the decline of the compliance rate won\u2019t be easy to do.\u201d\n\nKoskinen\u2019s appearance came just a few weeks after the Trump administration released a budget plan that called for major cuts to IRS funding. He expressed hope that Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin would try to defend the agency\u2019s funding in the White House, arguing that when an investor purchases an existing business, \u201cYou don\u2019t look at the revenue arm and say, \u2018I think I\u2019ll starve it of funds and see how it does.\u2019\u201d\n\nRelated: How GOP Conservatives Could Make Tax Reform Impossible\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have a real problem if the IRS doesn\u2019t have enough employees to help people figure out what they owe or to fairly enforce the tax code,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the impact will be on the ability of the government to fund itself. A one percent drop [in compliance] translates into more than $30 billion a year in lost revenues. Think about what a loss of $300 billion over 10 years would do to the federal deficit.\u201d\n\nKoskinen also noted that he would be leaving the IRS in November, when his term as commissioner expires. The 77-year-old, who has been facing demands that he resign or be impeached by House Republicans angry at how he dealt with an investigation into the agency\u2019s treatment of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt non-profit status, did not seem sorry to be leaving.\n\n\u201cNext year at this time, with any luck, there will be a new commissioner,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough I still have several months to go as commissioner, I\u2019ve encouraged the administration to search for a candidate who can follow me as soon as possible.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/04/05", "title": "Is Trump\u2019s Pick to Head the FDA Too Close to Big Pharma?", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/04/05/Trump-s-Pick-Head-FDA-Too-Close-Big-Pharma", "text": "President Trump has been pressing for proposals to lower prescription drug prices to the point that he has begun conferring with a senior Democratic lawmaker on ways to prevent the pharmaceutical industry from \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d in their pricing practices.\n\nWhile Trump has yet to unveil concrete proposals for addressing the problem, during the campaign he proposed allowing the importation of cheaper drugs from Canada and other countries to enhance competition.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) on whether he would now get behind Trump on these and other schemes for dealing with runaway drug costs that add billions of dollars in costs to consumers and federal health agencies, the typically expansive Gottlieb demurred by saying that drug prices weren\u2019t the responsibility of the FDA.\n\n\u201cSenator, it\u2019s true I have written a lot of things on a lot of different subjects including issues around Medicare [drug pricing],\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI think I\u2019m coming before you for the position at FDA and I\u2019m going to get asked my position on a lot of different subjects that fall outside FDA\u2019s purview. I think I would be doing the agency I hope to lead no favors by wading into other territory.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump Might Adopt a Democratic Plan to Crack Down on Drug Prices\n\nGottlieb is technically correct that the FDA\u2019s principal mandate is to protect the public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products and medical devices and ensuring the safety of the country\u2019s food supply. But as Sanders noted, the agency\u2019s stated mission is also to make medicine \u201cmore effective, safer and more affordable.\u201d\n\nGottlieb said he shared those goals, but that drew a rejoinder from Sanders, a major proponent of both drug importation and strengthening Medicare\u2019s bargaining hand: \u201cBut your goal is, from what I\u2019m hearing, you oppose the ideas that President Trump told he was going to do for the American people. It sounds a little strange to me.\u201d\n\nGottlieb, 44, is a clinical assistant professor at New York University\u2019s School of Medicine and a resident fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute (AEI).\n\nLast year, Gottlieb complained in a post on the Brookings Institution website about what he described as \u201cpolitical pressure\u201d to enact policies giving federal and state government authority to set drug prices or limit price increase. Trump and many Democrats at the time were pressing to grant Medicare the same authority that the Veterans\u2019 Administration and Medicaid have to directly negotiate with drug companies to contain or bring down drug costs.\n\nRelated: How Big Pharma Lobbyists Keep Medicare Drug Prices High\n\nGottlieb wrote that \u201cthese policies could have the unintended consequences of reducing the incentive to develop more effective drugs.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of drug importation, Trump strongly supported that idea throughout the campaign. He recently met with Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, about legislation that Cummings and Sanders are promoting to allow drug importation and enhance Medicare\u2019s drug price bargaining clout.\n\nGottlieb argued in a March 2016 commentary in Forbes that the added costs of regulating imported drugs would practically erase any net savings to the government. Moreover, he argued, foreign countries would have no incentive to sell cheaper drugs to the U.S. or ensure their safety.\n\nSanders, Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) and other Democrats are highly suspicious of Gottlieb and his ability to be objective in regulating a prescription drug industry. Gottlieb, a one-time FDA official, has spent most of his career working as a consultant to the drug and health care industry \u2013 raising obvious questions about the potential for conflicts of interest. The New York Times recently reported that Gottlieb was paid millions of dollars in consulting fees over the years.\n\nRelated: Trump Jolts the Pharmaceutical Industry with Vow to \u2018Bring Down Drug Prices\u2019\n\nAs a condition of his nomination, Gottlieb has promised to recuse himself for a year from any FDA decisions involving about 20 health care companies he has worked for.\n\nDuring his testimony this morning before the committee chaired by Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Gottlieb suggested there were a number of things the FDA could do to spur more competition \u2013 possibly by speeding up the review of less expensive generic drugs and thwarting efforts by major drug companies to game the system by seeking anti-competitive regulatory changes\n\n\u201cI think this is a problem that I am uniquely suited to try to look at and solve because of my background \u2013 because I understand how companies have tried to game the process in the past,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not illegal to try to use the regulatory process to gain commercial advantage,\u201d he added. \u201cWe should try to design policies that prevent those abuses because we don\u2019t want to be playing \u2018whack-a-mole\u2019 with companies and going after them one by one.

But on Tuesday he made it clear that the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus\u2019s willingness to cooperate comes with conditions and a not-so-subtle reminder that what the Caucus members did to the American Health Care Act can be done to any tax reform bill.\n\nSpecifically, Meadows insisted that unlike the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, any tax reform bill would have to be written with the active participation of the Freedom Caucus. The failed AHCA, by contrast, was written in virtual secrecy, and members only learned of its details through the media.\n\nRelated: Chair of Freedom Caucus Open to Deficit-Expanding Tax Cuts\n\n\u201cWhen a member sees the text for the first time in a leaked draft from Politico, therein is a problem,\u201d he said late Monday, as the GOP worked in vain to revive the health care bill.\n\nThe structure of the House Republican majority is such that, when the Freedom Caucus signals that it has a problem, that means House leadership also has a problem. Republicans hold a comfortable majority in the House if they all stick together, but the Freedom Caucus has, over the years, demonstrated a willingness to walk away from legislation supported by the majority of the House GOP if it doesn\u2019t meet their standards of ideological purity. Because its three dozen members are enough to deprive the GOP of a majority on the House floor, when that happens, Republican legislation crafted without Democratic support dies.\n\nWhile it may seem only sensible for House leadership to make sure the Freedom Caucus has a seat at the table as they try to write a bill overhauling the tax code, the danger is that including them in advance means the bill dies a slow, lingering death rather than a relatively quick one, like the AHCA\u2019s.\n\nThe default Freedom Caucus position on issues it considers vital tends to be maximalist and uncompromising, as House leadership re-learned during the battle over the AHCA. The group\u2019s hardcore members were unwilling to support a bill that gave them most of what they wanted\n\nRelated: New Obamacare Repeal Plan Would Leave the Hard Decisions to the States\n\nFormer Freedom Caucus chairman Jim Jordan has already come out against something expected to be a major element of any plan backed by House leadership: a border adjustment tax that would benefit US exporters and penalize importers.

The idea that you\u2019re going to add an entirely new tax is a big problem.\u201d\n\nIf it turns out that being \u201cat the table\u201d just means that the Freedom Caucus can start presenting its ultimatums earlier in the negotiation, including them is likely a recipe for another legislative failure, albeit one that plays out over months rather than weeks.\n\nRelated: Has Trump Overplayed a Losing Hand in His First Legislative Test?\n\nThe real wild card here is public opinion. President Trump has already shown his willingness to attack Freedom Caucus members on social media, and while that didn\u2019t have much of an effect on them during the health care debate, it\u2019s conceivable that if a tax reform proposal can be presented as a major tax cut for Middle America that still keeps popular government programs in place (a dubious prospect, but still,) the politics could change.\n\nAs Molly E.

Freedom Caucus members have been touting a plan that would devolve much of the decision-making to the states, through a system that would allow them to individually opt out of some of the law\u2019s requirements.\n\nAmong the things the states would be allowed to opt out of is what\u2019s known as \u201ccommunity rating.\u201d That\u2019s a system under which everyone in the same age cohort is charged the same amount for their insurance, regardless of whether or not they have a pre-existing condition.\n\nThe elimination of discrimination on the basis of a preexisting condition is one of the most popular elements of the ACA, and even the most conservative lawmakers are worried about getting rid of it outright. But it comes at a price for everyone who has to pay some of those costs, whether they're sick or not. But the elimination of community rating would do so through the back door by allowing insurers to raise premiums on people with preexisting conditions so much that they are effectively priced out of the market.\n\nRelated: Under Pressure from Insurers, Trump Continues Obamacare Taxpayer Subsidies\n\nMembers of the Freedom Caucus would like to shift sicker consumers onto state-run high-risk insurance pools subsidized by the federal government, in order to bring down costs for healthy people buying insurance on the open market.

Despite many near misses more recently, the possibility of any state going under financially is remote at best.\n\nYet a senior official at S&P Global Ratings, a premier government credit rating agency, warned on Tuesday that nearly a dozen states with festering budget problems and woefully underfunded employee pension programs are struggling through \u201cchronic budget stress\u201d that could push them to the brink.\n\nStates Face a $1 Trillion Pension Problem: Here Are the Worst 10\n\n\u201cThis long period of relative calm may have lulled some people into complacency when it comes to state finances [but] it shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d Gabriel Petek, a managing director and expert on state finances at S&P Global Ratings, wrote in The Hill. \u201cWe now see a profound shift unfolding in states such as Illinois, Kentucky and New Jersey, whose pension systems are funded at distressed levels.\u201d\n\nSince January 2016, S&P Global Ratings has issued 11 state credit rating downgrades and only two upgrades. States that received negative ratings or \u201coutlooks\u201d ranged from Alaska, Wyoming and North Dakota to Oklahoma, Louisiana, Kansas and New Mexico. But far and away the three most problematic states are New Jersey, Illinois and Kentucky.\n\nIn October 2016, for instance, S&P Global Ratings dropped Illinois' credit rating one notch to BBB, virtually junk bond status and the lowest rating of any state. S&P warned that the rating could fall even further unless Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and his Democratic opponents in the state legislature come to an agreement on a long-term solution to Illinois\u2019 chronic budget deficit and pension problems.\n\nThe impasse is so great that the two sides have been unable to agree on a new budget for nearly two years.\n\nRelated: Illinois Is Not Alone: States Facing $1 Trillion Pension Shortfall\n\nLast November, S&P Global Ratings downgraded New Jersey\u2019s credit rating from \u201cA\u201d to \u201cA-minus\u201d after citing the state's struggling pension system and a recent, ill-conceived deal between Republican Gov. Chris Christie and Democratic lawmakers to cut more than $1 billion in taxes at a time when the state lacked sufficient revenue to cover its obligations.\n\nThe nation\u2019s three top credit rating agencies -- S&P, Fitch Ratings and Moody\u2019s Investors -- have now downgraded New Jersey for a total of 10 times. Christie, an unsuccessful 2016 Republican presidential candidate who was later passed over by President Trump for a cabinet post, is struggling to hold the state together financially before he leaves office.\n\nFinally, last January, S&P raised a red flag regarding Kentucky\u2019s $32.6 billion public pension debt. The credit rating agency revised its outlook on Kentucky from stable to negative, just as the state was getting ready to hold a bond sale.\n\nThe lowered outlook reflected the reasonable likelihood that S&P would further lower the rating sometime over the next two years, making it more expensive for Republican Gov. Matt Bevin and the state government to borrow.\n\nMany factors have adversely impacted state finances. For instance, low oil prices help to explain fiscal gaps for the leading energy states, such as Alaska, North Dakota and Oklahoma. Moreover, slower revenue growth, declining worker-to-beneficiary ratios in state retirement systems, and rising Medicaid enrollments \u201care widespread and have meant that fiscal stress is no longer confined to recessionary times,\u201d Petek wrote.\n\nRelated: States Keep Using Gimmicks to \u2018Balance\u2019 Their Budgets\n\n\u201cThis stress is leading states to forego crucially needed investment in infrastructure and higher education,\u201d he added.\n\nAlthough a handful of states including West Virginia, New York and Indiana have made important strides in reducing major shortfalls in their employee pension plans, many others are just treading water or losing ground, as The Fiscal Times reported last year. A study by the Pew Charitable Trust renewed its warning about a widening gap between assets and obligations.\n\nState-run retirement systems reported shortfalls totaling $934 billion in fiscal 2014, the latest figures available, which was a slight improvement over the $969 billion deficit from the previous year. Many states were fortunate to make smart investments to chip away at their pension fund shortfalls. Others were not so fortunate.\n\nTo be sure, says Petek, states continue to benefit from certain \u201cinherent advantages\u201d that result in mostly high credit ratings and low borrowing costs.

He just wants to fix things.\u201d He is completely right, but the geniuses in the opposition don\u2019t get it.\n\nTrump has not made any secret of his unorthodoxy. He is \u201cfine\u201d with same-sex marriage, he says, and not interested in reviewing the Supreme Court decision that legalized such unions. He is open to granting legal status to people in the country illegally, a stance which is anathema to conservatives and surprising to many in light of his push to close our southern border. He is also content to protect many provisions of Obamacare, much to the horror of the Freedom Caucus folks, who want to roll the clock back.\n\nNot only is Trump not a staunch conservative, he is pliable.

He also sought to amend the current year budget by adding $30 billion more to defense and again finding partial offsetting cuts in other parts of the budget.\n\nTrump campaigned on a pledge to pump billions more into the Pentagon to transform the four military services into an unparalleled global fighting machine. However, the CRS report dated April 3 and leaked to the Federation of American Scientists, concluded that Trump\u2019s fiscal 2018 defense buildup would breach the 2011 Budget Control Act -- a budget law worked out by former President Obama and Republican congressional leaders that equally constrains defense and non-defense spending.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the administration\u2019s request for additional fiscal 2017 appropriations would exceed the current fiscal 2017 defense limit by $25 billion,\u201d wrote analysts Pat Towell and Lynn Williams.

You are now considered statistically employed,\u201d he said.\n\nThat is spectacularly wrong. When someone looking for a job gives up, the BLS considers them to have left the workforce. It absolutely does not consider them as employed, though it no longer counts them in the ranks of the unemployed either.\n\nIf Trump had stopped there, it might have been glossed over as a slip of the tongue at a live event. But he didn\u2019t. He decided to emphasize his disagreement with BLS, adding, \u201cBut I don't consider those people employed,\u201d thus making it certain that he believes discouraged workers are counted as having jobs for purposes of the unemployment rate.\n\nRelated: New Obamacare Repeal Plan Would Leave the Hard Decisions to the States\n\nThe comments about discouraged workers came just seconds after Trump let loose another howler in front of the crowd of businesspeople.

The cost for the most current version of the F/A-18 Super Hornet is about $77 million each.\n\nThe rest of the deal, he went on to say, is that \u201cLockheed Martin will not complain about the F/A-18 purchases because the president will work to secure the F-35 multi-year block buy.\u201d\n\nRelated: Is the F-35 Really Streaking by Its Troubled Past?\n\nThe POGO post said that since the F-35 \u201chas not yet even started the critical combat testing phase of its development,\u201d production should be halted until the tests are completed.

The UAE, which sees Iran as one of its main enemies, also shared the Trump team\u2019s interest in finding ways to drive a wedge between Moscow and Tehran.\n\nZayed met twice with Putin in 2016, according to Western officials, and urged the Russian leader to work more closely with the Emirates and Saudi Arabia \u2014 an effort to isolate Iran.\n\nRelated: Flynn Did Not Initially Disclose Income From Russia-Linked Companies\n\nAt the time of the Seychelles meeting and for weeks afterward, the UAE believed that Prince had the blessing of the new administration to act as its unofficial representative. The Russian participant was a person whom Zayed knew was close to Putin from his interactions with both men, the officials said.\n\nScrutiny over Russia\n\nWhen the Seychelles meeting took place, official contacts between members of the incoming Trump administration and the Russian government were under intense scrutiny, both from federal investigators and the press.\n\nLess than a week before the Seychelles meeting, U.S. intelligence agencies released a report accusing Russia of intervening clandestinely during the 2016 election to help Trump win the White House.\n\nThe FBI was already investigating communications between Flynn and Kislyak. The Washington Post\u2019s David Ignatius first disclosed those communications on Jan. 12, around the time of the Seychelles meeting. Flynn was subsequently fired by Trump for misleading Vice President Pence and others about his discussions with Kislyak.\n\nYousef Al Otaiba, the UAE\u2019s ambassador in Washington, declined to comment.\n\nGovernment officials in the Seychelles said they were not aware of any meetings between Trump and Putin associates in the country around Jan. 11. But they said luxury resorts on the island are ideal for clandestine gatherings like the one described by the U.S., European and Arab officials.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all,\u201d said Barry Faure, the Seychelles secretary of state for foreign affairs. \u201cThe Seychelles is the kind of place where you can have a good time away from the eyes of the media. That\u2019s even printed in our tourism marketing. But I guess this time you smelled something.\u201d\n\nTrump has dismissed the investigations of Russia\u2019s role in the election as \u201cfake news\u201d and a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nRelated: Russia's Rosneft Hopes Iran Rulings Can Help It Beat EU Sanctions\n\nThe level of discretion surrounding the Seychelles meeting seems extraordinary given the frequency with which senior Trump advisers, including Flynn and Kushner, had interacted with Russian officials in the United States, including at the high-profile Trump Tower in New York.\n\nSteven Simon, a National Security Council senior director for the Middle East and North Africa in the Obama White House, said: \u201cThe idea of using business cutouts, or individuals perceived to be close to political leaders, as a tool of diplomacy is as old as the hills. These unofficial channels are desirable precisely because they are deniable; ideas can be tested without the risk of failure.\u201d\n\nCurrent and former U.S. officials said that while Prince refrained from playing a direct role in the Trump transition, his name surfaced so frequently in internal discussions that he seemed to function as an outside adviser whose opinions were valued on a range of issues, including plans for overhauling the U.S. intelligence community.\n\nHe appears to have particularly close ties to Bannon, appearing multiple times on the Breitbart satellite radio program and website that Bannon ran before joining the Trump campaign.\n\nIn a July interview with Bannon, Prince said those seeking forceful U.S. leadership should \u201cwait till January and hope Mr. Trump is elected.\u201d And he lashed out at President Barack Obama, saying that because of his policies \u201cthe terrorists, the fascists, are winning.\u201d\n\nDays before the November election, Prince appeared on the Breitbart radio program, saying that he had \u201cwell-placed sources\u201d in the New York City Police Department telling him they were preparing to make arrests in the investigation of former congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) over allegations he exchanged sexually explicit texts with a minor. Flynn tweeted a link to the Breitbart report on the claim. No arrests occurred.\n\nRelated: US-EU Official\u2014No Sign Trump Plans To Ease Russia Sanctions\n\nPrince went on to make unfounded assertions that damaging material recovered from Weiner\u2019s computers would implicate Hillary Clinton and her close adviser, Huma Abedin, who was married to Weiner. He also called Abedin an \u201cagent of influence very sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood.\u201d\n\nPrince and his family were major GOP donors in 2016. The Center for Responsive Politics reported that the family gave more than $10 million to GOP candidates and super PACs, including about $2.7 million from his sister, DeVos, and her husband.\n\nPrince\u2019s father, Edgar Prince, built his fortune through an auto-parts company. Betsy married Richard DeVos Jr., heir to the Amway fortune.\n\nErik Prince has had lucrative contracts with the UAE government, which at one point paid his firm a reported $529 million to help bring in foreign fighters to help assemble an internal paramilitary force capable of carrying out secret operations and protecting Emirati installations from terrorist attacks.\n\nFocus on Iran\n\nThe Trump administration and the UAE appear to share a similar preoccupation with Iran. Current and former officials said that Trump advisers were focused throughout the transition period on exploring ways to get Moscow to break ranks with Tehran.\n\n\u201cSeparating Russia from Iran was a common theme,\u201d said a former intelligence official in the Obama administration who met with Trump transition officials. \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem very well thought out. It seemed a little premature. They clearly had a very specific policy position, which I found odd given that they hadn\u2019t even taken the reins and explored with experts in the U.S. government the pros and cons of that approach.\u201d\n\nMichael McFaul, the former U.S. ambassador to Russia, said he also had discussions with people close to the Trump administration about the prospects of drawing Russia away from Iran. \u201cWhen I would hear this, I would think, \u2018Yeah that\u2019s great for you guys, but why would Putin ever do that?\u2019 \u201d McFaul said. \u201cThere is no interest in Russia ever doing that. They have a long relationship with Iran. They\u2019re allied with Iran in fighting in Syria. They sell weapons to Iran. Iran is an important strategic partner for Russia in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nFollowing the New York meeting between the Emiratis and Trump aides, Zayed was approached by Prince, who said he was authorized to act as an unofficial surrogate for the president-elect, according to the officials. He wanted Zayed to set up a meeting with a Putin associate. Zayed agreed and proposed the Seychelles as the meeting place because of the privacy it would afford both sides. \u201cHe wanted to be helpful,\u201d one official said of Zayed.\n\nRelated: To Moscow, Trump's Choice For Envoy Makes Russian Thaw Less Likely\n\nWealthy Russians and Emirati royalty have a particularly large footprint on the islands.

Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, president of the UAE, built a hilltop palace for himself with views across the chain of islands.\n\nThe Emiratis have given hundreds of millions of dollars to the Seychelles in recent years for causes including public health and affordable housing. But when the Emirati royal family visits, they are rarely seen.\n\n\u201cThe jeep comes to their private jet on the tarmac and they disappear,\u201d said one Seychellois official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to be seen as criticizing the Emiratis.\n\nZayed, the crown prince, owns a share of the Seychelles\u2019 Four Seasons, a collection of private villas scattered on a lush hillside on the main island\u2019s southern shore, overlooking the Indian Ocean, according to officials in the Seychelles. The hotel is tucked away on a private beach, far from the nearest public road.\n\nCurrent and former U.S. officials who have worked closely with Zayed, who is often referred to as MBZ, say it would be out of character for him to arrange the Jan. 11 meeting without getting a green light in advance from top aides to Trump and Putin, if not the leaders themselves. \u201cMBZ is very cautious,\u201d said an American businessman who knows Zayed and spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. \u201cThere had to be a nod.\u201d\n\nThe Seychelles meeting was deemed productive by the UAE and Russia, but the idea of arranging additional meetings between Prince and Putin\u2019s associates was dropped, officials said. Even unofficial contacts between Trump and Putin associates had become too politically risky, officials said.\n\nSieff reported from the Seychelles.

According to The Washington Post, the White House is pressing an alternative version of the bill in an effort to win over both the hard right Freedom Caucus and the more moderate elements of the party, which combined to block a vote on the AHCA in March.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s unclear whether the measure being discussed will have much more success than its predecessor.\n\nRelated: Under Pressure from Insurers, Trump Continues Obamacare Taxpayer Subsidies\n\nHouse Republicans found themselves in a bind two weeks ago when President Trump was demanding they vote to pass the extremely unpopular AHCA, a bill that had the support of about 17 percent of the country according to public opinion polls. It was unpopular largely because it would result in some 24 million Americans to be without health insurance within a decade -- 14 million by choice -- and would dramatically drive up costs for older Americans and the poor.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus was upset that the bill didn\u2019t go far enough, demanding a rollback of multiple elements of the ACA that the bill didn\u2019t touch, such as requirements that insurers not discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions and that they offer a suite of \u201cessential\u201d health benefits with every plan and more. Their object, above all, was to drive down the cost of insurance premiums.\n\nHouse moderates, at the same time, were balking at the changes already in the AHCA, concerned that many fewer Americans would be insured and that costs would skyrocket for the poor and older Americans who were not yet eligible for Medicare.\n\nThe version of the bill now being considered would not solve those problems so much as avoid them. The plan would be to push decisions about issues like essential benefits and coverage requirements down to the state level.\n\nRelated: Insurer\u2019s Message to Trump: Fix Obamacare or We\u2019re Out\n\nFor example, the proposal would allow states to drop the \u201ccommunity rating\u201d requirement of the ACA, which demands that insurers charge the same amount for coverage for people who are the same age. In effect, this is a backdoor way of eliminating the ACA\u2019s ban on discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions. While insurers would still be nominally required to offer policies to people with existing illnesses, there would be no limit on what they could charge them. Just as it was in the days before the ACA, sick people would be effectively priced out of the market for health insurance.\n\nSimilarly, the proposal would allow states to eliminate the ACA\u2019s requirement that insurance policies purchased with government subsidies cover a set of standard benefits, including hospital stays, outpatient procedures, addiction and mental health treatment, maternity care, and more. The new plan would allow states to create a system in which people could use federal dollars to buy insurance plans that offer far less protection from health-related costs than the ACA requires.\n\nThis last move would create at least the possibility that states could achieve one of the key goals articulated by members of the Freedom Caucus: driving down average health insurance premiums. But it would do so in the same way that removing the requirement that new cars have brakes and airbags would make automobiles more affordable.\n\nThe hope among supporters of the plan is that by allowing the sale of bare-bones policies, the change would reduce the number of people who lose coverage under the new rules. However, it\u2019s not clear that the Congressional Budget Office and the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation would be willing to play ball when they score the bill. Last year, the CBO made it plain that for purposes of analyzing the effects of healthcare legislation, it would not consider people \u201ccovered\u201d by insurance unless they were substantially protected from major financial risks.\n\nRelated: Five Ways Trump Can Cripple Obamacare\n\nThe upside of this plan, from the perspective of the White House and Congressional Republicans, is that it would allow them to claim that they have kept their promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act while avoiding the hard work of crafting a measure that solves the thorny problems that repealing the bill creates.\n\nAs with the original version of the AHCA, Republicans in the House can\u2019t count on getting any Democratic votes for this iteration of the ACA replacement plan. So, assuming the changes are sufficient to win over the Freedom Caucus, the big question is the reaction of the more moderate members of the Republican conference.\n\nWill the fig leaf of devolving key decisions to the states be enough political cover, or will the latest attempt to repeal the ACA cause another fracture in the party, albeit along a different fault line?"}, {"date": "2017/04/04", "title": "How Obama Opened the Door for Trump\u2019s Greatest Accomplishment So Far", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/04/04/How-Obama-Opened-Door-Trump-s-Greatest-Accomplishment-So-Far", "text": "President Donald Trump and the Republican Congress have squandered their first few months of unified control, bungling a repeal of the Affordable Care Act and finding it difficult to even keep the government funded by the end of April. But they\u2019ve had a lonely area of success: methodically taking down Obama-era regulations.\n\nAn obscure law (only used once before in history) called the Congressional Review Act (CRA) empowers Congress to pass resolutions of disapproval for any regulation passed in the last 60 legislative days of the last session. The resolutions require only a majority vote, avoiding the Senate filibuster. And Republicans have leaned heavily on the CRA in 2017, passing 13 resolutions through the House and Senate.\n\nTrump has signed nine of them into law thus far, out of only 18 public laws signed. The latest, signed just yesterday, kills a rule that would have blocked Internet providers from selling their customers' personal information. Another four await his signature, and 20 more could pass Congress before a mid-May deadline.\n\nRelated: The One Way Trump\u2019s Administration Really Is a Fine-Tuned Machine\n\nSenator Pat Toomey (R-PA) wants to extend CRA\u2019s reach into routine agency guidance on how they will interpret existing rules. Toomey wants to eliminate banking regulators\u2019 warnings to banks to reduce issuance of risky \u201cleveraged loans,\u201d and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s bulletin to indirect auto lenders about complying with anti-discrimination laws.\n\nOnce Trump signs a resolution, the regulation is nullified, and federal agencies cannot create a \u201csubstantially similar\u201d rule without Congressional approval. So the Fair Play and Safe Workplaces rule, which would have forced federal contractors to disclose violations of labor law, or the stream protection rule barring waste disposal from surface coal mining into waterways, will be sidelined potentially forever.\n\nBecause I like drinking water untainted by coal waste, and oppose my tax dollars going to companies that continually harm their workers, I\u2019m saddened by the rampant use of CRA. But I\u2019m also wondering why so many rules weren\u2019t finalized by the Obama administration earlier in his presidency, when they wouldn\u2019t be vulnerable to Congressional nullification. The CRA makes \u201cmidnight rules\u201d enacted as far back as June 2016 eligible for disapproval. But that\u2019s seven and a half years into Obama\u2019s tenure. Why did so many important rules wait so long?\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Who Wins With Trump\u2019s Order to Slash Regulations\n\nThere\u2019s no one answer to this question. But part can be found in the byzantine rulemaking process, which creates unnecessary bottlenecks and mountains of delays. In fact, contrary to Republican claims about dark-of-night scheming to usher in regulations before leaving the White House, some of these \u201cmidnight\u201d rules were proposed as long as three years ago.\n\nUnder the current process, governed by the Administrative Procedure Act and over a dozen other statutes, agencies must publish proposed rules openly, give the public ample time to comment, and take those comments into account in the final regulation. Agencies must study the impact of their rule on the environment and small businesses. They have to analyze costs to state, local and tribal governments. They have to review whether the rule would collect undue information on Americans. Combine that with having to work through comments, which historically come overwhelmingly from the industry subject to the rule, and the gauntlet can take years to complete.\n\nThere\u2019s another hurdle at every step, a subsidiary of the Office of Management and Budget called the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). Established in 1980, OIRA adds another layer of review of all proposed and final rules, performing cost-benefit analyses and ensuring that a rule fits with presidential priorities. Rules can bounce back and forth between an agency and OIRA for years, constraining agency manpower and running out the clock. Most of the groups meeting with OIRA on rules have industry affiliations.\n\nRelated: Why Your Web-Browsing History Could Soon Be for Sale\n\nTechnically, OIRA has 90 days from receiving a submission from a federal agency to issue a response. But \u201cthose deadlines are basically not honored,\u201d says Lisa Heinzerling, a Georgetown law professor who worked at the Environmental Protection Agency under President Obama. \u201cSo the rules can sit for a long time.\u201d\n\nAgencies can grant a 30-day extension of the OIRA deadline, and Heinzerling explained that what usually happens is that OIRA calls the agency and tells them they\u2019d better ask for another 30 days because that\u2019s how much time they need. \u201cThe bottlenecks were huge,\u201d Heinzerling said, regarding her time at EPA.\n\nWhile Heinzerling added these OIRA bottlenecks became less prominent in Obama\u2019s second term, it still had an impact on late rulemaking, which is a defined trend. A study by the right-leaning think tank R Street looked at 1,400 rules between 1996 and 2014, finding that more than 50 percent of them missed statutory deadlines set by Congress for implementation.\n\nRelated: The Hidden Dangers of Government Tweets \u2014 and Not Just Trump\u2019s\n\nAny delay gives industry more days of non-compliance. So all the burdens placed on agencies in finalizing rules are deliberate, to drown them in bureaucracy. It has a chilling effect too, making it seem insurmountable just to initiate a rulemaking effort. And the OIRA bottleneck shows that Congress isn\u2019t the only entity meddling in the process. As part of OMB, the agency is directly under control of the president, and can be used to delay or kill rules that the president doesn\u2019t favor.\n\nThe newfound love for the CRA adds a further complication. If endless delays in rules get too close to the CRA deadline, Congress can just wipe them out with a majority vote.\n\nHere\u2019s one case study: a Department of Education rule on teacher preparation, designed to measure the effectiveness of classroom certification programs serving half a million would-be teachers, and help them improve. The final regulation got published last Oct. 31. But it began with a notice of proposed rulemaking back in December 2014. OIRA got a hold of it in September 2015, held onto it well beyond the 90-day deadline and got it withdrawn in February 2016, approving a new version in March. After another comment period, the final rule went to OIRA in July, and they took another three months to finalize it.\n\nRelated: 4 Political Minefields Waiting for Trump\n\nUnfortunately, this was months after the CRA deadline, and last week Trump signed the resolution killing the regulation. Teacher prep programs will not be scrutinized as rigorously because OIRA dragged out the rulemaking.\n\nFixing most of the broken rulemaking process will require Congressional action. But presidents can change the OIRA component of it as they see fit. They can trust the experts they install at the regulatory agencies to properly balance economic effects of regulations with the public interest. In other words, as president, Obama could have done something to rein in the delays to his rules. He didn\u2019t, and Trump is picking them off one by one as a result."}, {"date": "2017/04/03", "title": "Under Pressure from Insurers, Trump Continues Obamacare Taxpayer Subsidies", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/04/03/Under-Pressure-Insurers-Trump-Continues-Obamacare-Taxpayer-Subsidies", "text": "The insurance industry, rattled by the chaos caused by the Republicans\u2019 failed efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, has been demanding some reassurance from the Trump administration of a semblance of fiscal stability in the Obamacare marketplaces or else many more large companies will bail out.\n\nPresident Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) haven\u2019t given are still trying to strike a compromise with the arch-conservative Freedom Caucus in the House and other GOP factions to enact a major overhaul of Obamacare in the coming months.\n\nRelated: Insurer\u2019s Message to Trump: Fix Obamacare or We\u2019re Out\n\nBut on Monday, the Trump administration sent a reassuring message to the health insurance industry that it would continue to support billions of dollars of Affordable Care Act cost-sharing subsidies vital to insurers and moderate to middle-income beneficiaries while a lawsuit challenging their constitutionality works its way through the courts.\n\nCiting comments by unidentified administration officials, The Hill and Morning Consult reported on Monday afternoon that the White House and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would continue to make the payments while the lawsuit is being litigated.\n\nSince he took office two months ago, the Trump administration has been exploring ways to erode Obamacare through executive orders and administrative actions to ensure the government subsidized insurance program is caught in a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d of soaring premiums, high deductibles, and limited consumer choices.\n\nMany major insurers, including Aetna, UnitedHealthGroup, Humana and others had pulled out of many markets before the November 2016 election.\n\nRelated: Five Ways Trump Can Cripple Obamacare\n\nAnthem and its Blue Cross-Blue Shield affiliates are seriously considering pulling back in 2018, as Jefferies analysts David Windley and David Styblo said is \u201clikely\u201d to happen in a note last week.

All of the invoice price growth for insulin was offset by price cuts, the institute said.\n\nBut discounting is much less common for newer, innovative cancer drugs, mostly given by injection and approved for defined patient populations.\n\nNet price growth for branded oncology drugs averaged 4.8 percent in 2015, versus 6.4 percent for invoices, according to IMS.\n\nExpress Scripts' Miller and others said makers of new cancer medications enjoy pricing power due to coverage requirements, insurance plan structure and a lack of head-to-head comparison studies.\n\n\"Cancer drugs don't compete on price,\" said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a researcher at Harvard Medical School and author of several studies of drug pricing. \"Drug companies have market exclusivity and we require payers to cover cancer drugs - Medicare has six protected classes, including cancer.\"\n\nMedicare, the federal government's healthcare plan for seniors and the disabled, covers most prescription drugs under its \"Part D\" pharmacy benefits.

As a result, it has been used as a political punching bag on and off for almost as long as it has been in existence. The most recent trend in politicians demonstrating their contempt for the national tax collector -- other than trying to get its commissioner impeached -- is to starve the agency of funding.\n\nHowever, despite major budget reductions -- or perhaps partly because of them -- the agency had been doing more with less over the past several years. One of the metrics the IRS uses to measure its performance is by comparing the amount of money the agency receives from Congress to the amount it collects in taxes due, expressing the result in the cost to collect $100.\n\nRelated: IRS Still Lacks Enough Auditors to Close the $458 Billion Tax Gap\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, that figure stood at $0.35 per $100, down from $0.53 as recently as 2010. It\u2019s also the lowest cost per $100 collected that the agency has recorded since at least 1981, according to the IRS 2016 Data Book.\n\nWhile some of the recent efficiency gains can be attributed to the increase in electronic tax filing, the bulk of the transition to automatic filing had already occurred by 2011, before the most recent downturn in the cost-per-$100 measurement.\n\nIronically, at a time when Washington echoes with calls to further slash federal spending, one of the best investments lawmakers could make, at least with respect to return on investment, would be to funnel more money, not less, to the IRS. That\u2019s because, properly directed, more IRS funding would drive those average costs even lower.\n\nThe Taxpayer Advocate Service, an independent agency within the IRS, put it this way: \u201cThe main reason the IRS is underfunded is because the congressional budget rules were written with classic spending programs in mind \u2014 namely, a dollar spent is treated as increasing the budget deficit by one dollar. As the government\u2019s revenue collector, the IRS is the only significant exception to that rule \u2014 a dollar spent generates substantially more than one dollar in additional revenue and thus reduces the deficit.\u201d\n\nRelated: The IRS Just Invited More Tax Cheating by the Public\n\nOne of the effects of constant budget cuts has been a large reduction in agency headcount. The IRS had 50,400 full-time equivalent employees funded by annual appropriations in 2010. By last year, that had fallen to 38,800. One result of this has been the shriveling up of the agency\u2019s enforcement arm.\n\nThe IRS left an estimated $458 billion in taxes uncollected last year because it doesn\u2019t have the necessary auditors and enforcement personnel to collect it -- an investment that would cost only a tiny fraction of the expected return."}, {"date": "2017/04/03", "title": "Trump Is Using Deadly Drone Strikes More Than Obama Ever Did", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/04/03/Trump-Using-Deadly-Drone-Strikes-More-Obama-Ever-Did", "text": "Former President Obama wasn\u2019t shy about ordering drone strikes \u2013 including a notable one that killed a fiery American cleric in Yemen who was accused of fomenting jihadist attacks \u2013 but his successor is ramping up the use of unmanned autonomous vehicles to attack America\u2019s enemies.\n\nMicah Zenko of the Council on Foreign Relations recently calculated that Obama authorized 542 targeted drone strikes and special ops missions in 2,920 days -- an average of once every 5.4 days.

This, in turn, will depend on what the oil sheiks that run OPEC and the career economists/bureaucrats at the Federal Reserve do in the weeks and months to come.\n\nFor now, instead of putting pressure on risk assets, the Fed's newfound hawkishness is bolstering the reflation trade by lifting the dollar higher and attracting global capital into U.S. assets.

Trump sent a preliminary budget request to Congress last month proposing deep cuts in most agencies but seeking a reduction of just two percent or $239 million from the IRS\u2019s $11.2 billion fiscal 2017 spending level.\n\nRelated: The IRS Just Invited More Tax Cheating by the Public\n\nThe budget request states that the new, reduced spending level would be enough to \u201cpreserve key operations of the IRS,\u201d including combating identification theft and tax fraud and improving tax collections to help reduce the deficit. The proposed budget would also shift resources to hasten the timetable for handling virtually all tax returns and correspondence electronically rather than on paper.\n\nBut while IRS Commissioner John Koskinen dodged another budgetary bullet, his agency is still understaffed and could take years to rebuild its tax enforcement and auditing operations to previous levels. The IRS, once a feared and highly respected agency, saw its influence diminished after congressional Republicans began slashing its budget in protest of the agency\u2019s harsh responses to requests from conservative activist groups for tax-exempt status during the 2012 election.\n\nIn a letter last week to a House appropriations subcommittee, 48 Democrats including Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota urged that Congress boost IRS spending by $1.7 billion in the coming year rather than impose further cutbacks. \u201cAn increase in funding for the IRS will reverse the short-sighted and damaging budget cuts which have increased our national debt, left the IRS ill-equipped to combat refund errors and fraud, drastically reduced taxpayer services, dangerously reduced audits, and limits the IRS\u2019s ability to implement new laws passed by Congress,\u201d the letter states.\n\nNearly 80 percent of all tax returns are filed electronically, which accounts for the reduction of some IRS staffers. Similarly, the IRS website and automated phone service have taken some of the burdens away from customer service agents, who have also been reduced. The agency is also considering 16 \u201celectronic recommendations\u201d that would continue to transform the agency into a digital enterprise.\n\nOver the past five years, as the agency\u2019s budget continued to shrink, the IRS lost almost 15 percent of its workforce, according to the new 2016 IRS Data Book. \u201cKey measures of enforcement activity, including audit rates, have also declined in several categories,\u201d the IRS said in a summary accompanying the new data compilation.\n\nBy 2016, the IRS workforce totaled 77,924 full-time equivalent employees, down slightly from 79,890 in 2015. That workforce included 10,174 revenue agents, 8,235 customer service representative, 8,267 tax examiners, 2,184 special agents and scores of seasonal employees.\n\nRelated: IRS Now Pegs Tax Cheating by Americans at $458 Billion Annually\n\nAccording to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the agency\u2019s current budget of $11.2 billion is 18 percent below the 2010 level, after adjusting for inflation. Because the agency is labor intensive and most IRS funding goes for staffing, the budget cuts have rippled through the workforce.\n\nArguably, the biggest loss has been in the enforcement division \u2013 which over the years has taken the lead in cracking down on tax scofflaws and recovering billions in unpaid taxes. The agency\u2019s enforcement staff has steadily declined, from more than 50,000 in 2010 to just 38,000 in 2016, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO).\n\nIndeed, the agency conducted just 1.2 million examinations of tax returns in 2013, a 16 percent decline from audits the previous year. Although the IRS data document covers only the past two years, a more expansive analysis by The Washington Post published last month concluded that 1.2 million reviews were the lowest number since 2004. It also represented the sixth consecutive year of decline.\n\nLong under attack by GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill that included a failed effort to impeach him, Koskinen has been forced to make significant cutbacks in audits and compliance operations. That, in turn, has helped to spawn widespread tax cheating and major revenue losses, as The Fiscal Times previously reported.\n\nLast year alone, the IRS reported a stunning $458 billion average annual difference between taxes that were owed and paid, a 5.5 percent increase in what\u2019s known as the \u201ctax gap.\u201d\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s the Basic Problem With Trump\u2019s Plan to Slash the IRS Budget\n\nDuring his Senate confirmation hearing, Mnuchin stressed the need to beef up the IRS enforcement division, saying \u201cThat is an important part of fixing the tax gap.\u201d Treasury officials estimate that every additional $1 invested in enforcement can generate $6 of additional tax revenue.\n\nSeven former IRS commissioners who served in both GOP and Democratic administrations have written, \u201cOver the last fifty years, none of us has ever witnessed anything like what has happened to the IRS appropriations over the last five years and the impact these appropriations reductions are having on our tax system.\u201d\n\nThe IRS is charged with a broad array of responsibilities. During Fiscal Year 2016, the agency collected more than $3.3 trillion, processed more than 244 million tax returns and other forms, and issued more than $426 billion in tax refunds.\n\nIRS employees assisted more than 68 million taxpayers over the telephone through live assistance and automated services, taxpayers used the IRS website in far greater numbers. The post popular feature on IRS.gov, \u201cWhere\u2019s My Refund,\u201d was used almost 300 million times last year \u2013 up 27 percent from the year before.\n\nRelated: IRS May Have Allowed Insurers to Escape Millions in Fees and Penalties\n\nThe IRS is also responsible for helping implement the Affordable Care Act, both by providing refundable tax credit subsidies to moderate to middle-income Americans who qualify for health insurance coverage and by enforcing a mandate penalizing uninsured people who don\u2019t apply for coverage.\n\nPresident Trump and congressional Republican leaders are planning to simplify the tax code, which could ease the workload. But the trillions of dollars in proposed tax cuts would be the first major overhaul of the federal tax system since 1986, requiring new training for staff.\n\nThe White House is still figuring out the best path forward on tax reform, though it does have one potential starting point: the tax plans that the Trump transition team developed between election night and the inauguration.\n\nPolitico obtained a copy of the transition document that essentially outlines many of the key tax proposals floated by Trump and his campaign advisers during the 2016 campaign. On the individual side of the tax code, for example, Trump would collapse the current seven brackets to three brackets of 12 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent, while keeping the capital gains rates as they are and repealing the estate tax.\n\nOn the corporate side, Trump would lower the rate from 35 percent to 15 percent for all types of businesses and wipe out the corporate alternative minimum tax. The plan would also repatriate corporate profits from overseas at a one-time rate of 10 percent and scrap most corporate tax deductions, other than research and development credits."}, {"date": "2017/04/03", "title": "Trump Projects Confidence As China Meeting Looms", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/04/03/Trump-Projects-Confidence-China-Meeting-Looms", "text": "Less than a week before he sits down with the president of China for what will be his most complex and challenging foreign negotiation since taking office, President Trump gave an interview to The Financial Times in which he seemed to suggest that solving crisis over North Korea\u2019s missile tests and renegotiating the trade relationship between Washington and Beijing would not be that tough after all.\n\nThe president has placed much of the responsibility for dealing with the Chinese government in the hands of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the former head his family\u2019s real estate business who has no relevant foreign policy experience.

He also promised to officially declare China a \u201ccurrency manipulator\u201d on his first day as president -- a promise he failed to keep.\n\nTrump is fixated on the fact that there is a trade deficit between the US and China -- something he sees as unfair on its face, even though trade economists insist that the mere existence of a trade deficit between any two given countries is not by itself important.\n\nAsked how he would bring down the deficit, Trump said it would be as simple as telling the Chinese president that it needs to happen.\n\nHe would do it, he said, \u201cBy telling China that we cannot continue to trade if we are going to have an unfair deal like we have right now. This is an unfair deal.\u201d\n\nRelated: China Finds a New Source of Cutting-Edge Military Technology: US Startups\n\nHowever, he balked at discussing tariffs, offering a brief soliloquy on how badly other presidents had misunderstood the mechanics of global trade and how he has the knowledge to solve the problem.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about tariffs yet, perhaps the next time we meet,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t want to talk about tariffs yet.

But I do.\u201d\n\nThe thing to watch when Xi arrives at Mar-a-Lago later this week will be which of Trump\u2019s advisers seem most closely engaged with the Chinese president and his entourage. During the campaign, much of Trump\u2019s tough talk on China seemed to emanate from a cadre of hardliners in his inner circle, including White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. All three are advocates of a much more confrontational policy on trade issues.\n\nThe other element of the Trump team is embodied by Kushner and, to some extent, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Until recently, Kushner\u2019s family was in negotiations with a government-connected Chinese insurance company to make a massive investment in an office tower they own in Manhattan, and Kushner himself has been the object of a charm offensive by senior Chinese officials visiting Washington.\n\nRelated: What Is THAAD?

And they might not even return to base.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why we don\u2019t take fine china and crystal to have picnics anymore,\u201d William Roper, chief of the Pentagon\u2019s Strategic Capabilities Office said, according to the website National Defense. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve used paper plates and Dixie cups, you\u2019re not coming back from that. It makes it a completely different experience. We haven\u2019t had that equivalent in the military.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the things we build are expensive, and if they take off, it\u2019s our expectation that they come home and land,\u201d Roper said, adding that until now, survivability has constrained designed and planners. But relying on lower-cost robotic weapons that don\u2019t require refueling, maintenance or protection could decrease the chances of human losses, deliver more operational flexibility and reduce budgets.\n\nThe notion of a swarm of drones launched and directed by a manned aircraft isn\u2019t new, but what is fresh is the idea of sending wave after wave of throwaway UAVs into battle without risking the life of a human.\n\nRelated: More Killer Drones, Please: The Air Force Places a $371 Million Order\n\nRoper didn\u2019t say what such expendable weapons might cost.

We would be liberated from financial insecurity, and those of us working in jobs threatened by robotics and artificial intelligence (such as factory workers and Uber drivers) would no longer have to fear long-term unemployment.\n\nIt sounds great in theory, which is why the idea has drawn increasing interest both in the U.S. and in countries from Canada to Finland to India. A number of prominent techies and futurists have come out in favor of the concept, with Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently saying, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be necessary.\u201d Notable advocacy for a universal basic income has come from Y Combinator, a Silicon Valley-based incubator, and the Niskanen Center, a DC-based think tank.\n\nRelated: 8 Reasons You Might Not Get the Social Security Benefits You Deserve\n\nThe idea isn\u2019t just some socialist fantasy. The notion of replacing government services and in-kind benefits with cash has interested many libertarians and conservatives since economist Milton Friedman first advocated a negative income tax in 1962. The virtues of a system of cash payments include reduced bureaucracy, lower administrative costs and less paternalism. By giving people cash instead of food stamps, Section 8 housing vouchers and other forms of in-kind assistance, government treats recipients as adults capable of making intelligent consumption decisions rather than as children whose lives need to be managed by a benevolent authority.\n\nUnfortunately, America\u2019s city streets provide abundant evidence that many adults are unable or unwilling to manage their lives. Ultimately, universal basic income (UBI) would have devastating budgetary consequences, would not end poverty and could have adverse effects on our social compact.\n\nFrom a fiscal perspective, UBI proposals range from insufficient to catastrophic, depending on the level of the payment and eligibility. Finland is currently experimenting with a monthly payment of about $600 per adult. That is a far cry from the income a single adult would need to make ends meet in a major U.S. city. Even the federal poverty level of $990 for a one-person household is less than the median rent for a studio apartment in any of the nation\u2019s 10 most expensive cities \u2014 and that\u2019s before considering the cost of food, transportation, clothing and other essentials. In Oakland, California, Y Combinator is experimenting with a more realistic basic income grant of $2,000 per month per family.\n\nRelated: Now It\u2019s Democrats\u2019 Turn to Make a Health Care Push \u2014 Medicare for All\n\nUBI could be set at varying levels around the country based on living costs, or at a flat level nationally, which would encourage those in more expensive areas to relocate or supplement their income. Aside from location, income payments may need to vary by size of household. Right now, UBI proposals often specify a flat payment regardless of family size. But if a proposal were to reach Congress, I would anticipate calls for increased payments to larger families on both sides of the political spectrum. The current Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program pays variable amounts depending on family size.\n\nFinally, from a cost perspective, there is the question of how universal a UBI program should really be. Finland is limiting its experiment to the unemployed, but cutting off or scaling back benefits to those who find jobs creates disincentives. On the other hand, paying $2,000 a month to Bill Gates seems absurd, but Social Security checks already go to older billionaires such as Warren Buffett and President Trump.\n\nTo give some sense of the budgetary impact of introducing UBI, consider a scenario under which every head of household between the ages of 18 and 64 received a monthly $2,000 check. Based on a Census estimate of 94.8 million households, that would cost $2.275 trillion dollars annually. Offsetting this cost would be savings from eliminating federal nutrition programs ($100 million), federal rental assistance programs ($21 billion), TANF ($17 billion), Supplemental Security Income ($62 billion), Earned Income Tax Credits ($67 billion) and public assistance spending at the state and local level ($543 billion). Since these offsets total only $810 billion, we are left with a net budgetary cost of over $1.4 trillion for a universal basic income program. With a projected 2017 deficit of $559 billion and trillions in unfunded entitlements, the federal government is not well positioned to take on such a large commitment.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Won\u2019t Touch Entitlement Reform\u2026Yet\n\nA final objection to UBI is philosophical. Western nations climbed out of millennia of poverty when they developed a capitalistic regime undergirded by the Protestant work ethic \u2014 an attitude that was embraced by people of all religions. The idea that all able-bodied adults have an obligation to work runs deep in our culture. Although there are many exceptions arising from luck (like inheritance) and rent-seeking (getting deals based on connections rather than competence), most of us still have an expectation that our economic circumstances should be connected to our willingness and ability to create value for others.\n\nUniversal basic income would delink productive behavior and economic well-being. It could thus break popular support for the market economy. Once the public conceives of income as a right rather than as a reward for value creation, voters will wonder why some still receive more than others. And if we stop thinking of strangers as potential employers, clients and customers, we may start treating them as rivals and enemies.\n\nAlthough I doubt that technological advances will produce mass unemployment, even if they do, paying people to remain idle or indulge in hobbies isn\u2019t the correct policy response. Better alternatives would be to create labor-intensive public projects or to subsidize the wages of lower-skilled private sector employees to keep them competitive with automated alternatives. These options at least maintain some link between effort, value creation and reward."}, {"date": "2017/04/02", "title": "McConnell Prepared to Invoke \u2018Nuclear Option\u2019 to Confirm Gorsuch", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/04/02/McConnell-Prepared-Invoke-Nuclear-Option-Confirm-Gorsuch", "text": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) vowed on Sunday that \u2013 one way or another \u2013 the Senate will confirm President Trump\u2019s nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme\n\nMcConnell has threatened to change the rules so that the Republicans can confirm Gorsuch as an associate justice with a simple majority instead of the 60-vote super majority typically required.\n\nRelated: Republicans Exhale With Trump\u2019s Supreme Court Choice of Gorsuch\n\nIn a chamber where the Republicans hold a narrow 52 to 48 seat majority, McConnell would need to round up at least eight Democrats to achieve a super majority \u2013 a task that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said today is virtually impossible.

Trump picked Gorsuch from a list of 21 potential nominees to the Supreme Court that Trump\u2019s campaign released last year. Trump boasted that Gorsuch is the \u201cvery best judge in the country.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump Would Favor Senate Rule Change If Supreme Court Choice Blocked\n\nGorsuch, 49, a federal appeals court judge on the 10th circuit in Denver, looked like a shoo-in to succeed the late associate justice Antonin Scalia, thanks largely to his Ivy League education, boyish good looks and sterling conservative credentials.\n\nThe widely respected jurist is pro-life and pro-religious liberty and is viewed by many as at least as conservative as Scalia. His appointment if confirmed will bring the nine-member High Court back to the same right-of-center balance that existed prior to the 79-year-old Scalia\u2019s death. As McConnell frequently points out, Gorsuch received high ratings from the American Bar Association, 97 percent of the opinions he wrote were unanimous and he was reversed by the Supreme Court only once in his career.\n\nBut Schumer and many other Democrats in the Senate soured on Gorsuch throughout two grueling days of testimony and private meetings. Some said they found Gorsuch to be evasive on hot-button issues like abortion, gun-rights and labor-management issues. They questioned whether he would be independent enough on cases challenging Trump administration policies. Others complained that Gorsuch was a strict constitutional constructionist whose views were outside the mainstream of American jurisprudence.\n\nSchumer complained that Trump never conferred with Democrats before choosing Gorsuch, in contrast with the past practices of both Republican and Democratic presidents who consulted with senior members of the opposing party. Instead, Trump relied on the recommendations of a few arch-conservative think tanks, including the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation.\n\nRelated: How Trump and the GOP Are Handing Congress Back to the Democrats\n\nFurther exacerbating tensions is the lingering Democratic anger that McConnell and other Senate Republican leaders refused to consider former President Obama\u2019s nominee for the same Supreme Court vacancy, Merrick Garland, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n\nObama nominated Garland a year ago to fill the vacancy caused by Scalia\u2019s death. But McConnell refused to hold hearings on Garland, insisting that there was precedent the winner of the 2016 presidential election to fill the vacancy.\n\nUntil today, only two Democrats \u2013 Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota \u2013 announced they will support Gorsuch\u2019s nomination. Both of those senators are from red states that voted overwhelmingly for Trump last year and face difficult re-election campaigns in 2018. However, a third Democrat, Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, announced today that he, too, would vote for Gorsuch.\n\nRelated: Tax Reform--A Must Win for Trump and the Republican Party\n\nThe 60-vote requirement for cutting off a filibuster of a Supreme Court nomination was preserved as part of a highly controversial rules change orchestrated by former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada in 2013 when the Democrats were still in control of the Upper Chamber.\n\nReid at the time was frustrated and angry with the Republicans for holding up confirmations of many of Obama\u2019s nominees for federal appellate court judgeships and changed the rules to require a simple 51-vote majority for all federal judgeships except for those on the Supreme Court.\n\nAt that time, McConnell blasted Reid for changing a rule that he predicted would come back to haunt the Democrats. \u201cObviously, you can break the rules to change the rule to achieve that,\u201d he seethed during a floor speech. \u201cBut some of us have been around here long enough to know the shoe is sometimes on the other foot.\u201d\n\nMcConnell\u2019s warning to the Democrats was prescient, and now he\u2019s likely to turn the tables on them by killing off the 60-vote requirement for Supreme Court nominees.\n\nRelated: 4 Political Minefields Waiting for Trump Following His Health Care Failure\n\nSen.John Cornyn (R-TX) left little doubt today that the Republicans would confirm Gorsuch even if the GOP had to resort to the most extreme tactics. \u201cThis is [the Democrats\u2019] last gasp from trying to prevent him from being confirmed,\u201d Cornyn told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. \u201cBut they won\u2019t, and Judge Gorsuch will be confirmed this week one way or another.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/04/02", "title": "Trump\u2019s Protests Over Russia Investigation Hit a Crescendo", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/04/02/Trump-s-Protests-Over-Russia-Investigation-Hit-Crescendo", "text": "Donald Trump, whose Saturday mornings are apparently much freer than one might expect the president\u2019s to be, spent a good chunk of time between breakfast and lunch yesterday rage-tweeting about news coverage of the investigations into Russian interference in the presidential election last year and possible connections between his campaign and that Kremlin-directed effort.\n\nThe President, like any other American, has the absolute right to challenge the accuracy of anything he sees in the press, and there isn\u2019t a reporter deserving of the job who would argue otherwise.

It would later come out that the documents were provided by the White House staff, something that Nunes originally denied after making a show of hurrying down Pennsylvania Avenue to personally brief Trump on information Trump\u2019s own staff had provided him.\n\nWhat Nunes appears to have been shown is evidence that intelligence intercepts targeting non-US persons outside the country incidentally picked up conversations by or about associates of the president. In some cases, he said, the identities of those individuals were \u201cunmasked\u201d in reports that were then circulated among intelligence agencies.\n\nRelated: Is Nunes Toast? White House Struggles to Explain Who Leaked Intelligence\n\nWhen US persons are incidentally picked up by intelligence intercepts, their identities are often concealed in reports detailing the findings unless they are relevant to an investigation or are otherwise necessary for analysts to understand what was being discussed. Nunes\u2019 complaint is that he was able to discern the identities of some of the people mentioned in the reports he was shown.\n\nLast week, The New York Times disclosed that some of the reports appear to detail conversations that did not involve the president or his associates but were rather about them -- such as foreign ambassadors discussing plans for gaining influence or access to the Trump White House.\n\nOn Saturday, Fox News reported that the person who gave the order to \u201cunmask\u201d names in the reports is a senior member of the Intelligence Community, which sent Trump rushing to Twitter again.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d the president wrote, \u201c@FoxNews just reporting big news.

One of the reporters who wrote the Fox piece, in an interview broadcast on the network, suggested that the incidental collection of information about Trump associates had begun even before Trump won the Republican nomination, and was done for political purposes by the Obama administration.\n\nHe did not explain why information from a project ostensibly aimed at discrediting Trump, was withheld until Trump had been elected and sworn in as president.\n\nThe tweets came a day after Spicer, from the White House podium, again repeated Trump\u2019s claim that the Obama administration had targeted him for surveillance despite the claims of intelligence officials that this is not true.\n\nIn support of the claim, Spicer cited comments by Evelyn Farkas, deputy assistant secretary of Defense for Russia and Ukraine, that she had encouraged her former colleagues to preserve and disseminate intelligence about alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nRelated: Former Trump Campaign Chair Worked to \u2018Benefit the Putin Government\u2019\n\nSpicer described Farkas\u2019s comments as \u201cdevastating\u201d evidence of an Obama administration effort to gather intelligence on Trump.\n\nIn fact, Farkas left the administration in 2015, when Trump\u2019s run for president was still widely viewed as a self-indulgent publicity stunt. Multiple fact-checkers have pointed out that Spicer had taken her comments completely out of context.\n\nThe efforts by the administration over the past week, with the apparent assistance of Nunes, appear to be an exercise in muddying the waters on the question of whether members of the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in the release of stolen emails that were used to embarrass Democrat Hillary Clinton in the final weeks of the presidential election.\n\nThe aim, to all appearances, is to create enough plausible doubt about the investigation to give the president\u2019s supporters the ability to dismiss the possibility that there is real merit to the Trump-Russia investigation.\n\nSo far, with public opinion strongly in favor of a continued investigation, it hasn\u2019t been working.

Trump will host Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Florida estate next week, for meetings that are expected to focus intensely on trade between the leaders\u2019 two countries -- and in particular, the US trade deficit with China.\n\nTrump, as he does, used Twitter on Thursday to send an early signal to his Chinese counterpart. \u201cThe meeting next week with China will be a very difficult one in that we can no longer have massive trade deficits and job losses,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cAmerican companies must be prepared to look at other alternatives.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Trump Shouldn\u2019t Be So Worried About the Trade Deficit\n\nOn Friday, Trump was expected to sign a pair of executive orders directing his administration to undertake a pair of studies. One will look at sources of the trade deficit, with a focus on duties and fees. The other will look into whether foreign companies are \u201cdumping\u201d their products in the US, that is, selling them at abnormally low prices in order to gain market share or damage competitors\u2019 profitability.\n\nThe White House has insisted that the executive orders are not focused on China, but it seems unlikely that Beijing will see things that way. Trump railed against China during his campaign, threatening punitive tariffs and promising to label the country a \u201ccurrency manipulator\u201d on Day One of his administration, the latter a promise he notably failed to keep.\n\nHe also hired economist Peter Navarro to direct the New White House National Trade Council. Navarro, whose views are well outside the mainstream when it comes to the importance of the balance of trade to the nation\u2019s economic well-being, has made a career out of bashing China and predicting economic ruin for the US if its trade relationship with Beijing doesn\u2019t get overhauled.\n\nThe meeting will also take place at a time when foreign governments and companies are starting to push back against Trump\u2019s bellicose rhetoric on trade as well as on Republican leaders\u2019 plan to consider a border-adjustable tax that would reward domestic production by placing a 20 percent tax on imported goods and raw materials while ceasing to charge US manufacturers taxes on revenues earned overseas. The tax plan, similar to the Value Added Tax (VAT) imposed by many United States\u2019 trading partners, would effectively subsidize American manufacturing and penalize foreign companies that sell goods into the US.\n\nRelated: Will Trump Gamble on a Border Tax and Anger Millions of Walmart Shoppers?\n\nJapanese billionaire Tadashi Yanai, whose Fast Retailing company owns the Japanese fashion outlet Uniqlo, said that he would abandon his existing US stores and his plans for a US expansion if the US began penalizing retailers who import goods for resale.\n\nYanai said that he recognizes that part of the desire for a border tax is to pressure companies to manufacture in America, but in an interview with a Japanese newspaper this week, he said he doesn\u2019t like the idea of being pushed into locating his manufacturing facilities anywhere other than where he thinks it\u2019s best for his business.\n\n\u201cIf I was directly told to do so, I will withdraw from the United States,\u201d he told The Asahi Shimbun. \u201cWe would not be able to make really good products [in the U.S.] at costs that are beneficial to customers.

Since then, Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) have been giving conflicting signals on what if anything will be done to try to recoup their losses and eventually push through changes.\n\nMeanwhile, since shortly after Trump took office, the new administration has been pursuing a series of administrative actions to try to undermine Obamacare, in an apparent effort to lend credence to the Republicans\u2019 assertion that the health care law is in a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d of soaring premiums and shrinking coverage.\n\nOne way Trump administration could effectively torpedo Obamacare is by killing off a $7 billion a year out-of-pocket cost-sharing subsidy for insurers and moderate and middle-income people. The subsidies, considered essential by consumers and insurance companies in order to keep insurance costs affordable, are projected to rise to $10 billion next year.\n\nThe provision has suffered a serious setback in federal court.

That will perpetuate a yawning structural revenue gap that has forced the Treasury to accelerate its borrowing and will push the gross national debt to an historic $20 trillion level this year.\n\nAs a line item in the federal budget, interest payments on the debt sometimes gets short shrift or even ignored in congressional debates on budget and tax issues. Yet, in 2015 interest on the debt consumed six percent of the entire $3.7 trillion government budget and is on track to eventually exceed spending for most domestic programs and agencies, including law enforcement and social safety net programs like food stamps, transportation and housing.\n\nRelated: Clock Starts Ticking on Possible Treasury Debt Ceiling Crisis\n\n\u201cRising interest costs is responsible for half of all spending growth over the next three decades, and it\u2019s not only driving up debt levels but crowding out investments in education, infrastructure, and national defense in the process,\u201d said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a prominent budget watchdog.\n\nIndeed, if the current pattern of mounting debts and rising interest rates persist, interest on the debt will become the third largest category of the budget by 2028, behind only Social Security and Medicare coverage for the fast-growing population of seniors and retirees.\n\nThe combination of a strengthening economy, the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision March 15 to raise interest rates for the second time in three months after keeping them at historic lows since the 2008 financial crisis, and rampant borrowing by the Treasury to keep up with runaway spending have all conspired to boost the government\u2019s interest costs to well in excess of $230 billion annually.\n\nThe government is stuck on a fiscal treadmill, struggling to keep up with interest payments on the debt even as its budget and tax policies put it farther and farther behind. The Treasury regularly must borrow from China, Japan and other major creditors to overcome glaring cash shortage to keep the government operating and repay interest and principle on the debt.\n\nRelated: Deficit Hawks Take Trump on an Ominous Tour of the Fiscal Cliff\n\nUnless the Trump administration and Congress can agree by this fall to raise the debt ceiling and increase the Treasury\u2019s borrowing authority, the government could be facing its first default in history and a partial government shutdown.\n\n\u201cThe higher the government\u2019s interest costs, the more difficult it would be to achieve any particular target for lower budget deficits: Tax increases, spending reductions, or both would have to be greater,\u201d according to the CBO. \u201cSuch policy changes could affect the economy and people\u2019s well-being.\u201d\n\nIf, for example, policy changes lead to an increase in marginal tax rates, the larger the increase the more people\u2019s incentives to work would diminish, the report said. \u201cAlternatively, if policy changes included a reduction in federal spending for investment, the greater that reduction, the more both output and income would be reduced,\u201d the agency argued.\n\nCBO warns that mounting debt levels could have the effect of shrinking the economy by three percentage points between now and 2047. That would have the effect of stunting average income growth by as much as $4,000 a year \u2013 from a projected $90,000 a year to only $86,000 while discouraging government and private investment.\n\nRelated: Budget Watchdog to Trump: Government Spending Is on an Unsustainable Path\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, in commenting on the CBO report, wrote that \u201cIf policymakers add to the debt, income growth will slow further.\u201d For example, if Congress and the Trump administration were to enact $2 trillion of tax cuts and spending increases over the next decade, \u201caverage income will fall by an additional $2,000 per person by 2047,\u201d according to CRFB.\n\nBesides cooling off the economy, CBO said, the mounting national debt may squeeze out other important priorities. That will make it more difficult for the government to respond to emergencies, such as natural disasters and wars, and it could ultimately increase the risk of another fiscal crisis or government shutdown.\n\nThe biggest drivers of government spending \u2013 Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and interest payments on the debt \u2013 taken together will nearly double in cost from 11.8 percent of the overall economy in 2017 to 21.8 percent by 2047.\n\nCBO also predicts that rising debt will have the perverse effect of further pushing up interest rates and adding to the government\u2019s overall costs.\n\nUnder that scenario, the government would end up paying interest rates 0.5 points or 13 percent higher than they otherwise would be by 2047 if the government had done a better job of controlling the debt. At the same time, 10-year Treasury notes would be 0.9 points or 23 percent higher than they otherwise would be.\n\nThose rising interest rates would not only further boost interest costs for the federal government, but would \u201clikely flow through to higher interest rates on mortgages, credit cards, car loans, and business loans,\u201d the CRFB says."}, {"date": "2017/03/31", "title": "The Billion Dollar Drug for Opioid Victims Has a Problem: It\u2019s Addictive", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/31/Billion-Dollar-Drug-Opioid-Victims-Has-Problem-It-s-Addictive", "text": "Maryland Gov.

With overdose deaths from heroin and fentanyl up by 62 percent between the first nine months of 2015 and the same period in 2016, efforts to combat this tragic epidemic must include detox programs, counseling, and medical treatments.\n\nIn the realm of medical treatments, Maryland took bold action last year to reduce access to the opioid treatment drug, Suboxone, which has become a dangerous drug on the streets and in prisons.\n\nRelated: The White House Is Ignoring the Real Cause of the Opioid Epidemic\n\nSuboxone, which was introduced in 2002, has become a huge money-maker since the opioid epidemic swept the country at the beginning of the 21st century. In 2015 alone, more than 52,000 Americans died from heroin and synthetic opioid overdoses, according to the Centers for Disease Control, nearly the number of Americans killed in the Vietnam War. The drug has generated $1-2 billion a year in revenues, first for its initial British manufacturer, Reckitt Benckiser, and the Richmond, Virginia-based company that it spun off two years ago, Indivior.\n\nMany doctors and patients see the drug as effective, but its manufacturer has fought hard to keep generic or alternative drugs off the market. This has led to an antitrust suit initiated last fall by attorneys general from 42 states, including Maryland.\n\nA sublingual version of Suboxone dispensed as a film that\u2019s placed under the tongue has become a contraband drug smuggled into prisons, endangering inmates and correctional officers. In July, Maryland became the first state to fight back, taking the drug off its preferred Medicaid drug list\u2014an action that Indivior appears to be vigorously fighting. Maryland replaced it with a newer treatment drug, that is said to be absorbed and processed by the body at lower doses and produce less harsh withdrawal symptoms than Suboxone. Already, prison smuggling is down sharply.\n\nRelated: Heroin Use, Addiction Up Sharply Among U.S. Whites\n\n\u201cSmuggling has been extremely problematic,\u201d Van T. Mitchell, former secretary of the state department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and Steve T. Moyer, his counterpart at the head of Maryland department of Public Safety and Correctional Services Van T. Mitchell, said. \u201cNot only does it jeopardize prisoners' health and safety but it also jeopardizes the security of correctional staff.\u201d\n\nAs other states consider following Maryland\u2019s lead, Indivior has recently more than doubled its lobbying presence in the state capital bringing its Annapolis lobbying presence to five. The company has a highly paid nationwide network of lobbyists from Alaska and Wisconsin to West Virginia and Kentucky and nearly tripled its spending on federal lobbying last year.\n\nHowever, Suboxone, which cornered the market for opioid addiction drugs, has not only led to prison smuggling and antitrust issues but also can be addictive, causing considerable suffering.\n\nAfter years of trying to fight her son\u2019s addiction to Oxycontin and heroin, several suicide attempts, psychiatric wards, detox programs, and many therapists, Laurie Kaye Schwartz of Kensington, Maryland took her son to a drug-treatment clinic where he was put on 16 mg. of Suboxone.\n\nRelated: Republicans\u2019 Medicaid and Housing Cuts Deal a Double Blow to Drug Crisis\n\nHer son became dependent on the drug because it essentially replaces dopamine, one of the brain\u2019s chemicals that influence happiness. Told that she was \u201cbetter off keeping him on because there\u2019s no protocol to get him off,\u201d they went to another psychiatrist. Since physicians must be certified to prescribe Suboxone, the doctor got the certification and tried to taper down her son\u2019s dose. When he tried to go cold turkey, he would get the shakes and vomit.\n\nMs. Schwartz\u2019s 31-year old son was put on antidepressants, which seemed to help. He moved to California a few months ago but soon wound up on the streets and in homeless shelters.\n\nWith its market share falling and the company facing an antitrust suit, Indivior certainly has an interest in keeping other states from adopting Maryland\u2019s policies and in weakening or reversing Maryland\u2019s law. The company has only said that it \u201cintends to defend\u201d against the suit and \u201crelated actions.\u201d\n\nIndivior\u2019s push is no surprise given the price of Suboxone, which costs around $500 for what seems to be the \u201cstabilizing\u201d treatment course, the first tier of a multi-tier treatment program."}, {"date": "2017/03/31", "title": "Trump\u2019s Climate Fail: Another Loss for American Leadership", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/03/31/Trump-s-Climate-Fail-Another-Loss-American-Leadership", "text": "President Trump put more than progress on climate change in jeopardy when he reversed the previous administration\u2019s clean-energy policies on Tuesday.

Sigmar Gabriel also explained that when he put this to Rex Tillerson, the just-confirmed secretary of state concurred.\n\nRussia, Iran, and Turkey, meantime, proceed with a peace process for Syria that, while tentative and slow, holds more promise than all previous efforts.

However, after initially saying that Trump\u2019s own communications had been picked up, he later waffled about exactly what the reports said while leaving the distinct impression that actual conversations involving Trump transition team members had been caught up incidentally in the course of regular intelligence operations.\n\nHowever, according to The Times report, officials with knowledge of the documents report that much of what Nunes saw was actually reports about third parties in foreign countries -- ambassadors and other officials -- talking about Trump and how to gain access to or influence with his inner circle.\n\nAfter it had become clear that Nunes had personally briefed President Trump on the documents and called the press conference all before sharing information with the Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee, he began to face calls to recuse himself from the investigation. Democrats, in particular, said that given his behavior it was impossible to avoid the perception that Nunes was working hand-in-glove with a White House that he was supposed to be investigating. Suspicions became stronger when Nunes revealed that he had been on the grounds of the White House complex when he viewed the materials.\n\nRelated: Former Trump Campaign Chair Worked to \u2018Benefit the Putin Government\u2019\n\nWhen questions were raised about where he received the information, Nunes told Bloomberg\u2019s Eli Lake that his source had not been a member of the White House staff.\n\nHowever, that appears to be false, The Times reported on Thursday. The newspaper identified Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the senior director of intelligence at the National Security Council, and Michael Ellis, an attorney in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office as the people who gave Nunes access to the information.\n\nIf Cohen-Watnick is, indeed, one of those responsible for giving Nunes the information, it would further complicate the situation. He was brought to the NSC by former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn who was fired for failing to reveal his contacts with Russian officials. Earlier this month it was revealed that Flynn\u2019s replacement, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster had wanted to fire Cohen-Watnick but was overruled by Trump at the urging of close advisers Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner, the latter being also Trump\u2019s son-in-law.\n\nRelated: A Politically Damaged Trump Will Try to Rally GOP Behind AHCA\n\nIn a press briefing on Thursday afternoon, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer flatly declined to address the report, vaguely challenging its accuracy but refusing to address any of the specifics.

Here are five of the most effective ways Price and other administration officials could bring Obamacare to its knees.\n\nKilling off a $7 billion a year out-of-pocket cost-sharing subsidy. Obamacare helps moderate, and middle-income people pay their deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs through subsidies by taxing high-income earners. The subsidies, considered essential by consumers and insurance companies, are projected to rise to $10 billion next year.\n\n\n\nHouse Republicans claimed in a lawsuit that the subsidies were unconstitutional because Congress didn\u2019t specifically appropriate the money, and a federal judge ruled in their favor in May 2016. The Obama administration appealed the ruling, but the new Trump administration has been silent until now whether it will continue to challenge the court ruling.\n\n\n\n\n\nObamacare helps moderate, and middle-income people pay their deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs through subsidies by taxing high-income earners.

The Obama administration appealed the ruling, but the new Trump administration has been silent until now whether it will continue to challenge the court ruling. Ignoring the individual mandate. Another key component of Obamacare is a mandate requiring everyone without insurance through an employer or other sources to purchase health care coverage through the Affordable Care Act or pay a gradually rising tax penalty. The mandate is essential to pressure younger, healthier Americans to sign up for Obamacare to create a more balanced risk pool of individuals so that insurance companies aren\u2019t overwhelmed by older, sicker Americans who have the greatest health care needs.\n\n\n\nShortly after taking office in late January, Trump signed an executive order designed to undercut the Affordable Care Act by instructing HHS and other agencies responsible for administering the program to find ways to \u201cminimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens\u201d associated with the ACA. The Internal Revenue Service responded in early February by weakening the health care law\u2019s requirement that individuals either acquire health insurance or pay a tax penalty to the government. If that stands, fewer young adults will feel obligated to sign up for coverage.\n\nRelated: Now It\u2019s Democrats\u2019 Turn to Make a Health Care Push: Medicare for All\n\nGetting rid of the 10 \u201cessential benefits\u201d in Obamacare . The current law mandates all insurance policies include 10 \u201cessential\u201d services, including pregnancy and maternity benefits, mental health and substance addiction treatment, emergency room coverage, prescription drugs, ambulatory care and other services.\n\n\n\nTrump and congressional Republican leaders argued that getting rid of those requirements was essential to bring down the cost of premiums. Price suggested several times during his congressional testimony Wednesday that he may use his executive authority to redefine minimal health care cover by insurers.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is one of those areas where we think individuals ought to have access to the kind of coverage that they want, not the kind of coverage that the government forces them to buy,\u201d Price said.\n\n\n\n\n\n.

In the final weeks of Obamacare enrollment for 2017, the administration halted several million dollars of paid television and digital advertising and other outreach activities designed to encourage consumers \u2013 particularly young people, to sign up for the program.\n\n\n\nHHS retracted the directive in the face of strong protests and complaints by Democrats and other Obamacare advocates. However, an HHS official warned in a statement that, going forward, \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to continue spending millions of taxpayers\u2019 dollars promoting a failed government program.\u201d\n\nRelated: Controversial Medicare Payment Reforms May Hit a Wall at Trump\u2019s HHS\n\n\n\n"}, {"date": "2017/03/30", "title": "Top Pay for Top Guns: Fighter Pilots Could Get $455,000 in Bonuses", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/30/Top-Pay-Top-Guns-Fighter-Pilots-Could-Get-455000-Bonuses", "text": "To keep Air Force pilots from jetting off to more lucrative careers with commercial airlines, the service is considering passing out enlistment bonuses that could go as high as $455,000 in total.\n\nRelated: The Marines New Helicopter Costs as Much as an F-35\n\nIn testimony before a House Armed Services subcommittee on Wednesday, Air Force personnel chief Lt.

To counter that problem, the bill Alexander and Corker put forward would make it legal for people who receive health insurance subsidies under the law to spend them outside the exchanges.\n\nUnder the ACA, the exchanges were set up to create a marketplace for individuals who were not covered by employer or government-sponsored insurance to purchase plans on the non-group market. Many of those people would be eligible for considerable government support to help pay for premiums.\n\nIn exchange for access to these consumers with federal money to spend, insurers that offered plans on the exchanges were required to offer coverage that met federal guidelines covering the type of care that was covered, restrictions on costs, and more. Insurers were still allowed to sell policies outside the exchanges, but consumers were not allowed to spend federal dollars on those policies.\n\nThat restriction, in a market where no insurers were on the exchanges, would leave individuals with no options.\n\nRelated: Now It\u2019s Democrats\u2019 Turn to Make a Health Care Push: Medicare for All\n\n\u201cThere are 34,000 Knoxville area residents who rely on an Affordable Care Act subsidy to purchase insurance, and after the one remaining insurer pulled out of the exchange for 2018, these subsidies are worth as much as bus tickets in a town with no buses running,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cThere is also a real prospect that all 230,000 Tennesseans who buy insurance on the exchange\u2014approximately 195,000 with a subsidy\u2014won\u2019t have any plans to buy next year either, and millions of Americans in other states are facing the same dire circumstances.\u201d\n\nThe bill would also waive the penalty that the law imposes on people who go without health insurance for those living in a market with no options.\n\nIn their statement announcing the bill, the two senators tried to preserve the \u201crepeal and replace narrative\u201d\n\n\u201cAt some point, on behalf of the American people, Congress and the administration have to resolve the issues that are driving up healthcare costs, limiting choices, and causing the exchange market to spiral downward,\u201d Corker said. \u201cHowever, in the interim, we must take steps to ensure people in places like Knoxville, where more than 34,000 individuals receiving subsidies under current law will have zero options in 2018, have the opportunity to purchase health insurance off the exchange in the individual market.\u201d\n\nRelated: Controversial Medicare Payment Reforms May Hit a Wall at Trump\u2019s HHS\n\nThey even set up a sunset provision for their proposal, saying that it would expire in 2019.

So Paul Ryan might want to keep the infographic below, from the Journal of the American Medical Association, handy.\n\nBased on the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Health Tracking Poll, the infographic provides a sense of where Democrats and Republicans agree and where the partisan divide remains wide.\n\nRelated: Now It\u2019s Democrats\u2019 Turn to Make a Health Care Push: Medicare for All\n\nA few key takeaways from the Kaiser polling (you can find more of the results here):\n\nFavorable views of Obamacare are near an all-time high, and a strong majority of Americans favor many provisions of the law, like allowing young adults to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance plans until age 26, creating health insurance exchanges for small businesses and individuals, providing subsidies for lower income people to buy insurance, prohibiting insurance providers from denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions, and giving states the option of expanding Medicaid coverage. For each of those policies, support among Republicans is at least 63 percent, and it\u2019s even higher among independents and Democrats. (Support for the individual mandate that requires Americans to have health insurance or pay a fine is much weaker, at 21 percent among Republicans, 30 percent for independents and 57 percent among Democrats.)\n\nThat all suggests that fixing Obamacare\u2019s flaws might be a more popular approach to health care reform than repealing the law, and Kaiser\u2019s polling earlier this month confirmed that 51 percent of Americans said lawmakers should not vote for repeal. Overall, just 37 percent of those polled (including 63 percent of Republicans) said repealing the Affordable Care Act is a top priority \u2014 a number that, coincidentally, is roughly in line with President Trump\u2019s approval rating.

Only 35 percent of those polled \u2014 and just 50 percent of Republicans \u2014 said that scaling back the federal government\u2019s role in health care was a top priority.

Don\u2019t be one of them.\n\nFailing to Coordinate Spousal Benefits: Too often couples focus on only their own Social Security and fail to recognize that they may be eligible to receive up to 50 percent of their spouse\u2019s benefit while waiting to claim their own benefits. Missing these benefits often costs a couple $40,000 to $50,000 in lost Social Security income. Also, filing the wrong type of application or filing at the wrong time can cost you dearly.\n\nNot Maximizing Survivor Benefits: Again, teamwork is important. Since the Social Security benefit of the higher-earning spouse is \u201cinherited\u201d by the surviving spouse, pursuing a strategy that increases the survivor benefit as much as possible can make a significant difference. Many couples miss another $70,000 to $80,000 by failing to maximize the survivor benefit. The higher-earning spouse should be especially careful about when to claim Social Security benefits.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s a First Draft of the GOP\u2019s Plan to Overhaul Social Security\n\nWorking a Minimum of 35 Years: Social Security is based on your highest 35 years of earnings history. Continuing to work in retirement can be one of the best ways to increase your Social Security benefits, especially for married couples. Each additional year of current earnings from work that replaces a lower earning year will increase your (and potentially your spouse\u2019s) Social Security. If you have less than 35 years of earnings, the non-working years will be counted as \u201c0\u201d and will lower your overall Social Security benefit vs. having worked at least 35 years.\n\nClaiming Early: If you\u2019ve just turned 62 and want to claim your benefits, hold on. This is by far the single biggest mistake that most Americans make. Many believe that Social Security is almost an \u201cautomatic\u201d benefit: turn 62, collect and don\u2019t think about it again. Avoid this path if you want to maximize your benefits. If you already claimed your benefits early, all is not lost. You can suspend those benefits and minimize the damage by reinstating benefits when you turn 70. Also, if you\u2019re within one year of your original filing date, there are ways to withdraw your application and start over.\n\nIf you do delay benefits, you receive what are called Delayed Retirement Credits (DRCs), which accumulate at a substantial rate \u2014 8 percent per year between 66 and 70. Claiming at 70 vs. 62 means you\u2019ll receive 176 percent of what you would have received at 62 for the rest of your life, and your spouse can benefit from your DRCs as well.\n\nRelated: A New Plan to Save Social Security for Another 75 Years\n\nEarning Too Much While Collecting Benefits: Another frequent stumbling block is the Earnings Test, which applies to those who claim Social Security benefits prior to their Full Retirement Age (66 for most people) and are still working and earning an income.\n\nEarning more than $16,920 in 2017 while collecting a Social Security benefit will cause the Social Security Administration to withhold $1 for every $2 in earnings over the Earnings Limit. While this money is not technically lost (the Social Security Administration credits it to your account at your Full Retirement Age), claiming early and having benefits withheld can present two major problems: 1) Benefits will be withheld so you will not receive all the benefits (if any) anticipated as the result of claiming, and 2) Claiming early (even if you\u2019re not receiving a benefit because it\u2019s being withheld) will still lock you into the early claim date which means a suboptimal Social Security strategy and less money.\n\nIgnoring the Impact of Taxes: Social Security benefits are taxable are considered income by the IRS and must be included on your annual tax return. Without proper planning, taxation can reduce Social Security benefits by up to 30 percent in some cases. This is called the Social Security Tax Torpedo and should be avoided whenever possible. Whether or not your Social Security income is subject to taxation depends on the level of your Provisional Income, defined as follows:\n\nProvisional Income =Adjusted Gross Income + Tax-Exempt Interest + 50 percent of Your Social Security Benefits\n\nHaving Errors in Your Social Security Earnings Record: You want to get credit for all your hard work, right? Well, make sure that you check your earnings record with the Social Security Administration on your Social Security statement. If there are errors in your earnings record, you won\u2019t receive all of the benefits that you have earned. You have 3 years, 3 months and 15 days to correct any erros. After that, it\u2019s too late.\n\nFalling into a \u2018Rat Holes\u2019: The Social Security increases that accumulate between the ages of 62 and 70 do not accumulate evenly, which creates what are called \u201cSocial Security Rat Holes\u201d for those that are single. These are suboptimal times to claim your benefit based on the formula that is used to calculate what Social Security will pay you. For those born between 1943 and 1954, one rat hole occurs between 62 years and 63 years and 11 months. The other occurs between 65 and 4 months and 66 and eight months. In other words, the \u201cFull Retirement Age\u201d as listed on your Social Security statement is directly in one of these rat holes!\n\nMatthew Allen is the Co-Founder/CEO of Social Security Advisors and creator of the new course Maximizing Your Social Security produced in conjunction with Weiss Educational Services."}, {"date": "2017/03/30", "title": "The Gorsuch Vote Will Show the Democrats Can\u2019t Govern, Either", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/03/30/Gorsuch-Vote-Will-Show-Democrats-Can-t-Govern-Either", "text": "Republicans on Capitol Hill have gotten off to a bad start as a governing party in full control of Washington DC.

The stumble exposed divisions that threaten to undermine other White House agenda items, so much so that President Donald Trump and his team have begun talking about finding ways to work with moderate Democrats to advance their domestic policy goals, such as tax reform. They\u2019re even thinking about crossing the aisle on health care.\n\nThat strategy may not pan out either as the coming confirmation vote for Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee could prove. While Republicans appear incapable of seizing the moment for governance due to internal divisions, Democrats seem ready to unify in a demonstration of opposition to governance.\n\nRelated: Top Senate Democrat Promises Fight to Block Trump High Court Pick\n\nNeil Gorsuch, a ten-year Tenth Circuit appellate jurist, finds himself cast into a strange role as the catalyst of this potential meltdown. Unanimously confirmed to his current position in 2006, Gorsuch spent the last ten years building a strong record of jurisprudence as well as a reputation for independence. Last week, Gorsuch demonstrated his grasp of the law and a gentle judicial temperament during a grilling by Senate Democrats.\n\nGorsuch\u2019s deft handling of the interrogation and his ability to answer critics with the law and the broad context of his career had no better example than his exchange with Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA). Feinstein, the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s ranking member, questioned whether Gorsuch could offer any proof that he \u201cwould give a worker a fair shot, maybe something in your background I don\u2019t know about.\u201d This question was part of a Democratic strategy to paint Gorsuch as nothing more than a corporate shill, but it backfired spectacularly on Feinstein. Gorsuch named ten cases off the top of his head, including two in which he found for plaintiffs in workplace discrimination cases, a sexual harassment case, and three in which he\u2019d sided with environmentalists.\n\nFeinstein realized that she\u2019d fallen into a classic blunder for cross-examination \u2013 asking a question without knowing the answer and allowing the witness to fill in the gaps. When Feinstein attempted to cut off Gorsuch, he insisted that his record showed him to be \u201ca fair judge.\u201d He concluded by declaring, \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee you more than that \u2013 but I can promise you absolutely nothing less.\u201d\n\nRelated: More Democrats Oppose Trump's U.S. Supreme Court Pick\n\nSenate Democrats had come under severe pressure from progressive activist groups to find a reason to block Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court, part of a strategy of \u201cresistance\u201d to the Trump administration. Rather than do damage to Gorsuch, the hearing made him look extraordinarily mainstream in both the law and in human terms. As the New York Daily News\u2019 liberal editorial board expressed it, Gorsuch \u201cwithstood a murder board of questions last week to prove himself to be an extraordinarily qualified, whip-smart jurist with exemplary judicial temperament.\u201d\n\nThe attempts to paint Gorsuch as extreme and unfit failed spectacularly, and instead, the hearings demonstrated that Gorsuch might be the most talented and prepared candidate to appeal to Republicans \u2013 who control both the Senate and the White House after an election in which this particular Supreme Court seat became a significant issue for voters.\n\nRather than acknowledge the obvious, however, Senate Democrats have decided to obstruct the Gorsuch appointment anyway, as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has called for a filibuster against his confirmation. If successful, it would be the first filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee since Abe Fortas in 1968 for his elevation to chief justice, and that was a bipartisan filibuster over ethics issues that would later force his resignation from the court.\n\nRelated: Supreme Court Nominee to Face Confirmation Vote April 7\n\nOnly two other Supreme Court nominees have faced attempts at filibusters: Samuel Alito in 2006, and William Rehnquist in 1971 and again in 1986 when nominated as chief justice. The so-called 60-vote standard has never been applied to Supreme Court nominees, as Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler repeatedly wrote, and two of the current justices on the Supreme Court got confirmed with fewer votes.\n\nGorsuch\u2019s opponents have no legitimate reason to block his confirmation other than political disagreement. Our system of government is supposed to function around such matters, however, especially when it comes to presidential appointments. If Democrats refuse to confirm Gorsuch, it will become clear that they will obstruct any nominee they do not choose for themselves. It will be an exercise of the absolutism of the minority \u2013 a refusal to cooperate in governance on anything other than the terms of a party that lost the last election and lost it badly.\n\nRepublicans may have proven themselves momentarily incompetent at governance over the American Health Care Act, but at least they tried to operate within the parameters of majority governance. Democrats might have taken a wiser course in cooperating with the traditional model of governance while reminding their supporters of the consequences of losing elections as a motivator for future cycles.\n\nAt least that would demonstrate a mature approach to the reality of their situation and acknowledgment of Gorsuch\u2019s obvious qualifications for the Supreme Court.

A new analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities goes beyond the topline numbers to illustrate just how historically harsh some of the proposals are.\n\nThe left-leaning think tank focused on what the Trump administration referred to as its \u201cskinny budget,\u201d an outline of its planned budget request for the fiscal year 2018, and found that it would sharply accelerate the already downward trend in funding, usually contained in block grants, for state-level programs serving those in need.\n\nRelated: Did Trump\u2019s Budget Chief Say Cutting Meals Programs Is \u2018Compassionate\u2019?\n\nIn sum, the proposal would slash discretionary funding for four different block grant programs, and appears to presage other reductions as well. The total money available to the four programs would be halved in 2018.\n\nThe reductions will hit programs that have seen their funding reduced almost every year for a decade and a half, except for a single-year spike in 2009, as the government moved to help those impacted by the financial crisis.\n\nThe grant programs identified by CBPP include the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps poor people pay for heating in the winter, and the Community Development Block Grant program, which provides funds that are used to benefit a smorgasbord of programs, including after-school activities, meals on wheels and more. Those cost $3.4 and $3 billion annually.\n\nIt would also hit two smaller programs: the Home Investment Partnership Program, a $948 million fund that supports housing rehabilitation and affordable housing, and Community Services Block Grant, a $714 program that supports anti-poverty initiatives.\n\n\u201cEliminating these four block grants would cut overall funding for discretionary block grants by $8.0 billion \u2014 or 47 percent \u2014 from its $17.2 billion level in 2017,\u201d the CBPP report finds. \u201cThat 47 percent doesn\u2019t account for inflation or any cuts, rather than outright eliminations, to block-grant programs that may flow from the austere discretionary funding targets that the President has set for most federal departments and agencies.\u201d [Italics in the original.]\n\nRelated: Why Another Government Shutdown Is Suddenly in the Cards\n\nOver the years, the push to block grant federal programs has resulted in more and more direct spending of federal dollars being delegated to the states. Lawmakers at the federal level cite the flexibility the grants provide states as a benefit, allowing those closest to the problems in the communities being served to determine how to allocate resources.\n\nIronically, that has also led to a decrease in the amount of those dollars flowing to the states.\n\n\u201cFrequently, policymakers cite the very flexibility that block grants provide to state and local governments as their reason to cut or end them,\u201d CBPP notes. \u201cThe increased flexibility and diminished accountability over using federal funds that are built into the basic structure of many block grants mean that states can use the funds in highly diffuse ways, making a block grant\u2019s impact much harder to assess. That, in turn, can eventually prompt federal policymakers who are seeking budget cuts to target block grants and argue that block-grant programs lack sufficient evidence of effectiveness.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a strategy on display again with the Trump administration. In discussing the budget proposal last week, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney was asked how the White House could justify cutting funding for programs like Meals on Wheels or after school food programs for hungry children.\n\nThe problems, he said, is that there is no evidence that they are effective."}, {"date": "2017/03/29", "title": "The White House Is Ignoring the Real Cause of the Opioid Epidemic", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/29/White-House-Ignoring-Real-Cause-Opioid-Epidemic", "text": "There's only one way to end the opioid epidemic, and so far \u2014 despite all the noise around Wednesday's meeting of a White House commission on the issue \u2014 it doesn't look as if the White House wants to touch it.\n\nYou see, what was discussed by the commission isn't just a plan in its early stages; it's a clear step in the wrong direction.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Health Secretary Invested in a Company Linked to the Opioid Epidemic\n\nIn a Wednesday press briefing following a meeting of this White House commission, the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, blamed the crisis on \"cheap heroin\" flooding the market, and he credited President Donald Trump with already taking action against drug cartels. He framed the battle against the epidemic as one for the Drug Enforcement Administration and law enforcement.\n\nIf that's what the White House is focused on, it has the situation all wrong.\n\nThe problem here isn't with drug cartels; the problem is big pharma and its multidecade campaign to normalize the prescription and sale of highly addictive opiate pain medication. It's usually only after prescriptions for this medication run out, or become too expensive, when addicts turn to cheap heroin.\n\nIf Trump isn't going after big business, he's not going after this problem. Period.\n\nSerious\n\nSince the 1990s, big pharma has paid off doctors to encourage them to write prescriptions for opioid painkillers, it has generated studies that made the effects of these drugs seem way less destructive than they are, and it has greased the wheels of the US healthcare system to make insurance payments easier to collect.\n\nHere's an example of this behavior. Last month two Alabama doctors were found guilty of making millions by running an opioid \"pill mill.\" They were getting patients addicted, overcharging them and their healthcare providers for treatment, and accepting payments from Insys Therapeutics, a maker of fentanyl.\n\nAnother one: In 2009, the American Geriatrics Society created guidelines recommending that doctors use opioids to treat all kinds of pain. Of the 10 experts on the panel, however, at least five had ties to big opiate producers.\n\nRelated: How West Virginia Became Ground Zero for the Opioid Epidemic\n\nMore serious\n\nYou may recognize some of the names in this game, and you might not: Purdue, Janssen/Johnson & Johnson, Insys, Mylan, and Depomed, to name a few.\n\nMore companies are involved in the rise of the opiate crisis, but those five are a start. At least, they're a starting point for Sen. Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat who on Tuesdayannounced an investigation into the marketing practices of companies that manufacture opioids and the drugs that are meant to treat opioid overdoses. According to the press release announcing the investigation, McCaskill requested from those five companies:\n\nDocuments showing any internal estimates of the risk of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose, diversion, or death arising from the use of any opioid product or any estimates of these risks produced by third-party contractors or vendors.\n\nAny reports generated within the last five years summarizing or concerning compliance audits of sales and marketing policies.\n\nMarketing and business plans, including plans for direct-to-consumer and physician marketing, developed during the last five years.\n\nQuotas for sales representatives dedicated to opioid products concerning the recruitment of physicians for speakers programs during the last five years.\n\nContributions to a variety of third-party advocacy organizations.\n\nAny reports issued to government agencies during the last five years in accordance with corporate integrity agreements or other settlement agreements.\n\n\"All of this didn't happen overnight \u2014 it happened one prescription and marketing program at a time,\" McCaskill said in the statement. \"The vast majority of the employees, executives, sales representatives, scientists, and doctors involved with this industry are good people and responsible actors, but some are not. This investigation is about finding out whether the same practices that led to this epidemic still continue today, and if decisions are being made that harm the public health.\"\n\nNot serious\n\nOf course, the ways a White House policy could deflect blame for the opioid crisis away from the pharma companies have been out in the ether for a while, and no one has articulated them better than Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia.\n\nManchin, a Democrat, would have the government focus on the Food and Drug Administration's classification of opioids, maybe have the agency slow down approval for new opiates, and have a \"one-penny fee on every milligram of opiates that are produced and sold in America\" to be collected for treatment.\n\nAs a side note, Manchin's daughter Heather Bresch is the CEO of the drug company Mylan, one of the five companies McCaskill is going after.\n\nManchin also called marijuana the gateway drug to opioids.\n\nThis is a joke, and it's an insult to the people whose \"gateway\" to addiction was a doctor who said these medications would be safe.\n\nPlease stop joking.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Business Insider.

Some have even begun to speculate that with Trump\u2019s approval ratings well under water already, the Democrats have a credible shot at taking control of the lower chamber, if not the Senate.\n\nIn 18 of the last 20 mid-term elections, the president\u2019s party has lost House seats. And of those 18 elections, the average seat loss was 33. If that trend holds, the Democrats have a solid chance of picking up the 24 seats they would need to regain the majority.\n\nWhile analysts caution that much can happen between now and 2018 \u2013 and that it\u2019s always risky betting against Trump and his ability to shake things up and turn things around in his favor \u2013 a turnover in control of the House in 2018 would have a devastating impact on Trump and the Republicans and limit their ability to get anything passed in the future without Democratic support.\n\nEven if the Democrats pick up no more than a dozen or so House seats, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) will face overwhelming odds against passing major legislation with his caucus split between the conservative Freedom Caucus and more moderate Republicans, and the Democrats positioned to make demands.\n\nIf that proves to be the case, Trump may have only limited time to achieve many of his major objectives, including tax reform, changes in the health care laws, deep cuts in many domestic programs and a major buildup of the military.\n\n\n\nRelated: 4 Political Minefields Waiting for Trump Following His Health Care Failure\n\n\u201cI would never rule out presidential successes in a Congress controlled by his party, even in the last year of Trump's term,\u201d Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics, said Wednesday. \u201cBut this particular president is hobbled far more than most. His party is deeply divided into factions, and if Trump's unpopularity continues, GOP congressmen will be looking out for themselves as 2018 approaches. So, I'd say Trump's potential productive period is more like 18 months, and that estimate may be generous.\u201d\n\nThe counterweight to that, of course, is that many House Republicans are in safe districts drawn by Republican-controlled state legislatures, and they will be tough to unseat. It\u2019s more likely that in many of the races, the Republican primaries could be determinant, especially if there are a lot of challenges. Nathan L. Gonzales, a political analyst with Inside Elections, says the current \u201cplaying field\u201d is far more favorable to the Republicans than the Democrats.\n\n\u201cBut there are still 18 or 19 months before the election, and I think there is an opportunity for the playing field to change,\u201d he said. \u201cIt changed pretty dramatically from 2009 to 2010 [in the GOP\u2019s favor]. I think that\u2019s sort of the scenarios Democrats are hoping for. Because fundamentally, mid-term elections are referendums on the president\u2019s party. If people don\u2019t like the president or the job he is doing, they can\u2019t vote against him in 2018 \u2013 they would have to vote against members of his party.\u201d\n\nBut Trump is not getting much help from his party. In the first few months of 2017, the House Republicans have not exactly made a strong case for voters to keep them in control of the chamber. The effort mounted by House leadership to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act not only failed, but it also forced dozens of potentially vulnerable party members to support a bill that was so politically toxic that only 17 percent of Americans said they supported it.\n\nRelated: Looks Like Trump Won\u2019t Be Getting Any Money to Build His Wall This Year\n\nTrump\u2019s biggest problem, for now, is that his job approval rating is at 41.8 percent, according to the Real Clear Politics average -- a bad omen for a newly installed president and one that could come back to haunt his party in the mid-terms. However, analysts warn against attaching too much significance to that in looking down the road.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s much more important is his job approval rating in the 10 or 12 states where there\u2019s going to be a top 10 Senate race or in key congressional districts where the majority is hanging in the balance,\u201d Gonzales said.\n\nTrump and the GOP may also have to deal with the demographic wave of millennial voters who now make up the largest single generational cohort in the US electorate, and are only gaining in numbers. Those younger voters did not turn out in strength last November, one of the factors that helped Trump win the election. However, those who did vote overwhelmingly for Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nA candidate who can mobilize younger voters -- or more actions by Trump that independently push them to the polls, like his executive order eviscerating Obama-era environmental regulations -- could make November 2018 an even tougher month for the GOP.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s approval rating will be important, more important is whether the GOP and Trump can show they can govern.\n\nRelated: Trump Takes Another Swing at Controversial Budget Cuts\n\nWhit Ayres, a veteran Republican pollster and political analyst, said, \u201cThe Republicans have been given control of the entire federal government, and now they have to deliver on at least some of the basic promises they made to the American people. If they manage to get a pro-growth tax reform bill through; if they manage to get some sort of replacement for Obamacare through that helps to make health care more affordable; if they reform the regulatory environment that increases economic growth and brings back some manufacturing jobs. Then they are in a very, very strong position to hold on to both the House and the Senate.\u201d\n\nBut even if Paul Ryan remains Speaker of the House in 2019, the Democrats wouldn\u2019t have to gain many seats at all to make his fractious GOP conference all but unmanageable.\n\nThe hard-right wing of the party, embodied in the House Freedom caucus, already wields power disproportionate to its size because it controls enough votes to deprive Ryan of a majority on legislation its members oppose. Those aren\u2019t the guys (they\u2019re all guys) who will be at risk of losing seats to a Democrat in 2018. It\u2019s the less doctrinaire members of the conference whose heads will be on the block.\n\n\n\nThe National Journal reports, \u201cOf the 36 at-risk House Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans, ac\u00adcord\u00ading to The Cook Polit\u00adic\u00adal Re\u00adport\u2019s rat\u00adings, 28 rep\u00adres\u00adent urb\u00adan or sub\u00adurb\u00adan dis\u00adtricts where Trump isn\u2019t par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlarly pop\u00adu\u00adlar.

Specifics surrounding exactly how and where Barrow met Tusk, as well as his planned route for getting to the preordained meeting point, were reportedly kept quiet for fear of impassioned Remain campaigners possibly attempting to intercept the letter and disrupt the timing of the agreed plan for this historic event.\n\nTusk has previously said the EU is ready to respond within 48 hours of obtaining the notification.\n\nThe two-year time limit can be extended with the unanimous consent of both the U.K. government and the European Council, which consists of the leader of each of the 27 member states remaining within the EU post-Brexit.\n\nThe deal will also be put forth for approval in each member state's respective national parliament, which could potentially slow down the process should certain lawmakers object to particular conditions. Any deal must be approved by a \"qualified majority\" of EU member states and the European Parliament retains the right to a veto.\n\nRelated: Britain\u2019s Tarnished Sterling: A Global Warning for Theresa May on Brexit\n\nWhat will the Article 50 achieve once completed?\n\nArticle 50 simply provides a path for the process by which the U.K. will exit the EU. Once the withdrawal agreement \u2013 enacted within the U.K. by the Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law within the country - comes into force, the EU treaties will no longer apply to the U.K. Following that, all of the permanent new terms governing the relationship going forward between the two sides will have to be negotiated and agreed. During this time, the government will decide which parts to retain, modify or cut. Some estimate this could take several more years.\n\nWhat if there is 'no deal' agreed with the EU within the two-year exit process?\n\nThe \"deal\" refers to the terms governing the new post-Brexit relationship between the EU and U.K. of which a trade agreement is the critical centerpiece. If no new deal is agreed before the U.K. leaves the EU, trading terms will default to the World Trade Organization (WTO) standards which are significantly less beneficial for both sides.\n\nWhat powers does the UK Parliament have during the Brexit process?\n\nThe U.K. Parliament will have the right to veto the final deal but not to suggest amendments to it, effectively leaving politicians with a \"take-it-or-leave-it\" option.\n\nWhen are official talks between the UK and EU expected to begin?\n\nSome believe that official Brexit talks could begin on April 29 at the next planned summit bringing together the leaders of the 27 remaining EU member states in Brussels.\n\nWhat are the biggest issues on the table?\n\nThe key topics are set to be the exit bill the U.K. is required to pay to the EU for the price of leaving, rights for EU citizens to remain within the U.K. following Brexit and vice-versa, the future freedom of movement for, above all, people and goods and the complicated political situation between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nHow does the timeline fit into the UK general election cycle?\n\nThe next general election in the U.K. is scheduled for May 7, 2020. Should the U.K. successfully exit the EU within the designated two years from the triggering of Article 50, the process should be completed by April 2019, leaving around a year for campaigning ahead of the next election.\n\nHow did markets react ahead of the trigger?\n\nStrong chatter anticipating that U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May would trigger Article 50 on March 29 emerged on the weekend of March 11/12. When markets opened on Monday March 13, both sterling and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 equity index rallied, with commentators suggesting that there was relief among investors that the process \u2013 now largely viewed as inevitable despite continued calls from certain high profile figures for the decision to be reversed \u2013 was finally getting underway. The FTSE 100 and the mid-cap FTSE 250 index both closed higher on Tuesday March 28, prior to the trigger being pulled on Wednesday while the British currency finished lower against the U.S. dollar.\n\nThis article originally appeared on CNBC.

And Trump came close to bringing primary rival Jeb Bush to tears by harping on what he said was former President George W. Bush\u2019s devastating decision to chase ephemeral weapons of mass destruction and topple the regime of Saddam Hussein, leading the country into a bloody Middle East quagmire.\n\n\u201cWe cannot be the policemen of the world,\u201d Trump said at the first presidential debate. \u201cWe cannot protect countries all over the world.\u201d\n\nBut that was then.\n\nNow Sanders is back to being a progressive voice crying in the wilderness, Clinton is wandering around the wilderness (or at least around the parks near her home in suburban New York) and Trump is commander-in-chief of a military that is flexing its muscles around the globe.\n\nIn Yemen, as The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, the Trump administration is ramping up support for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in their fight \u201cagainst al Qaeda and Iranian-backed militias \u2026 drawing the U.S. deeper into the two-year civil war there.\u201d\n\nRelated: US Strikes in Libya Kill More Than 80 Islamic State Fighters\n\nIn Iraq, 300 troops from the Army\u2019s 82nd Airborne Division are joining the battle to oust ISIS from its stronghold in Mosul, where some 2,000 fighters are embedded in the civilian population, according to Military Times. That pushes up the number of American soldiers in Iraq to more than 6,000, it said. On Mar. 17, as many as 200 civilians may have been killed by a U.S. airstrike, according to Foreign Policy.\n\nIn Syria, some 400 Marines began manning heavy artillery earlier this month in support of hundreds of U.S. Special Operations soldiers assisting Kurdish fighters and other ant-ISIS warriors trying to capture Raqqa, the so-called capital of the Islamic State.\n\nIn Libya, U.S. troops continue to monitor what is left of an Islamic State force decimated by B-2 bomber raids in January that attacked a desert encampment near the coastal city of Sirte, according to Stars and Stripes. Last week, Marine Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, chief of the U.S. Africa Command, said Special Operations teams would remain in the country for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn Somalia, drought and famine are complicating the fight against the terror group Al-Shabaab, Waldhauser told a press breakfast on Monday, but he also said last week that the military has asked the Trump administration for more \u201cflexibility\u201d on the rules of engagement with the al Qaeda-linked group, according to the website Military.com.\n\nIn Afghanistan, more troops may be needed for America\u2019s longest military action, Gen. Joseph Votel, head of U.S. Central Command, said earlier this month, according to Foreign Policy. That would mark a reversal from a peak of about 100,000 troops six years ago to about 8,400 today.\n\nConsumed by the investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. election and allegations that the Trump campaign may have colluded with Moscow; embarrassed by a failed run at replacing Obamacare; and tripped up by all the predictable hurdles facing a young and inexperienced White House, the military-heavy administration seems to be giving the Pentagon considerably more leeway than it had in the Obama years.\n\nRelated: Trump Wants a Much Bigger Navy: Here\u2019s How Much It\u2019ll Cost\n\nA lot of what looks like increased enemy engagement in all the hot spots mentioned above can be tied to Trump pledge to eradicate ISIS. But the thrust of the administration can also fairly be said to be more military involvement, not less.\n\nThe president has asked for almost $30 billion more in fiscal 2017 and $54 billion next year to rebuild the military and accelerate the fight against ISIS; he wants to expand the size of America\u2019s fighting force, including 3,000 more Marines this year; and his plans call for a 350-ship Navy.\n\nEven in Europe, which was unsettled during the campaign by Trump suggestions that other NATO countries weren\u2019t pulling their weight, the Pentagon under Defense Secretary James Mattis, a former four-star Marine general, is showing the flag.\n\nIn January a contingent of about 300 Marines were deployed to Norway for six months \u2013 the first time since World War II \u2013 for training in an Arctic environment.\n\nAlso that month, 4,000 American soldiers landed in Poland to demonstrate what the U.S. ambassador to that country called \u201can iron-clad commitment\u201d to NATO allies.\n\nIn the meantime, two months of war games continue in and around the Korean Peninsula, where tensions are high as North Korea angrily monitors almost 20,000 U.S. and 300,000 Republic of Korea troops engaging in joint exercises.\n\nOn Friday, Reuters reports, North Korea carried out a new test of a rocket engine that could be used in an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) \u2013 part of a pattern of provocative behavior this month.\n\nPresident Trump may not want to police the planet, but willingly or not, he is becoming the new U.S. cop on the beat.\n\nThe President has asked for almost $30 billion more in fiscal 2017 to rebuild the military and accelerate the fight against ISIS; he wants to expand the size of America\u2019s fighting force, including 3,000 more Marines this year; and his future plans call for a 350-ship Navy."}, {"date": "2017/03/29", "title": "Tax Reform: A Must Win for Trump and the Republican Party", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/03/29/Tax-Reform-Must-Win-Trump-and-Republican-Party", "text": "The knives are out for Paul Ryan. To survive, the House Speaker must produce a win on tax reform. That will not be easy because the obstructionist Freedom Caucus could once again join Democrats to defeat this next major White House initiative. While Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer will bleat about handouts to billionaires, the intransigents on the right could well object to the \u201cnew\u201d border adjustment tax.\n\nIt will become virtually impossible if the House sinks into another tussle over leadership. Ryan is pivotal to the success of the Trump agenda: He\u2019s a veteran who understands the legislative process, a close ally of Vice President Pence and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, and a respected leader in the House.\n\nRelated: It\u2019s High Time for Tax Reform, but the Republicans Are Doing It Wrong\n\nStill, the failure of the AHCA \u2013 at least in its first round at bat -- has put Ryan on the hot seat. The Freedom Caucus blames him for the failure to repeal and replace Obamacare, and for embracing the now mainstream position that the country expects all citizens to have access to healthcare. Like John Boehner before him, House Speaker Ryan has failed the litmus tests of the far right; they want him gone.\n\nPresident Trump may also wonder whether Ryan is the right man to push his agenda through Congress. His outsourcing of the healthcare overhaul to Ryan was a sign of confidence in the House Speaker and also proof that the president knows his own limitations. Unfortunately, he now also knows Ryan\u2019s. To his credit, he has stood with the Speaker through the debacle, saving his ire for the Freedom Caucus, and rightly so.\n\nRyan\u2019s American Healthcare Act of 2017 would have accomplished much that conservatives wanted. Through its dismantling of the fees and taxes which funded Obamacare, it effectively dismantled the law itself. In addition, the bill would have for the first time thrown a lasso around Medicaid, starting to rein in the third-largest federal program, which has tripled in size since 2000.\n\nTo be sure, the AHCA was flawed. It only made sense in the context of the two further measures which were to follow \u2013 a series of executive orders to be issued by President Trump and additional legislation. The three-step approach was required by the rules of reconciliation, through which it was meant to pass. Since those subsequent elements were never fully explained to the public, Ryan and others had a difficult task selling the AHCA to fellow legislators and to the public.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Needs the Border Tax to Secure Across-the-Board Tax Reform\n\nPaul Ryan can be criticized for taking that path, and for not bringing more people into the conversation. The weekend before the AHCA showdown, Ted Cruz told John Dickerson on CBS\u2019 Face the Nation that Ryan\u2019s bill would not pass the Senate, and that it should include more provisions, like eliminating the Obamacare mandates and allowing competition across state lines to lower premiums. He argued that such items ultimately impact the budget and thus could be passed under reconciliation.\n\nCruz\u2019 point is well taken. With a majority in the Senate and the right leadership, the GOP might have been bent the rules to suit the situation and gotten a more comprehensive and inclusive bill passed.\n\nRyan should perhaps also have brought the Freedom Caucus into the conversation earlier on. However, as one recently-resigned member of that group said in disgust, \"There are some members of the Freedom Caucus, they'd vote no against the Ten Commandments if it came up for a vote.\"\n\nThe fractious Caucus has single-handedly taken the wind out of Trump\u2019s sails. After the bill tanked, the stock market sold off for eight straight days, ending a record-setting run fueled by optimism that the new president could boost economic growth. To what end? Though there is a small group in the country that fervently aligns with what radio host John Batchelor calls the \u201cBoutique of No,\u201d they are not in the majority, even within the GOP.\n\nRelated: Republican Meadows: Tax Plan Does Not Have to Be Revenue Neutral\n\nCaucus members may be wising up to the damage they have caused. Ringleader Meadows, facing the reality that thanks to his group Americans will continue to suffer the high costs and narrower choices of Obamacare, sounds more conciliatory. On ABC\u2019s This Week, Meadows argued that the health care push wasn\u2019t dead, but simply interrupted; he promised that President Trump \u201cwill deliver.\u201d\n\nWe shall see. After Republicans met yesterday, there was speculation that the House might try again to bridge differences between moderates and the Freedom Caucus. If another attempt is in the cards, Meadows needs to show he can convince his group to compromise.\n\nThe ability to work together will also be essential to crafting tax reform. Conservatives want lower rates but will likely balk at the balancing mechanism of the border adjustment tax, which some have likened to a VAT. That tax is unpopular on the right because politicians can (and usually do) so easily hike the rate over time.\n\nIn the tax debate, Ryan must bring more of his colleagues on board earlier on. He will also have to do a better job of messaging, explaining that the border tax aims to spur exports and curb imports and help U.S. workers. It can be done; Trump will help.\n\nIf the Freedom Caucus and Speaker Ryan have learned some lessons from the AHCA fiasco, they can work together to get the job done. Both need to show they can govern for the good of the Trump presidency and of the country."}, {"date": "2017/03/29", "title": "The Federal Government Really Does Need an Overhaul: Can Trump Get It Done?", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/29/Federal-Government-Really-Does-Need-Overhaul-Can-Trump-Get-It-Done", "text": "The knives are already out for the Trump administration\u2019s new plan to overhaul the federal bureaucracy using state-of-the art business techniques to enhance efficiency and reduce costs.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s 36-year-old son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is heading a new White House Office of American Innovation invested with wide ranging authority to reform and reorganize the federal bureaucracy, improve health care for veterans and help fight the opioid addiction crisis by tapping into the best thinking of corporate America and Silicon Valley.\n\nRelated: The Staggering Cost of Medical Waste in America\n\nKushner has begun holding twice weekly meetings at the White House with other senior officials, and has reached out to such corporate giants as Apple chief executive Tim Cook, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk to brainstorm change in the federal government.\n\nKushner, a former New York real estate investor and media executive, told The Washington Post, \u201cWe should have excellence in government\u201d and that \u201cgovernment should be run like a great American company.\n\nHowever, resistance is already building to Kushner\u2019s SWAT team. Some public employees\u2019 leaders and other entrenched interests are warning of possible Trump White House ulterior motives, such as vastly stepping up privatization of government activities to benefit the president\u2019s friends in the private sector while targeting a federal workforce for downsizing that has remained relatively stable for years.\n\nSteven Lenkart, executive director of the National Federation of Federal Employees, representing 110,000 blue and white-collar federal workers, told The Washington Post that he is concerned that the new initiative will have a \u201clopsided focus\u201d on dismembering offices that enforce environmental or labor regulations.\n\nRelated: Government Wastes More Money than You Think\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Teresa Gerton, a former deputy assistant secretary at the Labor Department under President Obama, said Kushner and his team will find it tempting \u2013 if not irresistible -- to replace federal workers with computers to save money.\n\nBut having Kushner head the new office of innovation could be arguably one of the few truly positive and constructive ideas to come out of a White House that has been consumed with deporting millions of illegal immigrants, promoting a failed health care plan, and building a $25 billion wall along the nearly 2,000-mile-long southern border with Mexico.\n\nTrump vowed throughout the campaign to use his business skills and talents to reshape the federal bureaucracy while ridding the government of hundreds of billions of dollars of \u201cwaste, fraud and abuse.\u201d But he offered few clues as to what he had in mind.\n\nMany of Trump\u2019s predecessors tried but largely failed to make lasting and fundamental changes to the operations of government, and there are no guarantees the new president can do any better.\n\nRelated: Billions of Taxpayer Dollars Wasted Annually in Redundant Federal Programs\n\nYet the need for action is great and well documented. Trump is putting a high-profile adviser in charge of restructuring government.\n\nKushner, the husband of First Daughter Ivanka Trump and a successful real estate investor in his own right, already had an extraordinary portfolio of responsibilities in the White House, including driving foreign and domestic policy, making presidential personnel decisions and advising Trump on political strategy.\n\nNow he is taking charge of a thorough review of the operations of government, with an eye to changing many long-standing practices of a hidebound federal bureaucracy and accelerating the government\u2019s move to the use of more sophisticated computer and internet operations. He will also set his sights on redundant programs that cost taxpayers billions of dollars each year.\n\nA 2014 report found that it took 10 different offices at the Department of Health and Human Services to operate programs addressing AIDS in minority communities, while autism research was spread over 11 different agencies. At the same time, Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado has eight different satellite control centers to control 10 satellite programs.\n\nKushner clearly is a newcomer to government, and will face a steep learning curve if he is serious about penetrating the far-flung operations of government and making significant change. Moreover, much of what he will be trying to do to upgrade the government\u2019s computer operations will overlap with the operations of other government offices, including the U.S. Digital Service, led by former Google executive Matt Cutts and populated with engineers and developers.\n\nRelated: Justice Department Wastes Millions Through Grant Program Fraud\n\nHowever, Kushner and his staff on the new White House office of innovation will bring the kind of fire power and centralized focus that others in government cannot provide, as Axios noted today.\n\nIn a government where the Internal Revenue Service still depends on antiquated computer systems to process tax returns and ferret out fraud, the Medicare and Medicaid programs have lost hundreds of billions over the years through improper payments and theft. And immigration and enforcement agents must use paper files to track down illegal immigrants because their computers still aren\u2019t up to speed.\n\nAs The Fiscal Times wrote in 2015 as part of a series of articles on ways to \u201cReboot America\u201d to restore Americans\u2019 faith in their institutions, \u201cThe federal government is a rudderless behemoth --- a massive $3.7 trillion a year enterprise that is struggling to come to grips with a fast-changing society, mind-boggling innovations in technology and business practices, and growing public impatience with bureaucratic inefficiency, waste and corruption.\u201d\n\nThe series concluded that the only way to truly reengineer the federal government was to \u201cembrace a cold-eyed business model that places productivity and accountability at the top of the list.\u201d\n\nRelated: From Strip Clubs to Combat Ships, McCain Blasts $13 Billion in Pentagon Waste\n\nIf government leaders were truly interested in pioneering better ways of servicing the country and reducing the deficit and waste, Washington policymakers, bureaucrats and public employees\u2019 unions \u201cmust somehow break free of their hidebound and self-defeating practices that reward stasis over progress and risk-taking,\u201d the series argued.\n\nOver the years, many have proposed changes to improve the quality of government, dating back to the Hoover Commission of 1947 appointed by President Harry Truman.\n\n\n\nDemocratic President Bill Clinton, who put Vice President Al Gore in charge of the \u201cPartnership to Reinvent Government\u201d beginning in 1993, had some of the best results. Their goals included:\n\nPutting customers (the American taxpayers) first\n\nCutting red tape\n\nEmpowering employees to get results\n\nCutting government back to basics\n\n\n\nGore methodically asked for recommendations from stakeholders and others and two-thirds of the recommendations were adopted in Clinton\u2019s first term. The results included the elimination of 426,000 federal positions, and a drive toward internet-based management, especially at the IRS and VA.\n\n\n\nRelated: The Pentagon Wasted $125 Billion and Buried the Evidence\n\nRepublican President George W. Bush urged lawmakers and bureaucrats to reduce red tape, but he had only modest victories to show for his efforts. Democratic President Barack Obama tried to streamline the federal bureaucracy, but he was blocked by senior lawmakers. His budget office also methodically benchmarked the efficiency of government departments in the areas of supply acquisitions, finance, information technology, personnel and property management.\n\nObama\u2019s final term revealed just how much work remained to be done.\n\nThere were still billions of dollars of waste, fraud and improper spending, especially at the Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security. Outrageous management practices at the Veterans Affairs Department forced patients to wait weeks and even months for an appointment that cost many their lives.\n\nThere was poor overall monitoring of the performance of government workers and contractors. And there was an appalling lack of competent in-house technological and IT savvy that could have saved the Obama administration from its humiliating on-line rollout of the Affordable Care Act in October 2013.\n\nGovernment reform typically gets short shrift or provokes yawns on Capitol Hill or along the campaign trail, and Trump and the other Republican and Democratic candidates had relatively little to say about it during the 2016 campaign.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Shouldn\u2019t Give the Pentagon Another Dime\n\nSome government experts say that if a new president is serious about making fundamental change in government, he has only a brief window in which to press for change, before his influence begins to wane and opposition mounts.\n\nMax Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a preeminent research and advocacy group for the federal government, urged Trump and other presidential candidates to think seriously about government reform early in the campaign and to be ready to hit the ground running if they won election.\n\n\u201cIf you wait a year or two years into your term to figure out what you want to do on the management agenda, you\u2019ve lost a considerable part of your runway for actually affecting real change,\u201d Stier told The Fiscal Times at the start of the campaign. \u201cWe need to see administrations starting with clear management agendas in the same way they start with policy agendas.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/03/28", "title": "Looks Like Trump Won\u2019t Be Getting Any Money to Build His Wall This Year", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/28/Looks-Trump-Won-t-Be-Getting-Any-Money-Build-His-Wall-Year", "text": "Still reeling from their health care reform debacle last week, congressional Republican leaders appear more willing to stiff President Trump on initial funding for his wall along the border with Mexico than risk a fight with Democrats that could result in a government shutdown.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) decided late last year to postpone final action on more than $1 trillion of discretionary spending for the 2017 fiscal year that runs through Sept. 30 in order to give the newly elected president an opportunity to put his stamp on spending priorities.\n\nRelated: 5 Biggest Winners and Losers in Trump\u2019s 2018 Budget\n\nBut Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has declared Trump\u2019s request for $1.4 billion in the current budget for preliminary planning for construction of the wall along nearly 2,000 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would prompt a Democratic filibuster and the likelihood the spending bill would go down.\n\nSen.

Trump has repeatedly pledged to ramp up infrastructure spending in the US.\n\nThe cuts are part of a broader effort to get Congress to acquiesce to Trump\u2019s request for an immediate infusion of $30 billion into the Pentagon as a down payment on what he has promised will be one of the biggest surges in military spending in the nation\u2019s history.

Representing the rightmost wing of the GOP in the House, they wield considerable influence within the party because there are enough of them to deprive House Speaker Paul Ryan of a majority if they decline to back him on the House floor.\n\nIn the past, the Freedom Caucus has used must-pass legislation, like government funding bills or debt limit increases, to push specific agenda items that may or may not be shared by the broader Congress, such defunding the ACA or Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus chairman, Mark Meadows, said over the weekend that the group doesn\u2019t expect problems with funding the government.\n\nRelated: Chair of Freedom Caucus Open to Deficit-Expanding Tax Cuts\n\nBut experts, like budget wars veteran Stan Collender, executive vice president at Qorvis MSLGROUP, note that history suggests that many of Meadows\u2019 members will be reluctant to pass up an opportunity to press for one of their priorities. The problem is that the rest of the party knows that if they cave into the Freedom Caucus demands, the bill will be filibustered by Senate Democrats.\n\nIn the end, there is a strong possibility that the Trump administration is going to need support not just from Republicans but also from a solid number of Democrats to overcome conservative resistance in the House.\n\nThat means even a temporary spending resolution that slashes medical research and CDBGs is going nowhere fast, even with the GOP in control of both houses of Congress."}, {"date": "2017/03/28", "title": "Trump Picks up His \u2018Pen\u2019 to Eviscerate Obama\u2019s Rules on Climate Protection", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/28/Trump-Picks-His-Pen-Eviscerate-Obama-s-Rules-Climate-Protection", "text": "When President Obama was faced with a Congress unwilling to work with him on virtually anything, he reminded the country that the chief executive has other ways of affecting the way the nation does business. Specifically, he said, he had a \u201cphone and a pen\u201d and proceeded, much to Republicans\u2019 fury, to overhaul much of the way the federal government does business through executive orders.\n\nNow his predecessor, faced with a humiliating legislative defeat in his first major effort to enact a new law, is following the same path, though arguably in reverse. Donald Trump on Tuesday is expected to sign an executive order that will roll back a vast array of Obama-era requirements meant to protect the climate from global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the country\u2019s investment in renewable energy.\n\nRelated: Trump Administration Takes Aim at Funding for Sanctuary Cities\n\nThat order follows close on the heels of a second, less-noticed, one that revoked rules put in place by Obama to ensure that companies winning large federal contracts do not have a history of violating labor laws and workplace safety requirements.\n\nThe two back-to-back orders are just the latest in a flurry of activity from the new administration, which has used executive orders to push its policy agenda forward in areas as diverse as immigration, regulatory reform, and enforcement of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance coverage mandates.\n\nThe order expected Tuesday will have sweeping consequences for the way the Environmental Protection Agency enforces federal laws related to carbon emissions and will absolve federal agencies of a requirement that they consider the environmental impact of their actions when making regulatory decisions.\n\nThe rule will undo a ban on the leasing of federal land for coal mining, an effort taken by the Obama administration as part of a push to move the country away from carbon-intensive fuels that create significant pollution and toward more renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar.\n\nRelated: Why Another Government Shutdown Is Suddenly in the Cards\n\nAn anonymous administration official told The Washington Post the new policy was meant to make the country \u201cenergy independent\u201d and denied that the move represents an abandonment of efforts to combat climate change. \u201cWhen it comes to climate change, we want to take our course and do it in our own form and fashion,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe order is not the first one Trump has signed paring back environment-related regulations, but it is the most sweeping. He previously signed a rule that removed restrictions preventing coal mines from polluting streams and other waterways and recalculated the royalties that private companies pay for mining on federal lands.\n\nMuch of the new rule focuses on undoing restrictions the Obama administration placed on coal-burning power plants. The new president has made the reviving the coal mining industry a focal point of his new administration. This despite the fact that coal mining represents a tiny fraction of overall employment in the US, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and that even top executives in the coal industry believe the effort to bring jobs back is doomed.\n\nThe order signed Monday, though less broad in scope, was also aimed at undoing efforts by the previous president that had frustrated conservatives. The main target of the action was President Obama\u2019s July 2014 Executive Order 13673, entitled \u201cFair Pay and Safe Workplaces.\u201d The Obama order, among other things, imposed strict transparency requirements on federal contractors with regard to information they were required to share with employees about their compensation.\n\nRelated: Trump Wants to Overhaul an Understaffed Government Desperate for Leadership\n\nCongress had already taken steps to undo the Obama-era rule, which detractors said created a \u201cblacklist\u201d of companies that would be barred from receiving federal contracts.\n\nWhile Republicans, by and large, cheered Trump\u2019s latest efforts to undo the Obama legacy, Democrats were dismayed -- particularly by the move to slash environmental rules.\n\nDelaware Sen.

The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) was designed to shift the medical system away from tradition \u201cfee-for-service\u201d and towards rewarding the quality of service in a bid to save hundreds of billions in the coming decades.\n\nBut while the Obama administration took an important step last October by issuing the proposed new regulations to implement the law, they could be stopped in their tracks under the new Republican leadership at HHS.\n\nFormer Rep. Tom Price of Georgia, the new HHS secretary, is a sharp critic of the move to a \u201cvalue-based\u201d system of payments to physicians and argues that they could seriously undermine the traditional doctor-patient relationship.\n\nPrice, a retired orthopedic surgeon, wrote in a letter to CMS last fall that the final MACRA rule \u201cdeserves careful scrutiny in light of the serious concerns\u2019 that he and other members of the Congressional Doctors Caucus had raised.\n\nRelated: Doctors and Nurses Charged in Massive $900 Million Medicare Fraud\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned about how this rule could affect the patient-doctor relationship, and I look forward to carefully reviewing it in the coming days to determine whether the Administration has addressed those concerns and put the interests of patients first,\u201d Price wrote at the time.\n\nNow Price, a Tea Party conservative and arch foe of Obama-era policies, controls the rulemaking at CMS. Although the new Trump administration has yet to make any pronouncement about MARC, it is very likely there will be significant and wholesale changes made to the proposed rule \u2013 if it is not blocked altogether.\n\nA new policy brief by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation issued Monday found the medical world sharply divided over the new rules and suggests that the debate could drag on for months, if not years.\n\n\u201cThis shift is potentially transformational but presents a serious implementation and logistical challenges,\u201d the new report stated. \u201cNot all doctors embrace the change, and the philosophical and economic underpinnings of value-based payment--and the mechanisms to achieve it--continue to be vigorously debated.\u201d\n\nRelated: Audit Uncovers $124.7 B of Overpayments and Fraud in Medicare and Medicaid\n\nMACRA is one of many regulatory and rulemaking controversies that fly under the public\u2019s radar and yet could have a monumental impact on the way the medical profession and health care industry do business in the future. In 2015 Medicare paid physicians and other clinicians around $130 billion, or a fifth of total Medicare spending. So the stakes in changing the system of reimbursing doctors and hospitals cannot be exaggerated.\n\nHealthcare reformists for years have complained about Medicare\u2019s fee-for-service payment system that allows hospitals, doctors, and other healthcare providers to seek reimbursement from the government for every test, examination, and treatment they provide to the elderly.\n\nThat approach has generated a blizzard of paperwork and incentive to doctors to run up the volume of their charges \u2013 even when it can mean ordering unnecessary tests or treatment \u2013 to maximize their income. Doctors have long complained about the inadequacy of Medicare reimbursement for their services, and find virtue in maximizing treatment.\n\nBut those practices drive up the government\u2019s Medicare costs and encourage fraud and other gaming of the system.\n\nRelated: 8 Big Changes Under Tom Price\u2019s Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nThe Obama administration and a bipartisan majority in Congress opted in April 2015 for an alternative to fee for service that based payment on \u201cbased on performance metrics, patient experience, patient outcomes, and public health improvements,\u201d according to the Robert Wood Johnson study. Doctors and other health care providers would no longer be allowed to operate \u201cuntethered from accountability,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe report spans the many years of debate and trial and error and highlights many of the arguments raised both for and against the new approach.\n\nHere are three of the most compelling arguments for and against MACRA, based on the new report:\n\nThe Pros\n\nThe new approach is consistent with a move in the private sector and government over the past decade toward a \u201cvalue-based payment\u201d that rewards quality of service and results rather than taking a more piecemeal approach regardless of the clinical need or the appropriateness of those services.\n\nRelated: The 10 States With the Worst Medicare Waste\n\nThat \u201cinappropriate\u201d or excessive care is common within the Medicare program and greatly adds to the health care costs of the government, businesses, and families.\n\nThe current fee-for-service system dates to 1992 and is based on a complex coded formula that estimates the amount of work required of physicians to perform hundreds of different services The CMS administers the fee system, but it is based on calculations provided by the American Medical Association (AMA).\n\n\n\nSome critics including the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission have complained that this approach \u201cdeputizes\u201d the medical profession to set the price list \u2013 essentially allowing the fox to guard the hen house.\n\nThere is flexibility in the new approach that will give the medical profession \u2013 especially small practices -- plenty of time to adjust. To make sure the reforms aren\u2019t overly burdensome, CMS has adopted an approach that sets 2017 and 2018 as \u201ctransition\u201d years and that allows doctors and clinicians to \u201cpick the pace\u201d at which they gradually shift to the new system.\n\nThe Cons\n\nWhile the change potentially is transformational, it poses serious implementation and logistical challenges. Many doctors including HHS secretary Price have bridled at changing a reimbursement system that has served them and their patients well for years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new system is hopelessly complicated and involves the choice of two different tracks. One is called the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System, or \u201cMIPS.\u201d The other is called the Alternative Payment Model, or \u201cAPM,\u201d and offers more financial incentives.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome critics complain that MACRA is designed to push doctors who practice on their own or in small groups into larger groups and other payment models. Many prefer their current arrangements while others take issue with the whole notion of changing or incentivizing doctor behavior through performance measurements and financial incentives.\n\nRelated: Doctors and Nurses Charged in Massive $900 Million Medicare Fraud\n\nDoctors who bill Medicare more than $30,000 a year and provide care for more than 100 Medicare patients annually can opt for either program. Clinicians who take part in MIPS will be scored on an overall 1-100 scale consisting of four performance categories: quality of care, practice improvement, advancing care information and cost or resource use.\n\nAPMs can apply to a specific clinical condition, a care episode, or a whole population \u2013 if you can follow that. The goal of the law and the final rules is to have APMs, over time, encompass entire populations. CMS estimates that 70,000 to 120,000 clinicians in 2017, and 125,000-250,000 in 2018 will join advanced APMs and qualify for a 5 percent incentive payment and a more generous annual fee increase. But many doctors are confused about exactly how the system will work.\n\nSkeptics insist there isn\u2019t conclusive proof that this approach yields improvements in care or general public health."}, {"date": "2017/03/27", "title": "Trump Administration Takes Aim at Funding for Sanctuary Cities", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/27/Trump-Administration-Takes-Aim-Funding-Sanctuary-Cities", "text": "Ever since Donald Trump began railing against undocumented immigrants at the beginning of his presidential campaign, so-called \u201csanctuary cities\u201d have been a target of some of his strongest condemnation. He declared that as president he would withhold federal funding from jurisdictions that decline to share information about undocumented individuals with federal immigration authorities. And on Monday, his administration detailed one of its plans for doing just that.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions, himself a strong supporter of tougher immigration laws, announced that the Department of Justice would deny grants administered through its Office of Justice Programs to jurisdictions that do not comply with 8 USC 1373. That particular segment of the U.S. Code says no government entity in the country may \u201cprohibit, or in any way restrict, any government entity or official from sending to, or receiving from, the Immigration and Naturalization Service information regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual.\u201d\n\nRelated: As AG, Sessions Could Radically Influence Immigration Enforcement\n\nIn his remarks, Sessions announced new DOJ guidance that \u201crequires state and local jurisdictions to comply and certify compliance with Section 1373 in order to be eligible for OJP grants. It also made clear that failure to remedy violations could result in withholding of grants, termination of grants, and disbarment or ineligibility for future grants. The Department of Justice will also take all lawful steps to claw-back any funds awarded to a jurisdiction that willfully violates Section 1373.\u201d\n\nWhether the clawbacks would be retroactive to grants already provided or limited to future grants only was unclear from the wording of the Attorney General\u2019s remarks. A request for clarification sent to DOJ had not received a reply at the time this story was posted.\n\nIn 2016, OJP oversaw 2,995 grants that translated into $3.86 billion in funds to state and local law enforcement agencies. In his remarks, Sessions said that the grants would top $4.1 billion this year.\n\nThe OJP grants range in size from the tiny -- $3,674 to the Custer County, Colorado, Sheriff\u2019s Department through the Bureau of Justice Assistance Small Agency Body-Worn Camera Policy and Implementation Program -- to the massive -- $264.3 million to the California Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services through the Victims of Crime Act.\n\nRelated: Team Trump on Immigration Disruption: \u2018It\u2019s a Small Price to Pay\u2019\n\nJurisdictions throughout the country are divided on the effect that Section 1373 compliance has on local law enforcement efforts. Some believe, as Sessions does, that \u201cwhen cities and states refuse to help enforce immigration laws, our nation is less safe. Failure to deport aliens who are convicted for criminal offenses puts whole communities at risk \u2013 especially immigrant communities in the very sanctuary jurisdictions that seek to protect the perpetrators.\u201d\n\nOthers, however, believe that if local law enforcement officials are seen by the undocumented community as an extension of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, they will be less likely to cooperate with police, either by reporting crimes, warning authorities of potential criminal activity or providing other information police find valuable.\n\nWhat there is little disagreement on, though, is the importance of OJP grants to many local police departments. The money is often used to fund technical upgrades, training and other resources that might otherwise be beyond the budgetary capacity of smaller departments.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s What Trump\u2019s \u2018Merit-Based\u2019 Immigration System Would Look Like\n\nWhile major metropolitan areas may have the financial resources to maintain sanctuary city policies in the face of the loss of OJP funding, the administration\u2019s new stance could force tougher choices on smaller municipalities, whose law enforcement agencies rely more heavily on the DOJ for funding.\n\nThat\u2019s the pressure Trump wants to apply to local officials, and it isn\u2019t immediately obvious that other federal grant programs managed by different arms of the executive branch couldn\u2019t be weaponized against sanctuary cities in the future."}, {"date": "2017/03/27", "title": "Here's Why Trump Won't Be Able to Keep His Promise Coal Miners", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/27/Industry-Chief-Urges-Trump-Not-Over-Promise-Jobs-Coal-Miners", "text": "In a bid to make good on a campaign pledge to Appalachia, President Trump is scheduled to take another big step this week towards scrapping the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to curb industrial carbon emissions that critics charge have seriously hurt the struggling coal industry and tossed tens of thousands of miners out of work.\n\nTrump will sign an executive order on Tuesday repealing President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan designed to slash greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants by a third in the coming decade and fulfill the U.S. commitment to an international global warming agreement reached in Paris in late 2015.

The 2015 rule has been held in abeyance since last year while a federal appeals court considers a challenge by a dozen coal-friendly, largely Republican states and more than 100 companies.\n\nPruitt, the former attorney general for the state of Oklahoma, was a leader in challenging that and other EPA regulations in court before he was tapped by Trump to head the premier agency responsible for clean air and water regulations and efforts to contain climate change.

One of them is Frank Zaccanelli, a Dallas real-estate mogul who was a part of the Mavericks ownership group headed by Texas billionaire Ross Perot Jr., who sold the team to Cuban in 2000.\n\nZaccanelli, who calls himself a \"pretty good student of Mark Cuban\" although he \"wouldn't say we're best friends or get along great,\" blasted Cuban for some of his statements and decisions during his de-facto tenure as Trump's foil in the business world.\n\n\"What he's doing now has put himself out there for a lot of criticism,\" Zaccanelli said.\n\nRelated: Mark Cuban: Here\u2019s What You Need to Do Before You Start Investing\n\nThe former Mavericks executive was particularly dismayed by Cuban's February tweet to a season ticket holder who was upset by the owner's comments about Trump and said he would turn in his season tickets and boycott games.\n\nCuban's response? \"DM me and I'll help get it done.\"\n\n\"The way I read it was that if you don't want to be a season ticket holder, I don't want you to be one,\" Zaccanelli said, suggesting that Cuban's political platform has been a drag on his businesses, particularly his pro-basketball team.\n\nBut Cuban disputed the assertion.\n\n\"For every hate email there was a positive one as well,\" he said of the response to his political opining, adding that he didn't see his politics becoming a drag on the Mavericks because \"remember, Clinton won Dallas County.\"\n\nA recent poll showed that the split sentiment in Cuban's inbox could be indicative of a larger one. The results of that poll, conducted by the left-leaning Public Policy Polling, found that Cuban would be in a neck-and-neck race against the sitting president in a prospective one-on-one 2020 election.\n\nTom Jensen, the pollster, said Cuban proved to be \"pretty competitive given his comparatively low level of name recognition at this point.\"\n\n'He needs to hire someone to help create the entire campaign'\n\nFor Cuban to have a serious chance at securing the White House, he would need to start taking policy positions and filling out the bare bones of a campaign infrastructure soon, campaign experts told Business Insider.\n\nRelated: Mark Cuban May Be the Next Billionaire to Seek the White House\n\nAnd unlike Trump, Cuban would have to run more of a \"traditional campaign,\" said Terry Sullivan, Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign manager.\n\n\"He definitely comes across as a more cerebral and thoughtful candidate than Donald Trump, and he's clearly got a better, self-made billionaire story,\" Sullivan told Business Insider. \"But ... because of that, he's not willing to set his hair on fire to make news in the same way. So it makes it a little more difficult for him to cut through [the noise] than a Trump [type].\"\n\nThe first steps to laying out a campaign infrastructure, Sullivan said, would be to get informed on the issues and begin to take positions on key areas of policy.\n\nCuban has already started to do that. He put forth a proposal to fix the Affordable Care Act, and he hammered away at a jobs platform heavily focused on dealing with what he sees as an upcoming wave of job loss due to automation, necessitating \"macro\"-level changes to economic policies.\n\nShould he decide to run, Cuban will also need to address what the future of his business empire would look like \u2014 something he said he has already considered.\n\n\"I have so many private business investments that it would be impossible to sell them,\" Cuban told Business Insider. \"I would put them in a blind trust but make it clear I would still be available on a limited basis for those companies. It wouldn't be fair to those companies if I just bailed on them.\n\n\"I would also be very transparent,\" he went on, seeming to take a jab at Trump, who has come under fire from ethics experts who have said Trump has not come close to fully complying with conflicts-of-interest laws and severing his business interests. \"Truly transparent about what I was doing. And yes, I would make my returns available.\"\n\nSullivan said the next step would be to \"get the media's attention that you're a serious candidate.\" He suggested Cuban start traveling to states like Iowa to hint he may be serious about getting in the fray.\n\n\"The amount of attention he would draw by doing a Lincoln Dinner in Davenport, Iowa, would be huge,\" Sullivan said. \"Those are the kind of things he has to start with.\"\n\nSullivan added that Cuban should \"absolutely\" hire a team of political advisers to develop a long-term strategy for him if he is sincerely interested in pursuing the White House.\n\nRelated: Mark Cuban: 6 Tips for the Powerball Winner\n\nCuban, Sullivan said, should also \"start at the top\" and find someone, preferably with experience, who could manage his campaign. From there, he could consult that person to make other hires.\n\n\"You reach out to people who've done it before,\" Sullivan said. \"I mean, he shouldn't be out there worrying about hiring \u2014 I'm going to hire a press person here or a TV guy here or a policy guy here. He needs to hire someone to help create the entire campaign.\"\n\nThe core team would also have to come up with a plan for victory. At this stage, Sullivan said it isn't clear whether Cuban would be better off running as an independent or a Democrat.\n\nCuban is not registered with a political party, and he would have to commission additional polls to gather data to see what his best route would be at this early stage.\n\n\"Plus, it is so early in the Trump administration. You can start laying the groundwork on things you need to do, but it doesn't necessarily mean you need to make some clear decisions,\" Sullivan said. \"You go into a more preliminary mode now, where you just put yourself in a position to succeed and then make commitments for closer in on how you're going to run.\"\n\nCuban seems content dishing out his takes on cable news and Twitter. But this isn't a long-term model for someone who's going to have to go a more traditional route, Sullivan said.\n\n\"Smart tactics are not necessarily smart strategy,\" he added.\n\nReed Galen, deputy campaign manager for Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's 2006 reelection bid, told Business Insider that Cuban is going to have to figure out how much of his own money he wants to spend, which he suggested might need to be upwards of $500 million if he decides to run an independent presidential bid.\n\n\"He won't have the party apparatus helping raise money,\" said Galen, now the owner of Jedburghs, a political consultancy firm. \"There would be people from both parties who would likely work for him. But the traditional networks that raise money for these people are at least initially out of bounds or unavailable. So how much of his own money is he willing to spend?\"\n\nGalen said Cuban needs to hire experts who have good political instincts and experience, can convince Cuban against pursuing a bad idea, and who understand that Cuban's campaign will have to be \"unique to his style.\"\n\nIt's also a matter of figuring out who Cuban's base would be and where he would compete on the map. As an independent, he would need to run essentially a 50-state campaign, depending on his endgame. As a Democrat, the map would look slightly different. Ballot access would also be a huge question, and Galen said starting early on that would be essential to an independent bid.\n\n\"Who is the base for a candidate like Mark Cuban?\" Galen asked. \"A lot of research and a lot of work needs to go into that, because you've got to figure out who you've got to go talk to.\"\n\nRelated: Mark Cuban: The Lesson Investors Can Learn From China\n\n\"What's the goal? Is the goal to get to 270? Or is the goal to get to a draw between the two major parties and an independent candidate and throw it to Congress? And what does that look like?\"\n\nGalen said that the states Cuban should most closely look to include Texas, where the strategist said he would likely have some home-state advantage, as well as some of the states where the past two presidential races were closely fought. Places like Pennsylvania, Colorado, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Florida should be key targets.\n\nIn states like those, Galen said Cuban could find himself carving out \"30% in the middle,\" possibly enough to win in a plurality.\n\nCuban also needs to figure out exactly what his message is to \"invigorate and bring together a very divided and ... nervous country,\" Galen said.\n\n\"How is he going to bring a very tribalistic political society?\" he asked. \"Republicans and Democrats. How're you going to start to peel off those people who have decided that the two-party system doesn't work anymore and are willing to take an independent as a legitimate choice.\"\n\nGalen did acknowledge that Cuban \"would be a fascinating addition to the presidential contenders list.\" He also provided Cuban with advice on what the absolutely first thing he should do is.\n\n\"What I'd have him do is read 'What It Takes' from Richard Ben Cramer,\" Galen said, referring to a book on the 1988 presidential election. \"Because there is not going to be any better opus on what it means to run for president than that book.\n\n\"Short of doing it, of course.\"\n\n'He thinks 10 moves ahead'\n\nThe idea that a Cuban candidacy is being chatted about among the political class is stunning to his lifelong friends.\n\nThen again, so was the fact he became such a prominent surrogate for Clinton and inserted himself right in the middle of the heated 2016 discussion.\n\n\"It's hard to believe,\" said Todd Reidbord, the president of Pittsburgh-based Walnut Capital, who has been a close friend of Cuban's since the two grew up together in Mt. Lebanon, a prominent Pittsburgh suburb. \"The whole thing is like a dream ... None of us could've ever predicted that. But that's Mark.\"\n\nReidbord described his friend as \"unpredictable\" and explained how he was \"totally\" shocked when Cuban was blasting Trump as a top Clinton surrogate, elevating himself in the political world in the process. When Cuban stumped for the Democratic presidential nominee in Pittsburgh, Reidbord was there to see it firsthand.\n\nIt would be surprising to Reidbord if Cuban decided to take that extra step and seek the presidency. But at this point, nothing really surprises Reidbord about his old pal anymore.\n\n\"Every time I've ever tried to guess what he's going to do next,\" he said, \"I've never guessed right.\"\n\nStu Chaban, another longtime friend of Cuban from Mt. Lebanon, said he's confident the billionaire won't be shy about seeking the White House if it's something he genuinely desires.\n\n\"If it's the right thing for him and what he wants, he'll do it,\" Chaban said.\n\nIn a sense, Chaban said it's going to come down to one thing: timing.\n\nRegardless, those who know him best expect that he's calculating his next moves.\n\n\"Mark is a chess player,\" Reidbord said. \"He thinks 10 moves ahead. I'm not sure that Trump is thinking 10 moves ahead. Mark certainly is.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in Business Insider.

Buoyed by how the debate cemented a federal role in the health care system \u2014 it was untenable for Republicans to simply repeal Obamacare and return to the Bush-era status quo of health care as a privilege for the wealthy \u2014 they\u2019re moving quickly to offer an actual alternative, a Medicare-for-all single payer system.\n\nBernie Sanders, who championed such a system throughout his presidential run, is going to introduce a bill, and this time he will have far more co-sponsors in the Senate than previous efforts. Elizabeth Warren voiced support for single payer at a town hall last week, and so did Rhode Island\u2019s senators over the weekend. The deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee, Keith Ellison, is a Medicare for All co-sponsor, along with 72 House members. And numerous progressive organizations are on board with the push.\n\nRelated: 4 Political Minefields Waiting for Trump Following His Health Care Failure\n\nIn less realistic moments, some have wondered whether Donald Trump and his ideologically un-rooted supporters would come aboard the single payer train. While Trump has offhandedly promised universal coverage, you would go broke waiting for him to fulfill that. It makes no sense to expect Republicans who failed to repeal the current system because of fealty to free-market ideals to now turn over one-sixth of the economy to the government. It\u2019s far more likely that Trump will burn down the current system to force through bad ideas like selling deregulated insurance across state lines, shifting costs to patients and adding work requirements to Medicaid.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make building support for single payer a useless exercise. In fact, it makes it more urgent, even responsible. Democrats have had a hard time the past several election cycles giving voters a specific reason to put them in charge again. As the minority party, this shouldn\u2019t be difficult. You come up with a roster of ideas and paint an alternative vision of how the country could conduct its affairs.\n\nMedicare for All has the benefit of being really easy to understand, leveraging an existing program that is reasonably popular. You can explain the underlying logic as well. The health system in America has devolved into a multi-sided market of competing monopolies seeking negotiating advantage. But you cannot get bigger than everyone. The government has a unique opportunity to clarify the system and use its bargaining power to give everyone the right to health care \u2014 at a more affordable cost.\n\nRelated: Can Trump and Dems Find Common Ground on Health Care?\n\nDefining principles directly and challenging the opposition in a war of ideas is simply how politics should work. It gives grassroots supporters confidence that their elected leaders share a vision for the future rather than just a discardable ideology of opposition. Republicans will call it a government takeover, and Democrats will call the GOP\u2019s ideas heartless abandonment or cruel bankrupting of the sick. Let\u2019s see who wins.\n\nThe problem has been that Democrats have made governing promises when out of power in the past only to abandon them when in a position to achieve them. The Employee Free Choice Act, which sought to protect workers\u2019 right to unionize and was organized labor\u2019s biggest priority, had the support of nearly every Democrat before Barack Obama; when Democrats could actually make it happen that support vanished. This breeds cynicism among the base, and if Democrats try the same thing with single payer the backlash will be even worse. That\u2019s also true of savvy pronouncements to support single payer as an \u201copening bid\u201d in a negotiation. Die-hard supporters don\u2019t want to see their dream elevated expressly to be traded away.\n\nIt should also be understood that single payer is the easiest to explain of a host of similar measures that can bring sanity to health care markets. For example, in California, where the state legislature is pushing a single payer bill, gubernatorial candidate Gavin Newsom has vowed to campaign on a universal health care program \u2014 not just insurance \u2014 that has echoes of both managed care and the socialized medicine of Britain\u2019s National Health Service. It\u2019s modeled on a program called Healthy San Francisco that allows anyone, regardless of insurance or immigration status, to visit a community health center or public hospital as a \u201cmedical home\u201d for primary and preventive care. These providers are publicly funded, mostly through an employer mandate; you can say that the health care professionals at the providers are public employees.\n\nRelated: Failure to Pass the GOP Health Care Bill Could Doom Tax Reform This Year\n\nUsing medical homes, which can lower costs by ensuring early detection of problems before they get out of hand, as a baseline of universal coverage that can be topped off with a private system is similar to the way health care works in France.\n\nAnother idea would maintain a private health care industry while achieving most of the goals of single payer. That is known as all payer rate setting, and it\u2019s what Martin O\u2019Malley \u2014 remember him? \u2014 ran on in his presidential campaign. It got no traction, but the basic idea is that the government sets a distinct price for every medical procedure. Insurance companies no longer bargain with providers; they effectively band together to use their power to get the lowest possible rate.\n\nThis is actually how health care works in Maryland, in addition to Germany and Switzerland. Under O\u2019Malley, Maryland instituted a global budget for hospitals, to reduce readmission rates and over-utilization of treatment as a way for health care providers to maximize profits. Insurance companies and hospitals actually like the certainty that comes with this system, despite the government intervention to set prices. It also attacks the tremendous billing waste in the system.\n\nPlus, the pharmaceutical supply chain, which features unnecessary profit-taking by middlemen at nearly every stage, needs a major overhaul. Trump has discussed \u201ccompetitive bidding\u201d in Medicare with the Congressional Black Caucus. That\u2019s actually too narrow. The oligopolist drug wholesalers and pharmacy benefit managers need to be broken up, and the markets made completely transparent on who pays what, or you\u2019re not going to drive down costs for consumers.\n\nRelated: Pfizer Chief Says Government Efforts to Contain Drug Prices Will Backfire\n\nI didn\u2019t mention lowering the Medicare eligibility age incrementally, or letting Americans buy into Medicare at cost, or even a public option to compete with private insurance. There are lots of ways to get to what a single payer system offers \u2014 a coherent market for health care that more affordably covers everyone than our current Rube Goldberg contraption. Standing on principles of true universal coverage is important and heartening. Whether it\u2019s called single payer or just something that is consistent with those principles shouldn\u2019t be a deal-breaker. But if Democrats think they can just talk up single payer to obtain power and then shuffle it off, they\u2019re playing with fire."}, {"date": "2017/03/27", "title": "Trump Wants to Overhaul an Understaffed Government Desperate for Leadership", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/27/Trump-Wants-Overhaul-Understaffed-Government-Desperate-Leadership", "text": "On Monday, the Trump administration will announce the launch of a new team within the White House dedicated to a massive overhaul of the federal bureaucracy, using ideas from the private sector to improve the efficiency of the government\u2019s operations. The Washington Post, which broke the story, reported the White House Office of American Innovation will be run by President Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to the president whose crowded portfolio also includes managing relations with China, negotiating Middle East peace, and more.\n\nThe administration sees the new office as a sort of \u201cSWAT team\u201d with broad license to restructure the federal bureaucracy, according to The Post. In a statement to the paper, the president said, \u201cAll Americans, regardless of their political views, can recognize that government stagnation has hindered our ability to properly function, often creating widespread congestion and leading to cost overruns and delays.

However, some of that is the fault of the new administration itself, which has fallen far behind in the task of appointing senior officials to the top ranks of federal agencies.\n\nAt the Justice Department, lawyers charged with enforcing existing criminal statutes have been told that in certain areas of law, previous guidance from the Obama administration is no longer operative. However, they complain that they can\u2019t get clarity from the administration on new instructions and that, in many cases, they have nobody to ask.\n\nThe top ranks of the State Department are likewise notably empty of people who can credibly claim to speak for the new administration. At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary James Mattis has on more than one occasion reportedly appeared in the offices of mid-level subject matter experts seeking to be briefed on topics that would normally be the responsibility of under-secretaries several steps down the organizational chart.\n\nThe Partnership for Public Service claims there are about 1,200 positions in the federal government that require a presidential appointee to be confirmed by the Senate. The Partnership calculates that 553 of those positions are \u201ckey\u201d to having an executive branch that can function at a basic level.\n\nRelated: Campaign Issues Dominate, But Who\u2019s Ready to Govern?\n\nAs of today, Trump has nominated 61 people to those key jobs, or about 11 percent of the openings. As a result of Senate Democrats\u2019 resistance, the failure of nominees to make timely disclosures to the Office of Government Ethics, and the decisions of several nominees to withdraw from consideration, only 20 people have been confirmed.\n\nAt this stage, multiple executive branch departments have had no top-level political appointees named at all beyond the cabinet secretaries.\n\nAt the State Department, Secretary Rex Tillerson has no permanent deputy, assistant secretaries or undersecretaries. At Defense, Mattis is likewise without any top-level aides, though in his case some were finally nominated earlier this month. (On the downside, prospective secretaries of the Army and the Navy have both withdrawn as candidates.)\n\nThe story is the same at multiple other agencies. The Departments of Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, Veterans Affairs, Interior, all have no senior level nominees below the secretaries.

But the Trump administration is lagging far behind even its immediate predecessor in sending names to the Senate for confirmation.\n\nSenior figures in the administration, particularly White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, have trumpeted their plans to \u201cdeconstruct\u201d much of the federal bureaucracy, and perhaps the apparent reluctance to fill top positions reflects a desire to slim the ranks of the top level federal workforce.\n\nBut it also means that when Kushner\u2019s team parachutes into a federal agency looking for dysfunction and paralysis, one of its first orders of business will be trying to discern how much of it is of this administration\u2019s own making."}, {"date": "2017/03/27", "title": "Pfizer Chief Says Government Efforts to Contain Drug Prices Will Backfire", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/27/Pfizer-Chief-Says-Government-Efforts-Contain-Drug-Prices-Will-Backfire", "text": "Pfizer Inc., the world\u2019s largest drug manufacturer, is no stranger to the growing controversy over price gouging and anti-competitive practices that have drawn sharp criticism from President Trump and prompted calls for government intervention.\n\nLast December, for example, Pfizer and Flynn Pharma Ltd. were hit with record fines totaling more than $110 million in Great Britain after they were found to have conspired to increase prices by as much as 2,600 percent for unbranded versions of the anti-epilepsy drug Epanutin.\n\nRelated: How Big Pharma Lobbyists Keep Medicare Drug Prices High\n\nThe stunning price increases were quietly imposed five years ago after Pfizer transferred distribution rights to Flynn, which sold the medicine by its generic name, phenytoin sodium, according to a report by Bloomberg.\n\nFor a drug manufacturing behemoth like Pfizer with annual revenues of $52.8 billion, a hundred-million-dollar fine is little more than a rounding error and a small cost of doing business.\n\nIan C.

The reality is that these types of cuts won\u2019t come anywhere close to covering budgetary cost of the tax cuts they have planned, and the hope that tax cuts will increase economic growth and hence tax revenue is undercut by the failure of tax cuts to stimulate economic growth during the Bush and Reagan administrations.\n\nThat will leave Republicans with two choices (assuming that health care reform is dead, as it appears to be). They can allow the national debt to expand substantially, by trillions if they make good on their tax cut promises, or they can cut entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. They could also give up on the tax cuts, but that\u2019s not going to happen.\n\nBut as Republicans in Congress contemplate trying to finance tax cuts for the wealthy with cuts to programs such as Social Security, they should realize that many of the same market failures that made health care reform so difficult also plague social insurance programs more generally. There\u2019s a reason why government got involved in these markets in the first place.\n\nConsider the individual mandate, a feature of Obamacare that Republicans have targeted for criticism. Social Security also has a mandate \u2013 if you report income to the government you have no choice but to pay Social Security taxes\u2014and the program wouldn\u2019t work without it.\n\nRelated: Blind Trust in Donald Trump Could Be Costly\n\nWhen people are left on their own to save for retirement, many people, despite the nagging feeling that they ought to be putting money away for the future, fail to do so. Immediate needs are more important.

Our social conscious will not allow that. However, the costs of giving people the basic necessities of life will be borne by society at large.

Even if their contributions don\u2019t fully cover their retirement needs, isn\u2019t it better if they cover at least some of the costs? That\u2019s what the mandate does. It ensures that a fraction of every paycheck is put away for the future.\n\nSome people will save for retirement, but there are considerable uncertainties. Do I need to save enough to live into my 90\u2019s, or will less savings be enough? This type of uncertainty seems to be easily overcome by insurance markets. People contribute to a retirement fund, and those who are unlucky and have lifespans that are shorter than average fund those who are lucky enough to live longer. Smoothing these kinds of risks (in this case against running out of money in old age) is what insurance markets are supposed to do.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem. Retirement insurance is a bad deal for people who have family histories or other reasons to believe that will not realize a typical lifespan (the average lifespan determines insurance premiums they would pay). If a large number of people who do not expect to realize an average lifespan drop out choosing instead to save on their own \u2013 they don\u2019t think they will need to save as much as insurance asks them to pay \u2013 premiums will have to rise since the insurance pool will be made up of people who are likely to live longer than average.\n\nRelated: When It Comes to Trumponomics, Economists Are on High Alert\n\nBut as premiums rise, more people conclude it\u2019s a bad deal and drop out, premiums rise again causing even more people to drop out, and as this continues the market will eventually collapse leaving people no choice but to save for retirement on their own. But, for the reasons given above, leaving people to save for retirement on their own doesn\u2019t work. The only way to solve this problem is a mandate for everyone to contribute to a retirement fund, and that requires government to intervene in these markets.\n\nAs Republicans try to find a way to implement their tax cut plans without exploding the national debt, they will face the same problem they faced with health care. The only way to fund the tax cuts is to cut programs millions of people depend upon, programs that only government can provide. Cutting either Social Security or Medicare would have severe political repercussions.\n\nLarge tax cuts for the wealthy without a significantly increasing the debt is an impossible task."}, {"date": "2017/03/27", "title": "Can Trump and Dems Find Common Ground on Health Care?", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/27/Can-Trump-and-Dems-Find-Common-Ground-Health-Care", "text": "President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) now acknowledge that the Affordable Care Act will remain the law of the land for the foreseeable future, following last week\u2019s debacle in which they were forced to pull the Republicans\u2019 repeal and replacement plan before it was put to a vote in the House.\n\nThey argued for months that Obamacare was in a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d and would eventually collapse of its own weight, but that alone wasn\u2019t a compelling enough argument to rally Republican lawmakers in the House and Senate behind the Republican\u2019s alternative approach. Moreover, analyses by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) showed that Obamacare wasn\u2019t in dire financial straits and that 24 million Americans would lose health care coverage by 2026, including 14 million by choice.\n\nRelated: 4 Political Minefields Waiting for Trump Following His Health Care Failure\n\nNow, in the wake of last Friday\u2019s GOP legislative train wreck, the Trump Administration and Republican congressional leaders are facing a critical choice: Should they continue to pursue a destructive and seemingly vindictive course to further undermine Obamacare in hopes of fulfilling their gloomy prophecy? Or should they join with Democrats and more moderate Republicans in seeking ways to fix the worst problems of a program that has insured more than 20 million Americans?\n\nOver the weekend, the Trump camp and some congressional Democrats signaled that some sort of political rapprochement over health care was not out of the realm of possibility after months of bitter conflict in which the Democrats stood united against any GOP plan. All sides agree that something needs to be done to strengthen the financial position of insurers, beef up competition, and slow the rate of growth of premiums and out of pocket costs. But if history is any indication of what to expect, the chances of a bipartisan agreement to strengthen the existing program seem unlikely at best.\n\nDuring their separate press conferences Friday to try to explain why they failed to pass the GOP American Health Care Act, Trump and Ryan both seemed to be rooting for Obamacare to fail, notwithstanding the adverse effect that would have on millions of Americans who receive subsidized private insurance or expanded Medicaid through the program.\n\n\u201cI hope it does well; I would love it to do well. But it can\u2019t do well; it\u2019s imploding and soon will explode, and it\u2019s not going to be pretty,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump voiced interest in working with Democrats, but only after they came to the realization that Obamacare was a failure. Ryan told reporters at the Capitol that Obamacare is \u201cso fundamentally flawed\u201d that he didn\u2019t know whether it was even possible to prop it up.\n\nOn Sunday, however, the administration and congressional Democrats signaled that there might be room for bipartisanship to address some of Obamacare\u2019s more glaring problems. The growing exodus of major insurers like Aetna, United Healthcare and Blue Cross-Blue Shield from the Obamacare market has many policymakers in both parties spooked.\n\nRelated: In Defeat, Trump and Ryan Offer No Path Forward on Health Care\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said on ABC News\u2019This Week that he could foresee room for negotiations going forward, provided Trump and the Republicans abandon their crusade to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThey ought to get rid of repeal \u2013 drop it \u2013 it\u2019s been a flop for them . . . and work with us to improve Obamacare,\u201d Schumer said.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Reince Priebus continued to insist that Obamacare is fundamentally flawed and \u201cis going south,\u201d during an appearance on Fox New Sunday. But he wouldn\u2019t rule out the possibility of a cooperative effort later this year to prop up the existing program, and said it was important that the Democrats ultimately \u201ccome to the table.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want people out there to understand this president is not going to be a partisan president,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cThis is a president that wants to make sure people don\u2019t get left behind; he wants to make sure there is competition in the marketplace so that rates are lower and people can choose their doctors.\u201d\n\nRelated: Budget Group Says Changes to AHCA Negate Half of Deficit Savings\n\n\u201cSo if those three things are incompatible with some members of the Republican House, then we need to work with moderate Democrats to make sure that that happens,\u201d he added.\n\nJoseph Antos, a health care expert with the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said that a more cooperative effort is not out of the question if both sides find a way to tone down their partisanship and accept the fact that Obamacare is here to stay. \u201cAbsolutely, there are a lot of fixes that could and should be made,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that would be a tall order politically and begs the question of how the White House and Democrats could strike a compromise on health care over the almost certain objections of members of the House Freedom Caucus and other conservatives who are still clamoring for the complete repeal of Obamacare.\n\nIf the past is prologue then the Trump administration and the Republicans in Congress will probably double down in trying to crush Obamacare with many techniques that already have been road-tested by the Republicans over the past several years and since Trump took office Jan. 20.\n\nRelated: The GOP\u2019s Charge of the Obamacare-Lite Brigade\n\nThose tactics include reducing advertising and recruitment activities, weakening the enforcement of the ACA\u2019s \u201cindividual mandate\u201d requiring people to obtain coverage, cutting federal spending to underwrite unforeseen losses by insurers, and sharing in the out-of-pocket costs of low-income policyholders.\n\nObamacare managed to survive two major court challenges that reached the Supreme Court and scores of Republican efforts on Capitol Hill to defund and dismantle the program over the years. Yet, GOP lawmakers led by Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida were instrumental in the closing of many of the 23 non-profit insurance plans under the ACA in 2015 and 2016 by blocking federal assistance to many of the coops that had incurred heavy operating losses.\n\nHouse Republicans also went to court to block Obamacare cost-sharing subsidies for lower-and-middle-income people arguing they were unlawful because they hadn\u2019t been specifically authorized by Congress. The Obama administration challenged an adverse federal court ruling in May 2016 that has put the subsidies on hold, but the new Trump administration might allow House Republicans to prevail in killing the subsidies.\n\nRelated: Has Trump Overplayed a Losing Hand in His First Legislative Test?\n\nShortly after taking office in late January, Trump signed an executive order designed to undercut the Affordable Care Act by instructing the Department of Health and Human Services and other agencies responsible for administering the program to find ways to ease the burden of the law on individuals and businesses. The Internal Revenue Service responded in early February by weakening the health care law\u2019s requirement that individuals either acquire health insurance or pay a tax penalty to the government.\n\nOver the coming weeks and months, the White House and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price \u2013 an arch foe of Obamacare -- will be faced with a number of choices over \u201cwhether to shore up insurance marketplaces created under the Affordable Care Act \u2013 or let them atrophy,\u201d The Washington Post reported over the weekend.\n\nFor 2917, the federal exchanges signed up or auto-renewed 9.2 million Americans, down by about 400,000 people from the previous year. That dip was due in part to the Trump administration\u2019s decision to curtail recruitment efforts in the final week of the enrollment season. Overall, an estimated 12 million people have enrolled in both federal and state-operated insurance markets this year, which typically drops when the first premium payment is due.\n\nInsurers and consumers are operating in an environment of uncertainty over the future of Obamacare, especially if Trump and Ryan take further measures to drive the program into the ground. That uncertainty could lead to another round of rising premium costs and diminished competition and policy choices heading into the 2018 insurance season.\n\nRelated: In Trump\u2019s New Health Care Reality Show, He Doesn\u2019t Control the Final Episode\n\nLarry Levitt, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, told The Post, \u201cThe administration could do everything from actively undermining the law to trying to reshape it to moving it in a more conservative direction.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/03/26", "title": "Chair of Freedom Caucus Open to Deficit-Expanding Tax Cuts", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/26/Chair-Freedom-Caucus-Open-Deficit-Expanding-Tax-Cuts", "text": "The House Freedom Caucus was so successful in opposing a version of the American Health Care Act that one of the bill\u2019s authors declared it \u201cdead\u201d and the White House signaled that it planned to walk away from the issue entirely.

But one possibility is that Meadows and other members of the Freedom Caucus are taking seriously Trump\u2019s threat on Friday to begin working with Democrats and less doctrinaire Republicans on an alternative effort to reform the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRelated: In Defeat, Trump and Ryan Offer No Path Forward on Health Care\n\nThe strength of the Freedom Caucus lies in its ability to block the Republican House majority from passing bills on party-line votes if its members deem them insufficiently conservative. But in a world where the Republican majority makes common cause with a significant number of moderate Democrats on compromise legislation that gives both groups some of what they want, the Freedom Caucus would be effectively marginalized.\n\nTo be sure, there is no obvious path to bipartisanship in a Congress that is as ideologically divided as it has ever been. But Trump\u2019s professed willingness to work with Democrats, and the fact that he really seems to hold few firm conservative principles, might be making Meadows and some of his caucus members nervous.\n\nIn fact, in an appearance on Fox News Sunday, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus suggested that was exactly the point of Trump\u2019s talk of bipartisanship.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s more or less a warning shot that we\u2019re ready to talk to anyone, that we always have been, and I think more so now than ever it\u2019s time for both parties to come together and get to real reforms in this country, whether it be taxes; whether it be health care; whether it be immigration; whether it be infrastructure. This president is ready to lead.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why the Senate Would Be an Even Higher Hurdle for the GOP Health Plan\n\nPriebus hammered the message home on Sunday morning, telling host Chris Wallace multiple times that the White House is interested in working with moderate Democrats.\n\nMuch of the criticism of the Freedom Caucus, especially from their fellow Republicans frustrated with the obstruction of the AHCA, focused on what many described as an unwillingness to \u201ctake \u2018yes\u2019 for an answer.\u201d The group wrung major concessions out of House leaders and the White House, but because they didn\u2019t get everything they wanted, they refused to go along with the bill in the end.\n\nOn Sunday, Meadows seemed to signal that the ideological rigidity of the Freedom Caucus may not be such an impediment to other Trump priorities, such as reform of the tax code.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of the Freedom Caucus is its members' insistence that they are \u201cfiscal conservatives.\u201d To most people, fiscal conservatism typically means opposition to deficit spending and a determination to reduce the national debt. Indeed, the Freedom Caucus has typically been one of the toughest nuts for Republican leaders to crack when it comes to raising the debt ceiling.\n\nRelated: Trump Takes His Brash, Bare-Knuckle Negotiating Style to Capitol Hill\n\nMeadows said that he expects his members will \u201chelp\u201d the president on tax reform and that when it comes to funding the government, \u201cthere\u2019s not going to be an issue there.\u201d\n\nSurprisingly, Meadows said that he personally would be open to reform that cuts taxes for Americans but doesn\u2019t include offsetting cuts in spending or increases in revenue designed to prevent the deficit and debt from rising.\n\n\u201cDoes it have to be fully offset? My personal response is no,\u201d Meadows said.\n\nHe suggested that feeling may be less rare within the Freedom Caucus than many expect. \u201cI think there\u2019s been a lot of flexibility in terms of some of my contacts and conservatives in terms of not making it totally offset and that\u2019s a move that we\u2019re trying to do to provide real relief and economic growth.\u201d\n\nThat would again pit Meadows against Ryan, who typically insists that tax reform packages be at least revenue neutral, but the show of flexibility might be more welcome to Trump, who frequently appears to be more concerned with being perceived as a \u201cwinner\u201d than he does with ideological or policy purity."}, {"date": "2017/03/26", "title": "4 Political Minefields Waiting for Trump Following His Health Care Failure ", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/26/4-Political-Minefields-Waiting-Trump-Following-His-Health-Care-Failure", "text": "Hours before President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan were forced to throw in the towel and withdraw their plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was telling a Washington audience that overhauling the federal tax code will be a lot easier than trying to rewrite federal health care law.\n\n\u201cHealth care and tax reforms are two very different things,\u201d Mnuchin told a breakfast gathering sponsored by Axios. \u201cHealth care is a very, very complicated issue.

Some political analysts say that the collapse of the Republicans\u2019 American Health Care Act was emblematic of a glaring ideological cleavage within the House Republican caucus and between House and Senate Republicans more generally that will make future deal-making equally challenging.\n\nIn fact, the failure of the GOP health care plan could signal trouble ahead on a whole range of fiscal issues, from Trump\u2019s and Ryan\u2019s effort to rewrite the tax code for the first time since 1986 to passing new spending plans for this year and next and raising the debt ceiling by early fall to avert a first-ever default on U.S. debt.\n\nRelated: The GOP\u2019s Charge of the Obamacare-Lite Brigade\n\nHere are just four of Trump\u2019s biggest fiscal challenges:\n\nTax Reform. Mnuchin\u2019s optimism aside, there is literally nothing easy about rewriting the tax code. It hasn\u2019t been done since 1986, and that\u2019s because once a serious effort to do so begins, the army of special interest groups and lobbyists that will assemble to protect cherished tax breaks and angle for other special treatment will make the battle to repeal the ACA look like a minor skirmish.\n\nTrump has done himself no favors here, with his repeated promise to impose tariffs on goods imported from countries whose trade policies he doesn\u2019t like. Nor has Ryan, by floating the idea of a Border Adjustable tax that would effectively favor some U.S. businesses over others, depending on whether they import things like raw materials or inventory. Both proposals have preemptively agitated constituencies who they will need to partner with on any tax reform effort.\n\nThere\u2019s also the problem of basic math. Trump and Ryan are very interested in cutting taxes, but are far less clear about how -- and from whom -- the lost revenue would be made up.\n\nThe last president who managed to shepherd tax reform through Congress was Ronald Reagan, and he began the effort fresh off a landslide reelection victory and after four years of building relationships with Congressional leader. Trump is a few months off an election in which he lost the popular vote. And despite his habit of touting his shrewd negotiating skills, Trump appeared at times inept and clueless in dealing with just his own party as he attempted to broker a deal on health care reform.\n\nRelated: Has Trump Overplayed a Losing Hand in His First Legislative Test?\n\nSpending Controversies. Trump is pushing for a $54 billion increase in defense spending next year, much of it coming at the expense of scores of government agencies and programs. He\u2019s also promising to find a way to create a $1 trillion infrastructure program fueled by tax breaks. And he wants to do all this while passing tax cuts.\n\nTrump may have got his first lesson in Congressional assertiveness in the defeat of his health care bill, but when he submits a detailed new budget, fleshing out the \u201cskinny\u201d budget released last week, he\u2019s likely to get another.\n\nSenior members of Congress -- including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell -- already are bridling at his initial budget proposal calling for steep cuts in many departments and agencies, including EPA, State Department/USAID and NIH.\n\nAs those cuts start to look more real, and translate into the expectation of the loss of solid government jobs in Congressional districts across the country as well as cuts in federal services, the Trump administration will have another very difficult sales job on its hands.\n\nRelated: In Trump\u2019s New Health Care Reality Show, He Doesn\u2019t Control the Final Episode\n\nThe Border Wall. Even more than his vow to repeal Obamacare, Trump campaigned on the promise to erect a wall between the U.S. and Mexico to keep out undocumented immigrants. Now, with that project facing a sticker price that could top $25 billion, Trump is going to have to find a way to shoehorn that appropriation into Congressional spending bills as well.\n\nAnd while the wall plays very well in some places far from the actual border, it is surprisingly unpopular among many people who actually live near where the proposed barrier would be installed. That price tag is going to look a lot more forbidding when people point out that it could fund other things -- like the Corporation for Public Broadcasting or the State Department\u2019s public diplomacy efforts -- for decades.\n\nThe Debt Ceiling. This is the big one. The clock is already ticking on the next legislative push to increase the Treasury\u2019s borrowing limit, ensuring the country does not go into default. The agency is actually up against it already, but its well-worn arsenal of \u201cextraordinary\u201d measures will give Congress until the fall to act.\n\nThe reason this is a particularly dicey situation for Trump is that his main adversaries within the Republican conference are going to be the same people emboldened by their ability to derail his health care bill: the House Freedom Caucus and their allies in the Senate.\n\nRelated: Trump Prepares His Health Care Plan B\n\nThe debt ceiling is a b\u00eate noire of the most conservative members of Congress, many of whom expressed a willingness to let the country default rather than increase the level of the Treasury\u2019s debt. Now secure in the knowledge that they were able to face down Trump on the issue of health care, they may well be emboldened to buck the president and Congressional leadership even more aggressively.\n\nRyan recently raised the possibility that the tax-cut package would also be used as the vehicle for raising the debt ceiling to avoid a first-ever default on the U.S. debt this fall. Tying two such fraught pieces of legislation together would likely exponentially increase the leverage of the Freedom Caucus to demand changes to their liking.\n\nAll this adds up to a very difficult road forward for Trump and Ryan, particularly when it comes to legislation vital to the country\u2019s fiscal health. They had been counting on momentum from a successful repeal of Obamacare to drive their agenda forward, but now that the GOP health care bill has gone down to defeat -- despite Republican majorities in the House and Senate and a Republican president -- their ability to find their way is in question.\n\nAnd Trump himself, with his ever-changing explanations of what\u2019s happening, isn\u2019t inspiring confidence.\n\n\u201cJust in the last 24 hours he has said that tax cuts and reform will be near impossible without repeal of Obamacare and now he is saying he should have begun with taxes,\u201d Zogby said in an email on Friday. \u201cAt some point he is going to have to win something.

The plan would also freeze and roll back expanded Medicaid coverage for the poor under the Affordable Care Act and would overhaul how states funnel Medicaid funding to the states.\n\nIn an effort to gain additional support from conservatives, House leaders have proposed a number of late-inning amendments, including a work requirement for able-bodied adults receiving Medicaid and a measure repealing Obamacare\u2019s requirement that insurers cover 10 \u201cessential\u201d medical services.\n\nRelated: In Trump\u2019s New Health Care Reality Show, He Doesn\u2019t Control the Final Episode\n\nBut the plan has come under withering fire in the Senate from all sides.\n\nStaunch conservatives -- including Sens.

The analysis released on Thursday also reaffirms an earlier finding that premiums on average would be 15 percent to 20 percent higher in 2018 and 2019 under the plan, before beginning to drop.\n\nHowever, the report provides an incomplete picture because the CBO didn\u2019t have time to include a number of last-minute deals struck by Trump and Ryan to try to win passage in the House, including some that might further reduce the number of Americans with coverage down the road or add to the overall cost of the program.\n\nRelated: Trump and GOP Flailing as Obamacare Repeal Stumbles\n\nAccording to Politico, senior Senate Republicans are dubious that the House GOP plan could survive a test in the Senate \u2013 both because of the strong opposition within the party and parliamentary landmines that could blow up in the Republicans\u2019 face during the floor debate.\n\nRepublican senators have largely watched from afar as House Republicans engaged in internecine warfare over the health care replacement plan, while more quietly debating an issue with profound political implications heading into the 2018 mid-term elections.\n\nSenators from both sides of the aisle have complained that Ryan and Trump have been hasty in pushing for swift passage of a bill, with little understanding about the long-term effects it might have on the health care system. \u201cIt\u2019s more important to finally get health-care reform right than to get it fast,\u201d Cotton has said repeatedly.\n\nRelated: Costs, Coverage of Latest Health Bill Revision a Mystery as Vote Looms\n\nUnlike in the House, where the leadership can pretty much dictate the rules to be followed in debating legislation, the Senate is encumbered by scores of long-standing rules that can ensnare controversial legislation and open the flood gates to challenges.\n\nRepublican leaders chose a fiscal 2017 budget resolution as the principal vehicle for passing legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare because it would enable them to invoke special \u201creconciliation\u201d provisions in the Senate to circumvent a Democratic filibuster and pass the legislation with a simple majority. Without reconciliation, Republican leaders would have to amass a 60-vote super majority to pass the major legislation \u2013 an impossible task with the Democrats united against it.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Act of 1974 permits the use of reconciliation for budgetary and fiscal measures that impact the size of the deficit or surplus, as in the case of major tax bills or long-term budget agreements. However, the so-called \u201cByrd Rule,\u201d authored by the late West Virginia Democratic senator Robert Byrd, allows senators to object to elements of the legislation that either significantly increase the deficit over a ten-year period or are \u201cextraneous matters.\u201d\n\nThose extraneous matters can include such things as measures that do not result in a change in spending or revenues that only incidentally impact outlays and revenues or that are deemed outside the jurisdiction of the budget committees. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and other Democrats have vowed to invoke the Byrd Rule to challenge some of the last-minute add-ons to the House bill that were aimed at placating conservatives.\n\nA likely prime target for the Democrats would be the amendment negotiated by President Trump that would end the insurance mandates in the Affordable Care Act that require that requires health care plans sold to individuals cover 10 essential services, including maternity care, mental health and addiction treatment, prescription drugs and preventative care.\n\nOther likely targets for challenge include a proposed ban on federal funding for Planned Parenthood and a work requirement for many able-bodied adults receiving Medicaid coverage for the poor.

The alternative will find House Speaker Paul Ryan under the wheels of the metaphorical bus.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump, the self-proclaimed master negotiator, sent his budget director to Capitol Hill to announce that the president was finished negotiating with members of the House Freedom Caucus, the bill\u2019s primary opponents within the GOP, and demanded a vote.

Indeed, even the bill\u2019s chief opponent, Freedom Caucus chair Rep. Mark Meadows, has praised Trump for going to great lengths to engage lawmakers on the details of the bill.\n\nBut privately and in anonymous comments to the press, the administration is plainly also preparing a strategy to deflect blame if the bill fails.

Asked if he thought Ryan should resign if the legislation fails, he said no.\n\nHowever, at almost the same time, anonymous White House officials were telling reporters that if the bill goes down to defeat, the fault would be Ryan\u2019s.

He supposedly now wishes that he had focused his initial efforts instead on tax reform or creating a plan for new infrastructure spending.\n\nOn Friday morning, New York Magazine published a story claiming that Trump\u2019s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, dislikes the bill Ryan brought to the floor, complaining that it was \u201cwritten by the insurance industry\u201d and that it fails to undo enough of the regulations surrounding the provision of health insurance.\n\nBannon\u2019s former website, Breitbart News, which is seen as extremely friendly to Trump and is widely read by the far right, seized on the comments with a headline trumpeting \u201cBannon Pans Ryan Bill.\u201d\n\nIn truth, the effort to lay the blame for the bill on Ryan has been going on since before Trump delivered his Thursday ultimatum.

But unlike\u201dThe Apprentice,\u201d the television program that defined his public persona throughout the decade before he entered politics, it\u2019s not Trump who will have the final say over who comes away a winner today.\n\nRelated: Trump and GOP Flailing as Obamacare Repeal Stumbles\n\nAs of early Friday morning, the House Rules Committee had convened in a necessary step before the bill can be brought to the floor of the House for debate and a vote. The meeting was contentious, with Democrats plainly unhappy about the shape of the legislation. Even House Ways and Means Committee Chair Kevin Brady of Texas admitted that it was unusual for the House to move to vote on a bill without an accounting of its costs and impacts from the Congressional Budget Office, which late amendments had made impossible.\n\nThe AHCA, which would repeal the Affordable Care Act, has zero Democratic support in the House of Representatives, meaning that Republicans need to find all the votes needed to pass it on their own side of the aisle. But as hard-core conservatives demanded more and more changes in exchange for their votes, Trump and House Republican leadership found themselves losing support from the party\u2019s less-doctrinaire members, who believed the bill had become too draconian in cutting funding and services to the most vulnerable.\n\nTrump, evidently frustrated with the process, sent his budget director, former House member Mick Mulvaney, to Capitol Hill on Thursday afternoon with a blunt message: The president was finished negotiating, and demanded that the House vote on Friday. If the bill fails, he added, Trump will abandon the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act and move on to his other legislative priorities, including tax reform and an infrastructure program.\n\nWhether moving on will be as easy as Trump seems to think is an open question. If this bill goes down, he will have suffered a major blow to his credibility as a leader -- particularly given his self-proclaimed mastery of the art of dealmaking.\n\nRelated: Has Trump Overplayed a Losing Hand in His First Legislative Test?\n\nBut the decision to force his adversaries\u2019 hand had the support of House Speaker Paul Ryan, who arguably has even more of his reputation riding on the AHCA. While the White House has no actual authority to compel a vote in the House of Representatives, Ryan was fully supportive of the gambit.\n\n\u201cFor seven and a half years, we have been promising the American people that we will repeal and replace this broken law because it\u2019s collapsing and it\u2019s failing families,\u201d he said after a meeting of House Republicans. \u201cAnd tomorrow we\u2019re proceeding.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the vote on the bill has been characterized by Trump and his surrogates as a sort of loyalty test. With virtually all Republicans in Congress having run on the promise to eliminate the ACA, they warn, failure to support AHCA will be seen as a betrayal that could cost them their seats in the next election. Not far below the surface is the suggestion that it is also a test of their loyalty to the first Republican president that many of them have ever served with.\n\nThe bill the House will proceed with underwent several last-minute changes meant to make it more attractive to wavering members.\n\nThe conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus, who represent the core of the opposition to the bill, had demanded, among other things, that the bill eliminate a suite of \u201cessential health benefits\u201d that all insurance plans sold on the ACA health insurance exchanges were required to include. Among them are mental health and addiction services, outpatient treatments, hospital stays, maternity and newborn care, and more.\n\nRelated: Costs, Coverage of Latest Health Bill Revision a Mystery as Vote Looms\n\nIn the end, they were offered a half-measure. A series of amendments to the bill pushed the responsibility for determining what benefits are \u201cessential\u201d was pushed down to the states, a change that would take effect in 2018.\n\nAs an offset, the changes dedicated more money to the Patient and State Stability Fund, a program meant to help ease the transition to the new system by providing financial assistance to individuals, incentives to insurers, and other measures. The amendments add $15 billion to the PSSF, all dedicated to maternity and newborn care and addiction and mental health services -- two of the essential health benefits that lawmakers worry would be most likely to be eliminated.\n\nThe proposal would pay for the change by retaining through 2023 a 0.9 percent additional Medicare tax on people earning more than $200,000 per year, or married couples earning more than $250,000. However, a key demand of the Freedom Caucus in early negotiations had been an accelerated repeal of Obamacare\u2019s taxes.\n\nAs of early Friday, it remained unclear whether or not the changes would be sufficient to bring along enough members of the Freedom Caucus or if the prospect of allowing states to slash essential health benefit requirements would drive Republicans at the other end of the conference\u2019s ideological spectrum away from the bill.\n\nRelated: Failure to Pass the GOP Health Care Bill Could Doom Tax Reform This Year\n\nThe legislation wasn\u2019t made any more attractive by a report from the Congressional Budget Office that came out late Thursday afternoon. The CBO report only dealt with the proposal as it had existed earlier in the week, and did not take the new amendments into account. However, it found that earlier amendments raised the cost of the bill without having any impact on the number of Americans with health insurance. The AHCA, CBO reported, would still result in 24 million fewer Americans with health coverage after a decade.\n\nThe fate of the bill in the House remained very much in question Friday morning, but even if Trump and Ryan are able to successfully call the bluff of the Freedom Caucus, the AHCA is facing an even tougher battle in the Senate.

The Kabul government is fractious, the Taliban plans to target provincial capitals in a spring offensive, and ISIS has expanded from its stronghold in the east of the country. Earlier this month it launched an attack against an Afghan military hospital in the capital.\n\nWhy is Russia suddenly so interested in Afghanistan? Its main concern is ISIS\u2019 presence in a tenuously governed nation not far from its southern border.

After the September 11, 2001, attacks, Vladimir Putin was the first world leader to telephone the Bush White House to offer assistance.

But that changed with the crisis in Ukraine\u2014another theater of U.S.\u2013Russian contention where the clock is still ticking.

Both supporters of the legislation and conservative Republicans demanding changes to it said they were confident it would ultimately pass, but how that would happen remained unclear at best.\n\nThe American Health Care Act was never going to get any Democratic votes in the House, so Republicans have always known that it would require them to hold together most of their own members in order to get to 216 votes, the current level needed for a majority. However, the need for near unanimity gave the House Freedom Caucus, a loose collection of the chamber\u2019s most conservative members, enormous leverage over the bill\u2019s final form.\n\nRelated: Has Trump Overplayed a Losing Hand in His First Legislative Test?\n\nThe Freedom Caucus spent the past week exercising that power, pressing House leadership and the Trump White House for concessions, such as accelerating the rollback of ACA-related taxes, changes to the rules for Medicaid eligibility, and the elimination of a requirement that insurance plans cover to \u201cessential\u201d health care treatments, including maternity care, mental health and addiction services, and more.\n\nBy Thursday afternoon, nobody was happy. The members of the Freedom Caucus were said to be pressing for still more concessions, particularly the elimination of ACA regulations on the insurance industry. Meanwhile, House leaders were facing defections from the other end of the party\u2019s spectrum, as less doctrinaire conservative members balked at the changes the Freedom Caucus was demanding.\n\nOn Thursday morning, there were estimated to be two dozen Republicans planning to vote against the bill. By the afternoon, despite a day of meetings, negotiations and deal-sweetening, that number had risen to around 30. GOP leaders can only afford to lose 21 votes.\n\nThe decision to postpone the vote appeared to catch the White House by surprise. Press Secretary Sean Spicer was insisting early Thursday afternoon that the vote would take place today. And President Trump, even after the postponement had been announced, appeared before cameras in advance of a meeting with representatives of the trucking industry and insisted that a vote was still taking place.\n\nRelated: The GOP\u2019s Charge of the Obamacare-Lite Brigade\n\nLater, a White House deputy press secretary tried to spin the delay as favorably as possible, insisting that the move was made only to avoid having to vote in the middle of the night. White House officials insisted that a vote would be held Friday morning.\n\nHowever, in an interview with CNN, House Majority leader Kevin McCarthy, who actually controls when the House votes, was less sanguine. He said the Republican conference would meet tonight and that the Rules Committee would pass a rule allowing a vote to take place tomorrow. But when asked if there would be a morning vote, he committed only to starting debate on the bill.\n\nThe contents of the bill itself remain something of a mystery. On Monday, amended versions of the original bill were made available, revealing some of the changes that were made. However, there have been marathon negotiations since then, and it remained unclear as of late Thursday what the final piece of legislation would actually look like.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, in a revised analysis of the AHCA that included the changes from earlier in the week, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office reported that the proposed revised plan would achieve even smaller deficit reduction over the coming decade than the original plan while doing little to address projected higher premiums and reduced coverage.\n\nAccording to the new CBO report, the revised House GOP plan would reduce federal deficits by $150 billion over the coming decade, or less than half the previously projected savings in the federal government. And the latest analysis continues to show a huge fall off in the number of Americans with health care coverage if Obamacare is replaced with this proposal. By 2026, an estimated 52 million people under the age of 65 would be uninsured under the House GOP approach.\n\nRelated: How Republicans Got Trapped by Their Health Care Promises\n\nThe drama on Capitol Hill comes amid growing public discontent about the AHCA.\n\nA new poll by Quinnipiac University found that only 17 percent of American voters approve of the House Republican plan, while 56 percent are against it and 26 percent are undecided. The poll found that nearly half of the voters interviewed said they would be less likely to vote for their House member or senator if he or she votes for the plan, while 19 percent said they would be more likely to support their representative in that case.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, are standing back and watching as the Republicans and the White House struggle to avert total disaster. Rep. Dan Kildee (D-MI) told MSNBC Thursday that Trump and House GOP leaders are spinning their wheels in trying to craft a compromise that could survive a House vote and unite the party.\n\n\u201cTheir problem is they have a very bad piece of legislation,\u201d Kildee said, adding that many rank and file Republicans are hearing from constituents who are afraid they will lose their coverage.\n\n\u201cThey are hearing loud and clear they don\u2019t want it,\u201d Kildee said.\n\nFormer Democratic governor of Pennsylvania Ed Rendell described the situation \u201cas a train wreck, and it\u2019s pretty hard to make it better.\u201d The biggest losers could be more moderate Republicans if they are forced to go along in trying to get the bill through the House."}, {"date": "2017/03/23", "title": "Why Your Web-Browsing History Could Soon Be for Sale", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/23/Why-Your-Web-Browsing-History-Could-Soon-Be-Sale", "text": "In a victory for internet service providers like Verizon, Comcast, and AT&T, the US Senate on Thursday voted to kill a set of Obama-era privacy regulations passed by the Federal Communication Commission in October.\n\nThe rules would have required ISPs to get explicit consent before sharing consumers\u2019 web browsing data and other personal info with advertisers.\n\nRelated: The Net Neutrality Debate Explained\n\nThe vote passed 50 to 48, with most Republicans in favor of the repeal and most Democrats against.\n\nThey were voting on a resolution proposed earlier this month by Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and co-sponsored by 24 other Republicans that broadly calls for the FCC\u2019s rules to \u201chave no force or effect.\u201d\n\nThe resolution was proposed via the Congressional Review Act (CRA), a seldom-used law that the GOP is more widely applying to repeal federal regulations they contested late in the Obama administration with a simple majority vote. Republicans have a majority in both chambers of Congress.\n\nThe resolution will now need to pass in the House of Representatives \u2014 where Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) proposed a similar resolution earlier this month \u2014 then be signed by President Donald Trump before going into effect.\n\nBecause the resolution uses the CRA, the FCC would be outlawed from creating similar privacy regulations if the repeal is passed.\n\nThe context\n\nThe FCC\u2019s privacy rules were passed in a party-line vote last October after months of contention between Democrats and Republicans at the agency.\n\nRelated: Outgoing FCC chair warns against overturning net neutrality\n\nThe rules were something of a follow-up to the 2015 Open Internet Order, which famously classified the internet as a public utility. That set in place the current net-neutrality rules \u2014 which forbid ISPs from blocking, throttling, or prioritizing sites as they see fit \u2014 but also left the FCC in charge of ISPs' privacy regulations.\n\nThe privacy rules apply a set of guidelines to ISPs about how they treat consumer data, but the most notable bit would force them to obtain explicit consent before they\u2019re able to share \u201csensitive\u201d consumer information with advertisers.\n\nIn other words, ISPs would need you to opt-in to their data collection policies before they\u2019re able to take that data and use it for targeted ads, instead of selling it by default and requiring you to manually opt-out. When people are given the explicit option, they are typically less likely to accept it. That means less potential revenue for ISPs.\n\nMuch of what the FCC deemed \u201csensitive\u201d fell in line with looser, pre-net-neutrality privacy guidelines from the Federal Trade Commission \u2014 things like financial, health, and geo-location info \u2014 but the agency notably added web browsing and app usage data to the list as well.\n\nThat specific provision is not scheduled to go into effect until later this December, however.\n\nEven under these would-be privacy rules, which now appear doomed, ISPs would not be required to get opt-in consent for other bits of personal information like email addresses.\n\nCurrent FCC chairman Ajit Pai has strongly opposed those privacy rules, and voted against them as a commissioner last October. Last month, he halted one part of the privacy rules that would\u2019ve broadly required ISPs to \u201cengage in reasonable data security practices.\u201d Pai and GOP commissioner Michael O\u2019Rielly currently have a 2-1 majority at the agency.\n\nPai feels the privacy rules unfairly target ISPs and give internet companies like Google and Facebook the ability to harvest more consumer data and dominate digital advertising. Google and Facebook are by far the two biggest players in the digital ad industry today.\n\nWebsites like Google and Facebook are still regulated by the FTC\u2019s looser guidelines, and thus are not forced to obtain opt-in consent before they collect and sell your web browsing and app usage data. This is partly why you may see ads personalized to your browsing history when you browse the web.\n\nRelated: Trump taps net neutrality opponent Ajit Pai to head FCC\n\nISPs aren\u2019t happy about this discrepancy, and have petitioned the FCC to roll back the rules entirely. Telecom industry groups have said keeping the rules could limit ISPs\u2019 ability to provide otherwise free or low-cost services. Wireless industry trade group CTIA also argued in a note to the FCC last week that web browsing and app usage history are not \u201csensitive\u201d information.\n\nThe debate comes at a time when ISPs like Verizon are increasingly interested in boosting their own digital advertising presence.\n\nDespite the fact that internet companies are not covered here, they have also opposed the regulations, mainly because they do not want a precedent to be set that may apply to their data collection policies in the future. Groups representing Google, Facebook, and the like, urged Congress to repeal the privacy rules using the CRA this past January.\n\nAnother shot at the net-neutrality rules\n\nLike many issues in Washington today, this is a heated debate drawn squarely along party lines.\n\nDemocrats and consumer advocacy groups argue that it is fair to apply more stringent privacy rules to ISPs because it is generally more difficult to switch internet providers than use different websites \u2014 particularly in rural and low-income areas with less choices between ISPs \u2014 and because ISPs are more easily capable of seeing everything you do over the internet connections they sell. (Though it\u2019s worth noting that behemoths like Google and Facebook are able to reach beyond their own sites.)\n\nThey also note that many websites provide free services in exchange for their targeted ads, whereas ISPs still charge relatively high fees for access to internet service.\n\nRelated: How Trump Could Make It More Expensive for You to Binge-Watch Netflix\n\nRepublicans and other conservatives, meanwhile, call the privacy regulations an overreach of federal agency power.\n\n\u201cIn reality, this is just yet another avenue designed to give the FCC more control over the Internet that should be open,\u201d said David Williams, president of the right-leaning Taxpayers Protection Alliance, in a statement in favor of the act on Tuesday.\n\nPai wants to create a single framework for both ISPs and internet companies that allows them all to be regulated under guidelines similar to those from the FTC.\n\n\"All actors in the online space should be subject to the same rules, enforced by the same agency,\" said Pai and acting FTC chairwoman Maureen Ohlhausen in a joint statement upon the FCC\u2019s data security stay last month. \"Until that happens, however, we will work together on harmonizing the FCC\u2019s privacy rules for broadband providers with the FTC\u2019s standards for other companies in the digital economy.\"\n\nIf privacy enforcement of ISPs is eventually removed from the FCC, there are doubts over whether or not the FTC has the authority to regulate ISPs\u2019 privacy practices at all. Apart from the restrictions set by the CRA, an appeals court decision last year said AT&T was exempt from FTC oversight because it was a \u201ccommon carrier\u201d \u2014 a title that was set for all internet providers through the 2015 net-neutrality order.\n\nPai says that, if the privacy rules are reversed, the FCC will still be able to regulate ISPs\u2019 privacy policies using Title II, Section 222 of the Communications Act. Those regulations are less stringent than the Obama-era regulations, however, and do not cover web browsing or app usage data.\n\nTitle II is the linchpin of the 2015 net-neutrality order, and the thing that gives the FCC much of its regulatory power over ISPs. But it\u2019s also the thing Pai and other Republicans most wish to dismantle as part of a larger rollback of the net-neutrality rules. If that happens, as anticipated, it could further reduce any privacy-related oversight of ISPs.\n\nEven if the net-neutrality order is undone, ISPs like Verizon and AT&T would retain \u201ccommon carrier\u201d status because they offer telephone services. That could create a situation where no agency has clear regulatory authority over ISPs, and thus require further action to expand FTC authority. That appears unlikely with the deregulatory-minded GOP in charge.\n\nDemocrats blasted Thursday's vote as taking too much control of personal data out of consumers\u2019 hands. \"This is yet another repeal without a replace,\" said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI), likening the vote to the ongoing healthcare debate.\n\n\"Let me be clear: This is the single biggest step back in online privacy in many years,\" he continued.\n\nA final rollback of the rules appears all-but-certain at this point, be it through the Congressional action here or an eventual FCC move. ISPs, advertisers, and internet companies can breathe a sigh of relief, but privacy advocates can consider it a missed opportunity.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Business Insider.

Former vice president Joe Biden memorably compared New York\u2019s LaGuardia Airport to one you would find \u201cin some third-world country.\u201d More recently, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump railed against the condition of the country\u2019s airports, and in his inaugural address promised \u201cgleaming\u201d new facilities across the country.\n\nBut for all the agreement about how much work the nation\u2019s airports need, there\u2019s little clarity on just what needs to be done, how much it will cost, and where the money is going to come from.\n\nRelated: Trump's Trillion Dollar Infrastructure Plan Could Be DOA\n\nTestimony delivered before a Senate subcommittee on Thursday by Gerald L. Dillingham, the Director of Physical Infrastructure Issues for the Government Accountability Office, claims there is a vast gap between what the Federal Aviation Administration considers necessary spending at the nation\u2019s airports and what the industry\u2019s trade group says is needed. The FAA says that over the next five years, airports will require about $32.5 billion in infrastructure development spending. However, the Airports Council International-North America (ACI-NA) says the number is closer to $100 billion.\n\nThe GAO says the gap is largely due how the FAA considers infrastructure projects: It only looks at those eligible for funding through the federal government\u2019s Airport Improvement Program, a grant system that is part of the larger Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which gets its money from various taxes on the airline industry.\n\nThe primary difference between projects that are eligible for AIP funding and those that aren\u2019t is in their ultimate purpose. The AIP money is typically spent on elements of a facility that are essential to the physical arrival and departure of airplanes and passengers. That includes land acquisition, building new runways, and construction of roadways and other systems for moving people through the airport.\n\nWhat the AIP does not fund, though, are many of the things that, to the average passenger, have a lot to do with whether they feel as though they are in a \u201cgleaming\u201d modern facility, or in Biden\u2019s \u201cthird-world\u201d airport. That\u2019s everything else that generates revenue for airports and commercial enterprises, from ticket counters to retail space.\n\nRelated: Rural State Republicans Challenge Trump\u2019s Infrastructure Spending Plan\n\nOne possibility for generating additional funds that could be used for other improvements would be to raise or eliminate the cap on what\u2019s known as the Passenger Facility Charge -- a $4.50 per-leg fee that is added to every passenger\u2019s ticket, up to a maximum of $18 for a round-trip purchase.\n\nDillingham says, \u201cIn 2015, GAO estimated that funding from these sources totaled an average of $10.3 billion annually (2013 dollars), $2.7 billion less than airports\u2019 planned development costs.\u201d\n\nHowever, raising or eliminating the PFC cap is controversial, not least of all with the airlines that worry that increasing the costs borne by passengers will result in an overall reduction in business. Indeed, the GAO\u2019s analysis determined that, depending on how price-sensitive consumers are, a PFC increase could impact the growth rate of airlines\u2019 businesses.\n\nRelated: Trump Again Calls for Rebuilding US Infrastructure in Inaugural Address\n\nHowever, the testimony appeared to come down primarily on the side of recommending increased PFC as a means of funding airport improvements. \u201c[H]igher PFCs can provide airports more control over local capital funding decisions, including the ability to decide how to apply PFC revenues to support capital projects and thus how those revenues might influence airline rates and charges.\u201d\n\n\u201cGenerally, PFCs offer airports relative independence over investment decisions at their airports. While airports must notify and consult with the airlines on how they spend PFCs, airlines cannot block these decisions if the FAA approves. Airlines can choose to serve other airports, however, so airports still have an incentive to listen to airline concerns.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/03/23", "title": "Is Going to Mars Donald Trump\u2019s New Ego Trip?", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/23/Going-Mars-Donald-Trump-s-New-Ego-Trip", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s health care plans may go nowhere, but he\u2019s dead set on being the first president to send a manned mission to Mars.\n\nIn a White House ceremony on Tuesday, Trump signed a $19.5 billion bipartisan bill introduced by fiscal conservative Sen.

Using Twitter to accuse former President Obama of ordering a wiretap on Trump Tower during the election is a prime example.\n\nIt\u2019s somewhat ironic then that a series of internal directives issued just after Trump took office were aimed at limiting communications from some U.S. government agencies to the outside world. Interestingly \u2014 especially coming from a president who takes to Twitter every chance he gets \u2014 these directives covered not only communications like press releases, but also blog posts and the use of social media.\n\nIn response, one former Obama administration official said this was \u201ca dark time\u201d at federal agencies. Another pundit stated Trump was \u201cat war with science.\u201d Some agencies even \u201cwent rogue\u201d by creating unofficial Twitter accounts in defiance of the Trump administration.\n\nRelated: Glued to the TV, Apparently, Trump Fires a Tweet Into the Comey Hearing\n\nDespite the outcry, there are some very sensible reasons for limiting certain types of government communications, especially with respect to the use of social media. Of course, communication between agencies and the public is critical in order to maintain transparency. Clear communication is also needed to educate the public about programs to enhance their effectiveness. However, there's a fine line between providing useful information to the public and engaging in acts of political advocacy. Even more concerning is that social media can give regulators an end-run around the checks and balances of the regulatory process.\n\nThe Administrative Procedure Act (APA) of 1946 set up a predictable process whereby agencies notify the public about new rules, and the public has an opportunity to give comments before a rule becomes law. Unfortunately, regulatory agencies routinely circumvent APA procedural requirements. Roughly half of all regulations between 1995 and 2012 avoided the notice-and-comment process altogether.\n\nEven worse, regulators can also influence the public\u2019s behavior in ways virtually identical to regulation without ever issuing a formal rule. These actions are what John D. Graham, dean of the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University, and I refer to as \u201cstealth regulation,\u201d and the government\u2019s use of social media is one form.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Who Wins With Trump\u2019s Order to Slash Regulations\n\nPerhaps the most common form of stealth regulation is the issuance of guidance documents and other policy memoranda. While usually not legally binding on the public, these documents can be binding with respect to government workers, making them powerful tools for implementing policy changes. Some of the most controversial actions of the Obama administration came in this form, from limiting deportations of illegal aliens to prompting schools to allow transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice.\n\nWhether or not one agrees with the policies themselves, it\u2019s highly problematic when sweeping government actions receive no public input, no analysis from technical experts and escape the rulemaking procedures that both political parties have accepted and adhered to for decades.\n\nColumbia Law Professor Tim Wu argues that agencies should also use threats, another form of stealth regulation, as a policy tool, especially in instances where an industry is undergoing rapid change, for example, from emerging technologies. But the threat of actions by the government against private citizens can be enough to ruin lives. Threats to retailers from the Consumer Product Safety Commission helped put the popular office-magnet company Buckeyballs out of business. And, yes, threats can come via tweets. Trump himself has demonstrated a dangerous tendency towards singling out individual companies on Twitter, especially those thinking about shifting jobs to other countries.\n\nRelated: This Big Washington Battle Could Hit You in the Wallet\n\nIn 2014, the EPA worked with the Sierra Club to promote a clean water regulation on Facebook and Twitter, employing a controversial online tool known as Thunderclap to reach hundreds of thousands of people and encourage them to comment on the proposed rule. In Congressional testimony, the EPA administrator would cite comments from the public as evidence of public support for the policy, but a Government Accountability Office report later determined that the EPA had violated anti-propaganda laws with its actions.\n\nNone of this is to say that regulators, or the president, should be completely banned from using social media. Some communications are clearly beneficial. However, the line between providing beneficial information to the public and engaging in political advocacy, outright propaganda or threats is rapidly blurring in this new digital age.\n\nIronically, one way to rein in abusive government use of social media may be to have the government write updated guidelines on the topic. The Office of Management and Budget is the logical agency to do this; it already writes guidelines for countless other regulatory agency functions.

In a statement last July to The Forward, a newspaper that bills itself as the voice of New York\u2019s Jewish community, the AG said, \u201cAs a Democrat and a Jewish American, I feel that I have a duty to help prevent such a dangerous, offensive, and grossly uninformed individual from occupying the Oval Office.\u201d\n\nLast October, the Journal editorial page accused Schneiderman of misusing \u201chis prosecutorial authority to attack his political enemies\u201d (read Trump) and for selectively targeting the Trump Foundation.\n\nRelated: Trump Hotels Settles With N.Y.

However, given the kinds of changes to the bill that are reportedly being considered as House leadership and the White House try to wrangle the votes they need, they probably don\u2019t want one anyway.\n\nWith the bill in danger of failing because of opposition from the most conservative Republicans in the House, the Trump administration and top Republican lawmakers in the House are reportedly entertaining the possibility of granting the holdouts a huge victory: the elimination of what the ACA calls \u201cessential health benefits\u201d that every insurance plan must cover.\n\nRelated: Has Trump Overplayed a Losing Hand in His First Legislative Test?\n\nCurrent law requires that all major medical health care plans cover ten different types of \u201cessential\u201d care, including hospitalization, outpatient services, maternity and newborn care, mental health and addiction services and more.\n\nOpponents of the law have long objected to the requirement, claiming that it forces consumers to purchase coverage that they may neither need nor want and drives up premium prices, making care unaffordable for some.\n\nLate Wednesday, Politico reported that the White House and members of the House Freedom Caucus, the right-wing lawmakers who are threatening to scuttle the bill because they don\u2019t believe it goes far enough in undoing the Affordable Care Act\u2019s changes to insurance markets, had agreed in principle to add language ending the essential care requirements in the bill.\n\nLawmakers were already facing the real possibility of having to vote on the AHCA without a CBO score of the final version of the bill. The budget agency\u2019s analysis of the initial version of the proposal released last week was brutal. It found that the proposed changes would result in 24 million fewer Americans with health insurance within a decade -- by choice or by design -- even as costs rose and benefits dwindled for the poor and elderly.\n\nRelated: The GOP\u2019s Charge of the Obamacare-Lite Brigade\n\nAfter House leadership released amended language Monday night, though, including changes to tax credits for older Americans, tweaking the repeal of ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion and more, the old CBO score became inoperative. There were reports that the agency was racing to prepare a new estimate of the amended bill in advance of Thursday\u2019s expected vote. But if major changes like the elimination of the essential care requirements are shoehorned in at the last moment, the odds of seeing a CBO score of the final bill on Thursday are very slim.\n\nFor the bill\u2019s supporters, that\u2019s probably just as well. That\u2019s because if conservatives are indeed successful in gutting the essential care requirement, CBO will likely project that even more Americans will be without health insurance under the AHCA.\n\nThe CBO itself warned Congress of this last year, trying to wave lawmakers off of efforts to allow the reintroduction of bare-bones insurance coverage by signaling that it would not consider people who are not protected from the serious financial risk of unexpected health crises as actually insured.\n\nCBO and the the staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation found that absent the essential care requirements, some policies offered to people receiving the AHCA\u2019s tax credits \u201cwould probably not provide enough financial protection against high medical costs to meet the broad definition of coverage that CBO and JCT have typically used in the past\u2014that is, a comprehensive major medical policy that, at a minimum, covers high-cost medical events and various services, including those provided by physicians and hospitals.\u201d\n\nRelated: Budget Group Says Changes to AHCA Negate Half of Deficit Savings\n\nThe agency continued, \u201cIf there were no clear definition of what type of insurance product people could use their tax credit to purchase, everyone who received the tax credit would have access to some limited set of health care services, at a minimum, but not everyone would have insurance coverage that offered financial protection against a high-cost or catastrophic medical event; CBO and JCT would not count those people with limited health benefits as having coverage.\u201d\n\nWhat that means is that a successful move to eliminate essential benefits would invite an even more damning analysis of the bill from the Congressional budget watchdog agency -- something that GOP leaders, struggling to hold together a coalition of lawmakers willing to pass the AHCA can ill afford.\n\nSo it will be no surprise if GOP leaders who normally preach fiscal responsibility and a commitment to budget discipline are happy to move forward on a vote before the agency charged with assessing the fiscal consequences of the ACHA has a chance to render a verdict."}, {"date": "2017/03/23", "title": "The Secret Service Won\u2019t Get $60 Million More to Protect the Trumps", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/23/Secret-Service-Won-t-Get-60-Million-More-Protect-Trumps", "text": "U.S. Secret Service spending to provide security for the lavish and far-flung travel of President Trump and his family \u2013 including Trump\u2019s now almost weekly trips to his Florida resort for presidential consultations and golf \u2013 has gotten so out of hand that the agency recently requested a $60 million increase in its budget for the coming year.\n\nBut The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that the request was turned down by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), headed by director Mick Mulvaney. The Secret Service was told to try to find the money through savings in other areas of its budget.\n\nRelated: The Five Biggest Winners and Losers in Trump\u2019s Fiscal 2018 Budget\n\nThe request, contained in internal agency documents obtained by the newspaper, was an urgent plea for more resources after Trump and his family\u2019s travel and lifestyle had begun to stretch the Secret Services resources to the limits.\n\nNearly half of the additional money that was sought in the fiscal 2018 budget request \u2013 or $26.8 million \u2013 was to be used to pay to protect Trump\u2019s family and private home in New York\u2019s Trump Tower.

Trump flew to Mar-a-Lago last Friday for his fifth post-inauguration weekend trip, just a day after OMB issued a federal budget proposal for the coming year seeking $54 billion in cuts in many government programs and agencies to offset the cost of a major military buildup.\n\nThe government spent an estimated $10 million on Trump\u2019s first three trips to Mar-a-Lago in late January and February, according to a recent investigation by The Washington Post.

Since then, First Family travel and leisure has been taxing Secret Service resources. And that, over time, could degrade the quality of protection for the commander in chief.\n\nThe Secret Service acknowledged last Friday that a 26-year-old California man with a history of mental illness who breached White House security March 10 remained on the White House grounds for more than 15 minutes before Secret Service agents detected and arrested him.

The Post quoted a person familiar with Secret Service budget discussions as saying the request for $60 million of additional funding was submitted in late February, before being turned down as excessive.\n\n\u201cThat means the agency will likely have to divert other spending to handle the additional burden,\u201d the newspaper reported. The agency plays other vital roles besides protecting the president and his family, including investigating cyber crimes, ferreting out counterfeit money operations and cases involving missing and exploited minors.\n\nThe Secret Service\u2019s annual budget last year was $2.2 billion, or 3.2 percent of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s overall $66.8 billion in spending. The agency, with wide ranging responsibilities, employs about 6,700 full-time equivalent workers, including about 3,000 agents. Salaries are better than average, and agent working long, grueling hours and traveling overseas are entitled to overtime, to a point.\n\nLast October, USA Today reported that at least 1,000 Secret Service agents, or about a third of the agent workforce, had already maxed out on annual overtime and salary allowance because of the extraordinary demands of providing protection to Trump, Democrat Hillary Clinton and other presidential candidates.

Nunes also stressed that the collection was incidental, meaning that Trump and his associates were not the original targets of the surveillance but were communicating with one or more targets.\n\nNunes said that despite the legality of the collection, he was troubled by the fact that the information was retained, shared among intelligence agencies, and that the names of at least some of the individuals whose communications were picked up were identified in the shared reports.\n\nRelated: It\u2019s Easy to See Where the Trump-Russia Investigation Is Headed\n\n\u201cThe House Intelligence Committee will thoroughly investigate surveillance and its subsequent dissemination to determine...who was aware of it, why it was not disclosed to Congress, who requested and authorized the additional unmasking, whether anyone directed the intelligence community to focus on Trump associates, and whether any laws, regulations or procedures were violated,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite repeating that the information was collected incidentally, though, Nunes repeatedly used language suggesting that the surveillance was somehow directed against Trump.

We won\u2019t know until we get the information on Friday, and that\u2019s why, look, I think the NSA is going to comply. I am concerned that we don\u2019t know whether or not the FBI is going to comply.

Trump has wagered his reputation as a dealmaker and a large share of the political capital that came with his election on his ability to ram the American Health Care Act through Congress. And he did it all without ever really looking at his cards.\n\nTrump appears to have seriously miscalculated in at least three areas: First, members of the House Freedom Caucus are far more resistant to the persuasions of the dealmaker-in-chief than the president seems to have realized. Second, public opposition to the bill is much stronger than expected, meaning even its supporters aren\u2019t deeply committed to it. And third, the bill faces adamant opposition from multiple Republicans in the Senate, where losing more than two votes would be fatal.\n\nRelated: The GOP\u2019s Charge of the Obamacare-Lite Brigade\n\nAs a result, the president is facing the real possibility -- perhaps even the likelihood -- of an embarrassing defeat in his first major foray into the legislative arena.\n\nThe bill, formally part of a budget reconciliation measure, hangs by a thread in the House of Representatives, where GOP leaders are faced with lockstep Democratic opposition and can afford to lose only 20 of their members without killing the bill. Currently, more than two dozen members of the caucus have expressed serious reservations or outright opposition, leading to a flurry of last-minute meetings between Trump and recalcitrant lawmakers, including a high-profile presidential visit to Capitol Hill on Tuesday.\n\nThe president\u2019s intense involvement suggests that Trump understands the gravity of the situation.\n\n\u201cIf Trump can't make this happen within his own party after the GOP ran four consecutive elections against Obamacare, he'll take a big hit,\u201d said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. \u201cThe chances that Trump will get other big bills through Congress are also diminished.\u201d\n\nRelated: Budget Group Says Changes to AHCA Negate Half of Deficit Savings\n\nTrump built his political success on his willingness to flout traditional \u201crules\u201d of the game.

If Trump shows that he can force recalcitrant lawmakers from both parties into line, that skill will be critical in steering the remainder of his top agenda items \u2013 including tax cuts, building up the military and constructing a wall along the southern border with Mexico -- through Congress.\n\nBut experienced analysts see little likelihood of things playing out that way.\n\nRelated: GOP Health Plan Reduces the Federal Deficit by $2.4 Trillion Over Two Decades\n\n\u201cYou want to score early, but you have to make sure what you\u2019re doing is reasonably well thought out and not slapped together in the interest of haste,\u201d said Ross Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers University and a congressional expert. \u201cGiven the kind of general disorder that has characterized the Trump administration, I don\u2019t have a lot of confidence that this is thoughtful legislation.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I think that legislation done in haste is likely to come back and haunt the people who wrote the bill \u2013 and that\u2019s more the members of the House of Representatives than the president,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump\u2019s first major misperception was that it would be a simple matter for him to bring the members of the House Freedom Caucus along with him, even if they weren\u2019t enamored of all the elements of the bill. But the Freedom Caucus has demonstrated, time and again, that compromise isn\u2019t in their DNA, and that they pay no price at the polls when they challenge party leaders from the right.\n\nIn his appearance on Capitol Hill Tuesday, Trump showed that he still doesn\u2019t really understand what he\u2019s dealing with when he confronted the holdouts with warnings that they will lose their seats in the next election if they don\u2019t back him on this bill.

The headline numbers from the Congressional Budget Office analysis released last week -- 24 million fewer Americans with insurance under the proposal and higher out-of-pocket costs for older people -- was a body blow to Republicans\u2019 insistence that they were replacing the Affordable Care Act with something better in terms of cost and effectiveness.\n\nA new poll by Morning Consult and Politico published Wednesday indicates that voters are growing uneasy about the Republican Obamacare replacement plan and that a \u201cstrong plurality\u201d believe GOP lawmakers are moving too quickly to overhaul the country\u2019s health care system, including Medicaid.\n\nWith a vote in the House likely to come on Thursday or early Friday, 43 percent of voters believe congressional Republicans should slow down the process while they take a closer look at the evolving replacement plan.

But the Associated Press apparently missed the memo.\n\nEarly Wednesday morning, the newswire published an explosive story alleging that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, already known to have done very well-compensated work for the Russia-friendly former leader of Ukraine, had made millions advising a close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin on public relations strategies within the United States aimed at boosting the image of the Kremlin.\n\nRelated: A Politically Damaged Trump Will Try to Rally GOP Behind AHCA\n\nIn 2005 a memo obtained by the AP, Manafort lays out a strategy that, \u201ccan greatly benefit the Putin Government if employed at the correct levels with the appropriate commitment to success.\u201d The plan he had drawn up, Manafort continued, \u201cwill be offering a great service that can re-focus, both internally and externally, the policies of the Putin government.\u201d\n\nThe AP report outlines a years-long relationship between Manafort and Oleg Deripaska, a billionaire and Putin confidant considered a powerful, behind-the-scenes figures in Moscow. In a statement to the AP, Manafort denied that he had worked on behalf of Putin\u2019s interests, despite the plain language of the memo.\n\n\u201cI worked with Oleg Deripaska almost a decade ago representing him on business and personal matters in countries where he had investments,\u201d Manafort said. \u201cMy work for Mr. Deripaska did not involve representing Russian political interests.\u201d\n\nIn general, there is nothing illegal or necessarily improper about an American citizen advising foreign governments or even working on their behalf in Washington. However, the Manafort memo represents a special case on multiple levels.\n\nRelated: It\u2019s Easy to See Where the Trump-Russia Investigation Is Headed\n\nFirst of all, Manafort is already suspected of having worked for foreign governments in the past, including Ukraine\u2019s Russia-backed former president Viktor Yanukovych, without making the disclosures required under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Revelations about his work for Ukraine led to his departure from the Trump campaign, which he ran from March to August of 2016, a period that included the crucial run-up to the Republican National Convention.\n\nSecond, he has adamantly denied working on behalf of Russian interests in the past. The AP\u2019s reporting, which uncovered both the memo written for Deripaska and records indicating that Manafort was paid tens of millions of dollars by the oligarch, now casts serious doubt on that claim.\n\nMost importantly for the Trump administration, though, is that fact the report comes out less than 48 hours after FBI Director James Comey took the highly unusual step of revealing that his agency is investigating not only the widely accepted accusation that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election but also the possibility that members of Trump\u2019s campaign team colluded with Russian intelligence agents in that effort.\n\nIn 2015, computer hackers broke into systems at the Democratic National Committee and into email accounts belonging to close associates of Hillary Clinton, who would go on to win the Democratic presidential nomination. Data from those hacks was later released in an obvious effort to damage Clinton during the following year\u2019s election.\n\nRelated: Why Spending $1 Trillion a Year on Defense Won\u2019t Make Us Safer\n\nLast summer Roger Stone, a Republican political operative and longtime Trump associate made multiple public statements indicating that he had advance knowledge of the information that was going to be released. High ranking members of the Trump administration, including former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, have faced criticism for failing to disclose contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyakov prior to the new administration taking office.\n\nThe allegations that Trump\u2019s campaign was somehow complicit in the Russian hacking effort has become a major distraction to an administration already overburdened with them as it struggles through its first 100 days in office.

By the time he was finished with his presentation, Ryan reportedly received a standing ovation and cheers from the lawmakers who attended the session.\n\nYet two months later, Ryan\u2019s flow chart of legislative action is being threatened by his own party in the House and Senate, and everything is riding on the leadership somehow prevailing in the two chambers.\n\nThat\u2019s because the health care replacement legislation is the lynchpin of the Trump-GOP agenda for the coming months. If that legislation goes down \u2013 despite Republican majorities in the House and Senate and a Republican sitting in the White House for the first time in eight years \u2013 that could set off a ripple effect that sets back the rest of the agenda, beginning with trillions of dollars of new tax cuts long advocated by Trump and Ryan.\n\nTrump and Ryan have both devised detailed descriptions of what they want to achieve. And while they are not identical, both approaches would provide massive tax cuts for individuals and businesses \u2013 especially for the wealthiest Americans -- and contribute substantially to the long-term debt absent real offsetting cuts and savings.\n\nRelated: A Politically Damaged Trump Will Try to Rally GOP Behind AHCA\n\n\u201cThis is so basic to what we\u2019ve promised over the last few elections,\u201d Senator John Cornyn (R-TX), the majority whip, said of the health-care legislation in an interview with Bloomberg. \u201cI think if we fail to keep this promise then I think it makes the rest of our work much, much more difficult to accomplish.\u201d\n\nStan Collender, a Washington budget expert, said in in an interview yesterday, \u201cIt would be much better for Trump and congressional Republicans to win first on ACA repeal and replace and create some seeming political inevitability to tax reform.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll those who hope for tax reform shouldn\u2019t abandon ship,\u201d he added. \u201cBut just know that there will be some opponents of the leadership and the Trump White House that are going to feel that if they beat them once, they can beat them a second time.\u201d\n\nRyan and President Trump have been frantically engaged in a series of behind the scenes negotiations with Republican conservatives and moderates to salvage the House GOP\u2019s American Health Care Act before the first big scheduled vote on the House floor on Thursday.\n\nTrump sought to rally House Republicans during a Tuesday morning appearance on Capitol Hill. He warned the lawmakers that they could lose their seats and the Republican majority in the 2018 mid-term election if they fail to deliver on their pledge to dismantle and replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Big Cuts to Medical Research May Not Get Past Congress\n\nTrump singled out Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), chair of the arch conservative House Freedom Caucus, for a special warning. The blustery, hard-charging Trump suggested that he might even campaign against him if the Republicans fail to pass new health care legislation in the House and Senate.\n\nYet Meadows, one of the sharpest critics of the House GOP health plan, was unfazed by the threat \u2013 one that White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer later dismissed as a joke by the president. Meadows was asked by reporters whether there were at least 21 Freedom Caucus members opposed to the legislation \u2013 or just one less than the number of Republicans it would take to stop the bill, assuming all Democrats vote against it. He replied \u201cyes,\u201d according to The Hill.\n\nEven if Trump and Ryan manage to squeeze out a bare majority for the bill by knocking heads and offering last-minute concessions, the political terrain in the Senate is far more hostile to the legislation. Critics on both sides of the aisle are worried about rising premium costs, inadequate subsidies, the loss of coverage for millions of their constituents and uncertainty over the fate of Medicaid for the poor.\n\nAn unholy alliance of conservatives including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah and more moderate senators including Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska may all stand in the way of the bill even making it to the floor for a vote next month.\n\nRelated: With Medicaid Costs Soaring, Republicans Plan Dramatic Eligibility Changes\n\nThe GOP fiscal and budget agenda has been so closely intertwined this year that something like the defeat of the AHCA would have a falling dominoes effect on everything else. For example, the Republican health care replacement plan includes the repeal of more than $800 billion of Obamacare tax hikes, with the lost revenue offset by corresponding cuts in Medicaid spending.\n\nThose long-term revenue reductions will be needed by the Republicans later this year in devising a \u201crevenue neutral\u201d tax cut plan that meets the special budget reconciliation rules that bar actions that result in a net increase in the deficit. Those special rules will be essential to the Republicans in passing the tax package with a simple 51 vote margin in the Senate, instead of the usual 60-vote super majority needed to get just about anything done in the Upper Chamber.\n\nRyan recently raised the possibility that the tax cut package would also be used as the vehicle for raising the debt ceiling to avoid a first-ever default on the U.S. debt this fall If the tax cut is delayed \u2013 or even put off until next year \u2013 the GOP leadership would have to find some other legislative vehicle to carry the unpopular debt ceiling increase.\n\nThere are other highly important fiscal and budgetary chores to be dealt with this year that could be temporarily sidetracked or adversely impacted because of lost momentum. For one thing, Congress has yet to finish work on this year\u2019s fiscal 2017 spending package that runs through Sept. 30. That process has been complicated by Trump\u2019s new budget plan unveiled last week, that seeks additional military spending this year above the existing cap.\n\nRelated: Budget Group Says Changes to AHCA Negate Half of Deficit Savings\n\nAnd there is likely to be a big fight over Trump\u2019s call for construction of a $25 billion security wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.\n\nTrump was expected to show extraordinary mojo and clout in pushing through GOP programs this year. Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) both feared and applauded Trump\u2019s political clout and communications skills coming off the 2016 campaign. They sought to harness that power in pushing through their agenda.\n\nBut Trump may be losing his influence just when he and his party need it most. Trump\u2019s erratic behavior with lawmakers and foreign leaders alike have raised concerns about his governing style and frequent self-inflicted political wounds. Now he is facing arguably the biggest crisis of his young presidency.\n\nThe FBI and Justice Department this week revealed an ongoing federal investigation into whether Trump\u2019s campaign advisers colluded with the Russians who hacked into Democratic National Committee emails as part of an effort to influence the outcome of the 2016 election and help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nMoreover, FBI director James Comey and other top intelligence officials have now confirmed that Trump lied two weeks ago in claiming on his Twitter account that former President Obama wire tapped Trump Tower during the campaign."}, {"date": "2017/03/22", "title": "3 Reasons the Pentagon Is Worried About Global Warming", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/22/3-Reasons-Pentagon-Worried-About-Global-Warming", "text": "While the Trump administration may be rife with climate-change skeptics such as Scott Pruitt, the new chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, Trump\u2019s Pentagon is taking global warming seriously.\n\nIn an update to a previous story, the investigative website ProPublica last week published new excerpts from written exchanges between Defense Secretary James Mattis and members of the Senate Armed Services Committee in which he said: \u201cI agree that the effects of a changing climate \u2014 such as increased maritime access to the Arctic, rising sea levels, desertification, among others \u2014 impact our security situation.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Pentagon Is Going Green, With or Without Trump\n\nThis week, Military Times laid out some of the things taking place right now in the world that give Mattis and the Pentagon reason to worry:\n\n1. The Arctic thaw. As ice caps at the top of the world melt, nations will compete for resources in the region. The Arctic is also a strategic site for anti-missile defenses, and Russia is well ahead of the U.S. there. \u201cIts military has established a new Arctic command, added four brigades, 14 airfields, 16 ports, and has 40 operational icebreakers and 11 in production,\u201d Military Times says. \u201cThe U.S. has only one working icebreaker, and it was commissioned in the 1970s.\u201d\n\nIn addition, there are worries that warming waters in the Artic will cause fish to migrate north, raising the chance of conflict over the fishing trade. One notable potential flash point is the South China Sea, where tensions are already high between China and Vietnam.\n\n2. Rising sea levels and droughts. A study by the Union of Concerned Scientists has warned that \u201cMany military bases along the US East Coast and Gulf of Mexico are at risk of permanently losing land to the ocean in the decades ahead.\u201d The study last summer said that \u201cA roughly three-foot increase in sea level would threaten 128 coastal DOD [Department of Defense] installations in the United States (43 percent of which are naval installations, valued at roughly $100 billion).\u201d Among the at-risk installations cited were the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland; the Marines\u2019 Camp Lejeune in North Carolina; and the naval shipyard in Portsmouth, Maine.\n\n\n\nMilitary Times also pointed to the 2014 wildfire at a naval facility near the Marines\u2019 Camp Pendleton in Southern California as an example of the devastation that droughts can cause.\n\n\n\n3. Refugees. Numerous mass migrations are already taking place around the world caused by war, economic conditions or other factors. Climate change could further disrupt unstable regions.\n\nProPublica said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) asked Mattis, a former four-star Marine general, the following: \u201cI understand that while you were commander of U.S. Joint Forces Command you signed off on a document called the Joint Operating Environment, which listed climate change as one of the security threats the military will face in the next quarter-century. Do you believe climate change is a security threat?\u201d\n\nMattis replied, \u201cClimate change can be a driver of instability and the Department of Defense must pay attention to potential adverse impacts generated by this phenomenon.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/03/22", "title": "Has Trump Hit the Wall Over the GOP Health Care Bill?", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/03/22/Has-Trump-Hit-Wall-Over-GOP-Health-Care-Bill", "text": "One big take-away from James Comey\u2019s testimony before the House Intelligence Committee is that the FBI is investigating whether members of the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.

They would also give states the ability to decide between accepting block grant funding for Medicaid or per capita funding.\n\nThe changes would also impact the federal Treasury on the revenue side, by accelerating the elimination of taxes imposed under the Affordable Care Act, the legislation that AHCA is meant to repeal and replace.\n\nRelated: With Medicaid Costs Soaring, Republicans Plan Dramatic Eligibility Changes\n\n\u201cWith these changes included, we roughly estimate that the amended version will reduce deficits by between $150 billion and $200 billion, as opposed to the $337 billion in the original bill,\u201d CRFB wrote on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cAs we have noted previously, the relatively modest amount of deficit reduction in AHCA compared to the savings from ACA repeal and Medicaid reforms in previous balanced budget resolutions will make it harder for Congress to balance the budget.

It would also raise costs and reduce service for vulnerable Americans, including the elderly and the poor. That combination of factors has left Republicans on the moderate end of the party\u2019s spectrum reluctant to support the bill.\n\nAt the same time, the bill leaves in place some elements of the ACA and creates a new system of tax credits meant to help low-income Americans pay for health insurance on the private market.

According to Politico, which obtained a copy of an amended version of the legislation, multiple changes were made to try to appease dissatisfied lawmakers.\n\nAmong them:\n\n-- An $85 billion provision meant to cushion older Americans from sharply increased costs under the plan. The amended bill would instruct the Senate to restructure the tax credit scheme to make it more generous to older Americans.\n\nRelated:\n\n-- A measure to allow states to add a work requirement for Medicaid recipients.\n\n-- Allowing states to choose between a per-person cap on federal contributions to Medicaid, or a fixed-sum block grant offering more freedom in how Medicaid dollars are spent.\n\n-- Accelerated repeal of taxes imposed by the ACA.\n\n-- Closing of a loophole that might have made it possible for recipients of the tax credits to use that money to pay for abortions.\n\nRepublican leadership, in a move reminiscent of the infamous \u201cCornhusker kickback\u201d that helped get the ACA passed, added language to the bill that applies only to the state of New York.

But we all know that Goldman\u2019s friendly merger with government spans both political parties over a period of decades. In fact, the latest outrage involving Goldman dates back to the Obama administration.\n\nLast April, as part of its \u201csettlements for everybody\u201d approach to the housing bubble-era financial crime wave, Obama\u2019s Justice Department reached agreement with Goldman Sachs to end investigation into the fraudulent sale of mortgage-backed securities. The bank lied to investors about the quality of the loans that comprised these securities, earning billions off the deception.\n\nRelated: How Democrats Can Un-Rig the Party and Start Winning Again\n\nThe Justice Department billed this as a \u201c$5.1 billion settlement.\u201d But that figure was incredibly misleading; at best the bank was giving DoJ a small cut of a decade of profits. There was a bigger problem, too: $1.8 billion of this settlement was earmarked for \u201cconsumer relief,\u201d in which Goldman would write down the mortgages of struggling homeowners. But it didn\u2019t own any home loans.\n\nSo Goldman went on a mortgage-buying spree, becoming the dominant customer for delinquent home loans from Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored mortgage holder. The bank has sucked up two-thirds of the $9.6 billion in loans Fannie Mae sold in the past year and a half, including $1.4 billion just last week. It has also purchased loans from other sellers, under the alias MTGLQ Investors (short for \u201cmortgage liquidation\u201d). And in no case was Goldman paying full price. In fact, it\u2019s paid as low as 50 percent of the face value for the \u201cnon-performing\u201d loans.\n\nDoing the math reveals the ridiculousness of the Justice Department calling this a punishment. Goldman Sachs buys a home loan at 50 percent off. It then modifies the mortgage for the borrower to perhaps 60 percent of face value. The modification gets referred to the overseer of the mortgage settlement, proving that Goldman did lower the cost for the homeowner. And as homeowners begin to make modified payments, the bank can resell the now-performing loans, or just take in the revenue stream. If this works, Goldman makes at least a 10 percent profit on the deal, while satisfying the consumer relief terms of the settlement.\n\nIn other words, the government sentenced Goldman Sachs to make money.\n\nRelated: JPMorgan Case a Reminder Why Trump\u2019s Attack on Dodd-Frank Is Dangerous\n\nNot only that, but if you think about who ends up paying the cost of the relief for the homeowner, it\u2019s Fannie Mae, who sold the delinquent loans at a severe discount, with some of that going to the homeowner and a markup to Goldman Sachs. Under the current conservatorship, Fannie Mae remits all of its profits to the U.S. Treasury. So these losses are essentially borne on the backs of the government. If you\u2019re asking who paid Goldman Sachs\u2019 mortgage penalty, the answer is Uncle Sam.\n\nThis is already working well for Goldman. In February, Eric Green, the settlement monitor, announced that the bank has satisfied over $100 million of its penalty already, through various modifications on around 5,000 mortgages.\n\nI\u2019ll stress that there\u2019s nothing illegal going on. Goldman was told to deliver consumer relief and it\u2019s doing it. The homeowners in these distressed mortgages are getting help. And if Goldman can achieve that while making money for its investors, bully for it. But this was supposed to be a penalty for committing fraud, not a business opportunity. And there\u2019s no reason it couldn\u2019t have been structured to force the actual offending bank to take the losses.\n\nWhat if, instead of Goldman Sachs administering consumer relief, it paid the $5 billion into a homeowner fund, which the government \u2014 through Fannie Mae or other agencies \u2014 then used to compensate troubled borrowers? This would have generated the exact same outcomes for homeowners, at Goldman\u2019s expense.\n\nPolicymakers have been screaming for precisely this kind of compensation fund since the foreclosure crisis began nearly a decade ago. During the Great Depression, a government program called the Home Owner\u2019s Loan Corporation (HOLC) bought up a million distressed mortgages, modified the loans to keep people in their homes, and by the time it ended in the early 1950s, turned a small profit.\n\nHOLC was a solid initiative that would have helped far more people than the government\u2019s failed attempts at foreclosure mitigation. We didn\u2019t need to leave this idea to proven rip-off artists running the same program as penance for misdeeds.\n\nAdditionally, when Goldman operates an HOLC-style scheme, the main interest is profits, not the public. The Wall Street Journal reports that the bank has often foreclosed on these mortgages, taking advantage of higher home prices to make money on the resale. In fact, if Goldman forgives secondary loans on the same property, it can foreclose and earn credit toward the settlement at the same time. Goldman\u2019s bankers are obviously weighing which strategy will bring a higher return on a case-by-case basis. The interests of the actual homeowners living in these properties are of secondary concern.\n\nRelated: 10 Real Estate Trends to Watch in 2017\n\nThis nonsensical circumstance stems from an inability to hold any company or individual accountable for the mortgage disaster that triggered the Great Recession. The Obama administration stressed that speeding relief to needy families took precedence over a need for Biblical-style justice. But of course, there\u2019s nothing speedy about a loan modification in 2017, a decade after the bubble collapsed. And if nobody at Goldman will pay a price anyway, the least Obama could have done is to take control of the process, minimizing collateral damage and ensuring that Goldman didn\u2019t reward itself even more from the swindle.\n\nThe failure of accountability was a component in the rise of Trump, whose anti-establishment rhetoric masked a return to power for the same old Wall Street titans. Trump railed against Goldman Sachs and then put its executives in control. But Obama\u2019s Justice Department \u201cpunished\u201d Goldman Sachs by allowing it to profit off the same mortgage crisis it helped create.

Factoring in an estimated $400 billion of interest on the federal debt that the government would save through reduced spending, CRFB puts the total two-decade savings at $2.4 trillion.\n\nThe new findings should provide the Trump administration with something to crow about in backing the health care plan which is likely to be brought up for a vote on the House floor on Thursday. Trump and his Republican allies have been repeatedly pounded by CRFB, the Concord Coalition and other fiscal watchdog groups for promoting budget and tax policies likely to drive up the deficit by many trillions of dollars in the coming decade.\n\nMoreover, the House GOP Obamacare replacement plan which Trump says he backs \u201c100 percent\u201d has been roundly criticized by many conservatives as \u201cObamacare Lite\u201d because it doesn\u2019t move quickly enough to dismantle the most important mandates \u2013 especially the requirement that everyone purchase insurance or pay a penalty -- and the biggest tax increases on the wealthy and health care industry.\n\nRelated: Ryan Says House GOP is \u2018On Track\u2019 to Repeal Obamacare and Pass the ACHA\n\nThe GOP proposal would, among other things, replace the Obamacare subsidy system with a different set of refundable tax credits. Those credits would enable individuals earning up to $75,000 a year to qualify for premium subsidies \u2013 with older people receiving the largest credits because they typically have much larger heath costs.\n\nIt would also gradually phase out the expanded Medicaid program now being used by mostly childless adults in 31 states and the District of Columbia. And it would eventually transform Medicaid from an increasingly costly entitlement program for the poor to a much cheaper system of block grants or per capita payments to the states.\n\nThose changes in the law would mean huge savings for the federal government over time, but it would also mean shifting a hefty portion of their costs to state governments. In the coming years, state governments would have to either dig deep into their coffers to finance an ever-growing share of the cost or tighten eligibility and shrink the rolls.\n\nThe CBO report said the largest savings for Republicans would come from reductions in spending for Medicaid and from the elimination of the Obamacare subsidies for non-group health insurance. The largest costs incurred by the new GOP plan would come from repealing dozens of ACA tax increase that have generated huge sums of money for the health insurance program.\n\nRelated: With Medicaid Costs Soaring, Republicans Plan Dramatic Eligibility Changes\n\nThose taxes raise $800 billion annually and include an increase in the Hospital Insurance payroll tax rate for high-income taxpayers, a surtax on those taxpayers\u2019 net investment income, and annual fees imposed on health insurers.\n\nThere are many factors that would contribute to the deficit reduction under the House GOP plan, according to the CRFB released Monday. First, the new savings are phased in throughout the first decade and grow in impact over time. Also, new spending on tax credits is likely to grow at a slower pace than the Obamacare tax credits if they were still operating.\n\nFinally, many costs of the GOP program, including a Patient and State Stability Fund and a delay in the imposition of the so-called \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on high-end health insurance policies provided by businesses to their employees are temporary. So those don\u2019t have any budgetary effects beyond the first ten years.\n\n\u201cIn other words, savings in the legislation would grow faster than the costs and from a higher starting point,\u201d the report stated.\n\nHowever, there are serious caveats to all of this. There is no way of predicting how insurance coverage might change during the second decade, the report noted, and \u201cthe AHCA\u2019s long-term savings could be significantly lower if various temporary policies were continued.\u201d\n\nFor example, if the Cadillac tax were repealed beyond 2025, it could cost the Treasury more than $600 billion over 20 years.

But the broader implication of the tweet was clear: Trump was asserting that the intelligence community had determined that the Russian hacking had no impact on the election\u2019s outcome.\n\nA staff member must have called the tweet to the attention of committee member Jim Himes of Connecticut because late in the hearing he raised it directly with Comey and Rogers.\n\n\u201cGentlemen in my original questions to you I asked you whether the intelligence community had undertaken any sort of study to determine whether Russian interference had had any influence on the electoral process and I think you told me the answer was no.\u201d\n\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cWe said the U.S. Intelligence community does not do analysis or reporting on the U.S. Political process or U.S. Public opinion. That is not our policy.\u201d\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s the Real Puzzle About the Trump-Russia Connection\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Himes. \u201cThanks to the modern technology that's in front of me right here, I've got a tweet from the president an hour ago saying the NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence the electoral process. That's not quite accurate, that tweet?\u201d\n\nClearly surprised at being asked to correct the President of the United States in real time, Comey hesitated. Himes read the tweet back, and the FBI director said, \u201cLet me tell you what we understand the state of what we've said is. We've offered no opinion, have no view, have no information on potential impact because it's never something we looked at.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it's not too far of a logical leap to conclude that the assertion that you have told the congress that there was no influence on the electoral process is not quite right?\u201d Himes pressed.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Comey. \u201cIt certainly wasn't our intention to say that today. We don't have any information on that subject. That's not something that was looked at.\u201d\n\nPeople frustrated by a White House that often seems to regard the truth as a matter of opinion might rightly have seen immediate pushback from senior intelligence officials as a victory on Monday. But in the end, it might have been a Pyrrhic one. Trump\u2019s tweet, wrong though it was, had tens of thousands of likes, comments and retweets by Monday afternoon.

Most of the growth was the result of an increase in federal spending, which rose by 16.0 percent and is a direct result of Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. In comparison, overall state spending on Medicaid increased by only 4.7 percent.\n\nLast month, four Republican senators with states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare \u2013 including Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2013 signed a letter saying they couldn\u2019t support the House GOP bill because it won\u2019t protect people enrolled in the health care entitlement.\n\nRelated: With Medicaid Costs Soaring, Republicans Plan Dramatic Eligibility Changes\n\nPolitico reported yesterday that during a meeting at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Saturday, several of the president\u2019s top advisers including Steve Bannon told Cruz, Lee and House Freedom Caucus chair Mark Meadows (R-NC) that it was increasingly apparent that the replacement plan would fail in the Senate with the accelerated Medicaid phase-out provision attached to it.\n\nCruz told Politico last week, \u201cWe can fix [the legislation] by meaningful Medicaid reform in particular: Freezing Medicaid expansion immediately, not holding open expansion for three more years to allow states to put yet more healthy childless adults onto an already overburdened Medicaid system.\u201d\n\nAntos said that the idea of a quick phase-out of the expanded Medicaid program was highly impractical \u2013 as well as politically infeasible \u2013 because states participating in the program had to pass conforming legislation or other regulatory action to take part. If the much shorter phase-out deadline were enacted, Antos said, \u201cI don\u2019t think the states would be able to realign their programs in time.\u201d\n\nMany moderates are also alarmed by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecast that as many approximately 14 million people would opt out of insurance because the mandate would be eliminated and another 10 million would lose their health insurance over the coming decade if Medicaid expansion was ended or curtailed.\n\nRelated: Trump's Health Chief Fails to Convince Patients They'll Get the Care They Need\n\nIn replacing the Obamacare tax subsidies, the Republican plan would provide fixed credits to individuals making up to $75,000 a year and families making $150,000 a year, with older people receiving higher credits than younger people because their medical costs typically are much higher.\n\nHowever, the CBO analysis showed that while the House GOP bill would bring down overall premiums on individuals in the private market by about 10 percent by 2026, older people would end up paying far more for their premiums than younger Americans. For example, a 64-year-old person who would pay $1,700 in average premiums under Obamacare would see premiums skyrocket to $14,600 a year under the GOP plan \u2013 a 750 percent increase. By contrast, a 21-year-old who pays about $1,700 under Obamacare would pay only $1,450 under the GOP approach.\n\nSen. Susan Collins of Maine, a prominent moderate who has been highly critical of the GOP plan, said on Sunday on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, \u201cWe have to do something about the fact that the House bill disproportionately affects older, rural Americans\u201d while wiping out coverage for millions of Americans across the board.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) said yesterday that he is pushing for an increase in the tax credits to help older people 50 to 60 years of age to purchase insurance and to allay the concerns of moderate Republicans.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s \u2018Hard Power\u2019 Budget Gives Billions to Defense, Guts Domestic Programs\n\nConservative are likely to have their way on several other matters, including imposing work requirement on able-bodied childless adults receiving benefits under expanded Medicaid and allowing states to choose between two alternatives to continuing to treat Medicaid as an open-ended entitlement program.\n\nStates would be allowed to opt for a per-capita payment for Medicaid beneficiaries in their states with a cost of living adjustment or a fixed \u201cblock grant\u201d that they could use to cover much of their annual Medicaid costs but have more flexibility in setting eligibility rules. The average annual cost per capita of a Medicare beneficiary in 2016 was $6,502, although some states are much higher. New York averages $8,910 per beneficiary; Rhode Island, $8,229; New Jersey, $8,309; and Florida $8,887, to name a few.\n\nThe House Budget Committee approved both measures last week and they are almost certain to be part of a package of amendments attached to the GOP replacement plan when it is brought to the floor late this week.\n\nHowever, many conservatives complain that the House GOP approach doesn\u2019t move quickly enough to repeal all the Obamacare mandates and taxes and the expanded Medicaid program. \u201cThe problem is, see, we as conservatives ran on repeal of Obamacare,\u201d Rand Paul said yesterday on ABC\u2019s This Week. \u201cI was elected in 2010, right after it came into place, to repeal it. We never ran on a replacement of Obamacare Lite. We never ran on making the entitlement subsidies permanent. We never ran on an individual mandate or keeping the taxes or keeping the Medicaid expansion. We ran on repealing Obamacare because it doesn't work.\u201d\n\nTrump predicted late last week that the House would approve the GOP plan and he told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday that efforts to line up support for the bill are \u201cgoing well.\u201d The president plans to meet with Republican lawmakers at the Capitol on Tuesday to make a final pitch for support, with the outcome of the vote still up in the air."}, {"date": "2017/03/20", "title": "How the Trump Administration Can Undermine Obamacare If Repeal Fails", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/20/How-Trump-Administration-Can-Undermine-Obamacare-If-Repeal-Fails", "text": "As chairman of the House Budget Committee, Tom Price spent the last seven years trying to muscle through a repeal of Obamacare. Now, as Health and Human Services Secretary, that health-reform law, the Affordable Care Act, may give Price a lot of the leeway he needs to roll back its regulations.\n\n\"There are 1,442 citations in #ACA where it says \"The Secretary shall\u2026\" or \"The Secretary may\u2026\" @HHSGov, we'll look at every single one,\" Price noted in a tweet Friday.\n\nRelated: With Medicaid Costs Soaring, Republicans Plan Dramatic Eligibility Changes\n\nWhat the secretary could do\n\nHealth policy analysts say the ACA gives the secretary the most discretion when it comes to enforcing reporting regulations for insurers, hospitals and physicians, in particular.\n\n\"Some of the paperwork requirements and data collection that have been layered on people over the last seven years, I wouldn't be at all surprised if that got eased up,\" said James Capretta, a resident fellow and Milton Friedman Chair of the American Enterprise Institute. \"It could make it easier for providers to change, adapt and cut their costs.\"\n\nPrice could also provide businesses with regulatory relief when it comes to Obamacare fees and taxes. The Obama administration initially delayed the health insurer tax on premiums that's built into the law to fund subsidies. The implementation of the employer mandate was also delayed, while the so-called Cadillac excise tax on high-cost plans was pushed back more than once.\n\n\"The employer mandate was delayed quite a bit by the Obama administration, and made much (weaker) than people anticipated. They could do that even more from the perspective of the Trump administration,\" said Capretta.\n\nRelated: Ryan Says House GOP is \u2018On Track\u2019 to Repeal Obamacare and Pass the ACHA\n\nAlready, Price has proposed stricter enrollment rules to prevent people from abusing Obamacare plan protections, by incurring high medical costs and then failing to pay their premiums.\n\nThe move was in direct response to what health insurers have been asking for to help stabilize the individual market.\n\nWhat the secretary can't do\n\nHowever, when it comes to giving insurers more flexibility over the types of plans that they can offer in order to bring down premium costs, the Trump administration's hands are tied without a repeal of the legislation.\n\nOne of the key things critics point to in the ACA is the requirement that every plan include 10 essential health benefits, among them free preventive care, mental health and pregnancy coverage.\n\nRelated: How Republicans Got Trapped by Their Health Care Promises\n\n\"It says that the essential health benefits have to be very similar to a typical employer plan,\" said Craig Garthwaite, a professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. \"Most employer plans don't differ that much on health benefits. To the extent that they do, it's really on the margins.\"\n\nInsurers have also argued that if they can charge older enrollees up to five times more than younger people, they can make premiums more attractive to young adults. But the ACA limits so-called age band rating so they can only charge older enrollees three times more.\n\n\"I don't see a way to purely through the regulatory process really do a lot to bring down premiums,\" Garthwaite said.\n\nWhat the secretary must do\n\nPrice has already used his regulatory discretion to extend the deadline for health insurers to submit rate plans for 2018 until June. But insurers say the administration needs to do more to secure the individual market next year.\n\nAn Anthem executive said CEO Joseph Swedish told President Donald Trump and Secretary Price in a private meeting this week that he welcomed the rollback on taxes and fees the administration is proposing, but also pushed to maintain some Obamacare measures.\n\nRelated: How the Tea Party Could End Up Killing the GOP Health Care Plan\n\n\"We'd like to see\u2026 cost-sharing subsides continue, that the Medicaid is appropriately funded,\" said John Gallina, Anthem chief financial officer at the Barclays Capital health conference this week. \"And we feel very good, very encouraged by the fact that the president and his team are listening and actually making change based on feedback that the industry is providing.\"\n\nDuring the Obama administration, Republicans in Congress sued to block Obamacare cost-sharing subsidies that help low-income exchange enrollees pay for out-of-pocket costs. Their federal lawsuit has been put on hold, but is still pending.\n\nInsurers say removing those cost-sharing subsidies before a transition to a new system will immediately destabilize the market, because enrollees will likely drop their plans.\n\n\"What really needs to happen is providing a stable environment for insurance carriers and consumers,\" said Sarah Collins, vice president for health-care coverage and access at the Commonwealth Fund. \"Part of that is\u2026 to resolve the suit over the cost-sharing reduction payments.\"\n\nCollins also said that financial stabilization mechanisms are also key for maintaining the individual market.\n\nThe ACA provided three programs that were intended to help offset insurers' losses on high-cost enrollees in the first three years of Obamacare, but Republicans also fought funding for those programs.\n\n\"The premium stabilizers\u2026 turned out not to be what the insurers thought,\" she explained, because they were paid only a fraction of what was expected. \"That had a major effect on small insurers in particular.\"\n\nSome insurers have sued the government in order to recover the funds they say were promised under the law's so-called risk adjustment program. If the Trump administration chooses to settle the claims, some policy analysts think it could buy some good will with insurers to keep them in the market next year.\n\n\"It would depend a lot on whether they could get the risk adjustment to work,\" said health policy Professor Laurence Baker, senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. \"They might be able to do that, but that would be a new frontier for everybody to figure out how to do that... and are plans prepared to buy into it?\"\n\nBut politically, that's not likely to happen any time soon, while the GOP repeal plan vote hangs in the balance.\n\n\"It's possible the administration could say, you know what, 'you're right. You should have been paid for this',\" American Enterprise's Capretta said. \"That would run counter to some of the rhetoric of the last seven years, so hard to do that.\"\n\n\"We should pay them,\" in order to insure the future of the individual market, said the Kellogg School's Garthwaite.\n\n\"If I'm worried about one thing broadly, it's whether the insurers are going to be willing to trust the regulatory process, going forward,\" he said \"Any replacement we try to come up with demands that private insurers be there to try to provide health insurance. At a certain point, they're not going to come back.\"\n\nAnd there's no law requiring insurers to provide coverage in the individual market.\n\nThis article originally appeared on CNBC.

But it was evident within the first few hours of the testimony from National Security Agency Director Admiral Mike Rogers and Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey that there are two very separate directions members of Congress would like to see it move in.\n\nNot surprisingly, the direction any given member prefers is closely correlated to the side of the aisle on which he or she sits.\n\nRelated: Your Guide to the Players in the Trump-Russia Investigation\n\nThe two initial headlines out of the hearing both came early, in statements from Comey. He confirmed the widely reported fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice as a whole has no information to support President Trump\u2019s claim, made on Twitter earlier this month, that former President Obama personally ordered that Trump\u2019s phones be tapped during the presidential election.\n\nNot only did Comey say there was no information to support the claim, but both he and Rogers said that, given the system in place for authorizing domestic surveillance activities, the president did not have the authority to give such an order.\n\n\u201cSo, President Obama could not unilaterally order a wiretap?\u201d asked Rep. Adam Schiff, the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat.\n\n\u201cNo president could,\u201d Comey said.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s the Real Puzzle About the Trump-Russia Connection\n\nRogers also angrily shot down the suggestion repeated by the White House that President Obama had used the British intelligence services to spy on Trump, saying such a move would be \u201cexpressly against\u201d a longstanding intelligence-sharing arrangement between the US and its closest allies.\n\nComey also took the unusual step of confirming that there is an ongoing investigation into not just the involvement of Russian agents efforts to disrupt the presidential election by stealing and disseminating information about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, but that the agency is also investigating whether there was any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s effort, he said in his opening statement, \u201cincludes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia\u2019s efforts.\u201d\n\nWith the two biggest bits of news out of the way, the next step was for the members of the committee to react to them, and they did so in notably different ways.\n\nRelated: Demands for a Special Counsel to Investigate Trump\u2019s Russia Ties Just Got Louder\n\nFrom the outset of the hearing, Republicans on the panel were laser-focused on the fact that information about the investigation into Russian meddling in the election -- particularly information that seems to have been derived from classified sources -- was leaked to the media. They repeatedly stressed the need to investigate and prosecute individuals who leaked information to the press, and gravely warned that the leaks might endanger the renewal of a specific law giving agencies like the NSA the ability to monitor the communications of non-U.S. persons overseas.\n\nA subject that repeatedly came up was the media reports, citing intelligence community sources, that revealed that former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had held undisclosed telephone conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, prior to Trump\u2019s inauguration, in which he discussed the sensitive issue of US sanctions on Moscow.\n\nRepublican lawmakers, like South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, pressed Rogers on the question of who would have the authority to \u201cunmask\u201d the identity of a US person caught up incidentally in the surveillance of a foreign agent. Gowdy made a point of naming several former members of the Obama White House who might have had such authority, insinuating that the information might have come from the former president\u2019s closest advisers.\n\nSuch surveillance is supposed to take place only under very closely controlled circumstances, with the results held in the strictest secrecy. Several GOP members of the panel warned the witnesses that the apparent breach of that secrecy could make it more difficult for lawmakers to renew Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which authorizes the collection of the communications of non-US persons located outside the United States.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Weekend Tweets Cause an Uproar Over Wire Tap Accusation\n\nBoth Comey and Rogers, at different times, felt the need to clarify to lawmakers that the intelligence being discussed during the hearing, the release of which the Republicans found so troubling, was not actually collected under the agencies\u2019 Section 702 authority in the first place.\n\nFor their part, the Democrats showed little interest in the way information about contacts between members of Trump\u2019s inner circle and Russian officials had gone public, focusing instead on what the existence of those connections might say about the influence Moscow had or may still have over the current president.\n\nTheir questions on that subject, though, went largely unanswered. Comey in particular, though he had been authorized to reveal the existence of an investigation into Russian involvement in the election and of possible coordination with the Trump campaign, was reluctant to expand on it any further.\n\nComey was particularly reticent when Schiff, the panel\u2019s top Democrat, laid out a litany of known and suspected contacts between Trump associates and Russian officials, repeatedly declining to address questions about individuals.\n\nRelated: Competing Narratives in Trump \u2018Wiretap\u2019 Story Lack Facts\n\nThe separate focus of the two parties when it comes to this investigation is likely to be pronounced in future hearings, perhaps as soon as next week, when the Intelligence Committee hopes to hear testimony from other former senior intelligence community figures.\n\nAnd if Republicans show any sign of wavering, they\u2019ll likely receive some Twitter-fueled encouragement from the president. Indeed, Trump was angrily tweeting in advance of the hearing Monday morning, at one point insisting that, despite the unanimous view of the intelligence community that Russia intervened on his behalf, that the whole thing was actually a set up by the Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign,\u201d the president claimed."}, {"date": "2017/03/20", "title": "Trump\u2019s Big Cuts to Medical Research May Not Get Past Congress", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/20/Trump-s-Big-Cuts-Medical-Research-May-Not-Get-Past-Congress", "text": "The nation\u2019s scientific research community hit the panic button last week after the Trump administration targeted the National Institutes of Health \u2013 the nation\u2019s premier biomedical research organization -- for a budget cut of as much as 20 percent.\n\nThe proposed $5.8 billion reductions in NIH funding for grants and aid was contained in the fiscal 2018 budget blueprint President Trump submitted to Congress on Thursday, which seeks devastatingly deep cuts in many federal agencies and programs. More than 80 percent of NIH\u2019s funding is awarded through nearly 50,000 competitive grants to more than 300,000 researchers at more than 2,500 universities, medical schools and other research institutions in the U.S. and overseas.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s NIH Budget Cuts Threaten a Serious Setback in Medical Research\n\n\u201cDrastic cuts to the National Institutes of Health budget run counter to the priorities of our nation, national security, and the aspirations of Americans,\u201d Mary Woolley, president and CEO of Research!

It is less clear that threats the U.S. faces justify the extra funding or that bureaucrats can spend the new money effectively.\n\nAlthough just about everyone agrees that defense spending should go up, the details are up for debate. The Trump administration has proposed to spend $603 billion on defense in 2018, which is $54 billion above the sequestration caps set during the 2011 budget compromise. Republican hawks led by Sen. John McCain say that the administration number is insufficient. They want to see a $640 billion military budget. On the Democratic side, Sen. Dick Durbin indicated support for Trump\u2019s number so long as Republicans agree to also break the sequester caps on domestic spending (highly unlikely).\n\nRelated: The Five Biggest Winners and Losers in Trump\u2019s Fiscal 2018 Budget\n\nThe final number, which will be somewhere between $603 billion and $640 billion, is huge \u2014 but is only part of what the U.S. government spends to counter foreign rivals. Each year, Congress also appropriates money to Overseas Contingency Operations \u2014 a slush fund created for emergency security spending created in the wake of 9/11. In fiscal 2016, Congress authorized $58.6 billion in defense-related OCO spending. Trump proposes to raise this amount to $65 billion in 2018. This means we are looking at total military spending approaching $700 billion, or about 3.5 percent of next year\u2019s nominal GDP.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t end there. The skinny budget does not include money for the National Intelligence Program, which funds the CIA, NSA and other spying agencies, but for 2017 these agencies requested a total of $53.5 billion. Also excluded from reported defense spending totals is the Department of Veterans Affairs, which addresses the human consequences of our past deployments. The VA would see its discretionary funding raised from $74.5 billion this year to $78.9 billion next year under Trump\u2019s budget blueprint, a 6 percent increase. That\u2019s on top of mandatory spending of more than $100 billion this year. In total, the VA budget has nearly doubled since 2009 and looks likely to escalate further under the new administration.\n\nSo, all told, our nation\u2019s defense establishment can be expected to cost us over $900 billion annually during the Trump years \u2014 closer to 4.5 percent of GDP.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Shouldn\u2019t Give the Pentagon Another Dime\n\nPolitical leaders justify the military buildup by citing a list of threats that typically include Russia, China and Islamic terrorism. But none of these threats approach the severity of that posed by the Communist bloc during the Cold War, when all of Eastern Europe was under the control of a hostile power. Yet, in real dollars, proposed defense spending exceeds the annual military budget at the height of the Cold War.\n\nToday, Russia is a mere shadow of the former Soviet Union, with a stagnant population less than half the size of ours and an economy that is about one twelfth of ours in nominal GDP terms. Yet the media is full of scare stories about the power and ruthlessness of Russia\u2019s leader, Vladimir Putin.\n\nRelated: The US Navy\u2019s $13 Billion Answer to China and Russia\n\nThe simple fact that Putin is a bad guy does not make the case for a defense buildup. It only makes sense to spend money to counter Russia if Putin is really a threat to us. Admittedly, Russia has enough nuclear weapons to kill everyone on the planet many times over. But there is every reason to believe that Putin, like all of his Soviet and Russian predecessors since World War II, is deterred from using his nuclear arsenal by the existence of our nuclear arsenal.\n\nSo we don\u2019t need to send billions more to the Pentagon to avoid a Russian attack on U.S. territory. The more plausible concern is that, without a strong counterforce, Putin will continue to grab territory from adjacent states as he did with Georgia in 2008 and more recently in Ukraine. But these situations are half a world away and have virtually no impact on our economy. From the perspective of Trump\u2019s \u201cforgotten men\u201d \u2014 the laid-off coal miners and manufacturing workers in the nation\u2019s heartland \u2014 events on the periphery of Russia\u2019s borders might as well be happening on Mars.\n\nChina is a more plausible economic rival but that nation has no history of global expansionism. As with Russia\u2019s border incursions, China\u2019s aggressive claims in the South China Sea are of little consequence to the average American.\n\nRelated: Tillerson\u2019s Asia Trip Could Signal the End US Soft Diplomacy\n\nISIS, al Qaeda and other radical Islamist groups have expressed designs on American civilians and have inspired lone wolf attacks on the homeland in recent years, but they have been unable to repeat the spectacular attacks of 9/11. These groups are small \u2014 with total forces numbering in the tens of thousands \u2014 and are constantly weakened by their reliance on suicide attacks. Also, they are almost universally reviled; many other countries are fighting them or are willing to do so. As Trump has repeatedly suggested, Russia could be an ally in cost-effectively fighting radical Islam.\n\nThe rest of the U.S. establishment seems bent on stopping such cooperation. Democrats and their mainstream media allies, eager to undercut Trump\u2019s legitimacy, continue to play up his campaign\u2019s links to Russia. To accentuate the issue, they demonize Putin and exaggerate the impact of Russian propaganda. Republican hawks like McCain and Sen. Lindsay Graham, who see every foreign policy issue through the prism of the late 1930s (when the Nazis gobbled up Europe while Chamberlain appeased and the Americans slept), can\u2019t fathom the idea of cooperating with the Russian strongman for any reason whatsoever.\n\nDue to this intransigence and political backbiting, we are obliged to fight Islamic terrorism largely on our own. Yet, given the small and decentralized nature of this threat, it is best countered by law enforcement and relatively inexpensive special forces; our heavy weapons and most of our 1.4 million Army, Navy and Air Force personnel are largely irrelevant.\n\nRelated: F-35s and Navy SEALs: Trump\u2019s Powerful Warning to North Korea\n\nGiven all that, it is hard to see how billions more for defense will benefit the typical American not employed by a weapons contractor. But even for those who believe the opposite, there is a second question: Can the Department of Defense use the new money effectively? Evidence from years of oversight suggests not.\n\nDOD has serious financial management issues. Unlike other federal agencies, it is unable to produce financial statements that can pass an external audit. Indeed, for fiscal 2016, it has yet to provide any financial statements at all. DOD\u2019s financial management issues have been on the General Accounting Office\u2019s high risk list since 1995.\n\nAs The Fiscal Times has previously reported, DOD was unable to account for billions of dollars it spent in both Iraq and Afghanistan. More recently, DOD\u2019s Inspector General found that the U.S. Army made $6.5 billion in unsupported year-end adjustments to close its books in 2015.\n\nRelated: The Navy\u2019s $35 Million Scandal: Hookers, Booze and a Guy Named \u2018Fat Leonard\u2019\n\nSo even if the DOD really needs new money to better counter external threats, there is little assurance that it will spend that new money wisely. Republicans often criticize Democrats for throwing money at dubious government programs irrespective of necessity or results, but the GOP\u2019s approach to military spending reveals their hypocrisy. Republican warnings about budget deficits, unsustainable entitlements and government waste ring hollow when it is obvious that they are willing to lavish billions more on the military-industrial complex without insisting on accountability or even a compelling case in terms of cost and benefit."}, {"date": "2017/03/19", "title": "Ryan Says House GOP is \u2018On Track\u2019 to Repeal Obamacare and Pass the ACHA", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/19/Ryan-Says-House-GOP-Track-Repeal-Obamacare-and-Pass-ACHA", "text": "With his reputation on the line as the leading proponent of GOP health care reform, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) on Sunday predicted victory in the first big test of the GOP\u2019s Obamacare replacement legislation this week.\n\n\u201cWe feel like we\u2019re on track and we\u2019re right where we want to be,\u201d Ryan said on Fox News Sunday. \u201cI feel very good about it actually.

Those amendments include imposing a work requirement on many able-bodied adult Medicaid beneficiaries, retooling the plan\u2019s refundable tax credit subsidies to provide greater assistance to older and low-income people, and granting states the option of receiving federal Medicaid funding in the future through a block grant program giving them more flexibility in how they spend the money and determine eligibility rules.\n\nRelated: Why the GOP Plan for Medicaid Could Be a Bad Deal for the States\n\nToday Ryan insisted that he always had been open to changes to his bill and that his members will finally face that \u201cbinary choice\u201d on Thursday when the legislation and a package of \u201cmanager\u2019s amendments\u201d are brought to the House floor for a vote.\n\n\u201cThe reason I feel so good about this is because the president has become a great closer,\u201d Ryan told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who has helped to negotiate changes to this bill with members from all over our caucus.

But the U.S. and its longtime South Korean ally are in the middle of war games that include F-18 Super Hornet attack jets soaring off the deck of the nuclear aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson and cruising along the coast of the Korean peninsula; elite troops including Navy Seals, Army Rangers and members of Delta Force joining some 300,000 ROK (Republic of Korea) and almost 20,000 American soldiers on maneuvers; and the positioning of THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Defense) anti-missile systems with powerful radar components, one of which will be in a mountainous region of South Korea about 300 miles southeast of the Demilitarized Zone.\n\n(That THAAD battery, in an ironic twist since it will first become operational under Commander-in-Chief Donald Trump, will be located on a former golf course.)\n\nIn fact, earlier this week, the Pentagon dismissed reports that some elite-troop maneuvers were aimed at \u201cdecapitating\u201d the North Korean leadership \u2013 though it\u2019s not unlikely such stories were read in Pyongyang.\n\nIn South Korea, where Tillerson visited the DMZ, he said the U.S. would not enter into any negotiations with North Korea over its missile and nuclear programs \u2013 a position similar to one taken by the Obama Administration that reflects Pyongyang\u2019s history of reneging on promises to back off.\n\nNorth Korea signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1985 and then after multiple violations, formally withdrew 18 years later. That same year, 2003, it pulled out of a 1992 agreement to keep the Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons. In 2005, North Korea admitted that it was building nuclear weapons.\n\nRelated: Tillerson\u2019s Asia Trip Could Signal the End US Soft Diplomacy\n\nOn New Year\u2019s Day of this year, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said his country was getting ready to test an intercontinental ballistic missile, which would have the range to strike the U.S. North Korea also says it can produce a nuclear weapon small enough to fit on an ICBM, though none of its claims have been verified.\n\nEarly this month, North Korea launched four missiles intended to threaten U.S. bases in Japan. They landed in the Sea of Japan, some about 190 miles off the coast.\n\nTillerson made clear that the Trump Administration would not even consider talks until North Korea denuclearized and gave up its \u201cweapons of mass destruction.\u201d\n\nThe U.S.\u2019s increasingly hard line may well reflect several new realities:\n\nWhile the Obama Administration's cyber war against North Korea may have partially disrupted its missile program, the latest \"testing\" suggests the hack attacks are no longer working.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina seems increasingly unable to control client state North Korea. The killing of Kim Jong-un's estranged half-brother at the Kuala Lumpur airport February demonstrates this: Beijing reportedly saw Kim Jong-nam as a possible replacement, but Malaysian authorities believe North Korean operatives engineered his assassination by having young women smear his face with a highly toxic nerve agent.\n\n\n\n\n\nKim Jong-un is arguably more blood-thirsty than his father or grandfather and seems more unhinged. He has slaughtered many of his top generals \u2013 in some cases with antiaircraft guns -- and other members of the leadership in Pyongyang, including his uncle by marriage, a key adviser who had close ties to China and was originally thought to be the man who would be the shadow leader of the country. Now there seems to be no one who can rein in Kim Jong-un.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump promised a harder line on North Korea, which with Iran neutralized for the moment, is the most dangerous nuclear rogue on the planet. But he is being more confrontational than might have been imagined.\n\nEven with Tillerson now in Beijing and scheduled to meet with President Xi Jinping on Sunday, Trump on Friday tweeted: \u201cNorth Korea is behaving very badly. They have been \u2018playing\u2019 the United States for years. China has done little to help!\u201d\n\nThat may not make diplomatic life any easier for Tillerson, but China, too, seems frustrated by its inability to get Kim Jong-un under control. A New York Times story on Saturday said that Kim remains unmoved by Beijing\u2019s economic pressure because he clings to nuclear weapons as the only guarantee of safeguarding his power and family dynasty.\n\nAlso on Saturday, Reuters reported that Kim was on hand for tests of a high-thrust engine and crowed about \u201cthe new birth\u201d of the nation\u2019s rocket program.\n\nCorrection: The story has been corrected.

Yet Republicans made it clear last week that \u2013 one way or another \u2013 the 52-year-old Medicaid program for the poor and disabled is headed for significant changes in the coming year.\n\nAlthough President Trump promised during the campaign that he would protect Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security from budget cuts or radical changes, Medicaid was put into play by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and other conservatives in drafting legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The fate of that legislation is in doubt, with both conservatives and moderates raising strong objections to a bill likely to come up for a vote this week in the House.\n\nRelated: Trump's Health Chief Fails to Convince Patients They'll Get the Care They Need\n\nEven if that legislation fails \u2013 or undergoes significant change \u2013 the Trump administration and House Republicans are working on separate legislation and administrative actions that would significantly tighten state eligibility regulations and impose new requirements including that able-bodied beneficiaries find work or pay for part of their health coverage.\n\n\u201cCertainly Medicaid is under assault here . . . and what is being proposed is the biggest threat to the program since it was enacted in the 1960s,\u201d said Edwin Park, vice president for health policy at the liberal leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nThe 1965 Medicaid law today covers about 75 million people, including poor children and pregnant women, the disabled and poor older people. While the program has been a lifesaver for millions of people, the growing numbers and associated costs have conservatives worried about runaway spending, fraud and waste.\n\nMedicaid spending grew 9.7 percent to $545.1 billion in 2015, or 17 percent of total national expenditures on health, according to government data. That increase was twice the rate of growth in spending for Medicare for the elderly.\n\nRelated: Why the GOP Plan for Medicaid Could Be a Bad Deal for the States\n\nMoreover, federal spending on Medicaid expansion under Obamacare proved to be much costlier than originally predicted, according to an analysis by Forbes. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimated in its 2014 Medicaid Actuarial Report that newly eligible enrollees would cost $4,281, on average, in 2015. Yet a 2015 CMS report issued in July 2016, the per capita cost was $6,366\u2014a 49 percent increase.\n\nThe most immediate question is whether House Republicans can agree among themselves on a plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act that will phase out the expanded version of Medicaid in 31 states and the District of Columbia. That program has grown in popularity -- even in more conservative states \u2013 and currently provides health care coverage to more than 11 million able-bodied childless adults or parents who previously were excluded from Medicaid.\n\nThe Ryan-Trump bill headed for House floor action this week would phase out the expanded Medicaid coverage beginning in 2020, or even sooner if conservative critics have their way. That change if approved would represent a serious blow to a large segment of the U.S. population that has struggled without health insurance for years.\n\nThe change would effectively freeze out millions of people who would have received coverage if the program were still in existence while causing current enrollees to eventually lose their coverage.\n\nA far more serious threat to low income Americans, however, is a provision in the bill that would impose a new per capita limit on federal matching funds for Medicaid, rather than continuing to treat the program as an open-ended entitlement.\n\nThat move would effectively shift costs and risks to the states and put coverage at risk for millions, according to some analysts. Essentially, states would receive a fixed amount of funds to provide coverage for an individual that would be adjusted for inflation in medical costs.\n\nRelated: Tom Price\u2019s Big Claim: People Won\u2019t Get Shafted on Health Care\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis of the GOP health care replacement plan found that the Medicaid cuts in the bill and the new per-capita spending cap would result in Medicaid enrollment declining by 14 million. Overall, the CBO projected that 24 million would either lose or decline their insurance by 2026.\n\n\u201cThe bill needs its deep Medicaid cuts \u2014 $880 billion over ten years in total \u2014 to offset its hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts to the wealthy, pharmaceutical companies, and insurers, and states simply couldn\u2019t make those cuts without harming millions of Medicaid beneficiaries,\u201d said an analysis published last week by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nThe Ryan-Trump replacement bill has encountered stiff resistance in the House and is considered unpassable in the Senate in its current form with some conservatives saying it isn\u2019t tough enough and moderates saying it goes too far and leaves many of their constituents without insurance coverage.\n\nTrump boasted on Friday that he has begun winning over conservative dissidents and predicted a victory when the bill comes to a vote in the House this week. \u201cI think we have a very unified Republican party,\u201d he said at a Friday news conference.\n\nWilliam Galston, a political and public policy expert with the Brookings Institution, said last week, \u201cI would be amazed if any bill emerges from the Senate that\u2019s within hailing distance of the bill that emerges from the House.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump Says His Plan Would Provide \u2018Insurance for Everybody\u2019\n\n\u201cMy gut tells me we are a long way from a legislative product signed by the president that would redo Medicaid,\u201d he added. \u201cUnlike members of the House, most of whom are in safe districts, there are a lot of red-state senators whose citizens have participated in the Medicaid expansion, and many of them voted for Donald Trump, and I think Trump knows that.\u201d\n\nBut even if the legislation goes down in the House or fails in the Senate, congressional Republicans and the new Trump administration are seeking ways to tighten eligibility rules that have long been championed by conservative lawmakers and think tanks like the Heritage Foundation.\n\nOn Thursday, for example, House Budget Committee Republicans signaled they would pursue legislation requiring able bodied adults without children to find work or lose their coverage. Many conservatives have complained for years that Medicaid beneficiaries were free-loaders who should be making money to defray their health care costs.\n\nResearch by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the CBPP indicate that between 60 percent and 80 percent of adult Medicaid recipients live in families where at least one person is a full-time or part time employee. Many of those who don't hold jobs have an illness or disability that prevents them from working or are care givers to other members of their families.\n\nRelated: How Republicans Got Trapped by Their Health Care Promises\n\nWhile Democrats and liberal advocacy groups are on high alert regarding what they see as growing peril for Medicaid, others are less certain about the prospects for change -- even if Trump and his congressional allies miraculously pass the Obamacare replacement legislation pending in the House.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d said Michael Cannon, a health care policy expert with the libertarian Cato Institute. \u201cIn fact, the bill as it exists right now does not make serious changes in Medicaid.\u201d\n\nEchoing the concerns of conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus and other factions, Cannon said that the prosed repeal of the Medicaid expansion is \u201cunserious\u201d because it doesn\u2019t begin to take effect until 2020 and contains too many loopholes.\n\nHe also argued that the proposed per capita matching grants to the states might have the unintended effect of encouraging states to enroll more able-bodied adults to generate more income while cutting back on benefits to vulnerable populations.\n\n\u201cSo the Medicaid provisions are just more of the same,\u201d Cannon insisted in an interview, dismissing the Ryan-Trump legislation as \u201cObamacare Lite.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/03/17", "title": "Is the US About to Turn Up the Heat on North Korea?", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/17/US-About-Turn-Heat-North-Korea", "text": "America\u2019s pivot to Asia under the Obama administration has developed sharper elbows under Trump.\n\nThis trip ostensibly is a diplomatic sweep of key countries to discuss many issues, including trade.

Tax increases are also out of the question. Trump and congressional Republican leaders are planning to unveil plans for massive corporate and individual tax cuts later this spring or summer.\n\nSo in the future, Trump will have little wiggle room politically other than to insist on more cuts to domestic programs and foreign aid and hope that his tax cuts will eventually produce the 4 percent annual GDP growth he is promising to expand the economy and generate more government revenue to offset spending.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that until the president and Congress are willing to address the real drivers of our debt, Medicare and Social Security, we will be complicit in shackling future generations with the financial burden of our own lack of discipline,\u201d Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) said Thursday. \u201cThis is not a legacy I want to leave.\u201d\n\nThe Navy\u2019s $35 Million Scandal: Hookers, Booze and a Guy Named \u2018Fat Leonard\u2019"}, {"date": "2017/03/17", "title": "The $92 Billion VA Still Doesn't Have Its Act Together", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/17/Why-Veterans-Affairs-Still-GAO-s-High-Risk-List", "text": "Nearly three years after the scandal first broke that hundreds of veterans had died waiting for medical treatment at Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers, the VA continues to operate under a cloud of doubt.\n\nDespite numerous reforms and improvements and tens of billions of dollars in new funding to upgrade medical treatment and eliminate long waiting lists, the VA remains on the Government Accountability Office\u2019s notorious \u201cHigh Risk List\u201d of agencies prone to mismanagement, waste and even fraud.\n\nRelated: VA Hospitals Struggle With a Growing Problem: Drug Theft by Employees\n\nThe VA \u2013 one of only a handful of federal departments that received a funding increase under President Trump\u2019s fiscal 2018 budget plan released on Thursday, will be undergoing yet another round of reforms and improvements under the new administration.\n\n\u201cWe're going to straighten out the VA for our veterans,\u201d Trump said in January, in announcing his choice of Dr. David Shulkin as the new VA secretary. \u201cI've promised that for a long time, and it's something I feel very, very strongly.\n\nThe VA operates one of the largest health care delivery systems in the country, including 168 medical centers and more than 1,000 outpatient facilities organized in regional networks. The number of people who have enrolled in the VA health care system has mushroomed from 7.9 million in fiscal year 2006 to nearly nine million last year.\n\nThroughout that same period, VA\u2019s Veterans Health Administration\u2019s total budget increased substantially, from $37.8 billion in FY 2006 to $91.2 billion in FY 2016. In response to the many serious and long-festering problems with access to VA health care, a $10 billion \u201cVeterans Access\u201d law was enacted in 2014 to provide temporary authority for veterans to obtain health care services from non-VA providers if they have to wait too long.\n\nRelated: Americans Sour on VA After Health Care Scandal\n\nBut despite these and some other notable improvements during the final years of the Obama administration and the leadership of former secretary Robert A. McDonald, the GAO added the troubled agency to its high-risk list in 2015 out of concern about the VA\u2019s inability to ensure the \u201ctimeliness, cost-effectiveness, quality and safety\u201d of veterans\u2019 health care.\n\nDebra A. Draper, GAO\u2019s director of health care, told the Senate Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee this week that VA officials had met only two of five crucial criteria for successful operation \u2013 including demonstrating leadership ability through the creation of task forces and other positive action and properly developing an action plan to address continued inadequacies in the agency\u2019s health care system.\n\nHowever, the VA has fallen well short of meeting three other criteria for escaping the list: demonstrating the capacity to address the major areas of concern, closely monitoring implementation of corrective actions, and demonstrating that progress is being made.\n\nSince the VA was added to the list in 2015, the GAO has conducted two follow-up reports examining mental health and primary care access at VA medical facilities. Both studies found \u201cwide variation in the time that veterans waited for primary and mental health care,\u201d Draper said.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Health Secretary Invested in a Company Linked to the Opioid Epidemic\n\nShe said those problems partly stemmed from \u201ca lack of clear, updated policies for appointment scheduling,\u201d which led to \u201cinconsistent and unreliable wait-time data.\u201d In short, for all its efforts and reforms, VA health care facilities continue to leave patients waiting too long to receive needed treatment.\n\nIndeed, last year there were reports that the wait time at VA facilities had gotten worse. Compared to the situation in 2015 levels, there were 70,000 more appointments that took veterans at least a month to be seen. The VA blamed the problem on a huge surge in demand for care, but it was apparent the problem had more to do with the confusing and complicated way Veterans Choice was set up.\n\nVA has implemented about 50 percent of the recommendations GAO has made to the agency. However, there continue to be more than 100 open recommendations related to VA health care. Nearly a quarter of those recommendations have remained open for three or more years.\n\nRelated: VA Program to Slash Patient Waiting Times a Bust\n\nThe GAO\u2019s high risk list dates to the early 1990s, and more than 60 different agencies and areas of government have been on the list at one time or another.

In a six-day tour of three nations, the unproven diplomat is tasked with persuading Japan, South Korea, and China to support a tough, military-first strategy to counter North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic-missile programs.\n\nUnless Tillerson has a lot of rabbits in his hat, it can\u2019t be done. All three nations have made their preference for new negotiations with the North Korean regime clear.\n\nRelated: F-35s and Navy SEALs: Trump\u2019s Powerful Warning to North Korea\n\nTillerson\u2019s tour is an opening round in an extended process. But early signals indicate that Washington risks serious damage to important relationships across the Pacific\u2014notably with China and South Korea\u2014if it remains as inflexible as it appears.\n\nIt has been plain since Barack Obama\u2019s final months in office that the status quo on the Korean Peninsula isn\u2019t working. Kim Jung-un, the North Korean erratic leader, fired roughly two dozen missiles last year and conducted the nation\u2019s fourth and fifth nuclear tests\u2014the last the most powerful to date. There have been five more missile launches already this year.\n\n\u201cWe have 20 years of a failed approach,\u201d Tillerson said after talks in Tokyo Thursday with Fumio Kishida, his Japanese counterpart. \u201cIn the face of this ever-escalating threat, it is clear that a different approach is required.\u201d\n\nThat was a good start. Subtly or otherwise, America\u2019s main allies in Asia have made it plain they judge the Obama administration\u2019s strategy since 2009\u2014sanctions combined with a fortified military posture\u2014a failure. So does Beijing. The alternatives, everyone agrees, are negotiations or military confrontation.\n\nRelated: Tillerson Underlines Cooperation With Japan, Seoul on North Korea\n\nBut is that where agreement between Washington and East Asia ends? At this early moment, it looks like it.\n\nTillerson was careful to avoid details of the administration\u2019s thinking. \u201cPart of the purpose of my visit to the region is to exchange views on a new approach,\u201d he said in Tokyo Thursday.\n\nAs diplomacy-speak that\u2019s good, but officials in Washington had already dispensed with the niceties by the time Tillerson boarded his plane. The Voice of America reported from the State Department Monday that \u201cWashington said it is \u2018moving farther away\u2019 from considering the option of direct engagement with the North Koreans.\u201d\n\nTwo days later an administration official told Reuters, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile defense system the Pentagon deployed in South Korea over China\u2019s vigorous objections: \u201cTHAAD is non-negotiable. This is one of those things where Beijing is just going to have to adapt or live in a perpetual cycle of outrage.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a worrisome idea of diplomacy with the world\u2019s No. 2 economy. It appears to be another example of what happens when the Pentagon, not State, runs Asia policy\u2014a problem in trans\u2013Pacific relations for the past seven decades.\n\nRelated: North Korea\u2019s Missile Test Leaves Trump with Three Options\n\nBefore Tillerson boarded his plane Wednesday evening, a common line among think tank experts was that he would eschew Clintonesque flash to \u201cquietly and effectively get the job done.\u201d Given what he\u2019s up against, a quiet trip\u2014and probably an effective one\u2014looks unlikely:\n\n\u2022 Japan. Tokyo will prove Tillerson\u2019s least complicated stop. After his summit with Trump last month, Premier Shinzo Abe signaled that Japan is prepared to participate if the Trump administration decides to reopen negotiations with the North. But while Abe prefers negotiations, his first concern is Japan\u2019s security, and he\u2019ll take it any way he can get it.\n\nAbe is a nationalist hawk of the old school, let\u2019s not forget. This week his government announced plans to send its largest naval vessel, a helicopter carrier, through the South China Sea to join U.S.\u2013led exercises in the Indian Ocean. It will be Japan\u2019s biggest naval deployment since 1945.\n\n\u2022 South Korea. Tillerson steps onto a very tricky path when he arrives in Seoul Friday. He\u2019s charged with persuading Seoul to hew to a hard line toward the North and accepting the deployment of the THAAD system, even though South Korean voters don\u2019t want either.\n\nRelated: North Korea Remains the Most Reviled Country Among Americans in New Poll\n\nEverything exploded when Park Geun-Hye, a hawk on North Korea and a strong Pentagon ally, was deposed on corruption charges one week ago. Elections are now due in May, and the opposition Democrats are ascendant. Moon Jae-in, their candidate, favors new talks with the North, reinstituting Kim Dae-Jung's \u201csunshine policy,\u201d and blocking the THAAD system. Moon\u2019s the clear favorite in the polls, with support hovering between 30 percent and 36 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see how Tillerson can hoe this row without making a mess. It\u2019s not the first time South Koreans have taken a stand against the Pentagon\u2019s plans, but Koreans won their admirable democracy the hard way, and the unpopular Park\u2019s fall leaves them especially prickly about it.\n\n\u2022 China. Beijing has been crystal clear on two points lately. One, it considers new negotiations a matter of urgency\u2014as it signaled dramatically when it cut off the North\u2019s coal shipments last month. Two, it is irate over the THAAD system in South Korea\u2014concerned that it is an unneeded provocation and gives the Pentagon the ability to peer deep inside Chinese territory.\n\nAs a clear measure of China\u2019s anxieties, the foreign ministry proposed last week that the U.S. and South Korea call off their annual military drills, now under way, in exchange for a suspension of the North\u2019s nuclear activities. Although Washington rejected the suggestion, the ministry repeated it on the eve of Tillerson\u2019s flight from Tokyo to Seoul.\n\nRelated: U.S. Deploys Anti-Missile System in South Korea\n\nTillerson\u2019s brief in Beijing is to smooth relations after a stony start when Trump took office while identifying trade-offs to induce Beijing to accept THAAD as a fact on the ground. That looks like another tough assignment for three reasons.\n\nOne, Beijing\u2019s signals indicate it doesn\u2019t consider THAAD any more negotiable than Washington does. Two, its calls for new negotiations with Pyongyang, probably via the \u201csix-party\u201d format that previously brought the U.S. to the table with five partners, have been incessant for some months.\n\nThree, Beijing hasn\u2019t been backing down on much lately, even when the stakes are high, as in the South China Sea. Does Washington have an enticement big enough to get the Chinese to cave on this one? It\u2019s unlikely.\n\nThe Trump administration is putting a lot at risk if the determination is to avoid the negotiation table. And with the Iran nuclear accord in view, there\u2019s no argument that a perilous standoff is the best \u201cnew approach.\u201d The dealmaker should deal on this one."}, {"date": "2017/03/16", "title": "Did Trump\u2019s Budget Chief Really Say Cutting Meals Programs Is \u2018Compassionate\u2019?", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/16/Did-Trump-s-Budget-Chief-Really-Say-Cutting-Meals-Programs-Compassionate", "text": "The White House press briefing on Thursday afternoon featured a near-meltdown by Press Secretary Sean Spicer as he sparred with reporters over President Trump\u2019s claims about surveillance during the 2016 election.

Around since the 1970s, CDBGs are used to fund a variety of programs at the discretion of the states receiving them.

This despite the fact that one of the major functions of PBS, for example, is creating educational content for young children who may not be getting the stimulation they need at home.\n\nThe OMB director also airily dismissed concern about the administration\u2019s decision to eliminate funding for programs meant to study and combat climate change. \u201cWe\u2019re not spending money on that anymore.

Trump is seeking deep cuts in a wide array of scientific endeavors, particularly within the Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies engaged in climate change research.\n\nThe NIH is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, which came in for cuts of more than $15 billion or nearly 18 percent of its operating funds. Trump\u2019s spending plan -- which is subject to review and alterations by lawmakers -- also calls for a \u201cmajor reorganization\u201d of NIH\u2019s 27 institutes and centers. Moreover, it would abolish the Fogarty International Center, which funds research on global health needs and initiatives.\n\n\u201cDrastic cuts to the National Institutes of Health budget run counter to the priorities of our nation, national security, and the aspirations of Americans,\u201d Mary Woolley, president and CEO of Research!

About 10 percent of NIH's budget supports projects conducted by nearly 6,000 scientists in its own laboratories, which are primarily located on the agency\u2019s campus in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nBetween fiscal 2003 and 2015, NIH fell into political disfavor and lost 22 percent of its capacity to fund research projects because of budget cuts, sequestration and inflationary losses. As the money dried up, NIH was forced to scale back its grant-making and other research activity substantially.\n\nBut that began to turn around a year ago when a bipartisan coalition got behind increased funding for the agency. Even one of Trump\u2019s senior campaign advisers, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA), called for a doubling of the agency\u2019s budget as a moral and financial imperative. Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the NIH, told reporters at the time that he was optimistic that funding in the future would be predictable and on the upswing.\n\nThree senior Republicans on key committees with spending authority and oversight over NIH played critical roles -- Sens. Roy Blunt (MO) and Lamar Alexander (TN) and Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma.

But experts say it will be difficult for President Donald Trump to meaningfully relax the rules under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, or CAFE.\n\nRelated: The Five Biggest Winners and Losers in Trump\u2019s Fiscal 2018 Budget\n\nStill, Trump said on Wednesday that the review would help boost the U.S. auto industry in short order.\n\n\"I'm sure you've all heard the big news that we're going to work on the CAFE standards so you can make cars in America again,\" Trump told auto workers during a rally in Detroit.\n\n\"We want to be the car capital of the world again.

That assessment was intended to determine how the industry was adapting to new standards and whether it was feasible to continue ratcheting up the average fuel efficiency as planned.\n\nMaking the case for rollback\n\nFormer EPA liaison and Obama campaign staffer Dan Kanninen said any impact from Wednesday's reopening of the review would likely be limited.\n\nRelated: This Big Washington Battle Could Hit You in the Wallet\n\n\"It's not rescinding the entire rule. It's not rescinding the standards. It would be quite difficult to do that, but it sends a signal that [Trump] is interested in going down that route,\" said Kanninen, now vice president for issues and advocacy at the Smoot Tewes Group, a lobbying firm.\n\nUnder the 2007 law that created the CAFE standards, the Trump administration and automakers must show that stricter tailpipe rules would be financially detrimental in order to revise the current schedule, Kanninen noted.\n\n\"They've got to prove real hardship on the cost, not just an inconvenience,\" Kanninen said.\n\nAutomakers worry they will have to produce small, fuel-efficient cars that are currently out of fashion in today's low oil price environment to offset the impact of gas guzzlers on their fleet's average efficiency.\n\nResearchers at Indiana's University's School of Public and Environmental Affairs recently concluded the standards would have a negative impact on the economy for a few years to roughly a decade, depending on a number of market factors.

Savings at the pump would ultimately allow consumers to spend money elsewhere in the economy.\n\nTrump's options\n\nThat leaves room for interpretation of economic harm.\n\nAny rollback of the rules is likely to be challenged in court by states or environmentalists, and there is a long legal and scientific record that supports the Obama-era standards, including a 2007 Supreme Court verdict on regulating heat-trapping emissions from autos, experts say.\n\nWhether the Trump administration prevails will hinge on the judicial panel that hears the challenge, but some policy options are more likely to be overturned than others, said John Graham, a former senior official under George W. Bush who worked on fuel efficiency standards.\n\n\"There is significant chance of judicial reversal if they're not careful on the review and economic analysis that supports the new rule-making,\" said Graham, now dean of Indiana University's SPEA.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Government Reorganization: Hatchet Job, or Just Major Surgery?\n\nThe option least likely to be reversed is extending the deadline for automakers to achieve an average 54.5 miles per gallon for their fleets to 2030, he said.\n\nTrump could also provide more credits to car manufacturers for using fuel-saving technologies. That would give them more leeway to make gas guzzlers, but a judicial panel may view that as a bolder move, said Graham.\n\nThe riskiest move would be to freeze the standards at current levels until fuel prices rise to a level that typically incentivizes consumers to buy more efficient vehicles.\n\nJamie Albertine, auto analyst at Consumer Edge Research, told CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" he believes an extension is likely. On Wednesday, he noted automakers still face tough tailpipe regulations in California, as well as in Europe and Asia.\n\nMorningstar analyst David Whiston told \"Closing Bell\" he doesn't expect automakers to shift away from fuel efficient cars in their product portfolios.\n\nTrouble at the EPA\n\nThe EPA also faces administrative hurdles to tackling a substantive review of CAFE standards, according to Kanninen. The agency has yet to fill a number of political appointments and is facing deep budget cuts and potential layoffs under Trump's so-called skinny budget.\n\nThat leaves career officials to carry out much of the CAFE review. Many are probably not on board with Trump and EPA chief Scott Pruitt's de-regulation agenda, and therefore may not arrive at the conclusions on CAFE standards the White House would prefer, Kanninen said.\n\nThe EPA, Department of Transportation and California's Air Resources Board determined last year automakers would be able to meet 2022-2025 targets, though Kanninen said the average efficiency will likely come closer to 52 miles per gallon due to Americans' preference for trucks and SUVs.\n\n\"What the folks in the Trump administration don't necessarily appreciate or fully understand is these agencies are not ideological agencies. They're agencies based on law and science,\" he said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on CNBC.

Last October, an officer of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service was sentenced to 12 years in prison for helping to keep Fat Leonard one step ahead of the law by supplying him with more than 80 reports on his criminal activities.\n\nThe highest-ranking officer charged this week is retired Rear Adm.

The plan proposed Thursday guts various government agencies, from the State Department to the Environmental Protection Agency, but it also eliminates completely many others, among them the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n\nCPB provides grants and other funding to public television and radio stations across the country and is also the umbrella organization for well-known broadcast entities like the Public Broadcasting System and National Public Radio.\n\nRelated: The Five Biggest Winners and Losers in Trump\u2019s Fiscal 2018 Budget\n\nThe corporation\u2019s grants to independently owned radio and television public broadcasting stations provide a very significant share of their funding in most cases, particularly in rural areas where government funding is scarce and the opportunity to recruit private sector sponsors is more limited.\n\nMany members of the Republican Party have, for decades, harbored the desire to eliminate CPB and the programming it supports. Their reasons generally fall into one of two areas: They object to the idea of the government funding broadcast media that competes with the private sector and/or they believe that the programs supported by CPB funding tend to be biased toward a more liberal point of view.\n\nHowever, on the question of competition, officials point out that most of the stations CPB supports are in largely underserved parts of the country where corporate media sees little upside to an investment in newsgathering or other local programming.\n\nThe complaints of bias may feel more justified. On the whole, the audience for CPB supported programming skews more Democratic and liberal than the rest of the country, However, NPR, PBS, and the stations that accept CBP funding are all bound by requirements that they balance their coverage and do not take political positions. Additionally, NPR and PBS tend to score very well in surveys asking people what news sources they view as trustworthy.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s \u2018Hard Power\u2019 Budget Gives Billions to Defense, Guts Domestic Programs\n\nOthers have argued against the CPB on fiscal grounds, saying that cutting it would simply save the taxpayer money, but in the context of the Trump administration\u2019s budget proposal, those claims ring a little hollow. The CPB had a budget of $445 million in 2016, equal to 0.07 percent of the administration\u2019s proposed Pentagon budget, and only 0.8 percent of the $54 billion increase the Trump budget would give to defense spending next year.\n\nIn a statement released Thursday, CPB President and CEO Patricia Harrison defended her organization.\n\n\u201cPublic media is one of America\u2019s best investments,\u201d she said. \u201cAt approximately $1.35 per citizen per year, it pays huge dividends to every American. From expanding opportunity, beginning with proven children\u2019s educational content to providing essential news and information as well as ensuring public safety and homeland security through emergency alerts, this vital investment strengthens our communities. It is especially critical for those living in small towns and in rural and underserved areas.\u201d\n\nSome of the bigger names in the public broadcasting universe, including NPR and PBS, have strong private sector and philanthropic partnerships that provide a considerable share of their funding. But revenue from member stations that buy their programming would be slashed by the funding cuts, leading to what Harrison described as an inevitable disappearance of public programming.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Government Reorganization: Hatchet Job, or Just Major Surgery?\n\n\u201cThere is no viable substitute for federal funding that ensures Americans have universal access to public media\u2019s educational and informational programming and services,\u201d she said. \u201cThe elimination of federal funding to CPB would initially devastate and ultimately destroy public media\u2019s role in early childhood education, public safety, connecting citizens to our history, and promoting civil discussions \u2013 all for Americans in both rural and urban communities.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Harrison is wrong, and there would be enough support from the public to support the stations that CPB now helps fund. But it would take an awful lot of tote bags and promotional coffee mug giveaways to fill what promises to be a funding gap in the hundreds of millions of dollars."}, {"date": "2017/03/16", "title": "Trump's Health Chief Fails to Convince Patients They'll Get the Care They Need", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/16/Trumps-Health-Chief-Fails-Convince-Patients-Theyll-Get-Care-They-Need", "text": "Health and Human Secretary Tom Price, on Wednesday night, spent an uncomfortable hour in a CNN-hosted town hall Wednesday night, answering questions from stony-faced cancer patients, medical professionals and others demanding an explanation of how Americans -- particularly poor and low-income Americans -- will be able to afford health care coverage under the Republicans\u2019 proposed replacement for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHis appearance was largely overwhelmed by the furor over massive budget cuts proposed by the Trump administration and a federal court ruling that struck down the president\u2019s second attempt to institute a ban on people from six majority-Muslim countries entering the United States. And that\u2019s a shame because the difficulty he had offering clear answers to the concerns his questioners raised suggests future struggles as the GOP tries to sell the bill to the American people.\n\nRelated: How Republicans Got Trapped by Their Health Care Promises\n\nPrice, a physician himself who Represented Georgia in Congress before accepting a spot in the Trump cabinet, sat down with hosts Wolf Blitzer and Dana Bash just days after the Congressional Budget Office released its estimate predicting that 24 million fewer Americans would have health insurance coverage by 2026 if the AHCA becomes law.\n\nBash brought up the agency\u2019s finding and asked how the GOP could claim that its proposal increases access to health coverage in the face of a number like that.\n\n\u201cThis is very interesting and it's an important question,\u201d Price acknowledged, before going on to largely avoid answering it. The HHS secretary fell back, as other supporters of the bill have done in recent days, on claiming that additional regulatory changes and further legislation removing restrictions on the health insurance markets will generate so much choice and competition that the markets will drive costs down to make insurance affordable for everyone.\n\nHowever, he didn\u2019t specify a single regulation that he would do away with, and the only legislative priorities he identified were removing barriers to the sale of insurance across state lines and reform of the medical malpractice laws, neither of which, according to experts, would have a large impact on the price of coverage.\n\nRelated: How Health Care Is Crippling the Speaker of the House\n\nPrice then faced a question from Brian Kline, a Pennsylvania man in recovery from colon cancer, whose care was paid for by the Medicaid expansion that the Affordable Care Act created.\n\n\u201cMedicaid expansion saved my life and saved me from medical bankruptcy,\u201d Kline said. \u201cNow, I earn $11.66 an hour at my retail job. And obviously, I cannot afford to pay for my cancer care out of pocket. My life really depends on having access to my doctors and medical care.\n\n\u201cGetting a cancer diagnosis is bad enough. But Medicaid expansion gives me the economic security in knowing that funding is always going to be there for my cancer care. So my question for you, Secretary Price, is pretty straightforward. Why do you want to take -- why do you want to take away my Medicaid expansion?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is that we don't,\u201d Price replied. \u201cWe don't want to take care away from anybody. What we want to make certain, though, is that every single American has access to the kind of coverage and care that they want for themselves.\u201d\n\nRelated: Scrambling to Save Their Health Plan, Republicans Consider a Major Change\n\nKline indicated that he was unsatisfied by Price\u2019s answer, but the discussion eventually moved on.\n\nA West Virginia physician, after pointing out that the AHCA would throw one in five of his low-income patients off the Medicaid rolls, asked, \u201cDo you think the members of Congress really understand the hardship that patients will have, particularly those on the edge if they lose their health insurance? And how can we help those patients who don't have health insurance?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, we're not interested in having anybody lose health insurance,\u201d Price said. But instead of addressing the people who would lose insurance under the GOP plan, he pointed out that there are 20 million Americans who chose to pay a penalty rather than comply with the ACA\u2019s individual mandate.\n\nBash then pointed out that the AHCA would massively cut Medicaid spending, lopping about 25 percent. How, she asked, can he promise \u201cthat these people can continue to get the care that they got under Obamacare?\u201d\n\nRelated: Why the House GOP Health Care Replacement Plan Is Collapsing\n\n\u201cThe premise of that question is that the way that you measure the success of Medicaid is by how much money goes into it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe the way that you measure the success of a program is whether or not it takes care of the individuals, the beneficiaries that are actually needing that program.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThe fact of the matter is that we believe there's a better way to provide the kind of care and services for Medicaid patients\u201d and said that is \u201cthe states, not Washington, D.C.\u201d are allowed to design the programs, the levels of care will be improved despite the hundreds of billions of dollars in funding the system would lose over the next ten years if the AHCA were approved.\n\nPrice faced a question from a former US Marine, now in recovery from opioid addiction, who worried that the AHCA eliminated the requirement that Medicaid provides care to addicts.\n\nPrice insisted that care would still be available, though not necessarily through Medicaid, and returned to the idea that returning authority for designing treatment to the states will work wonders on the system.\n\nRelated: How the GOP Health Plan Would Devastate Mentally Ill, Addicted\n\n\u201cMany of them have been hamstrung by the federal government, not being able to do what they believe is most helpful for their vulnerable population,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there are wonderful ways I believe in addressing this in a positive way if we keep our focus on the patient -- not on government, but on the patient.\u201d\n\nOne of the more dramatic moments of the night came when Price was confronted Karen Santana, of Brooklyn, who was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 30.\n\nPointing out that the Republican plan would eliminate the individual mandate, allowing young and healthy people not to purchase health insurance if they are willing to risk a temporary 30 percent surcharge if they get sick and decide they need coverage.\n\n\u201cIf the mandate is removed, how will insurance companies be able to afford to pay for people with pre-existing conditions, just like me?\u201d\n\nRelated: How the Tea Party Could End Up Killing the GOP Health Care Plan\n\nPrice answered with a litany of complaints about the Affordable Care Act and repetition of the promise that prices will come down so dramatically under AHCA that even a cancer survivor would be able to afford good coverage with the relatively small tax subsidies available under the plan.\n\nBlitzer pushed back, pointing out the reason insurance works is that people who buy it and don\u2019t wind up needing coverage subsidize those who do.\n\n\u201cSo I think what you just said is that you want to force young individuals to purchase coverage so that they can participate in a government program.\u201d\n\nPrice was falling back on the \u201cfreedom\u201d argument that House Speaker Paul Ryan has used to defend the AHCA, insisting again that unspecified future changes to the system would create so many great plans that young and healthy consumers will happily purchase coverage.\n\nRelated: Now It\u2019s the Democrats\u2019 Turn to Threaten a Government Shutdown\n\nBut Santana pushed back, saying that most young people really don\u2019t feel that they need coverage. \u201cI want to say that when I was diagnosed, I was 30 years old, and, you know, in the prime of my life, and I had a 9-month-old son. You know, I never thought -- I was very young. I never thought I was going to be diagnosed with this, especially at such a young age. And I know people that are in their 20s and are diagnosed with very severe diseases.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we want them all to have health coverage,\u201d Price insisted. \u201cEvery single one of them.\u201d\n\nHow that\u2019s going to happen, though, was still a mystery at the end of the night."}, {"date": "2017/03/16", "title": "This Big Washington Battle Could Hit You in the Wallet", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/16/Big-Washington-Battle-Could-Hit-You-Wallet", "text": "If you\u2019ve ever had to dispute a charge on a credit card, fix a mix-up with your mortgage or stop a debt collector from hounding you, you\u2019ve benefited from the work of a federal watchdog agency that is now under fire in Washington.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau arguably has done as much to change the financial lives of consumers as any other government agency in history.\n\nMost Americans who have a credit card, bank account, mortgage, student or personal loan, or who care about their credit rating, have been helped by the CFPB. Some 29 million of them, or about 1 of every 8 adults, are receiving direct financial relief \u2014 money returned to them \u2014 as a result of the bureau\u2019s work since it opened six years ago.\n\nRelated: The Five Biggest Winners and Losers in Trump\u2019s Fiscal 2018 Budget \u200b\n\nA review of the agency\u2019s record by NerdWallet found that for every $1 in federal spending on the bureau, more than $4 has been placed back in consumers\u2019 pockets. The agency says it has saved or returned to Americans nearly $12 billion since 2011, while costing taxpayers $2.9 billion to operate.\n\nSavings Misleading, Critics Say\n\nBut as congressional conservatives and the Trump administration look to slash federal regulations that they believe have harmed businesses and consumers, the young bureau has been targeted by opponents who want it eliminated.\n\nCritics say the dollar relief the agency claims it has provided consumers is misleading because it fails to account for the costs businesses have absorbed or passed along to customers in the form of higher fees to comply with the CFPB\u2019s regulations, which include new rules to make the mortgage market safer.\n\nRelated: Why So Many CEOs Are Cozying Up to Trump\n\nThe figures also do not account for the hidden damage done to people who cannot qualify for loans under the new rules, agency opponents say.\n\nHowever, NerdWallet found that nearly all financial consumers have benefited from the agency in some way. (Disclosure: NerdWallet CEO Tim Chen is a member of the CFPB Consumer Advisory Board.)\n\nFor example, the bureau slapped Wells Fargo with a $100 million fine last year following a fake accounts scandal involving some 2 million customers. The consumer agency has ordered other large banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citibank and its subsidiaries, to pay back hundreds of millions of dollars in restitution, alleging they charged millions of their customers for services they never received.\n\nThe agency has also taken aim at debt collectors, who have threatened to have debtors arrested over unpaid bills; for-profit colleges, whose predatory lending practices have cost many borrowers tens of thousands of dollars; credit reporting companies, which the bureau says misled consumers about the cost and usefulness of the credit scores they marketed; and mortgage lenders, whose lax lending standards led to millions of foreclosures.\n\nIn addition, the CFPB created a new way of monitoring the financial landscape, building an online hub where customers could lodge grievances against companies and get support in fighting their problems.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Won\u2019t Touch Entitlement Reform\u2026Yet\n\nSince going online in 2011, the bureau\u2019s consumer complaint portal has collected more than 1 million responses. Unlike other government agencies that field consumer complaints, the CFPB posts its publicly, including the names of companies and a detailed description of the allegations.\n\nBanking industry leaders want those narratives taken offline. They say the write-ups are riddled with inaccuracies and can be misleading for consumers, causing them to choose products and services that might not be best for them.\n\nAgency Gives Weight to Consumers\u2019 Complaints\n\nThe mere existence of a CFPB complaint may force companies to resolve conflicts, says Raychelle Burks, who contacted the agency after she had problems setting up a repayment plan with her student loan servicer Nelnet.\n\nBurks, an assistant professor of chemistry at St. Edward\u2019s University in Texas, says the company refused to answer her calls and sent her letters claiming she was not responding to its inquiries.\n\nShe provided the CFPB and the Department of Education with the dates and times of her calls and copies of correspondence. Within days, Nelnet\u2019s representatives contacted her to arrange a payment plan.\n\n\u201cJust filing the complaint and having a claim number \u2014 all of a sudden, this loan servicer acted completely differently,\u201d she says.\n\nNelnet did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNerdWallet\u2019s review of the CFPB\u2019s performance included dozens of changes implemented by the agency and their effect on the consumer marketplace.\n\nNerdWallet found that the bureau helped stabilize a housing market and economy reeling after the Great Recession by requiring new levels of transparency with mortgages and investments. The agency says it has returned billions of dollars in improper fees to credit card holders and has given all consumers additional credit card rights.\n\nMixed Reaction in Congress\n\n\u201cWe know exactly what the landscape would look like without the CFPB,\u201d Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts told NerdWallet. \u201cWe saw it in the 1990s and in the 2000s in the run-up to the biggest financial crash since the Great Depression.\u201d\n\nNot only did the agency help the nation recover from the recession, but it also will help prevent another crash, she said.\n\nRelated: Now It\u2019s the Democrats\u2019 Turn to Threaten a Government Shutdown\n\nWarren helped start the agency and has been a lightning rod for its critics who say the CFPB has misinterpreted laws, stifled business expansion and made it difficult for companies to plan or budget for the future.\n\nThose opponents are pushing to gut the bureau or at least sharply curtail its powers, starting with firing its director, Richard Cordray, whom they view as a rogue regulator.\n\n\u201cThe CFPB is potentially the most powerful, unaccountable agency in the history of government,\u201d Rep. Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, told NerdWallet. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can believe in democracy and believe in the CFPB.\u201d\n\nBrad Wolverton is a reporter at NerdWallet, a personal finance website.

At the same time, Trump would slash spending on foreign aid and gut scores of domestic programs and agencies. The State Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Labor were among the hardest hit.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s \u2018Hard Power\u2019 Budget Gives Billions to Defense, Guts Domestic Programs\n\nTrump\u2019s spending plan for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 is focused exclusively on the one-third of the roughly $4 trillion annual federal budget that goes for discretionary programs and general government operations. A more comprehensive budget plan including Social Security, Medicare and other entitlement programs that are the main drivers of the deficit will be released by the administration later this spring.\n\nMoreover, the spending document released today is only the president\u2019s opening bid in what is likely to be a contentious budget debate in Congress this year. The Republican-controlled Congress will have the final say on spending priorities, including whether to lift legal caps to accommodate all the additional defense spending. Some lawmakers, including Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), have predicted that some of Trump\u2019s more draconian spending cuts would be \u201cdead on arrival\u201d on Capitol Hill.\n\nNonetheless, Trump\u2019s spending proposals can\u2019t be ignored, and they will play an important role in determining budgetary policy in the coming year. Here is a list of five of the biggest winners and losers in Trump\u2019s budget blueprint:\n\nWinners\n\nDepartment of Defense \u2013 10% increase. As part of Trump\u2019s call to rebuild the U.S. military from stem to stern, the president is seeking a base budget of $574 billion in fiscal 2018, up $53 billion from the current year. The administration is also seeking an additional $65 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations.\n\n\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security \u2013 6.8% increase. With a major focus on border security and cracking down and deporting illegal immigrants, Trump has requested $44.1 billion in the coming year, an increase of $2.8 billion. The department will hire 500 new border patrol agents and 1,000 new immigration and customs agents. It will also begin planning for construction of a nearly 2,000-mile wall along the southern border.\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs \u2013 6% increase. Trump complained that the Obama administration didn\u2019t do enough to help veterans receive adequate health care coverage and benefits. He is requesting $78.9 billion, or $4.4 billion more than the current level. He is also seeking $3.5 billion to fund the Veterans Choice Program to assure veterans can obtain prompt medical services.\n\n\n\nDepartment of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration \u2013 11.3% increase. The Energy Department has major responsibility for the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons stockpile. Trump is seeking $13.9 billion, or $1.4 billion more than this year. The administration wants to revive the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada.\n\n\n\nSocial Security Administration \u20130.2% increase. Few tasks are more politically important than getting out Social Security checks on time. But Trump\u2019s budget is so tight outside of spending on national security and defense matters that the Social Security Administration was lucky to escape with a minuscule increase. The president has requested $9.3 billion, just a fraction more than this year\u2019s spending level.\n\nLosers\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency \u2013 31% decrease. Trump campaigned vowing to dismantle the EPA and its climate change regulations that have adversely impacted the coal industry and energy production. The EPA is being hammered more than any other agency and would receive only $5.7 billion, down $2.6 billion from this year. Trump would eliminate more than 50 programs and 3,200 jobs.\n\n\n\nDepartment of State and USAID \u2013 29% decrease. The administration insists that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson shouldn\u2019t take it personally, but it may be hard for the former ExxonMobil CEO to swallow this humiliating cut. The White House budget office says the lion\u2019s share of the cuts will be in foreign aid, with only a small part related to diplomacy. But there would also be sharp reductions in UN peacekeeping activities and climate change programs. Trump is asking for $25.6 billion, down $10.1 billion from this year.\n\n\n\nDepartment of Agriculture \u2013 21% decrease. Looks like farmers aren\u2019t among Trump\u2019s favorites. The president has requested $17.9 billion, down $4.7 billion this year.\n\n\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services\u201418% decrease. HHS is in the cross hairs of the Trump administration because it has been responsible for running the Obamacare program and other health care policies. Trump requested $69 billion, down $15.1 billion from this year. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) which is part of HHS would lose $5.8 billion for research grants. Department of Housing and Urban Development \u2013 13.2% decrease. Trump repeatedly voiced concern about the plight of blacks in decaying and crime-ridden urban areas, but that wasn\u2019t reflected in his budget request that would result in deep cuts in housing vouchers and community development programs. Trump requested $40.7 billion, down $6.2 billion of this year.\n\nThere are plenty of other casualties in the Trump budget. For example, the administration is seeking to eliminate funding for nearly 20 other long-standing and popular programs, including the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the Legal Services Corporation, and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation."}, {"date": "2017/03/16", "title": "Will Steve Bannon Go to War Against the Big Banks?", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/16/Will-Steve-Bannon-Go-War-Against-Big-Banks", "text": "The vice-chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. floated a plan earlier this week that would require big banks to separate their commercial and investment arms \u2014 essentially a return to the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act that for decades kept the Citibanks of the world walled off from the securities business.\n\nThe FDIC\u2019s Thomas Hoenig said in a speech to the Institute of International Bankers that investment activities and commercial banking, such as holding deposits and lending to consumers, should be handled by distinct units. In exchange, big banks would get looser capital and liquidity requirements.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump often promised a return to Glass-Steagall and in a last-minute change last July, that position was inserted into the Republican Party platform, surprising many. At a press briefing last Thursday, Trump Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in response to a question that the administration remains committed to restoring Glass-Steagall.\n\nStill, with so many former Wall Street players holding top positions in the Trump administration, any new iteration of Glass-Steagall would seem like a non-starter.\n\nRelated: Trump Calls for '21st Century' Glass-Steagall Banking Law\n\nBut there are several factors that could make a \u201cGlass-Steagall for the 21st Century\u201d \u2014 which Trump called for last October and which Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said at his confirmation hearing should be considered \u2014 more of a possibility.\n\nFirst, most of the Wall Streeters in the Cabinet or other positions of power \u2014 such as economic adviser Gary Cohn, Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross \u2014 do not come from the big commercial banks but from investment banks, which might actually benefit from not having behemoths such as Citi, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo playing in their sand box.\n\nIn what may have been a telling moment, Mnuchin told the Senate that the Volcker Rule, a component of the Dodd-Frank financial reform act that restricts speculative investments by banks, should apply only to banks that benefit \u201cfrom federal deposit insurance.\" That means big commercial banks and investment banks that also offer customers some commercial banking functions.\n\nIn addition, Trump confidant and early supporter Carl Icahn, the billionaire investor, called for a reinstatement of Glass-Steagall in a 2014 interview with Fox News.\n\nRelated: Trump the Populist Is Trying to Hobble a Champion of the Little Guy\n\nPerhaps the biggest reason that the Trump administration could embrace a version of Glass-Steagall is influential adviser Steve Bannon. In a Wall Street Journal profile on Tuesday, the self-described economic nationalist talked about how the nest-egg losses his father suffered during the financial crisis of 2008 have informed his outlook. \u201cEverything since then has come from there. All of it,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd in a video discussion at the 2014 annual conference of the Rome-based Human Dignity Institute, Bannon talked about a \u201ccrisis in capitalism\u201d and complained that no one had been jailed because of the financial crisis. He said the big bank \u201cbailouts were completely and totally unfair. It didn\u2019t make those financial institutions any stronger, and it bailed out a bunch of people \u2014 by the way\u2026people that have all gone to Yale, and Harvard, they went to the finest institutions in the West. They should have known better.\u201d\n\nBannon said that seeing \u201call the upside [go] to the hedge funds and the investment bank[s] and to the crony capitalist[s] with stock increases and bonus increases\u201d was part of what was fueling a populist uprising.\n\nA November 2016 Journal story said that Bannon\u2019s remarks suggested an endorsement of Glass-Steagall, though it remains unclear if he still holds those views. Still, Bannon ran Breibart News until he joined the Trump campaign late last summer, and during his tenure the right-wing news site on more than one occasion called for a return to Glass-Steagall.\n\nTrump wasn\u2019t the only candidate to call for a reinstatement of Glass-Steagall during last year\u2019s election campaign; Democrat Bernie Sanders did, too. Both pointed out that the barriers between commercial and investment banks were broken down by legislation signed by former President Bill Clinton in 1999 \u2014 a clear jab at Hillary Clinton \u2014 and suggested that rolling back Glass-Steagall helped bring on the financial crisis, though economists and regulation experts are divided about its impact.\n\nRelated: Bill Clinton Still Can\u2019t Fess Up to One of His Biggest Blunders\n\nIn a story last August, The Atlantic laid out the wide range of views. Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich wrote: \u201cI\u2019ve\u2026heard bank executives claim there\u2019s no reason to resurrect Glass-Steagall because none of the big banks actually failed. This is like arguing lifeguards are no longer necessary at beaches where no one has drowned.\u201d\n\nBut John Berlau of the Competitive Enterprise Institute had a vastly different position. \u201cSince Glass-Steagall forbade \u2018Main Street\u2019 commercial banks from venturing into investment banking, it actually protected Wall Street investment banks such as Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs from competition, enabling them to get bigger.\u2026 And in the end, it was pure investment banks such as Bear and Lehman Brothers \u2014 neither of which had merged with commercial banks \u2014 that were the first dominoes to fall in the financial crisis.\u201d\n\nReinstating the original structure of Glass-Steagall is probably not in the cards. Mnuchin said in January that \u201cSeparating out banks and investment banks right now\u2026would have very big implications,\u201d including, as Bloomberg noted, \u201cpotentially hurting liquidity, the capital markets and lending.\u201d But he did endorse looking at new ways to wall off bank risk.\n\nToday, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said she had seen no concrete proposals and didn\u2019t know what a modern-day Glass-Steagall would look like. She also said: \u201cI don\u2019t think [rolling back Glass-Steagall] was the cause of the financial crisis,\u201d adding that bank holding companies have been strengthened since the crisis and investment banking activities are now more appropriately capitalized. \u201cBut,\u201d Yellen said, \u201cobviously we would look at any proposals.\u201d\n\nOne other thing might give the president pause: Two of his arch-enemies from both sides of the aisle, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren and Republican Senator John McCain have jointly proposed an update to Glass-Steagall.\n\nIf Bannon were to pick this fight, he would have allies \u2014 but also heavy resistance."}, {"date": "2017/03/16", "title": "How Republicans Got Trapped by Their Health Care Promises", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/03/16/How-Republicans-Got-Trapped-Their-Health-Care-Promises", "text": "During the election campaign in 2015 and 2016, Donald Trump repeatedly insisted that he didn\u2019t want anything to do with entitlement reform. Even while promising to repeal Obamacare and Medicaid expansion, which was included in the Affordable Care Act, Trump promised not to touch Medicare or Social Security.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican, and I\u2019m not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid,\u201d Trump told David Brody in May 2015. Since then, he has remained steadfast on that promise, even as Republican leadership insists they can convince him to take on the challenge of entitlement reform during the next three years.\n\nRelated: How Health Care Is Crippling the Speaker of the House\n\nAfter seeing the reaction from some Republicans to just a return of Medicaid to the status quo ante of 2009, Trump looks wise indeed to kick that can down the road. Rather than offer an honest assessment of the consequences of rolling back a costly and unsupportable mandate, everyone tried to promise nothing would change \u2013 and then got trapped by reality.\n\nBefore Monday\u2019s score from the Congressional Budget Office, Republican leadership on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue argued that the American Health Care Act (AHCA) would not leave any Americans in the lurch. In an op-ed for USA Today last week, Speaker Paul Ryan assured readers that they would have a stable transition.\n\n\u201cAs we move from a Washington-driven system to a more vibrant market,\u201d Ryan wrote, \u201cwe will make sure no one will have the rug pulled out from under them.\u201d The day before the score came out, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price went even further. Price told NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd on Meet the Press that \u201cnobody will be worse off financially in the process that we\u2019re going through.\u201d\n\nThe next day, the CBO released its analysis of the AHCA, and it made clear that some Americans will face negative impacts from the AHCA. In the first year of Obamacare repeal, CBO estimates that there will be 14 million more uninsured than under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) \u2013 but those will result from the end of mandates that force people to buy insurance. By 2020, though, the Medicaid expansion in the ACA will end, and current and projected recipients on that safety-net program will comprise the bulk of the 24 million more Americans expected to be without insurance by 2026.\n\nRelated: Why the House GOP Health Care Replacement Plan Is Collapsing\n\nThe next day, Republicans tried pushing back on the CBO\u2019s figures \u2013 but mainly avoided the Medicaid changes. Ryan told Fox News that he was \u201cencouraged\u201d by the CBO report, but that \u201cthey sort of overestimate the uninsured number.\u201d Price said the administration\u2019s analysts \u201cdisagree strenuously with the report that was put out.\u201d\n\nOMB director Mick Mulvaney stressed on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe that the CBO missed widely on its estimates for enrollment in Obamacare, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t believe the facts are correct.\u201d When Kasie Hunt challenged Mulvaney on the Medicaid rollback, he fell back on the private-market argument about those \u201cwho have coverage but don\u2019t have care,\u201d an argument that does not apply to Medicaid, as the rollback does nothing to improve access to those on the entitlement program.\n\nAll of this dances around a very clear reality: the Medicaid rollback will impact several million Americans who gained this benefit in the ACA. The impact of an Obamacare repeal on Medicaid should come as no surprise; indeed, Republicans have advocated repeal for the last seven years ever since Congress passed Obamacare, and that always included returning Medicaid to its 2009 parameters. Republicans set up a false expectation of zero impact, and now are blaming the CBO for reporting the obvious.\n\nIn fact, they are stepping on what should be an overall positive message. Despite gloom-and-doom predictions from Democrats, the CBO concluded that the AHCA will not destabilize insurer markets, and will eventually begin to bring premium prices back down as coverage alternatives and rational risk allocation return. It cuts $1.2 trillion in taxes while reducing deficit spending by $337 billion \u2013 a remarkable combination.\n\nRelated: Scrambling to Save Their Health Plan, Republicans Consider a Major Change\n\nAs Avik Roy points out at Forbes, the CBO\u2019s analysis doesn\u2019t even address \u201cthe macroeconomic effects that those tax cuts would have on economic growth, and thereby on greater tax revenues.\u201d Nor does it address the potential for wage and employment growth with the elimination of employer mandates, employment caps on their enforcement, and full-time work requirements.\n\nThe flustered, unprepared, and arguably disingenuous response from Republicans this week does not bode well for future efforts on serious entitlement reform. The tens of trillions in unfunded mandates that will eventually bury the US economy and impose crippling debt do not result from offering too few benefits from these programs; those burdens result from too much expansion of entitlements, both in breadth and scope.\n\nAt some point, entitlement reform means restricting benefits, delaying eligibility, and increasing contributions in some combination. There are no end games to fiscal solvency for these programs that keep all their current promises and obligations. One way or another, bad news will be part of the effort, even while necessary to prevent much worse news.\n\nAny serious effort will require brutal honesty, courageous leadership, and a shared sense of fiscal crisis between those who govern and are governed, but it starts with the latter being forthright with the former. This week hasn\u2019t given much reason for confidence in the ability of reformers to deliver on any of those necessary qualities."}, {"date": "2017/03/16", "title": "Trump\u2019s \u2018Hard Power\u2019 Budget Gives Billions to Defense, Guts Domestic Programs", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/16/Trump-s-Hard-Power-Budget-Gives-Billions-Defense-Guts-Domestic-Programs", "text": "President Trump will formally unveil a budget plan on Thursday that makes good on his campaign pledges to rebuild the military, crack down on illegal immigrants, and construct a wall along the southern border with Mexico while slashing spending on foreign aid, environmental enforcement and scores of other domestic programs he derided throughout the 2016 campaign.\n\n\u201cThis is the \u2018America First\u2019 budget,\u201d White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said Wednesday, invoking Trump\u2019s signature campaign theme while asserting that the budget document directly reflects the priorities Trump established on the campaign trail. \u201cThere\u2019s no question this is a hard-power budget, it is not a soft-power budget, Mulvaney said.\n\nRelated: Trump Could Face His First Fiscal Crisis Over Raising the Debt Ceiling\n\nTrump\u2019s fiscal 2017 and 2018 budget blueprint \u2013 which is subject to congressional approval -- would boost defense spending this year by an additional $30 billion and by another $54 billion in the fiscal year that begins next October 1 \u2013 a roughly 10 percent increase.\n\nThe budget would also shower the Department of Homeland Security and immigration and border patrol agencies with billions of fresh dollars aimed at stemming the flow of illegal immigrants into the country and blocking the flow of refugees from the Middle East and other countries. The budget also makes the first down payments on the cost of building a wall along the border with Mexico. That will begin with a relatively modest $1.5 billion appropriation this year, a small fraction of the estimated $25 billion overall cost that was Trump said would be paid by Mexico.\n\nThat would be followed by an additional $2.6 billion in fiscal 2018, to provide the administration with time and resources to design the wall and set a construction timeline for arguably Trump\u2019s most expensive and controversial infrastructure project.\n\nRelated: Five Big Challenges Facing Trump\u2019s New Budget Chief\n\n\n\nAt the same time, Trump is proposing a series of deep cuts in other programs to offset the cost of his national defense and homeland security efforts and to begin to whittle away at what the president insists is a bloated and entrenched federal workforce. Stephen K. Bannon, Trump\u2019s White House senior adviser, has boasted that Trump would lead a \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state,\u201d and the president\u2019s budget seeks to make good on that boast.\n\nAmong programs targeted for deep cuts or elimination: The Corporation for Public Television, the Legal Services Corporation, AmeriCorps and the National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities, with public television funding slated to be zeroed out.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency, which led the Obama administration drive to combat climate change, would see its budget cut by 31 percent, or roughly $2 billion, which would force the layoffs of about 3,000 employees. The administration will also seek $6 billion in cuts at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, a move that would greatly diminish public housing support and end most federally funded community development grants.\n\nOne of the deepest cuts of 28 percent would be made in the State Department \u2013 a jarring setback for Trump\u2019s new secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil chairman and CEO. Mulvaney insisted yesterday that this in no way reflected the president\u2019s view of Tillerson\u2019s performance and that the bulk of the savings would come from the foreign aid program.\n\nRelated: A Military Buildup and Big Tax Cuts: Is the Debt Set to Soar Under Trump?\n\nWhile bulking up spending on defense, homeland and border security, veterans\u2019 benefits, law enforcement and private and public school choice, the administration pursued dollar-for-dollar offsetting cuts in domestic programs that were given a low priority by the new president.\n\nMulvaney recently revealed that Trump\u2019s 2018 budget \u201cblueprint\u201d would allocate $603 billion towards \u201ctop line defense discretionary\u201d funding, or a $54 billion increase over the Budget Control Act spending caps. Yesterday Mulvaney said the administration would seek $30 billion more for defense and border security this year as part of an unfinished fiscal 2017 appropriations package.\n\nHe said the budget would fund the Pentagon\u2019s needs \u201cin a responsible fashion in terms of what they can actually spend this year.\u201d\n\nThe so-called preliminary \u201cskinny budget\u201d is missing many crucial details that won\u2019t be known until later this spring, including overall projected spending, revenues, interest on the debt and the fate of major entitlement programs including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and other costly entitlement programs that are the biggest drivers of government spending and debt.\n\nRelated: Why a Small Interest Rate Hike Means a $50 Billion Hit to the Federal Budget\n\nThe federal government is currently projected to spend a little more than $4 trillion next year, with roughly two-thirds going to Social Security, Medicare and other entitlements and interest on the nearly $20 trillion national debt. The Congressional Budget Office currently forecasts that fiscal 2018 spending will exceed revenues by $488 billion, more deficit that will be piled onto the debt.\n\nDespite his frequent promises to address the rising deficit and debt, Trump\u2019s new budget plan does nothing to shrink the deficit next year. If anything, his drive for major tax cuts for businesses and individuals, new infrastructure construction including the southern wall, expanded access to charter schools and other initiatives will likely drive up the debt even more.\n\n\u201cThis is a budget blueprint, not a complete budget,\u201d Mulvaney said, which focuses almost exclusively on the roughly one-third of the budget consumed by discretionary spending. \u201cAnd anybody who looks at the deficit and knows the issues of the deficit knows you cannot balance the deficit in the discretionary budget.\u201d\n\nMoreover, there is considerable uncertainty over whether Trump and congressional Republican leaders will make good on their campaign pledge to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and what impact that will have on millions of Americans reliant on Obamacare\u2019s subsidized private insurance policies and expanded Medicaid for their coverage.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Lofty Vision of Renewal Comes with a Huge Price Tag\n\nHowever, critics say that even with only sketchy information about Trump\u2019s intention to effectively shred social safety net programs while escalating defense spending well above the legal discretionary spending caps under the 2011 Budget Control Act, the new administration appears bent on imposing devastating cuts to domestic social programs that have long enjoyed bipartisan support on Capitol Hill.\n\nNon-defense discretionary spending on such things as education, job training, research and development as well as operating costs for federal agencies already have been reduced significantly since 2010 under the Budget Control Act and would have been deeper if it hadn\u2019t been for the intervention of Congress, according to the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nUnder existing law, non-defense discretionary spending is due to fall 16 percent below its 2010 level in 2018. If Trump prevails with his budget proposal, the cut will deepen to 25 percent. Trump has vowed not to cut Medicare or Social Security as part of his efforts to restrain spending \u2013 at least for the time being. That will put even more pressure on his policy advisers and cabinet members to find additional savings in domestic programs which constitute about a third of the overall federal budget, including food stamps and welfare assistance.\n\nRobert Greenstein, president of the center, told reporters yesterday that \u201cthe emerging Trump fiscal policy agenda appears to harm many of the very people who the president said during his campaign would be a priority for him and his administration \u2013 namely low and middle-income families that have struggled with stagnant or declining incomes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd those people would be harmed even as other parts of the fiscal policy agenda confer very large new tax cuts on people at the top of the income scale,\u201d he added. \u201cIndeed, the indications are mounting that when we get the full Trump budget, it may well represent the most aggressive, Robin-Hood-in-reverse budget proposal by any president in modern U.S. history.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/03/15", "title": "How the Tea Party Could End Up Killing the GOP Health Care Plan", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/15/How-Tea-Party-Could-End-Killing-GOP-Health-Care-Plan", "text": "For the past week, the question swirling around the House Republican proposal to replace the Affordable Care Act has been whether or not the GOP leadership could produce enough votes to pass the bill on the floor of the House.

And Texas, being one of the top international trading and importing states alongside California, Florida and New York, would likely lose.\n\nTexas has a gross state product of nearly $1.6 trillion, and its international trade portfolio is almost evenly balanced; that is, the value of exports and the value of imports are very close in terms of dollar figures.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, state exports from Texas stood at $232.6 billion in 2016, accounting for 16 percent of all U.S. exports last year. State imports for Texas were $229.3 billion in value last year. The no.1 import commodity was crude oil. The no.1 and no.2 export commodities were also oil products. Mexico is Texas\u2019 no.1 trade partner, both in exports and imports. Oil companies and refiners in Texas are importing crude oil, including heavy crude from Mexico. The border tax would be a hit to their business, because even if they wanted to switch to buying American-only crude oil, it is light crude and not suited for all kinds of refining processes and products.\n\nRelated: Republican defends border-adjustment tax after Trump criticism\n\n\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, criticized the border adjustment tax at the end of January.\n\n\u201cThe United States imports into our refineries a lot of the heavy crude that our refineries are outfitted to deal with. Those would all be subject to the tax. One refiner told me that they thought that might increase the cost of gasoline by 30 cents. I want to make sure we know what the consequences would be and exactly how this would work,\u201d Cornyn said. He stressed that he supports a tax overhaul that would spur economic growth, but called for further discussion on the border tax consequences for U.S. companies.\n\nA couple of weeks later, Cornyn said, as quoted by Bloomberg:\n\n\u201cThe hard reality is the border tax is on life support, and given the imperative of 51 senators and 218 House members and one president, I think we need to look for other options.\u201d\n\n\n\nPresident Trump, who had initially criticized the border tax proposal, calling it \u201ctoo complicated\u201d, seems to have been warming to the plan, telling Reuters at the end of February that the tax plan could boost U.S. exports and job creation, but stopped just shy of endorsing it.\n\nShould the border tax pass as-is (currently not a very likely scenario), many companies relying on imports, such as retailers and refiners processing foreign oil, could take a hit, as could a globalized and foreign trading economy such as Texas.\n\nThis article originally appeared in OilPrice.com.

The provision allows insurers to add a 30 percent premium surcharge on policies for people who go without insurance for 63 days or more. The penalty would last for 12 months.\n\nRelated: Why the House GOP Health Care Replacement Plan Is Collapsing\n\nNow, according to the news website Axios, GOP leaders in the House are saying they might jettison the requirement in order to gain more support for the bill.\n\nIn one sense, this is easy to understand. The requirement is easily the most unpopular element of the proposed law, according to a poll out Wednesday morning from Morning Consult and Politico. Sixty-four percent of Americans said that they objected to the 30 percent penalty, while only 18 percent said they approved.\n\nIn another sense, though, abandoning the coverage requirement is something like actuarial suicide.\n\nThe whole point of the requirement was to help stabilize insurance markets if the GOP is successful in repealing the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate, which requires all Americans to have health insurance or to pay a penalty. The mandate was put in place because a successful insurance market requires that relatively healthy people be willing to purchase insurance even though they probably won\u2019t need all of its benefits. By doing so, they effectively subsidize sicker people who use more services.\n\nRelated: How the GOP Health Plan Would Devastate Mentally Ill, Addicted\n\nThe reason the Republican plan contained the continuous coverage requirement was precisely to avoid what\u2019s known as the \u201cfree-rider\u201d problem: a situation where no healthy people bother to sign up for insurance until they need it, which would ensure that the pool of policyholders is predominantly made up of people who are already sick.\n\nPlenty of experts pointed out that a 30 percent penalty for a year probably wasn\u2019t sufficient incentive to entice many healthy people to buy insurance in the first place, but eliminating it entirely virtually guarantees an insurance market that is built either to fail or to generate skyrocketing prices for coverage.\n\nThat\u2019s because as insurers realize that their customers are, on average, beginning to cost them more, they will begin raising prices. And because of the ACA\u2019s coverage guarantees, which the Republican plan keeps in place, those price increases can\u2019t be targeted at specific high-cost individuals, but must be the same for people across broad age ranges.\n\nAs a result, rising premiums create even greater disincentives for healthy people to opt out of coverage, potentially creating a spiral of cost increases and dropped policies that harms virtually everyone. If the AHCA was a hard sell for House leadership confronting skeptical health care establishment before, a version without the continuous care requirement would be even worse."}, {"date": "2017/03/15", "title": "Why the House GOP Health Care Replacement Plan Is Collapsing", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/15/Why-House-GOP-Health-Care-Replacement-Plan-Collapsing", "text": "Support for the GOP plan to replace the Affordable Care Act is collapsing quickly in the House, where both conservative and moderate Republicans have been stunned by a Congressional Budget Office forecast that as many as 24 million Americans could lose their insurance coverage over the coming decade.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and the Trump administration continue to press for approval of the Republican replacement plan in the House in the coming weeks, despite mounting warnings that it has no chance of winning approval once it reaches the Senate without a major overhaul.\n\nRelated: How Health Care Is Crippling the Speaker of the House\n\nBut many Republicans are bridling at this, fearing that a vote on an increasingly unpopular health care plan with no prospects for ultimate passage will cost them dearly in the 2018 mid-term elections when their party could risk losing the gains in the last November election.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened to the Democrats in 1993 when President Clinton and House Democrats pushed through a deficit reduction bill with an energy tax increase that died in the Senate.

Conservatives complain that the plan doesn\u2019t go far enough in wiping out Obamacare mandates and policies, dismissing it as \u201cObamacare Lite.\u201d More moderate Republicans fear the plan goes too far by phasing out expanded Medicaid benefits and providing inadequate premium subsidies and other assistance to low and moderate-income Americans.\n\nRelated: GOP Replacement Plan Could Send Hospital Costs Soaring Again\n\nWith sharp criticism of the plan now coming from both the conservative and more moderate wings of the party in both the House and Senate, Vice President Mike Pence, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and other administration officials scrambled yesterday to salvage the plan.\n\nIt\u2019s not what Ryan and the Trump administration want to hear, but many uneasy Senate Republicans yesterday advised the speaker and White House officials to go back to the drawing board and make significant changes.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, the Senate Republicans want to see a plan that would result in lower insurance costs for poorer, older Americans, and an increase in funding in states with large numbers of hard-to-insure people.

But she has informally served as one of the few voices of reason on climate change within a new Republican administration populated with a few key climate change skeptics.

The new presidential order would also override the government\u2019s use of a metric known as \u201cthe social cost of carbon\u201d which attempts to quantify the social cost of carbon.\n\nBloomberg also reports the order would eliminate industry restrictions on methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas.\n\nThe Climate Change Crisis Trump Refuses to Acknowledge\n\nIvanka Trump does have two powerful allies within the cabinet. Defense Secretary General James Mattis considers climate change real and a threat to U.S. national security. He wants to see a reduction in fossil fuels for the armed forces in order to keep them mobile and sustainable. And Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is vigorously arguing against fulfilling the president\u2019s campaign pledge to cancel the 2015 Paris accord that binds most countries to curb global warming, as The New York Times recently reported.\n\nThe Obama administration pledged that the U.S. would reduce its carbon pollution about 26 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. Ivanka Trump and Tillerson reportedly fear that pulling out of the landmark climate agreement could have \u201cbroad and damaging diplomatic ramifications,\u201d not to mention undermining what former President Obama deemed the \u201clast best hope\u201d to save the planet.\n\nBut other powerful forces in the White House, including the senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon, are pressing for President Trump to disavow the international agreement signed by 194 nations. If the U.S. \u2013- the largest economy in the world and the second biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions next to China -- were to gradually pull out, experts say it would do incalculable damage to the international agreement.\n\nRelated: Obama--This May Be \u2018The Last Generation\u2019 That Can Stop Climate Change\n\nAl Gore, who met with both President Trump and Ivanka at Trump Tower last December, told The Washington Post Tuesday that he thinks \u201cthere is a realistic chance\u201d the president will opt to keep the United States as a participant in the Paris accord.\n\nBut more generally, Ivanka is probably fighting a losing cause within an administration that is sworn to helping the coal industry make an improbable comeback and turning back the clock on thousands of industry and environmental regulations geared to trying to reduce global warming.\n\nHer father has stacked the deck against her, choosing, for instance, former Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and preside over the dismantling of every facet of Obama\u2019s policies to crack down on carbon emissions from aging coal-fired power plants.\n\nTrump recently signed one of his many executive orders directing Pruitt to begin the lengthy legal process of repealing the EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan for cutting power plant pollutions.

After much hype and a 20-minute delay that made the program feel more like a reality television show than a commentary on the news, MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow revealed that through veteran reporter David Cay Johnston, she had acquired the first two pages of Trump\u2019s form 1040 for tax year 2005.\n\nThe document shows that Trump paid about $38 million in income tax that year, on income of close to $150 million, after a massive write-off of $103 million in business losses. Johnston said that he had received the documents \u201cover the transom\u201d and that he had not solicited them, nor did he know who had mailed them to him.\n\nRelated: The 20 Richest People in the World\n\nDespite the hype on MSNBC Tuesday night, though, the documents answer almost none of the real questions that have been driving people to demand that Trump, like presidents before him back to the 1970s, releases his tax returns to the public. Among them: Does Trump have significant business ties to Russia, or to other foreign governments that could create conflicts of interest as he pursues US policy overseas?\n\nThe problem is that for a return as complicated as Trump\u2019s no doubt is, looking at the first two pages is equivalent to reading the front and back covers of a book and ignoring the hundreds of pages in between. It gives you a general idea of what\u2019s going on but is woefully short on details.\n\nFor example, take Line 12 on the 1040 where Trump reports $42,395,804 in business income for the year. Yes, we now know a little more about Trump\u2019s finances, specifically that he pulled down more than $42 million from the operation of various businesses. But we have no idea which of his many businesses generated all that income, or how. Much of that information would be contained on the IRS Schedule C that was presumably filed with the return, but which was not included in the documents Johnston received.\n\nOr look at Line 17, on which Trump reported $67,383,658 in income from \u201crental real estate, royalties, partnerships, S corporations, trusts, etc.\u201d We get the bottom line number, but not the breakdown of what exactly those partnerships and trusts look like, where they are located, and who Trump may be doing business with. All that would be detailed on IRS Schedule E which, conveniently, wasn\u2019t part of the package either.\n\nRelated: Why So Many CEOs Are Cozying Up to Trump\n\nThere is also no detail about the more than $9 million in interest payments Trump received in 2005 or the more than $32 million in capital gains he realized during the year.\n\nThe biggest mystery the release of those two sheets of paper solves is the question of whether Trump paid any taxes at all in the years after a filing in 1995 in which he reported a loss of nearly $1 billion. That loss made it theoretically possible that using IRS rules that allow losses to be carried forward, Trump could have paid no taxes for up to 18 years.\n\nIt turns out that wasn\u2019t true, at least in 2005, but that\u2019s about the only revelatory part of the documents.\n\nJohnston seemed to acknowledge as much when he pointed out early in his appearance on Maddow\u2019s show that he couldn\u2019t discount the possibility that Trump himself had caused the documents to be leaked, citing Trump\u2019s history of such activity during his years as a tabloid-obsessed Manhattan real estate developer.\n\nRelated: The Best Ways to Use Your Tax Refund \u2013 and the Worst\n\nIndeed, much of the speculation surrounding the unexpected appearance of the documents Tuesday was focused on the idea that it was an attempt by Trump or his supporters to distract attention from the other story dominating the news: the damaging report by the Congressional Budget Office that found the health care bill proposed by House Republicans and backed by Trump, would cost 24 million Americans their health insurance.\n\nRegardless of where the documents came from, the White House made a show of righteous indignation. On Wednesday morning, Trump tweeted, \u201cDoes anybody really believe that a reporter, who nobody ever heard of, \"went to his mailbox\" and found my tax returns? @NBCNews FAKE NEWS!\u201d\n\n(For the record, Johnston was a longtime reporter on tax issues for The New York Times and is a Pulitzer Prize winner. People have, in fact, heard of him.)\n\nOn Tuesday night, the White House released a statement blasting MSNBC and Johnston.\n\n\u201cYou know you are desperate for ratings when you are willing to violate the law to push a story about two pages of tax returns from over a decade ago. Before being elected president, Mr. Trump was one of the most successful businessmen in the world with a responsibility to his company, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required.\n\nRelated: Leave More Time for Your Financial Aid Form This Year as IRS Shuts Down FAFSA Data Tool\n\n\u201cThat being said, Mr. Trump paid $38 million dollars even after taking into account large-scale depreciation for construction, on an income of more than $150 million dollars as well as paying tens of millions of dollars in other taxes such as sales and excise taxes and employment taxes and this illegally published return proves just that. Despite this substantial income figure and tax paid, it is totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns. The dishonest media can continue to make this part of their agenda, while the president will focus on his, which includes tax reform that will benefit all Americans.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the Trump administration\u2019s decision to bring up the president\u2019s tax reform plan in the statement calls attention to one more interesting fact revealed by the return. Trump\u2019s effective tax rate in 2005 was a little more than 25 percent. But the only reason he paid as much as he did is that he was subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax, designed to assure that the very wealthy pay some taxes even if their income and deductions are structured in a way to avoid all tax liability.\n\nTrump\u2019s tax proposals include the elimination of the AMT."}, {"date": "2017/03/15", "title": "Trump\u2019s Government Reorganization: Hatchet Job, or Just Major Surgery?", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/15/Trump-s-Government-Reorganization-Hatchet-Job-or-Just-Major-Surgery", "text": "President Donald Trump\u2019s habit of appointing people to run federal agencies who have a history of very public antipathy toward those same agencies has caused many good government advocates to throw up their hands in dismay.

There is the Trum-skeptic view, which considers the move window dressing on an ideologically-driven plan to drastically reduce the size of the federal government and its influence on the daily life of the nation. To some Trump advisers, like Bannon, a reduction of the size of the government is essentially a good in and of itself.\n\nRelated: How the GOP Health Plan Would \u2018Devastate\u2019 Mentally Ill, Addicted\n\nThe other, more optimistic view is that this represents a real chance to begin a serious discussion of genuine government reform.

He also pointed out that the order includes language directing the agency heads to consider the impact of cuts on necessary public services.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really important and something to be lauded -- it\u2019s recognition that the people are at stake here,\u201d he said.\n\nStier, whose organization is dedicated to finding ways to make government agencies work better, both in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, said that there is plenty of relatively obvious targets for a reform effort.\n\nRelated: Republican Health Plan: Good for the Budget, Bad for the Poor and Elderly\n\n\u201cWe have over $100 billion spent on improper payments. There\u2019s duplication in back office functions. And there\u2019s a huge opportunity for thinking of the government as an integrated enterprise.\u201d\n\nHowever, he warned, government reform efforts have come and gone over the years, and there are some stumbling blocks the Trump administration would do well to avoid.\n\nThe first, he said, is failing to assure real buy-in from members of Congress -- something that caused real problems during the years following the reorganization of the nation\u2019s law enforcement and national security services to create the of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\u201cCongress plays an incredibly important role,\u201d he said. \u201cNo organizational changes are going to take effect without Congress signing on.\u201d\n\nRelated: Ryan: We Don\u2019t Know How Many We Will Cover or How Much It Will Cost\n\nThe second is failing to understand that \u201cas much as organization matters, people matter more and that includes the political leaders. This is a very hard task to take on without having his team in place in the agencies.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration will have a hard time getting really thorough, smart analyses of the various agencies it controls if it doesn\u2019t have the people it needs in key positions at those agencies -- and Stier, whose organization is tracking the White House\u2019s appointments to key executive branch positions, warns that the administration has already fallen behind previous administrations in naming people to key positions.\n\nThe administration may need to decide which is more important -- sticking to its 180-day timetable for the first phase of the project, or waiting until it has the personnel in place to do the job right.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about selecting these people,\u201d Stier said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting them up to speed and getting them to work together.

Long coddled by establishment Foggy Bottom types and by U.S. corporations salivating over China\u2019s burgeoning markets \u2013 not to mention an Obama White House desperate for a legacy climate deal -- Beijing has met little resistance as it has cyber attacked U.S. corporate and military secrets, broken trade agreements, ignored international law courts, lied about its intentions in the South China Sea, fudged its climate regulations, worked to undermine American alliances in Asia and harbored the villains running North Korea. No more.\n\nThere\u2019s a new sheriff in town, and the opening salvo came last week when the Commerce Department announced it had imposed record-level civil and criminal penalties of $1.2 billion on Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE. The fines were levied in response to ZTE\u2019s illegal exports of equipment to Iran and North Korea \u2013 exports that violated sanctions imposed against Tehran. If approved by the courts, it would be would be the largest fine and forfeiture ever levied by the U.S. government in an export control case.\n\nRelated: China Is Ready to Step into America\u2019s Role as World Leader\n\nCommerce\u2019s announcement about the fees further rattled the cage. Secretary Wilbur Ross said, \u201cWe are putting the world on notice: the games are over. Those who flout our economic sanctions and export control laws will not go unpunished \u2013 they will suffer the harshest of consequences.\u201d\n\nThe five-year investigation into ZTE found that the company had aggressively conspired to conceal evidence of its misdeeds and lied to U.S. officials. After being served with a subpoena in 2012, its shipments to Iran declined but then picked up again when management decided in November 2013 to thwart the U.S. embargo even as the federal probe was ongoing. Ross said ZTE made \u201c283 more shipments to North Korea after the investigation had begun.\u201d\n\nWhy not? Chinese companies and the government had little reason to fear the Obama White House. Several months earlier, President Obama had met at Sunnylands with President Xi Jinping, purportedly to deliver a stern message about cyber hacking and other bad behavior. Just before the summit, The Washington Post had published an explosive report about China hacking more than two dozen major advanced U.S. weapons systems, a breach thought likely to significantly shrink America\u2019s military advantage. Access to the technology could save the Chinese 25-years\u2019 of research and tens of billions of dollars as they race to match U.S. capabilities, experts said.\n\nNaturally, Xi stonewalled the charges of cyber thefts, insisting that China, too, was the victim of hacks, and shared the U.S.\u2019 concerns. Obama, whose position was admittedly weakened by revelations of NSA spying, went along with this nonsense despite a National Intelligence Estimate earlier in the year, which definitively identified China as the country most wantonly penetrating U.S. businesses and institutions.\n\nRelated: What Is THAAD? A $1.6 Billion US Weapon That\u2019s Going to Korea \u2013 and Worrying China\n\nIncreasing Chinese aggression (cyber and otherwise) has been met by American hand-wringing and dithering over issues such as whether employing the THAAD system (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) in South Korea to counter North Korea\u2019s growing arsenal might offend Beijing. Foreign policy wonks advise appeasement; a recent essay in Foreign Affairs, typical of establishment thinking, advises that \u201cThe United States should welcome a more influential China, so long as it respects other countries\u2019 interests, contributes to the common good, and adheres to international laws and norms.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what the U.S. should do when Beijing patently does not respect other countries\u2019 interests, and it\u2019s obvious the Obama White House was confused as well. Even as they pursued trade violations and won monetary settlements, they avoided offending China\u2019s leaders by declining to collect the monies owed.\n\nIn a recent interview with Fox Business\u2019 Varney & Company, Ross reported that the Obama administration had failed to collect penalties assessed of Chinese companies that broke U.S. trade agreements. Ross reiterated the charge in an interview with Maria Bartiromo asserting, \u201cBillions of dollars of countervailing duties have not been collected.\u201d As he pointed out, given the expense and labor of charging violators, it makes no sense whatsoever not to collect.\n\nEspecially since these are high-stakes situations that have hurt Americans.\n\nFor instance, the White House charged in 2015 that Beijing\u2019s price supports of its domestic corn, rice and wheat exceeded its WTO commitment limit by $100 billion. Our government argued that American farmers were consequently unable to compete and to sell their goods to China.\n\nRelated: The US Navy Sends a Powerful Message to Beijing in the South China Sea\n\nA study sponsored by the U.S. Wheat Associates, a lobbying group, and conducted by Iowa State University, estimated that those Chinese price supports cost U.S. wheat farmers alone between $650 and $700 million annually.\n\nMore recently, at the urging of eight U.S. senators, the Obama White House lodged a complaint with the WTO over China\u2019s subsidies for its aluminum industry \u2013 support that critics say includes 27 different subsidy programs, costing thousands of American jobs. Excess capacity among Chinese producers has pushed down costs worldwide and driven numerous U.S. producers out of business. In 2000, there were 23 smelters operating in the U.S.; by the end of last year, there were only five.\n\nNot all of China\u2019s trade cheating is so straight-forward. The Chamber of Commerce issued a report in 2014 charging that Beijing\u2019s enforcement of its 2008 anti-monopoly law was leading to unfair treatment of American companies like Microsoft and Qualcomm, possibly in violation of WTO rules. The report said that China\u2019s antitrust \u201cremedies often appear designed to advance industrial policy and boost national champions [while] intellectual property rights have been curtailed.\u201d\n\nIt is cheering to see the Trump White House cracking down on Chinese misbehavior.

Landlocked Alberta has had trouble getting its oil to market. Every direction except north has been seriously considered, with TransCanada, Enbridge and Kinder Morgan jockeying to advance their competing projects to service Alberta. All of these projects have been bogged down by a combination of the federal approval process, environmental protest and opposition from First Nations.\n\nRelated: Why the Keystone XL Pipeline May Never Happen, Even With Trump's Approval\n\nThe Keystone XL pipeline saga is nearly a decade old and there is still no steel in the ground. Over the years, Canadian heavy oil has been forced to sell at a discount because of the shortage of pipeline space. In fact, the lack of pipeline capacity has been singled out as one of the top threats to expanded oil sands production. That is exactly why environmental groups targeted Keystone XL years ago, and it is exactly why the oil industry says building pipelines is its top priority.\n\n\u201cCanada\u2019s energy future relies on our ability to get Canadian oil and gas to the people who need it,\u201d Tim McMillan, president and CEO of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) said last year. \u201cConnecting Canadian supply to new and growing markets abroad, safely and competitively, is a top priority.\u201d Canadian pipelines can carry 4 million barrels of oil per day, which is just a bit above the actual oil flows in 2015 at 3.981 mb/d, according to CAPP. Without more pipelines, oil sands companies cannot expand their operations. The industry is targeting an additional 850,000 bpd over the next five years.\n\nIn late 2015, the issue looked like it was going nowhere. The Obama administration had just killed off the Keystone XL project, rejecting it on climate grounds. Alternative routes also struggled for acceptance. Moreover, falling oil prices forced oil companies to cancel or delay several dozen oil sands projects.\n\nBut a little more than a year later and Alberta finds itself in a different situation: three viable pipelines from three different companies, all of which are determined to move forward in a market that might only need two of them.\n\nRelated: Trump signs order to move controversial oil pipelines forward\n\nIn the fourth quarter of last year, the Canadian government gave federal approval to two major pipeline expansions: the Trans Mountain Expansion and the Line 3 replacement. Kinder Morgan\u2019s Trans Mountain Expansion project will see the construction of a twin line that will run parallel to an existing pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast. The expansion will nearly triple its capacity from 300,000 to 890,000 bpd. Enbridge also received approval for the replacement and overhaul of its Line 3 pipeline from Alberta to Wisconsin in the United States. The replacement of the pipeline will nearly double its carrying capacity to 760,000 bpd.\n\nThen there is the Keystone XL Pipeline, which, like a zombie, refuses to die. The election of President Donald Trump brought the project, left for dead by President Obama, back to life. TransCanada hopes to move forward on the project.\n\nBut according to Enbridge, there may not be a market for all three pipelines. \"If you look at the supply profile and you look at our expansion replacement capacity for Line 3 and one other pipeline, that should suffice based on the current supply outlook, out to at least mid-next decade,\" Enbridge\u2019s CEO Al Monaco said on a fourth quarter earnings call. Naturally, Monaco wants his company\u2019s Line 3 to be one of the two pipelines to move forward.\n\nThe obvious odd man out would be Keystone XL despite the support from the Trump administration. CAPP expects additional Canadian oil output on the order of 850,000 bpd 2021; the IEA largely agrees, projecting a 900,000 bpd increase by 2022. That lines up nicely with the capacity additions from the Trans Mountain expansion (+590,000 bpd) and the Line 3 expansion (roughly +370,000), which would add just under 1 mb/d in new pipeline capacity. Keystone XL, a nearly 1,200-mile pipeline, would add 830,000 in new capacity.\n\nMore importantly, the Trans Mountain and Line 3 expansions would be adding new pipes on existing routes, not bulldozing new territory. They would not have the massive seizure of public and private land problems that Keystone XL still has to go through. The two expansions would literally just be installing new pipeline where existing and older pipeline is currently located. Similarly, those projects face fewer legal hurdles than Keystone XL, which still has to overcome local lawsuits.\n\nThus, the comments from Enbridge\u2019s CEO, warning that not all three pipelines will get built, is worth noting. Wood Mackenzie agrees. \"We definitely need two of these pipelines by around 2025 and after that it depends on the supply outlook,\" Wood Mackenzie analyst Mark Oberstoetter said, according to Reuters. \"There's not an evident need to get three or four pipelines built.\"\n\nSo, Keystone XL might be back from the dead, but it is unclear for how long.\n\nThis article originally appeared on OilPrice.com.

That shutdown was triggered by a bruising battle between the Obama administration and conservative Republicans in the House and Senate who were attempting to cut funding for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe funding disputes this year will be every bit as difficult to resolve, with neither party inclined to engage in the type of political give and take necessary to avoid a crisis.\n\nTrump and the Republicans are gambling that they can achieve their most important goals \u2013 including the repeal and replacement of Obamacare, overhauling the Medicaid program and passing major tax cuts -- without inviting Democrats to the negotiating table.\n\nBut with their own party badly fractured over an Obamacare replacement and sharp divisions over tax policy and trade, Trump eventually will have no choice but to seek Democratic support to achieve the semblance of a successful legislative program.\n\nRelated: The Debt Ceiling: What Is It and Why Does It Matter?\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Trump administration and GOP leaders have yet to reveal their strategy for averting a debt ceiling crisis this fall.

Meadows and others in his caucus have expressed strong reservations about the AHCA, complaining that it leaves too much of the ACA intact and that its introduction of refundable tax credits for purchasing insurance on the open market amount to the creation of a new entitlement program.\n\nOhio Rep.

In the Senate, Republicans can only afford to lose three votes without killing the legislation, and even that would require a tie-breaking vote by the vice president.\n\nChanges to the bill that further depress the percentage of Americans with insurance coverage, or accelerate the loss of coverage are only going to harden the opposition it faces from Senate Republicans like Maine\u2019s Collins and others who have expressed concern about the proposal\u2019s effects on the uninsured rate.\n\nIt\u2019s a dilemma that offers the Speaker no obvious way out, and help from the White House doesn\u2019t seem to be forthcoming."}, {"date": "2017/03/14", "title": "How the GOP Health Plan Would \u2018Devastate\u2019 Mentally Ill, Addicted", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/14/How-GOP-Health-Plan-Would-Devastate-Mentally-Ill-Addicted", "text": "By now, the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s assessment of the proposed American Health Care Act\u2019s impact on health coverage in the US is well-known.

According to CBO, a 64-year-old with earnings equal to 175 percent of the federal poverty line would see their net annual premium costs after tax credits rise from $1,700 per year to $14,600 per year, a 759 percent increase.\n\nRelated: Republican Health Plan: Good for the Budget, Bad for the Poor and Elderly\n\nLess well understood, though, is the impact the law would have on some of the country\u2019s most vulnerable individuals: Medicaid recipients with mental illness, addiction problems, and even dementia.\n\nDespite Republicans\u2019 near constant claim that Obamacare recipients have coverage but no ability to access care because of high deductibles, the Affordable Care Act made not just coverage, but actual care, available to millions of people through the expansion of the Medicaid program.

That reduction would be due mainly to lower enrollments throughout the period, culminating in 14 million fewer Medicaid enrollees by 2026.\n\nRelated: GOP\u2019s Repeal of Obamacare Taxes Could Put Medicare Closer to Insolvency\n\nSome of that decline would be among people who are currently eligible for Medicaid benefits while others would be people who subsequently were made eligible by states that decide to accept the expanded Medicaid coverage before the ax starts to fall on the program.\n\n\u201cSome decline in spending and enrollment would begin immediately, but most of the changes would begin in 2020, when the legislation would terminate the enhanced federal matching rate for new enrollees under the ACA\u2019s expansion of Medicaid and would place a per capita-based cap on the federal government\u2019s payments to states for medical assistance provided through Medicaid,\u201d CBO reported.\n\nFederal spending on Medicaid has increased more than on Medicare over the past few years\u2014to an average rate of 7.5 percent annually. That means Medicaid costs this year would be about $638 billion. But by 2026, Medicaid spending would be about 25 percent less than what CBO projects under current law.\n\nAs spending on Medicaid plummets, hospitals and other medical providers will incur steep losses to provide emergency treatment and services to those least able to pay for them.\n\nRelated: Ryan--We Don\u2019t Know How Many We Will Cover or How Much It Will Cost\n\nUnder Obamacare, states that chose to participate in Medicaid expansion, which opened the program to single, able-bodied adults, broadened their programs to cover people making up to 138 percent of poverty-level income. States could decide whether to participate in accordance with a landmark June 2012 Supreme Court ruling.\n\nIf the Republican replacement plan is ultimately enacted, the states would continue to receive expanded Medicaid benefits until 2020. After that, the federal government would pay 90 percent of the cost of existing eligible beneficiaries while new beneficiaries would be funded at a much lower level. Eventually, the expanded program would be phased out.\n\nPrior to the ACA, hospitals throughout the country struggled to cover the cost of charitable treatment of low-income patients, bad debts or inadequate reimbursement from Medicaid because of regional disparities in health care costs. Medicaid payments to hospitals and other providers amounted to 90 percent of the costs of patient care in 2013, according to estimates by the American Hospital Association.\n\nRelated: Medicare Could Save Nearly $16 Billion a Year Negotiating Drug Prices\n\nMany studies \u2013 including one by researchers at Northwestern University -- have shown that reductions in uncompensated care costs almost exclusively occurred in states that expanded Medicaid, according to the Healthcare Financial Management Association.\n\n\u201cThe uninsured has gone from 18 percent to 11 percent of the population. It's been very beneficial, particularly to my [hospital] members who are in lower-income neighborhoods and lower-income parts of this country and rural hospitals, too,\u201d Thomas Nickels, executive vice president of the American Hospital Association, told National Public Radio on Monday. \u201cSo it will be a burden on the hospitals to have to have additional uncompensated care.\u201d\n\nUnfunded care in Medicaid expansion states fell from 4.1 percentage points of operating costs to 3.2 percentage points, said a report by the Healthcare Financial Management Association last August. \u201cIn non-expansion states, uncompensated care costs continued close to their existing trend, remaining at about 5.7 percentage points of hospitals\u2019 operating costs,\u201d the report stated.\n\nRelated: The GOP Health Plan: A Giant Step in the Wrong Direction or Merely Step One?\n\nThe Healthcare Financial Management Association, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Department of Health and Human Services, and Kaiser Family Foundation all found dramatic reductions in unfunded care resulting from both the ACA\u2019s cost-saving mandates and Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe reports generally defined uncompensated care costs as the sum of losses on charity care and bad debt. Nickels warned that hospitals throughout the country would suffer a serious financial setback if the Republican Congress succeeds in rolling back expanded Medicaid.\n\n\u201cWe would definitely want to continue that Medicaid expansion into the future.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/03/14", "title": "Why So Many CEOs Are Cozying Up to Trump", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/03/14/Why-So-Many-CEOs-Are-Cozying-Trump", "text": "I\u2019ve managed to find what I believe is the only explicit show of support for the American Health Care Act outside of House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s office. Joseph Swedish, the CEO of health insurance giant Anthem, threw his support behind the bid to repeal and replace Obamacare in a letter to Congress, saying it \u201caddresses the challenges immediately facing the individual market and will ensure more affordable health plan choices for consumers in the short term.\u201d\n\nAs the Republican plan promises generally stingier support for health insurance, with higher premium costs, co-pays and deductibles on the individual market, I don\u2019t understand Swedish\u2019s claim. Even in the short term, the proposal eliminates the individual mandate penalty, enabling healthy consumers to avoid getting insured unless they get sick. That could worsen the current problem for insurers: a sicker covered population than expected. Indeed, even America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the main lobbying group for big insurers like Anthem, expressed concern over numerous pieces of the GOP bill, including the inadequate tax credits to purchase insurance and the vanishing mandate penalty.\n\nRelated: Why the Republican Health Care Plan Is Destined to Fail\n\nSo why does Anthem see success in repeal and replace where so many see failure? Why is the CEO more excited about this plan than many Republicans are? It may have something to do with the fact that Anthem wants to buy fellow giant Cigna for $54 billion. And in the Trump era, Anthem, like many other corporations seeking mergers and acquisitions, has decided that the path to success in building monopoly power goes directly through the White House.\n\nThat\u2019s a very disturbing prospect, because merger reviews operate out of nominally independent federal agencies, at both the Federal Trade Commission and (in the case of the insurance industry) the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department. Yet corporate wooing of Trump to grease the wheels for merger approval creates a serious conflict of interest hanging over one of the greatest challenges facing the U.S. economy.\n\nA federal judge blocked the Anthem/Cigna merger in February; Anthem decided to appeal (Cigna is grudgingly going along with the challenge). In its arguments ahead of the March 24 appeal, Anthem said in open court that it believed the Trump administration would be more favorable to the merger than Justice Department officials under President Obama. And just a couple weeks after that comment, Anthem\u2019s CEO stakes out a lonely position in favor of what to this point is Trump\u2019s signature legislative initiative.\n\nRelated: Republican Health Plan \u2014 Good for the Budget, Bad for the Poor and Elderly\n\nIf anything, Anthem\u2019s strategy is less overt than those of its corporate counterparts. CEOs of companies awaiting completion of merger reviews have formally met with Trump. AT&T chief Randall Stephenson sat down with the president-elect in January; the two sides claimed the telecom\u2019s pending $85.4 billion merger with Time Warner didn\u2019t come up. Even if true, ex parte communications between the president and CEOs awaiting merger approval are highly unusual.\n\nThe heads of Bayer and Monsanto, meanwhile, did discuss their $66 billion proposed merger with Trump at a January meeting. In fact, Trump appeared to dictate terms, announcing a pledge that the new company would spend $8 billion on research and development and add jobs. This completely disregards due process, sells out family farmers and weakens competition in the seed and pesticide markets, in exchange for vows that were apparently already made well before the Trump meeting, and a vague reference to jobs, when the merger itself is designed to create corporate \u201csynergies\u201d that will downsize workers, as is typical for corporate consolidations.\n\nTrump also met with SoftBank\u2019s Masayoshi Son, securing another dubious pledge of $50 billion in U.S. investment. But the meeting appeared to give SoftBank the greenlight to pursue a merger between its subsidiary Sprint and T-Mobile, which SoftBank has considered previously. Talks between SoftBank and Trump\u2019s team have continued since that initial meeting in December. Last week, reports indicated that Son was \u201cbetting big on Trump,\u201d and that Sprint could join with either T-Mobile or Comcast.\n\nRelated: OMB Director Mulvaney Blowing Smoke on Health Law\u2019s Impact\n\nIt was strong antitrust enforcement from the Obama administration that blocked T-Mobile from a series of proposed mergers, leading to competition that has proved beneficial for consumers. We wouldn\u2019t see every major wireless carrier offer unlimited data plans without T-Mobile making the first foray.\n\nBut Trump hasn\u2019t filled any of the vacancies in antitrust positions at the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission, much like the other open posts across the federal government. This centralizes power inside the White House in unusual and disturbing ways. We have a legal process for determining whether markets have grown unfairly concentrated, based on enforcing century-old laws that promote competition. That doesn\u2019t include sucking up to the president and hoping that influences whatever monopolization corporations want.\n\nThe Justice Department has of course maintained that it won\u2019t be swayed by political considerations in merger review. But Attorney General Jeff Sessions was one of Trump\u2019s closest confidants on the campaign trail, and his independence has already been questioned. Moreover, if Trump is cutting deals with the likes of Bayer and SoftBank, the Justice Department will be under enormous pressure to not inhibit them by blocking those plans.\n\nRelated: GOP\u2019s Repeal of Obamacare Taxes Could Put Medicare Closer to Insolvency\n\nThe end result here is a de facto private government, with corporations able to appeal to one man who thinks running the country equals having CEOs visit the White House every other day to chat. Communications channels to Trump come overwhelmingly from a small subset of the country, one that has its own agenda in mind: more consolidation, more accumulation of power and more use of that power to maximize and hoard profits while destroying competitors. We know that concentrated markets, which have worsened over the past three decades, equal higher consumer prices, fragile supply chains, greater inequality and a kind of sickness in the economy \u2014 a lack of dynamism that harms all of us. While it\u2019s bad for the country, it\u2019s good for those at the top. And they have a straight channel to the president to get things done.\n\nThe Republican health care proposal is so battered that Anthem might not get its wish of a reworked insurance market. But it will have shown a president who values loyalty highly that it was willing to give support when few others would. And that could mean getting its prized merger. These days, success in business merely means pleasing a small man who lives on Pennsylvania Avenue."}, {"date": "2017/03/13", "title": "Republican Health Plan: Good for the Budget, Bad for the Poor and Elderly", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/13/Republican-Health-Plan-Good-Budget-Bad-Poor-and-Elderly", "text": "The much-anticipated Congressional Budget Office analysis of the American Health Care Act, House Republicans\u2019 plan to do away with the Affordable Care Act, was released Monday afternoon, and the findings were a mixed bag for the GOP. On the positive side of the ledger, the plan would save the government $337 billion over the 10-year budget window, and would not send the healthcare marketplace into a death spiral of escalating premiums.\n\nOn the downside, by the end of the 10-year window, there would be 24 million fewer Americans with health care than there would be under the current law, and many of those between 50 and 64 would be paying much, much more for it.\n\nRelated: GOP\u2019s Repeal of Obamacare Taxes Could Put Medicare Closer to Insolvency\n\nThe CBO estimate, chock full of caveats about the difficulty of projecting the results of a complete overhaul of the health insurance system in the US, seems to settle at least one major question about the law: whether it would survive the arcane rules that govern the passage of budget reconciliation bills in the Senate. Had there been evidence that it would significantly increase the federal deficit, the bill would have been dead on arrival.\n\nConcern about the impact of the proposal on the stability of health insurance markets should also be reduced by the report, at least somewhat. There had been concern that by sharply cutting the subsidies available to Americans for the purchase of insurance plans on the nongroup exchanges established by the ACA the law would create a severe imbalance between relatively healthy policyholders and sicker ones.\n\nHowever, the CBO found that a combination of tax credits and penalties for not maintaining continuous coverage would entice enough healthy consumers to purchase insurance to keep the markets stable. Also helping would be premiums kept lower by federal grants from a Patient and State Stability Fund.\n\n\u201cEven though the new tax credits would be structured differently from the current subsidies and would generally be less generous for those receiving subsidies under current law, the other changes would, in the agencies\u2019 view, lower average premiums enough to attract a sufficient number of relatively healthy people to stabilize the market,\u201d the report found.\n\nRelated: Ryan--We Don\u2019t Know How Many We Will Cover or How Much It Will Cost\n\nHowever, it won\u2019t do much to settle the many other battles raging around the legislation, particularly its effect on the number of people in the country with health insurance. By 2026, under current law, the CBO projects that the number of Americans without health insurance would be 28 million. Under the ACHA, by contrast, that number would spike to 52 million.\n\nIn the first year of the ACHA, the report finds, 14 million additional Americans would be without health insurance, but the majority of those would be people who chose not to purchase a policy, running the risk of paying a penalty if they fall ill and have to sign up for a policy. However, in the out years, this changes, and the majority of people without insurance will be those who would have been eligible for it under the ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion, which the proposed law would eliminate.\n\nThe bill\u2019s effect on the budget, cutting $323 billion from the deficit over 10 years, reflects the net impact of drastic cuts in both spending and revenue. Under the bill, the federal government would reduce outlays by $1.2 trillion dollars, according to the CBO estimate. The of that savings would come from slashing federal Medicaid funding and from replacing the subsidies offered by the ACA with much less generous tax credits under the ACHA.\n\nThe spending cuts are offset by some $900 billion in tax cuts, much of which will go to the wealthiest Americans and to corporations. Among the taxes eliminated are an additional payroll tax for the country\u2019s highest earners, a surtax on wealthy investors\u2019 net investment income, and fees on health insurance companies.\n\nRelated: Medicare Could Save Nearly $16 Billion a Year Negotiating Drug Prices\n\nRepublican promises that the bill would bring down health insurance premiums are supported by the CBO, but with some important caveats. Out of the gate, the bill would actually drive premiums in the nongroup market up by 15 to 20 percent. After three years, though, they would begin to decline, with average levels coming in below current estimate of costs under the ACA.\n\nBut it\u2019s important to note that the CBO is talking about average premiums. The cost decreases would not be evenly distributed but would favor the young at the cost of the elderly.\n\n\u201cUnder the legislation, insurers would be allowed to generally charge five times more for older enrollees than younger ones rather than three times more as under current law, substantially reducing premiums for young adults and substantially raising premiums for older people.\u201d\n\nPartisan reaction to the CBO score on Capitol Hill broke down along predictable lines.\n\nRelated: The GOP Health Plan: A Giant Step in the Wrong Direction or Merely Step One?\n\n\u201cThis report confirms that the American Health Care Act will lower premiums and improve access to quality, affordable care,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement. \u201cCBO also finds that this legislation will provide massive tax relief, dramatically reduce the deficit, and make the most fundamental entitlement reform in more than a generation.\u201d\n\nHe added a reminder that the GOP sees the ACHA as only the first step in broader health care reform. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that this report does not take into consideration additional steps Congress and the Trump administration are taking that will further lower costs and increase choices.\u201d\n\nKentucky Rep. John Yarmuth, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, took a different tack. \u201cToday\u2019s analysis from the CBO confirms that the Republicans\u2019 repeal bill isn\u2019t a health care bill at all. It\u2019s an ideological document with real and incredibly damaging consequences for American families. In order to give another $600 billion in tax cuts to corporations and the wealthiest among us, Republicans are pursuing a path that will leave 14 million Americans without insurance next year, and result in 24 million more people without coverage by 2026.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/03/13", "title": "GOP\u2019s Repeal of Obamacare Taxes Could Put Medicare Closer to Insolvency", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/13/GOP-s-Repeal-Obamacare-Taxes-Could-Put-Medicare-Closer-Insolvency", "text": "The House GOP drive to wipe out hundreds of billions of dollars of tax increases as part of the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act has rekindled a debate over the long-term solvency of Medicare and the Republicans\u2019 intentions to overhaul the premier federal health insurance program for seniors eventually.\n\nBy repealing a 0.9 percent federal payroll surtax for families earning more than $250,000 a year and individuals making more than $200,000, the Republicans would eliminate an estimated $117 billion in revenue over the coming decade for the Medicare trust fund. That would accelerate by nearly four years the timetable for depleting the Medicare hospitalization trust fund would begin to run out of money, potentially curtailing benefit payments unless additional taxes were raised.\n\nRelated: Ryan--We Don\u2019t Know How Many We Will Cover or How Much It Will Cost\n\nThe 2010 Obamacare law effectively extended the life of the Medicare trust fund by more than 11 years through 2028 by increasing the federal payroll tax on wealthier Americans and by reducing reimbursements to doctors, hospitals and other health care providers.\n\nHowever, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and other GOP leaders have targeted the payroll tax increase along with $600 billion of other Obamacare-related tax increases on the health care industry and wealthier Americans to make good on their campaign pledge to eviscerate virtually all the tax increases and mandates imposed by the law.\n\n\u201cWe made a promise to the people who elected us we would repeal and replace this law,\u201d Ryan said Sunday on the CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. \u201cAnd we basically said, this is what we would replace it with. And now we are keeping our word.\u201d\n\nCritics including Democratic lawmakers, senior advocacy groups like AARP, which also sell health insurance, and former Department of Health and Human Services official Andy Slavitt charge that repealing the payroll tax hike will speed up the insolvency deadline and violate President Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to do nothing to cut Social Security or Medicare benefits.\n\nRelated: Is This Why the GOP Is Having Trouble Selling Its Health Care Plan?\n\n\u201cThis bill breaks a clear Trump promise not to harm Medicare,\u201d Sen.

Since Trump and the Republicans swept to victory in November, Ryan and other Republican House leaders have said they believe that the election results are a mandate to push a bold agenda including Medicare reform.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s campaign promise to take Medicare cuts off the table, Ryan told reporters in late February that the issue was still \u201can open question.\u201d He said that while he and Trump agreed that Medicare coverage for those who are retired or nearing retirement should be preserved, nothing should preclude taking steps to address the program\u2019s long-term costs and impact on the public debt.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a big-time entitlement reformer for a long time because if you don\u2019t start bending the cost curve in the out years, we are hosed,\u201d Ryan told reporters.\n\nTampering with Medicare for more than 55 million Americans is politically risky at best, and Trump and House Republicans already are hip-deep in controversy over repealing Obamacare, despite the possibility that as many as 15 million people could lose health care coverage over the coming decade.\n\nRelated: Is the Republican Health Care Bill Headed for a Do-Over?\n\nMedicare covers much of the cost of hospital care, physician visits and drugs for those 65 and older.

We believe credits inversely related to income, rather than age as proposed in the committee\u2019s legislation, not only result in greater numbers of people insured but are a more efficient use of taxpayer resources.\u201d\n\nRelated: OMB Director Mulvaney Blowing Smoke on Health Law\u2019s Impact\n\nThe elder advocacy group AARP warned that the tax credit system would end up costing low-income seniors not yet eligible for Medicare up to $8,400 a year in increased costs and that a proposal to cut and cap Medicaid funding would effectively eliminate the last resort for many poor people seeking health coverage.\n\n\u201cIn providing a fixed amount of federal funding per person, this approach to financing would likely result in overwhelming cost shifts to states, state taxpayers, and families unable to shoulder the costs of care without sufficient federal support. This would result in cuts to program eligibility, services, or both \u2013 ultimately harming some of our nation\u2019s most vulnerable citizens,\u201d the group senior vice president for public affairs, Joyce A. Rogers, said in a letter to Congress.\n\nOn Sunday, Dickerson asked Ryan about all the opposition the plan has been facing, including from Republican senators who have called on the House to slow down rather than trying to push through a bill that, currently, doesn\u2019t have enough support to pass in the Senate.\n\nThe Speaker said that waiting isn\u2019t an option, claiming that the current system is in imminent danger of collapse.

And the beautiful thing about this plan that we're proposing, it's more freedom. It's more choices. It's more markets. It's lower prices, which gets us better access.\u201d\n\nReturning to the pending CBO report on the ACHA, Dickerson asked again about the number of people who could be expected to lose coverage under the bill. Ryan refused to accept the premise of the question.\n\n\u201cI can't answer that question,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's up to people. Here's the premise of your question. Are you going to stop mandating people buy health insurance? People are going to do what they want to do with their lives because we believe in individual freedom in this country.\u201d\n\nThe next move in this game will come Monday or Tuesday, with the CBO\u2019s estimate of how many Americans would be forced to exercise their \u201cfreedom\u201d to go without health insurance under ACHA."}, {"date": "2017/03/13", "title": "Why the Republican Health Care Plan Is Destined to Fail", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/03/13/Why-Republican-Health-Care-Plan-Destined-Fail", "text": "\u201cIt is the general social consensus, clearly, that the laissez-faire solution for medicine is intolerable.\u201d \u2013 Kenneth Arrow, 1963.\n\nAs Republicans struggle to find an acceptable replacement for Obamacare, a task that does not yet appear to be complete given the growing opposition to their recent proposal, they would do well to remember the words of the person who invented healthcare economics, Kenneth Arrow.\n\nProfessor Arrow, a Nobel Prize-winning economist who recently passed away at the age of 95, argued that the market for healthcare is not like other markets for several reasons.\n\nHealthcare often involves large, unexpected expenses. To be able to pay these large expenses if and when they occur, people must have adequate savings or the ability to borrow when needed to cover the costs. But even that may not be enough, an individual may not have saved enough or be able to borrow enough to cover necessary healthcare costs. In the face of such uncertainty \u2013 not even knowing who will need healthcare and when \u2013 pooling money into an insurance fund and then sharing the risk of a major expenditure across individuals is a natural way to handle this uncertainty.\n\nRelated: Is the Republican Health Care Bill Headed for a Do-Over?\n\nBut health insurance markets have the well-known problems that are difficult to overcome. First, there is what economists call moral hazard \u2013- people tend to take more risks when they are insured or seek healthcare for trivial ailments. The insurance company is paying, so why not? Deductibles, which make it costly to take risks or get help for minor problems, are one way to overcome the moral hazard problem.\n\nThe bigger problem is called \u201cadverse selection.\u201d When people are pooled together in an insurance fund some will have very high expected medical costs (due, for example, to pre-existing conditions), others will have low expected costs, and the premium they are charged will reflect average healthcare use. For the healthy, that\u2019s a bad deal \u2013 the premiums are more than their expected health spending. So many of them won\u2019t purchase insurance (and the emergency room is available for serious problems, and if the bill is big enough someone else will end up paying). That leaves more people with high expected health costs in the insurance pool, leading to higher premiums and more dropouts, a process that continues until only the highest cost patients are left and the premiums are unaffordable.\n\nOne way to stop this spiral to market collapse is a mandate that keeps healthy people in the insurance pool. The mandate in Obamacare wasn\u2019t strong enough, and too many relatively healthy (and often young) people went without insurance. The mandate in the Republican proposal is even weaker and actually creates an incentive to go without insurance. The penalty for going without insurance does not occur until you sign up for insurance after a lapse, so the rational thing to do is to wait as long as possible before getting insurance. It\u2019s hard to see how this will work.\n\nRelated: The GOP Health Plan: A Giant Step in the Wrong Direction or Merely Step One?\n\nThe presence of insurance companies in the health services market creates another problem. It means people are going to have their choices \u2013 what will be paid for, the type of care, etc. \u2013 determined by insurance companies and the policies they offer. Unlike most other goods, you can\u2019t choose whatever health care treatment you want. The insurance company must approve it, and insurance companies will deny payment whenever possible. They have whole staffs devoted to finding reasons to deny payment, so some type of regulatory oversight is needed to ensure consumers get the care they were promised.\n\nBut the most problematic aspect of delivering healthcare in the private marketplace is that consumers do not have the information they need to make informed healthcare choices. What type of implantable heart monitor is best? If they are on sale down the road, can I trust the quality? Do I even need this procedure \u2013 are there other treatments that are equally or more effective? Doctors often disagree, if they don\u2019t know the answers, how can I make informed choices?\n\nWe often don\u2019t care about information problems; for example, the market for wine certainly involves a great deal of uncertainty on behalf of consumers. In many cases, people likely pay far too much for wine due to their lack of knowledge. But unlike health care, the consequences of making a bad wine choice won\u2019t end up harming your health permanently, or maybe even causing death. When market failures have potentially severe consequences, such as in healthcare or the financial sector, regulation is needed to insulate against very costly outcomes for individuals or the economy as a whole.\n\nRelated: The Staggering Cost of Medical Waste in America\n\nHow can the information problem be solved? One way is through professional standards, certification, and self-policing within the medical profession. We expect more from doctors than we expect from, say, car salespeople. We expect doctors to guide us in making the best possible healthcare choices, but I have no such expectation when I buy a car. Doctors could sell all sorts of unnecessary tests, follow-ups, etc. to unwitting consumers \u2013 think of all the unnecessary add-ons you are pressured to purchase after agreeing to buy a car \u2013 but we expect more from medical professionals.\n\nIn this regard, Professor Arrow made an interesting comment in an interview in 2009 when asked if anything had changed since he wrote his path-breaking paper on health economics decades ago:\n\n\u201cIf you look closely at my argument there is a sociological structure. There is a kind of sociological thesis. The market won't work -- it doesn't work well in the health context. But something else supplements the market, and the thing I put stress on in the paper are the elements that put a non-economic influence on the market: professional commitments to provide a service, to engage in services that aren't self-serving. Standards of caring decided by non-economic actors. And one problem we have now is an erosion of professional standards. In a way, there is more emphasis on markets and self-aggrandizement in the context of healthcare, and that has led to some of the problems we have today.\u201d\n\nAnother way to overcome the information problem is to let an informed agent make decisions on your behalf. This is the role that institutions such as HMO\u2019s are supposed to play. But HMOs make less money when consumers receive more care, and consumers do not trust HMO-type institutions to make important decisions about their health. Thus, regulatory oversight is needed to make sure that insurance companies are delivering policies that provide adequate coverage, and that consumers can get the care the pay for.\n\nRelated: Will CBO Deal a Death Blow to the GOP Health Care Plan?\n\nThat does not end the long, long list of problems in healthcare markets. For example, if everyone around me is healthier, I am less likely to get sick, so there are what economists call \u201cexternalities\u201d in these markets. When externalities are present, the private sector will not produce the socially desirable quantity of a good. Government mandates that, for example, require people to be vaccinated against some diseases can overcome this problem.\n\nWhen you put all of these problems together, especially the information problem, professor Arrow\u2019s assertion seems clearly true. The market for healthcare does not operate like most markets. Government involvement is needed to ensure consumers get the care they need, and to ensure that care providers are not taking advantage of consumer\u2019s lack of knowledge.\n\nOnce the need for government involvement to overcome market failures is accepted, and to me, it seems impossible to deny, the question is how well a particular healthcare proposal addresses these problems. Obamacare is not perfect, and some tweaks were needed. But it did a pretty good job of tackling these varied and difficult problems in healthcare markets.\n\nHowever, the Republican plan does not even seem to recognize the full extent of the problems in healthcare markets, and when it does, the remedies are far from adequate. Anyone who is serious about a delivering broad-based, affordable healthcare insurance should give it two bigly thumbs down."}, {"date": "2017/03/12", "title": "OMB Director Mulvaney Blowing Smoke on Health Law\u2019s Impact", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/12/OMB-Director-Mulvaney-Blowing-Smoke-Health-Law-s-Impact", "text": "The director of the Trump administration\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, former South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney, sat for a pair of interviews on Sunday morning, in which he questioned the credibility of three of the federal government\u2019s most respected non-partisan agencies and twisted himself into verbal knots in explaining how the proposed replacement for the Affordable Care Act currently being considered by Congress would improve the nation\u2019s health care system.\n\nMulvaney, appearing on CNN, was asked by host Jake Tapper to comment on the job growth numbers put out by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday, which showed unemployment shrinking to 4.7 percent even as wages increased and the economy created an estimated 235,000 jobs.\n\nRelated: Is the Republican Health Care Bill Headed for a Do-Over?\n\nTapper pointed out that during the campaign, Trump had repeatedly called the BLS statistics \u201cfake\u201d and insisted that the \u201creal\u201d rate of unemployment was actually as high as 40 percent. But on Friday, the White House celebrated the numbers. What changed?\n\nMulvaney began with some hand-waving about the alternative measure of unemployment known as the U6, which, unlike the more broadly cited U3, accounts for people marginally attached to the workforce and people involuntarily working only part-time.\n\n\u201cWhat I think changed is you start to look at some of the underlying numbers you look at the U6 number, already boring your audience. There are things like U3, U6, what you should really look at is the number of jobs created.\u201d\n\nIt should be noted here that there was absolutely nothing remarkable in Friday\u2019s U6 number. It was well within the range it has occupied since prior to the election.\n\nRelated: The GOP Health Plan: A Giant Step in the Wrong Direction or Merely Step One?\n\nThen, Mulvaney accused the BLS, which is staffed by career professionals, of cooking the books during the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cWe thought for a long time, I did, that the Obama administration was manipulating the number in terms of the number of people in the workforce to make the unemployment rate that percentage rate look smaller than it actually was. We used to tell people back home the only thing you should look at is the number of jobs created.\u201d\n\nBut if there were something magical about the number of jobs created in February, 235,000, Trump certainly wasn\u2019t acting like it when the economy added that many jobs or more in multiple months during his presidential campaign.\n\nMulvaney was forced, in the end, to admit that, despite the administration\u2019s change in attitude toward the BLS numbers, there is actually nothing really different about them. \u201cThe BLS did not change the way they count, I don\u2019t think, but you can have a long conversation when you\u2019ve got a numerator and a denominator how to arrive at a percentage.\n\nRelated: Is This Why the GOP Is Having Trouble Selling Its Health Care Plan?\n\nTapper then asked if President Trump was breaking his campaign promise not to touch Medicaid by supporting the House Republicans\u2019 American Health Care Act, which would strip hundreds of millions of dollars from the program and repeal the expansion it underwent through the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cJust because you spend less money on something doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t get better,\u201d Mulvaney said, insisting that improvements in efficiency and increased state-level control would improve the system for those using it.\n\nWhen Tapper pointed out that the ACHA\u2019s changes would result in many million fewer Americans being enrolled in the program, Mulvaney tried to thread the needle by insisting that because people currently covered under the expansion would be allowed to remain -- but new enrollees would not be accepted -- that the bill isn\u2019t really reducing anyone\u2019s access to healthcare.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t kick anybody off,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: The Staggering Cost of Medical Waste in America\n\nIn an interview on ABC, Mulvaney took the opportunity to criticize the well-respected Congressional Budget Office in advance of its expected release of an analysis of the ACHA\u2019s impact on healthcare markets, expected on Monday.\n\nAsked by host George Stephanopoulos about expert analysts who expect CBO to report that as many as 15 million Americans could lose coverage under ACHA, Mulvaney joined others in the White House, like Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who have challenged the competency of the agency.\n\n\u201cWe continue to think and have for a long time that CBO is scoring the wrong thing,\u201d he said. The congressional budget watchdog, he said, fails to consider the benefits of market competition, which he insisted the ACHA would generate, and also didn\u2019t take into account what he predicted as the \u201ccollapse\u201d of Obamacare.\n\nHe also took a swipe at the Joint Committee on Taxation, which last week released a report that found the repeal of multiple taxes related to the ACA would greatly benefit the wealthy, and another from the AARP, which found that it would increase costs for seniors by thousands of dollars a year.\n\nRelated: Will CBO Deal a Death Blow to the GOP Health Care Plan?\n\n\u201cI seriously doubt that any of those analyses take into account the fact that the use of Health Savings Accounts and the lower premiums that come from competition. Look, everybody\u2019s got skin in this game. Everybody has an interested party and they\u2019re trying to protect their own.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Health Savings Accounts, which allow individuals to set aside income tax free to pay for health-related expenses, are being asked to do an awful lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to the purported \u201cimprovements\u201d to that ACHA proponents are promising.\n\nAgain addressing the changes to the Medicaid program, Mulvaney insisted, \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is making sure that the truly indigent have care. Medicaid is still there. In fact, we think it\u2019s going to be even better. The people who are just above Medicaid but still have difficulty buying their own premiums will not only have the refundable tax credit but they will have the ability to use HSA\u2019s to pay for their health care on a tax-advantaged basis just like you and I get. So I don\u2019t understand the criticisms lobbed in that fashion.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack here:\n\nRelated: Medicare Could Save Nearly $16 Billion a Year Negotiating Drug Prices\n\nFirst, the tax credits being offered under the proposed ACHA would provide much, much less money for premium payments than the existing subsidy system under the ACA.\n\nSecond, the idea that people on the cusp of qualifying for Medicaid are somehow going to find enough spare income to fund an HSA at the level needed to pay for a decent health insurance policy is laughable on its face. (Not to mention that \u201ctax advantaged\u201d savings for people with income too low to trigger significant tax liability is not much of a benefit.)\n\nFinally, Mulvaney presents HSAs as though they are something new and innovative when in fact they have been around in their current form since 2003, and in different manifestations since the 1990s. If they were some sort of magic bullet to help the poor pay for care, they\u2019d have solved the health care affordability problem years ago.\n\nThe upside to Mulvaney\u2019s appearances is that he repeatedly said that the administration views the existing proposal as a \u201cframework\u201d and is open to improvements offered through the amendment process in Congress.\n\nGiven the level of opposition the ACHA is generating on both sides of the aisle, it will need them."}, {"date": "2017/03/12", "title": "Republicans\u2019 Medicaid and Housing Cuts Deal a Double Blow to Drug Crisis", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/12/Republicans-Medicaid-and-Housing-Cuts-Deal-Double-Blow-Drug-Crisis", "text": "President Trump campaigned last year vowing to address the nation\u2019s tragic epidemic of opiate addiction and overdoses and then brought it up again a week ago during his address to a joint session of Congress.\n\n\u201cWe will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted,\u201d Trump said.\n\nRelated: A Military Buildup and Big Tax Cuts: Is the Debt Set to Soar Under Trump?\n\nThe crisis is unmistakable: A record 33,000 people died of opioid overdoses in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and addiction to heroin and other powerful drugs is rampant. Once the scourge of inner cities and urban areas, drug addiction has now become a brutal fact of life in suburban and rural areas as well, including in New Hampshire, Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia.\n\nAnd yet, last week House Republicans and the Trump Administration unveiled austerity measures that when taken together would do incalculable harm to federal programs that assist drug addicts and the mentally ill.\n\nThe first was a House Republican proposal to strip out essential mental health and drug addiction treatment in the coming years as part of the GOP\u2019s highly controversial replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act. An estimated 1.3 million people currently receive treatment for mental health problems and substance abuse under an expanded Medicaid program in 31 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe Washington Post reported last week that the Republican\u2019s American Health Care Act would freeze and then roll back expanded Medicaid beginning in 2020, which means that many of those patients would be denied desperately needed treatment in the future. Moreover, if the Republicans prevail in overhauling the traditional Medicaid program converting it to a system of fixed, per-capita payments to the states, a far greater number of Americans could lose their mental health and drug treatment assistance in the coming years.\n\nRelated: A Plan to Drastically Cut EPA Staff and Programs Is on Trump\u2019s Desk\n\nMedicaid pays on average nearly 50 percent of medication assisted treatment in three states with some of the biggest drug addiction problems, including Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia, according to figures compiled by the National Center on Behavioral Health. In 2014, spending by Medicaid accounted for 25 percent of all mental health spending in the U.S. and 21 percent of all substance use disorder expenditures.\n\nJoshua Sharfstein, an associate dean at the Johns Hopkins Medical School, told The Washington Post that, taken as a whole the Republican plan to replace Obamacare \u201cis a major retreat from the effort to save lives in the opiate epidemic.\u201d\n\nBut the problem is even more serious than that. As part of its effort to offset the cost of a major military and homeland security buildup, the Trump administration has targeted the Department of Housing and Urban Development for $7.7 billion in fiscal 2018 \u2013 a 16 percent reduction in the agency\u2019s current $48.2 billion operating budget.\n\nThe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that those cuts if approved by Congress, would contribute to the loss of about 200,000 rental assistance units across the country. Funding for federal housing vouchers would plummet by about $900 million while rising housing costs and inflation would exacerbate the problem.\n\nRelated: Prospects Dim for Deficit Control as Trump Drives for Defense Buildup\n\nAt the same time, public housing funding for 2.1 million residents \u2013 many of them seniors or people with disabilities \u2013 would also take a hit under the budget reduction plan crafted by the Office of Management and Budget. \u201cReducing the availability of this crucial support would increase and prolong homelessness for vulnerable people with disabilities, families with children and others,\u201d wrote Douglas Rice, a housing expert and a senior policy analyst at the CBPP.\n\nMental health and drug addiction experts have long contended that drug addicts who have decent, safe and affordable housing respond far better to treatment than people who are homeless or living in squalor.\n\n\u201cPoor housing, such as housing that\u2019s too expensive, run-down or over-crowded, can lead to poor overall health,\u201d according to an analysis by BC Partners for Mental Health and Addiction Information, a group of seven leading health and addiction non-profit agencies. \u201cIt can also make recovery from mental health or substance problems much more difficult.\u201d\n\nIn an interview Friday, Rice of the CBPP said that a staggering number of homeless people living on the street have significant mental health issues or substance abuse problems that are difficult to treat without them having a more stable environment.\n\nRelated: Will CBO Deal a Death Blow to the GOP Health Care Plan?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of evidence showing that providing these folks with stable, affordable housing can be an important first step to securing treatment for the other issues that they face,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s what\u2019s called \u2018supportive housing\u2019 which combines affordable housing with treatment and other services that these guys benefit from.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/03/12", "title": "Is Rex Tillerson Already Irrelevant \u2013 or Playing a Long Game?", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/12/Rex-Tillerson-Already-Irrelevant-or-Playing-Long-Game", "text": "Later this month, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is scheduled to host a high-profile meeting in Washington with representatives of 68 nations involved in the U.S.-led coalition to fight the Islamic State.\n\nThe conclave will be Tillerson\u2019s first big moment at center stage as America\u2019s top diplomat, but it remains to be seen whether the meeting on Mar. 22 can put to rest the sense that the former ExxonMobil CEO has been sidelined as a major player in U.S. foreign policy.\n\nRelated: 'CEO' Tillerson Faces Internal Skeptics, Crisis-Battling White House\n\nIn mid-February, Tillerson did attend a gathering of G20 foreign ministers in Germany, but he largely avoided the press and didn\u2019t make much of a splash.

In a piece last May in the conservative Weekly Standard, Abrams had written: \"The party has nominated someone who cannot win and should not be president of the United States.\"\n\nThat apparently did not sit well with the man who did win and did become the Commander-in-Chief.

Whatever the explanation, over the last few days a lot of Republicans have made comments about medical care, the American poor and basic concepts like, well, health insurance that have given critics reason to question whether their reform effort is really meant to deliver higher quality, lower cost health care to the American people.\n\nTake House Speaker Paul Ryan, the man who rose to prominence in the GOP by dint of his supposed mastery of policy arcana. In a presentation to reporters on Thursday, he walked them through what he described as the \u201cfatal conceit\u201d of the Affordable Care Act: Healthy people buying insurance who turn out not to need care in the near term are \u201csubsidizing\u201d sicker people, who do need care.\n\nRelated: 3 Big Winners in the GOP Health Care Plan \u2013 and 3 Big Losers\n\nThat, as more than a few people quickly pointed out on social media and in the mainstream press, is pretty much how insurance is supposed to work.

If Ryan is opposed to the healthy subsidizing the sick, does he really believe in properly functioning health insurance at all?\n\nBut Ryan was far from the only Republican to raise some eyebrows over the past week. Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah, the chair of the House Oversight and Investigations Committee, suggested in an interview that poor Americans worried about losing health care if the Affordable Care Act is replaced with a less generous plan might just be a little too profligate in their non-healthcare spending.\n\n\u201cAmericans have choices, and they\u2019ve got to make a choice,\u201d he said on CNN. \u201cSo rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and want to go spend hundreds of dollars on that, maybe they should invest in their own health care.\u201d\n\nFor most Americans, of course, a new iPhone is something they might buy every few years, and typically at the cost of less than a month\u2019s worth of insurance premiums. After Chaffetz\u2019s appearance on CNN, the woman planning to run against him in 2018 reported a huge spike in donations to her campaign.\n\nRelated: Is the Republican Health Care Bill Headed for a Do-Over?\n\nThen, there\u2019s Florida Rep. Mike DeSantis, who said in an interview that cancer patients who lose coverage under ACHA need not worry, because they can go to the emergency room.\n\nOn CNN, DeSantis was asked about the case of a young woman who self-identified as a Republican. She said that she suffers from cancer and that she would lose access to treatment without the ACA\u2019s expanded access to Medicaid.\n\n\u201cWell, if you remember when Obamacare was enacted, there were millions of people who had their health care canceled,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cAnd so there are stories of people who had certain needs, cancer or whatnot, who got pushed into policies that they didn\u2019t want, and then they didn\u2019t have the same coverage that they had because of the broken promise ... I would say though, and people who supported Obamacare used to make this point a lot before it passed, there really is no lack of health care. If people really need it, they show up to the emergency room, they do get care, it just gets passed on to other folks.\u201d\n\nOnce again, the very idea of health insurance and the need for proper medical care seems to be in question here.\n\nRelated: The GOP Health Plan: A Giant Step in the Wrong Direction or Merely Step One?\n\nThen there was Illinois Rep. John Shimkus, who seemed to temporarily forget some fundamental facts about how babies are made. During a mark-up of the GOP\u2019s proposed ACA replacement bill, Shimkus was complaining about the current law\u2019s mandates when he was interrupted by Pennsylvania Democrat Michael Doyle.\n\nDoyle: What mandate in the Obamacare bill does he take issue with? Certainly not with pre-existing conditions, or caps on benefits or letting your child stay on the policy until 26, so I\u2019m curious what is it we\u2019re mandating?\n\nShimkus: What about men having to purchase prenatal care? Is that not correct? And should they?\n\nDoyle: There\u2019s no such thing as a la carte insurance, John.\n\nShimkus: That\u2019s the point. We want the consumer to be able to go to the insurance market and be able to negotiate on a plan.\n\nDoyle: There\u2019s not a single insurance company in the world that does that. You\u2019re talking about something that doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nOnline, people relentlessly reminded Shimkus of just why women need pre-natal care, and the mechanics of how they get to that point. More broadly, Shimkus was reminded that insurance works for everyone who has a policy, whether they need a particular service or not.\n\nBut perhaps the oddest and most disturbing comment came last week, from Rep. Roger Marshall of Kansas, who is himself a doctor.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Won\u2019t Be Cheap: GOP Plan Could Cost $700 Billion\n\n\u201cJust like Jesus said, \u2018The poor will always be with us,\u2019\u201d he told the medical website Stat. \u201cThere is a group of people that just don\u2019t want health care and aren\u2019t going to take care of themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust, like, homeless people \u2026 I think just morally, spiritually, socially, [some people] just don\u2019t want health care,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Medicaid population, which is [on] a free credit card, as a group, do probably the least preventive medicine and taking care of themselves and eating healthy and exercising.

Because the government spends more money than it takes in, raising the debt ceiling is also essential to keep cash flowing to operate defense and domestic government programs and to make sure that millions of Americans continue to receive their Social Security checks on time.\n\nThe task almost invariably becomes enmeshed in larger partisan disputes over budget and tax policy and frequently raises the specter of a partial government shutdown if left unresolved.\n\nIn his letter, Mnuchin revealed that the Treasury Department was suspending the sale of certain state and local securitie, a task the Treasury routinely performs to assist state and localities in meeting their obligations. By doing so, the Treasury technically slows the rate of growth of government borrowing.\n\nOther maneuvers the Treasury likely will take to forestall the threat of default include delaying the reinvestment of assets in the Federal Employees\u2019 Retirement System G-Fund, the Exchange Stabilization Fund and the civil service and postal retirement fund.\n\nThose and other steps would likely enable the Treasury to continue making all payments until at least mid-August or early September, but it's unclear what would happen beyond then, according to some budget analysts.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Lofty Vision of Renewal Comes with a Huge Price Tag\n\nBut not everyone is so sanguine. David Stockman, the storied White House budget director during the Reagan administration, insists that the Treasury\u2019s financial picture is direr than Mnuchin is letting on and that \u201cthey are burning through cash at the Treasury like drunken sailors.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the first 46 days of the Trump administration they burned through $294 billion of cash,\u201d after starting with $382 billion, Stockman told Fox News this week. If they continue at last year\u2019s rate, he said, \u201cThey will be out of cash by Memorial Day\u201d at the end of May.\n\nTrump and the Republicans will need some support from Democrats to raise the debt ceiling since many conservatives refuse to support a boost in borrowing authority. Stockman said there is currently \u201cno pathway\u201d to a majority of Congress agreeing to raise the debt ceiling given the poisonous divide between Republicans and Democrats over policies ranging from immigration to health care reform.\n\n\u201cBy May, the Republican Party is going to be in tatters, and there will be no majority to raise the debt ceiling, and then the rubber will meet the road,\u201d he said. \u201cThis debt ceiling crisis is going to take down the whole system.\u201d\n\nRelated: Will CBO Deal a Death Blow to the GOP Health Care Plan?\n\nIn 2015, Congress and the Obama administration declared a temporary truce on debt ceiling politics by agreeing to suspend the debt limit until March 15 of this year \u2013 just a few days from now. At that point, the Treasury technically will be unable to borrow additional funds without the consent of Congress and the White House.\n\nPresident Trump created a stir in financial circles during the 2016 campaign by lightly dismissing the importance of the debt ceiling. He even suggested that if push came to shove, he would try to negotiate down the debt with the country\u2019s biggest creditors. And White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, a former Tea Party conservative House member, has long voiced skepticism of the dangers of the Treasury defaulting on its debt, suggesting that Congress and the administration could \u201cprioritize\u201d repayments of loans and federal expenditures.\n\nBut Mnuchen, a wealthy former Wall Street banker and hedge fund manager, takes the debt ceiling deadly seriously. He made it clear in his letter to Ryan that the debt ceiling demands immediate attention, even while the GOP-controlled Congress and White House are struggling to pass legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRelated: Putting Trump\u2019s \u2018Historic\u2019 $54 Billion Military Spending Boost Into Context\n\n\u201cAs I said in my confirmation hearing, honoring the full faith and credit of our outstanding debt is a critical commitment,\u201d Mnuchin told Ryan. \u201cI encourage Congress to raise the debt limit at the first opportunity so we can proceed with our joint priorities.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury has had close brushes with default over the decades.

There are boxes of IV fluids and bags of ostomy supplies and kits with everything you\u2019d need to perform an obstetrics surgery.\n\nThis, however, isn\u2019t a story of about the crippling price of medical supplies. This is about the high cost of medical supplies that hospitals throw away.\n\nRelated: Why a Third of American Health Care Costs Are Considered Unnecessary\n\nOn a recent snowy day the warehouse\u2019s 65-year-old proprietor, Elizabeth McLellan, gave an indignant accounting: She yanked a urinary catheter out of one bin. It\u2019s unopened and has an expiration date of July 2018. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to get rid of this.\u201d A box of 30 new feeding bags has an August 2019 expiration date. The same type sells on Amazon.com for $129.\n\nThat surgical stapler? It\u2019s unopened. The same model sells online for $189. And McLellan simply shook her head over a set of a dozen long thin laparoscopic surgery instruments that some hospital discarded. Similar used tools can go for hundreds of dollars.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with these, nothing wrong with any of these,\u201d she said.\n\nTen years ago, McLellan, a registered nurse, shocked to see what hospitals were tossing out, began asking them to give her their castoffs instead. In 2009 she launched Partners for World Health, a nonprofit that now has four warehouses throughout Maine. Today, she and hundreds of volunteers collect medical equipment and supplies from a network of hospitals and medical clinics, sort them and eventually ship containers full of them to countries like Greece, Syria and Uganda.\n\n\u201cThis is money.\u201d McLellan said, extending her arm to the vast array of supplies. \u201cThis is one of the reasons why your health insurance is so expensive.\u201d\n\nThe vexing riddle of how to make health care more affordable has seldom been more front and center on the national stage. President Trump and Republican lawmakers are wrestling with the future of the Affordable Care Act, which has helped millions of people obtain health insurance. But most Americans would rather their legislators focus on bringing down health care costs, according to a recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Two-thirds of those surveyed said reducing such costs should be the \u201ctop\u201d health care priority for Trump and the Republican-led Congress.\n\nTalk to experts and many agree that waste would be a good place to start. In 2012 the National Academy of Medicine estimated the U.S. health care system squandered $765 billion a year, more than the entire budget of the Defense Department. Dr. Mark Smith, who chaired the committee that authored the report, said the waste is \u201ccrowding out\u201d spending on critical infrastructure needs, like better roads and public transportation. The annual waste, the report estimated, could have paid for the insurance coverage of 150 million American workers \u2014 both the employer and employee contributions.\n\nRelated: Is the Republican Health Care Bill Headed for a Do-Over?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable that we\u2019re not only wasting money in health care but in doing so are sacrificing other important social needs,\u201d Smith said.\n\nSmith\u2019s committee blames the obvious villains \u2014 overtreatment, excess administrative costs and high prices \u2014 for most of the fat in the system. Left untallied, however, are the discards that arrive in waves into McLellan\u2019s warehouses, most of which would otherwise end up in landfills. McLellan estimates the goods her group has right now are worth $20 million. Sure, that\u2019s a rounding error in the overall waste tab, but it starts being real money if you add up the discards of all the nation\u2019s medical facilities.\n\nResearchers at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center, for instance, recently estimated that in a single year the hospital wasted $2.9 million in neurosurgery supplies alone. Nearly $3 million. On wasted supplies. In one department.\n\nLast year Partners sent seven containers overseas, each weighing up to 15,000 pounds and with an estimated value of up to $250,000. One is being sent to Syria this week. It includes an ultrasound machine ($25,000), a dozen trocars ($4,400) and an infant warmer ($3,995).\n\nMedShare, a Georgia-based nonprofit more than 10 times the size of Partners, sent 156 containers of discarded medical supplies to developing countries last year, each one worth as much as $175,000. As lawmakers debate, ProPublica is setting off to document the rarely examined \u2014 and mind-boggling \u2014 ways your health care dollars are frittered away. Our first stop: the world of \u201cmedical surplus.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a display case in the Partners headquarters that sums up the heedless wealth of American health care. On one side are medical supplies McLellan brought home from Bangladesh: a yellowed plastic respirator mask, dirty tubing and a bloodstained square of gauze that\u2019s brown and stiff from being washed and reused over and over again. Above them a sign reads, \u201cShared By Thousands.\u201d On the other side are the same items, sterile and new, the discards of local health care facilities in the U.S.\n\nMcLellan once worked as a nurse in Saudi Arabia and her wardrobe reflects her extensive travels in the developing world: velveteen pants from China, a chunky sea rock necklace from Senegal and bangles from Ethiopia. Places that welcome our medical largesse.\n\nRelated: 3 Big Winners in the GOP Health Care Plan \u2013 and 3 Big Losers\n\nAt the back of her office, she pushed through a set of swinging double doors that led to her disposable medical supplies warehouse, a room the size of a gymnasium, with 20-foot ceilings and glassy concrete floors.\n\nDonations from throughout Maine, Vermont and Massachusetts come in through a loading dock at the back. McLellan calls it \u201cgolden trash\u201d and it generally falls into a handful of categories: equipment discarded for upgraded models, supplies tossed after a hospital changed vendors, or materials donated by the families of patients who have died. Other items are past their expiration dates or were swept out by strict infection control procedures, but remain safely usable.\n\nMcLellan grabs a bag from a haphazard, 10-foot mound of boxes and bulging sacks waiting to be sorted. Its contents, she says, came from a single room in a hospital\u2019s intensive care unit. She dumps the bag out onto a table like a kid pouring out a pillowcase full of Halloween candy. The stuff rains down into a pile that\u2019s three square feet: Handfuls of unopened and unexpired sterile needles, two dozen sterile syringes, packets of alcohol and antiseptic pads, IV tubing; a roll of tape that\u2019s never been used, a bag of IV solution that expires in September 2018, 14 saline flushes that expire in 2019, an unopened package of suction catheters and a pulse oximeter adapter.\n\n\u201cThis is normal,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is every hospital.\u201d\n\nMcLellan started her nonprofit after watching patient rooms being cleaned out at Maine Medical Center, where she was a nurse administrator. When patients were discharged, hospital staff threw out everything, including unopened supplies. McLellan got permission from the hospital\u2019s CEO to put out bins to save the discarded items.\n\nA year and a half later, she\u2019d gathered more than 11,000 pounds of supplies and equipment in her house. Today, Partners has three paid employees \u2014 McLellan is a volunteer \u2014 and an annual budget of $357,000, most of it from individual donations. Hundreds of volunteers pitch in. Similar nonprofits have sprung up around the country.\n\nOn a recent afternoon, Donald Madison, 47, Paul Farren, 69, and William Silveira, 85, picked up a used anesthesia machine, an exam table and other items at a Maine Medical Center storage facility and brought them to a different Partners\u2019 warehouse stuffed with medical hardware: a sea of new-looking wheelchairs, a shiny mountain of walkers and canes and neat rows of IV pumps. The biomedical equipment room has ultrasound machines, anesthesia machines, laparoscopic surgery towers and more. Biomedical engineers check out each piece before it is sent on to a country in need.\n\nMadison, a supervisor at a retail pharmacy, said it\u2019s easy to get disgusted by the waves of wasted medical goods pouring through the warehouse. He grabbed a $30 walker from the pile. \u201cWe\u2019ll get 400 more of them this year,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy do we need everyone on Medicare to get a new walker?\u201d\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Won\u2019t Be Cheap: GOP Plan Could Cost $700 Billion\n\nAnd those pallets of adult diapers stacked high on a shelf? He sells the same type at his pharmacy for $11.99 per package or more. Farren recalled one time they picked up about 100 unopened packages of diapers from the home of a patient who had died. \u201cIt was ridiculous,\u201d he said.\n\nMcLellan is sensitive about the built-in tension of her mission. The hospitals are casting off useful supplies that would otherwise be sent to a landfill. But they are also donating items that are desperately needed in the developing world. \u201cThey are trying to be good stewards in our community and in their world,\u201d she said.\n\nOn the flip side, she can\u2019t look past the waste. She said she could fill 15 shipping containers now if she had the $25,000 it cost to send each one overseas.\n\nHospital officials either declined to comment or, sometimes sheepishly, said some of the waste was unavoidable. Elton Cole, the supply chain manager at Stephens Memorial Hospital in western Maine, said some items, such as a torn exam table, must be replaced to meet infection control guidelines. Same goes for those supplies left in patient rooms. At Stephens, he said, the supplies in the room, such as bandages or gloves, are typically included in the room charge and not billed directly to patients.\n\nHealth care finance experts say while patients might not see the cost in their bills, the wasted supplies boost a hospital\u2019s overhead, which in turn makes everyone\u2019s costs higher.\n\nThe waste \u201ccontributes a lot to the cost of health care,\u201d Cole said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty phenomenal the tons of product we\u2019re shipping out to Elizabeth\u2019s group.\u201d\n\nPatricia Fallows, who organizes the University of Vermont Medical Center donations to Partners, sent ProPublica a list of the typical shipment. Among the 100 items are a Medline Skin Staple Remover ($100), a box of Carefusion Blood Sets ($100 for 10) and three cases of unexpired Ethicon sutures ($431 per box). (ProPublica is using the list price of the products online, since the prices hospitals and other medical facilities pay vary widely depending on their individual deals with suppliers.) Officials at the medical center said the waste is a tiny percentage of their budget and some of it is unavoidable.\n\nWe called the National Rural Health Association in Leawood, Kansas, to see if they could use anything on this list.\n\nRelated: GOP Health Care Plan Would Cost the States Billions in Lost Medicaid Funds\n\n\u201cOh my gosh!\u201d said Brock Slabach, the vice president for member services. \u201cSome of the equipment I know folks would be interested in.\u201d\n\nSlabach said more than 600 rural hospitals are so strapped financially they risk closure and according to the data, some may be uncomfortably similar to facilities in Algeria and Bangladesh. Wealthier hospitals\u2019 waste could help them stay afloat.\n\n\u201cEvery little bit helps,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of these things will cure the entire problem altogether. But it would be helpful to meet a need in a community.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, quantifying what\u2019s being squandered is difficult. There is scant research, so it\u2019s easy for hospitals to say it doesn\u2019t add up to much.\n\nDr. Corinna Zygourakis, the chief neurosurgery resident at UCSF, who has studied operating room waste, said hospitals may not like what they\u2019d find. \u201cIt\u2019s not nice to say, \u2018Hey, look at the amount of money we\u2019re wasting.\u201d\n\nShe decided to study waste after a medical mission trip to Mexico in 2015. At UCSF it was common to set out an array of disposable surgical instruments in the sterile field of the operating room just in case a surgeon needed them. Often the surgeon wouldn\u2019t even touch the instruments, but they, nevertheless, had to be discarded. In Mexico, they wouldn\u2019t have been.\n\nZygourakis and a team of colleagues tracked 58 neurosurgeries at UCSF and tallied the unused supplies that were discarded. In 26 surgeries, all the blood clotting materials weren\u2019t used, for a total of $3,749. In 16, an expensive tissue adhesive wasn\u2019t used at a cost of $3,495. Screws were wasted on three cases, totaling $3,144. The items marked as wasted were not billed to patients, and were donated whenever possible, she said.\n\nBut the study\u2019s findings, published in Journal of Neurosurgery in 2016, were eye-opening: The public hospital wasted an estimated $968 per neurosurgery case, which amounted to about $2.9 million over the course of a year.\n\nUCSF reviewed all the preference cards for each surgeon, which specify how the operating room should be set up before each operation. The hospital now makes sure the set-up doesn\u2019t include supplies that aren\u2019t actually needed, preventing a significant amount of the waste.\n\nIn a separate study in the December edition of JAMA Surgery, Zygourakis and her colleagues showed each UCSF surgeon his or her direct costs per procedure in comparison to other surgeons in the institution. Most doctors were unaware of operating-room costs. Then they gave them an incentive: Their departments would get a bonus if they reduced costs by at least 5 percent.\n\nThe median surgical supply costs dropped by 6.5 percent in the group of surgeons who participated \u2014 a savings of about $836,000 over one year \u2014 while the control group\u2019s costs increased by almost 7.5 percent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to make people aware of this,\u201d Zygourakis said. \u201cThe younger generation of physicians and surgeons do care about these things. We do realize we have limited resources and want to see how we can provide the most and best care to the most number of patients.\u201d\n\nBack in Maine, McLellan said she would love for the medical community to put her out of business by cutting the waste and passing the savings on to patients. She\u2019s invited hospital CEOs to visit her warehouses, to see the vast display of wasted health care dollars. So far none have come.\n\n\u201cI want to go talk to Trump,\u201d McLellan said. \u201cTrump wants to figure out how to do this business in a different way, how to be more cost effective. I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t understand what the waste is. Not this kind of waste.

Another law prohibits businesses from directly donating to federal-level candidates or political parties.\n\nRelated: If France Elects Le Pen, Another Country Will Have Been Scared Stupid\n\nBut the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United case cleared the way for corporations and unions to pay for political ads made independently of candidates\u2019 campaigns. The high court ruled that corporations and unions are associations of U.S. citizens with a First Amendment right to political expression.\n\nHoping to take the decision a step further, proponents of bills under consideration in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Washington state would bar political spending by businesses in which non-U.S. citizens have a significant ownership stake.\n\n\u201cIf a company is owned and controlled by foreign nationals, then I think we really have to take a hard look at how that is consistent with the existing law on the books that says foreign nationals aren\u2019t allowed to spend money in our elections,\u201d said Federal Election Commissioner Ellen Weintraub, who has been testifying in support of the idea at the state level after the FEC deadlocked on a similar proposal.\n\nSponsors of the legislation aren\u2019t sure how much foreign money makes its way into state elections, because under current law it doesn\u2019t have to be disclosed. But there are several recent examples of companies with foreign ties spending significant sums at the state level.\n\nThe ride-hailing company Uber, along with its competitor Lyft, together spent $9 million on a 2016 ballot initiative in Austin, Texas, that would have overturned the city\u2019s requirement that drivers for the companies undergo fingerprint-based background checks. The Chinese ride-hailing company Didi invested $100 million in Lyft, and Uber announced a few weeks after the election that Saudi Arabia had secured a 5 percent stake in the company with a $3.5 billion investment. Airbnb, the short-term rental company owned in part by Russia-based company DST Global, gave $10 million to its super PAC to run ads on New York state lawmakers\u2019 positions on short-term rentals during the 2016 election.\n\nBut critics say having some foreign ties \u2014 especially minimal ones \u2014 should not disqualify corporations from participating in the political process.\n\n\u201cCorporations have a right to speak about politics. It\u2019s a strange calculus that says we\u2019re going to sacrifice the rights of the 95 percent American ownership for the 5 percent foreign ownership,\u201d said Allen Dickerson with the Center for Competitive Politics, a First Amendment group that supports the Citizens United decision.\n\nHow Much Is Too Much?\n\nThe proposals vary in the percentage of foreign ownership that would bar a corporation from political participation.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s the Real Puzzle About the Trump-Russia Connection\n\nIn Massachusetts, the proposed prohibition would block companies from donating to super PACs or running political ads if they have a single foreign owner who owns 5 percent or more of the company, or multiple foreign owners who combined own 20 percent or more of the company. Super PACs, or political action committees, can raise unlimited sums of money from corporations, but cannot contribute directly to campaigns or political parties or coordinate their political advertising with either.\n\nA Connecticut bill imposes similar requirements. The Washington state measure would apply to businesses that are majority-owned by foreigners. And a Maryland bill would prevent any company whose principal place of business is outside the U.S. from spending money on state ballot initiatives.\n\n\u201cCertainly a company owned by more than 50 percent foreign nationals \u2026 raises a very sharp question of who is using the leverage of corporate treasury to influence democracy,\u201d said Ron Fein with Free Speech for People, which fights corporate spending in politics and helped draft the Massachusetts bill. \u201cWe think companies with less than 50 percent run that same danger.\u201d\n\nIn a hearing on the Washington bill, Republican Sen. Kirk Pearson questioned whether any \u201cforeign country would care about my election in the 39th District.\u201d\n\nBut while big ad buys and contributions are still rare in legislative races in most states, statewide elections and ballot initiatives are attracting more cash.\n\nSpending in state elections has been growing steadily since 2000, according to data from the National Institute on Money in State Politics, which tracks spending in state races. Adjusting for inflation, candidates in 2000 collected nearly $1.2 billion in contributions compared with $2.3 billion in 2014, the last major election year for which there is complete data.\n\nU.S. businesses also are becoming more international. According to data from the Federal Reserve, foreign ownership of U.S. corporate stock has grown from about 5 percent in 1982 to 26 percent in 2015.\n\nThose two trends are helping fuel the debate.\n\nRelated: Your Guide to the Players in the Trump-Russia Investigation\n\n\u201cThe board of a public company generally conceives of themselves as working for the shareholders,\u201d said John C. Coates, a professor at Harvard Law School who testified in favor of the bill in Connecticut. \u201cThat affects the policy decisions the company supports, the candidates they may support, lobbying on certain laws that may affect their business model, ideas about what countries it wants to engage in trade with \u2014 all of those are affected by having a significant foreign owner.\u201d\n\nDefending Citizens United\n\nJim Manley, a lawyer with the Goldwater Institute, a conservative think tank that has filed a lawsuit to overturn a Massachusetts law that bars corporations from giving directly to state candidates, said the bills ask businesses to give up too much.\n\n\u201cThe problem is what that says to corporations is if you allow foreigners to buy stock in your company, you\u2019re giving up the corporation\u2019s First Amendment rights,\u201d Manley said. \u201cIf I own a company with my friend who\u2019s a foreign national, I shouldn\u2019t be prohibited and the corporation shouldn\u2019t be totally banned from speech just because a foreign national has a vote on how the corporation spends its money.\u201d\n\nBoth Manley and Dickerson of the Center for Competitive Politics suspect the real intent of the proposals is to undermine the Citizens United decision. \u201cHow much of this is an attempt to prevent indirectly what we can\u2019t do directly, which is prevent businesses from speaking? I understand there are people who don\u2019t like Citizens United, but it\u2019s the law,\u201d Dickerson said.\n\nSupporters of the bills deny that charge. Weintraub opposes the Citizens Uniteddecision, but she argues that state efforts to limit foreign influence honor the logic behind it.\n\n\u201cThis is just trying to put meat on the bones. What does it mean to be an association of citizens and when are corporations not an association of citizens?\u201d she said. \u201cWhen is foreign ownership too much?\u201d\n\nDemocratic state Sen. Ted Kennedy Jr., who sponsored the bill in Connecticut, said that a disclosure requirement might be a middle ground between supporters and opponents of spending restrictions. \u201cCitizens deserve to know who is making these contributions,\u201d he said.\n\nCompliance Difficulties\n\nAnother potential pitfall of the legislation, according to critics, is that it would be difficult for corporations to certify a level of foreign ownership. Stocks are routinely traded, they argue, and large investment houses make purchases on behalf of thousands of people.\n\nDickerson said the FEC policies already in place for wholly owned subsidiaries of foreign companies target what is most important: that PAC money comes from American operations and that Americans make the decisions about how it is spent.\n\n\u201cThere is a tendency in the legislative and political process to underappreciate both how interconnected American businesses are with the larger global economy and the difficulty of parsing these things out at that level of detail,\u201d Dickerson said.\n\nBut Coates said companies already know if 5 percent or more of their stock is foreign-owned because under federal law they must report any purchase of that size, as well as the nationality of the buyer, to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Furthermore, he said, publicly traded companies already collect that kind of information on stockholders for their annual shareholder meetings.\n\nState Sen. Andy Billig, the Washington Democrat who is pushing legislation there, said the claim that some companies don\u2019t know who their owners are only strengthens his case. If they can\u2019t figure it out, he said, \u201cthen they should not be allowed to participate in campaigns.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared on Stateline.

The addition of 235,000 jobs to the economy, rising wages, falling unemployment and the return of workers to the labor force are unquestionably positive developments in that they signal strengthening economic growth. But they are bad news for the federal deficit and debt.\n\nThat\u2019s because the signs of a strengthening economy from the jobs report make it much more likely that the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy makers on the Federal Open Market Committee will vote later this month to raise interest rates, and that they may well do so two times more before 2017 is over.\n\nRelated: Medicare Could Save Nearly $16 Billion a Year Negotiating Drug Prices\n\nIn and of itself, that isn\u2019t a bad thing. Rates are still sitting near historic lows, and raising them isn\u2019t likely to have major negative effects on the economy. However, it does mean that as rates rise and the federal government keeps borrowing money to finance deficit spending and to roll over existing debt, both at increasingly higher rates of interest, the amount of money the country spends on debt service will take up a larger and larger share of the federal budget.\n\n\u201cThis is one reason that we can\u2019t really count on economic growth to fix all our problems because it has offsetting effects,\u201d said Marc Goldwein, a senior vice president with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \u201cFaster growth is always better than slower growth, but it\u2019s not a pure win for the federal budget. There are offsetting effects in the form of higher interest payments and larger Social Security benefits.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, this doesn\u2019t have to be so. If Congress were willing to find a way to increase federal revenues, the percentage of the national outlay on debt service as a share of the budget could be kept steady. Likewise, if Congress were willing to spend less in order to reduce or eliminate the deficit, the Treasury wouldn\u2019t need to add to the debt burden.\n\nBut judging from the proposals emanating from both the Trump White House (Trillion dollar infrastructure spending! Massive defense buildup!) and from Congress (Big tax cuts for the wealthy! Bigger tax cuts for business!) federal revenues are headed down, not up, and both the deficit and the debt are likely to increase.\n\nRelated: Trump Uses His \u2018Discredit Tactic\u2019 on CBO to Hedge Against Negative Report\n\nThat means that for every dollar in taxes Americans send to the Treasury in April, a little more is going to go to debt service, and less is going to go to the services delivered by the federal government. In Fiscal 2016, according to the Treasury Department, the federal government paid $433 billion in interest on its outstanding debt of nearly $20 trillion.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office says rising interest rates have a clear and dramatic effect on the Treasury Department\u2019s interest payments. In the first five months of Fiscal 2017, the government had already spent $188 billion on interest payments.\n\nIn an analysis last year, the Capitol Hill budget watchdog agency wrote:\n\nIf interest rates on all types of Treasury securities were 1 percentage point higher each year through 2026 than is projected in the baseline and all other economic variables were unchanged, the government\u2019s interest costs would be substantially larger. The difference would amount to only $16 billion in 2016 because most marketable government debt is in the form of securities that have maturities greater than one year. As the Treasury replaced maturing securities, however, the budgetary effects of higher interest rates would mount. Added costs from higher interest rates on the debt projected in CBO\u2019s baseline would reach $200 billion in 2026 under this scenario.\n\nThe cumulative impact is even more dramatic, CBO notes. \u201cIn sum, if interest rates were 1 percentage point higher than projected in CBO\u2019s baseline, the deficit would worsen progressively over the projection period by amounts increasing from $38 billion in 2016 to $260 billion in 2026. The cumulative deficit would be $1.6 trillion higher over the 2017\u20132026 period.\u201d\n\nRelated: Will CBO Deal a Death Blow to the GOP Health Care Plan?\n\nGoldwein of CRFB explains, \u201cThe interest feedback is going to be so large is because the debt is so large. If your debt is low, a one percent increase doesn\u2019t have a big effect. But when your debt is high, the effect can be large.\u201d\n\nTo protect against interest rate risk, he said, the best thing the country could do would be to reduce the national debt, if not on an absolute basis, then at least as a share of Gross Domestic Product."}, {"date": "2017/03/10", "title": "If France Elects Le Pen, Another Country Will Have Been Scared Stupid", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/03/10/If-France-Elects-Le-Pen-Another-Country-Will-Have-Been-Scared-Stupid", "text": "The French, along with the rest of Europe, were on the edges of their seats before the American elections last autumn: Who will it be\u2014a right-wing populist disrupter or a centrist favoring liberal economics, open borders, global institutions, and a foreign policy that rests on longstanding alliances?\n\nNow it\u2019s our turn to watch and wonder as the first round of France\u2019s presidential elections approaches. While numerous contenders will be on the April 23rd ballot, there are two names to watch. One is the Front National\u2019s Marine Le Pen, a vigorous nationalist and the closest the French have to Donald Trump. The other is Emmanuel Macron, a centrist defector from Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s socialist government who has surged swiftly to the fore after creating his own political movement a year ago called, En Marche!\n\nRelated: Macron Consolidates Lead Over Le Pen in French Election Polls\n\nThe winner will be setting the political, economic and cultural course for France and perhaps the rest of Europe and its allies for years to come.\n\nThe emergence of these two as front-runners follows months of uncertainty and some unexpected political casualties. Now the opinion surveys are becoming a lot clearer. A Harris Interactive poll released Thursday has Macron taking 26 percent of the first-round tally to Le Pen\u2019s 25 percent. That\u2019s a gain of 6 percentage points for the 39-year-old Macron in the past two weeks.\n\nIn a May 7 runoff between Macron and Le Pen, which seems extremely likely, Macron will likely trounce Le Pen, 65 percent to 35 percent, the Harris poll indicates. But French politics have proven as volatile as America\u2019s during this campaign season. It\u2019s far too soon to count Le Pen out.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot at stake in the French results for Americans. Starting at the top, the strength of the trans\u2013Atlantic alliance hangs in the balance. While Macron is a staunch believer in the European Union, Le Pen is radically opposed to it\u2014and the euro, too. Many analysts assert that if she is the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace\u2019s next resident, it\u2019s the end of the European project altogether.\n\nA splintering Europe is a weaker Europe, which is the last thing Washington needs to maintain global security. If the Trans\u2013Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership dies along with its Pacific counterpart, the U.S. goal of a unified trade regime based on free-market principles will come to nothing. The alternative will be a pasta bowl of separately agreed bilateral accords--a Commerce Department nightmare. A divided Continent will complicate Washington\u2019s trans\u2013Atlantic ties economically.\n\nRelated: Dollar Rises as Euro Dips on French Election Development\n\nOn Monday, the EU announced in Brussels that members agreed to institutionalize joint military training\u2014a move that would please the Pentagon. If Le Pen goes to the second round and wins, that deal is off the table. De Gaulle-like, she\u2019s on the record promising to pull France out of the NATO alliance. Along with this, she favors a Trump-style d\u00e9tente with Russia, which would complicate both US foreign policy with a core ally, but also American national security. Le Pen received \u201ca hefty loan from a Russian bank, and Mr. Macron\u2019s organization has suffered more than 4,000 hacking attacks,\u201d The Economist reported.\n\nLike other right-wing populists in Europe\u2014and our own president\u2014Le Pen trades on insecurities. Horrible terrorist attacks that eluded France\u2019s security system, a chronically sluggish economy and persistently high unemployment\u201425 percent of French youth are unemployed\u2014have turned France into the most pessimistic of the industrial democracies, a recent survey shows. Such conditions are just right for a candidate fanning anxieties about immigrant populations, global institutions, and free trade.\n\nEven though Donald Trump eschews multinational trade deals in favors of bilateral deals, a Le Pen victory this spring would be bad news for the U.S. And even though Trump is also a disrupter, his America First campaign along with his border tax proposal could alienate a France First nationalist like Le Pen.\n\nRelated: Kremlin Denies French Election Meddling, Macron Camp Renews Charges\n\nMacron is 180\u00b0 Le Pen\u2019s opposite on all the core questions. He backs the basic institutions supporting the postwar order, and his economics are neoliberal centrist. He pledges to cut the corporate tax rate from 33 percent to 25 percent while giving companies permanent breaks on payroll taxes. He\u2019ll also exempt the corporate sector from some of France\u2019s famously considerable social levies.\n\nMacron\u2019s a fresh face in a field of old-timers and, asserting that France\u2019s middle class has been neglected, promises to make reviving it his priority. But Macron\u2019s not superman. Last week he issued a \u201cmanifesto,\u201d and it exposes potential vulnerabilities. His tax cuts are unconvincing, some analysts say, because they\u2019re effectively tied to a European Union pledge to keep the budget deficit below 3 percent of GDP.\n\nMacron promises to bring France\u2019s jobless rate down from 10 percent to 7 percent\u2014impressive, except that he gives himself five years to get it done. He\u2019s an austerian who cuts himself some slack, but austerity doesn\u2019t play too well among a lot of voters in France (or anywhere else on the Continent).

But economists at the Brookings Institution reported Thursday they anticipate the CBO estimates will project the loss of coverage for 15 million people over the coming decade under the Republican plan.\n\nRelated: 3 Big Winners in the GOP Health Care Plan \u2013 and 3 Big Losers\n\nThe GOP plan would wipe out most of the Obamacare mandates and taxes and replace them with tax credits, expanded use of tax-exempt health savings accounts, funding targeted to assist older and sicker people obtain coverage and significant changes in the Medicaid program for the poor.\n\nBrookings and its partner, The Leonard D. Schaeffer Initiative for Innovation in Health Policy, based their expectations on previous CBO estimates of earlier GOP. While acknowledging that there is significant uncertainty about how CBO will go about modeling every aspect of the GOP plan and determining how the different pieces would interact with one another, Brookings said CBO\u2019s estimates could be even higher than 15 million by the end of the 10-year \u201cscoring window,\u201d but that it is unlikely they will be significantly lower.\n\nPerhaps anticipating a damaging CBO report, the Trump administration and congressional Republicans have already cast aspersions on the budget scorekeeper\u2019s past work and the importance of the report expected on Monday. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking to the C.B.O. for accuracy, you\u2019re looking in the wrong place,\u201d White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said on Wednesday.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Won\u2019t Be Cheap, GOP Plan Could Cost $700 Billion\n\nYet the Brookings analysis and guesstimate pinpoint several factors that would contribute to a dramatic drop in coverage. The two biggest are the proposed repeal of the Obamacare mandate requiring uninsured Americans to purchase coverage and a plan to freeze and then phase out expanded Medicaid coverage for the poor in three years.\n\nThe Brookings report said that without the so called individual mandate, many Americans \u2014 especially young and healthy people whose participation is vital to the financial success of insurance plans \u2014 would drop their insurance coverage. That, in turn, would drive up premiums and spark further coverage losses.\n\nCBO previously estimated that individual market premiums would rise by 20 percent under the GOP approach and that six million people would lose individual market coverage by 2026 as a result. Beyond that, elimination of the individual mandate will reduce by two million the number of people with insurance obtained through their employers. Finally, GOP plans for scaling back Medicaid coverage would reduce by seven million the number of ensured Americans \u2014 for a grand total of 15 million.\n\nThe residual effects of the Republicans\u2019 proposal for gradually overhauling Medicaid and converting it into a per capita payment to the states likely would lead to millions of more poor people losing their coverage because of changes in state eligibility requirements and sharp restrictions on funding.\n\nWith so much at stake politically for Trump and the Republicans seeking to fulfill a key campaign vow to repeal and replace Obamacare, Ryan and his troops appear willing to try to ram their bill through the House in the coming weeks. Yet the plan they unveiled on Monday after weeks of secret negotiations has run into a tsunami of opposition from the health care industry, Republican governors, outside conservative groups and a potent mix of conservative and moderate lawmakers in the House and Senate.\n\nTrump has given the plan a strong endorsement and has signaled a willingness to barnstorm across the country to rally support and bend the will of recalcitrant lawmakers. Yet the president has also suggested that he is open to \u201cnegotiations,\u201d according to Politico. And in the process he has been sending mixed signals to different factions that are greatly complicating the job of Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) in trying to consolidate the party around the bill.\n\nRelated: Conservatives Don\u2019t Like What They See in the Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee advanced a portion of the GOP American Health Care Act Thursday on a strict party-line vote, over the strong objections of the Democrats. Earlier in the day, the Ways and Means Committee completed its work on the tax-related portions of the repeal and replacement plan.\n\nNow the action shifts to the House Budget Committee where the pieces will be cobbled together and fine-tuned before Ryan, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and the House GOP whip organization attempt to pass it on the floor within the next few weeks.\n\nDemocrats insist that the Republican leadership and Trump are on a fool\u2019s mission in promoting a replacement plan that will never pass the Senate, where the GOP holds a narrow 52-48 margin, even if they manage to get it through the House.\n\nIf the CBO report is in line with the Brookings projections, public anxiety levels are sure to rise and Ryan and others will have to explain why they felt compelled to ram their plan through committee late this week before even seeing CBO\u2019s projections.\n\n\u201cI would think that people would want to know if their constituents would lose their insurance before they vote for this bill today,\u201d said Rep.

Bernie Sanders endorsed measures to rein in drug costs, including importing cheaper drugs and empowering Medicare officials to drive a harder bargain with drug companies.\n\nMedicaid drug prices are set by law at the lower end of a discounted price or the lowest price anyone can negotiate. Veterans Affairs also negotiates prices, receives mandatory rebates, and maintains a national drug formulary that encourages drug companies to compete more aggressively.\n\nYet presidents dating back to Bill Clinton and George W. Bush struggled to enlist support in Congress to grant Medicare the same bargaining power that other federal health care programs and departments enjoy. And it\u2019s no wonder since the drug industry donated $244 million to Congress in 2016 and had the dubious distinction of being the number one lobby industry in America.\n\nBefore the government could even begin to negotiate drug prices under Medicare Part D, government policy makers would first have to define precisely what negotiations would entail, according to an analysis by Health Affairs.\n\nRelated: Trump Might Adopt a Democratic Plan to Crack Down on Drug Prices\n\nThat would mean determining precisely which of the many drugs would be subject to negotiation and deciding whether they should include brand drugs that have competing generic versions. HHS would also have to create a metric for year-over-year drug price comparisons. And finally, it would have to create a formulary or detailed list of drugs covered by Medicare that sets a ceiling for drug prices.\n\nFormularies essentially are designed to give certain drugs \u201cpreferred status\u201d over other comparable drugs. Such a listing would be a potent tool for HHS in extracting price reductions because it would force major drug manufacturers to offer price concessions or risk losing out on an important share of the Medicare market.\n\nDrug manufacturers and their well-paid lobbyists argued that Medicare was still able to obtain deep discounts and rebates from drug manufacturers for seniors, while middle-man drug distributors such as CVS Health and SilverScript extracted additional price reductions from drug companies.\n\nThe legislative ban on government price bargaining, even as prescription drug costs steadily climbed over the years, was justified by the industry and other supporters on free market grounds. Also, strengthening Medicare\u2019s bargaining hand would constitute a dangerous move towards government price controls, they argued, while drug companies would lose billions of dollars in revenues that could have gone for research and innovation.\n\nRelated: How Big Pharma Lobbyists Keep Medicare Drug Prices High\n\n\u201cRepublicans say they want limited government and they don\u2019t like price controls,\u201d Cannon said. \u201cSo they\u2019ve found it easier to burnish their limited government bona fides and appeal to that element of their base by opposing big government attempts to ration care for seniors by imposing price controls on prescription drugs.\u201d\n\nBut Trump and an array of Democratic and Republican lawmakers aren\u2019t buying that line and insist that much can be done to strengthen the government\u2019s hand in containing drug prices for the 40 million or so seniors enrolled in Medicare Part D.\n\n\u201cIt simply makes no sense for Medicare to buy wholesale and pay retail prices,\u201d Welch, the Vermont Democrat, said in a statement. \u201cAs a businessman, President Trump understands that. I hope he helps us enact our legislation to provide urgently needed relief to consumers and taxpayers.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/03/09", "title": "America's Civil Engineers Give US Infrastructure a D+", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/09/Americas-Civil-Engineers-Give-US-Infrastructure-D", "text": "America's infrastructure is close to failing.\n\nThat's the assessment of the American Society of Civil Engineers, which released its 2017 \"infrastructure report card\" Thursday, giving the nation's overall infrastructure a grade of D+.\n\nRelated: Tax-Free Bonds Get a Second Look as Trump Eyes Infrastructure Plans\n\nThe report came a day after President Donald Trump held a high-profile meeting with a group of executives to discuss his campaign pledge to invest a trillion dollars to upgrade the nation's critical infrastructure, such as highways, bridges, airports and dams.\n\nDetails of any spending plan have yet to be released, and it remains to be seen how the Trump administration will pay for the proposed spending.\n\nHis spending target, moreover, represents less than a quarter of what's needed to bring the condition of U.S. infrastructure up to a level that would earn it a B grade, according to ASCE estimates.\n\nTo reach a comprehensive grade, the association said it evaluated 16 categories of infrastructure, ranging from rail to schools to airports to dams. Its committee consists of civil engineers from across the country who assessed categories such as capacity, condition, funding and public safety, to assign grades across the 16 segments.\n\nSince 1998, grades have been near failing and averaging only Ds, due to \"delayed maintenance\" and \"under investment across most categories,\" the engineers said.\n\nIn addition to assigning grades to America's ports and parks, the 2017 report card projected a total investment of $4.59 trillion that would be required to bring U.S. infrastructure from where it stands today \u2014 at a D+ \u2014 to a B grade.\n\nRelated: U.S. infrastructure legislation back on Congress' radar\n\n\"We need our elected leaders ... to follow through on those promises with investment and innovative solutions that will ensure our infrastructure is built for the future,\" ASCE President Norma Jean Mattei said in a statement.\n\nTo close what the association has calculated to be a $2 trillion, 10-year infrastructure investment gap, the nation needs to up investments from all levels of government and the private sector from 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product by 2025, the report said.\n\n\"Infrastructure owners and operators must charge, and Americans must be willing to pay, rates and fees that reflect the true cost of using, maintaining, and improving infrastructure,\" the group said.\n\nAwaiting Trump's infrastructure plan\n\nWith a Trump administration in the White House now, advocacy groups are keeping a close watch on the Republicans' agenda to see how they move forward on infrastructure spending.\n\n\"While Congress and states have made some effort to improve infrastructure, it's not enough,\" Greg DiLoreto, a past ASCE president, said in a statement. DiLoreto said a bill is \"overdue\" and is costing each American roughly $3,400 per year in disposal income.\n\nIn his first speech to a joint session of Congress, Trump last week proposed $1 trillion in infrastructure investment, \"financed through both public and private capital.\"\n\nThat investment, he said, would create \"millions of new jobs.\"\n\nRelated: Rural State Republicans Challenge Trump\u2019s Infrastructure Spending Plan\n\nThough infrastructure investment was a major theme of his campaign, the issue has largely taken the back seat to Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and pass tax reform.\n\nOn Wednesday, though, Trump made strides toward announcing a more formal infrastructure plan, meeting with leading members of the private sector, such as SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk and Vornado Realty Trust Chief Executive Steve Roth, asking for their perspectives.\n\nDespite Trump's vocal support for ambitious investment, the White House has yet to release substantive details.\n\nTrump has also suggested that private investors play a role in rebuilding infrastructure. But critics of that approach say the number of potentially profitable projects is limited.\n\n\"[Private investment] would not deliver many of the most important needed projects for roads and bridges, public transit, schools and public housing,\" the Center on Budget Policies and Priorities wrote in a report. \"Rather than public investment \u2026 the Trump plan relies entirely on private projects through which investors would own the projects, get huge federal tax credits equal to a stunning 82 percent of their equity investment, and make profits from the tolls or fees they would charge to consumers.\"\n\nRelated: The States With the Worst Highways in America\n\nThe group said Trump's \"plan\" has no way of ensuring that infrastructure projects flow to communities that are currently underserved by investments, and the administration's ideas of funding are based on many \"unrealistic assumptions.\"\n\n\"There's a broad recognition that we need to significantly increase infrastructure investment on a range of things,\" said Michael Leachman, the center's director of state fiscal research. \"But how do you most effectively do that? There's some misguided worry about the debt required to fund big infrastructure projects,\" he said.\n\nFederal vs. state\n\nStates are also stepping up to fund the overhaul of infrastructure, much of which they own, even as many struggle to balance their budgets.\n\n\"The Federal government has an important role to play, but the vast majority of infrastructure is owned by states and localities,\" Leachman said.\n\nThat state burden has been amplified by a maintenance backlog that can pose a threat to public safety, as was recently highlighted by last month's emergency spill along the Oroville Dam in California.\n\nThe event was a wake-up call for many, the first event of this kind in more than half a century. An emergency order forced nearly 190,000 residents to evacuuate their homes.\n\nThe average age of the nation's more than 90,000 dams is 56, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers, with over 15,000 classified as \"high hazard\" in 2016.\n\n\"The number of dams identified as unsafe is increasing at a faster rate than those being repaired,\" the group said in a statement. About 14 percent of dams are owned or regulated by federal agencies, leaving the rest to states and municipalities, according to the group's data.\n\nWhether federal or state owned, dams in particular are getting less attention in the media than \"high profile\" bridges or airports, said Tim McCarty, risk control manager at Trident Public Risk Solutions.\n\nThe news from the ACSE report card wasn't all bad.\n\nRail infrastructure received the highest rating \u2014 a B \u2014 this year. Bridges, ports and solid waste all received C+ grades, implying more effort has been made in these segments.\n\nThis article originally appeared on CNBC.

Ways and Means chairman Kevin Brady (R-TX) announced after 4 a.m. on Thursday that his committee had finally wrapped up its work.\n\nRelated: Trump Uses His \u2018Discredit Tactic\u2019 on CBO to Hedge Against Negative Report\n\n\u201cWays and Means Republicans just passed legislation that will help Americans finally have access to affordable health care,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe voted repeatedly to end Obamacare\u2019s crushing taxes and mandates and ensure patients have more power over their own health care.\u201d\n\nThe Energy and Commerce Committee, which convened at 10:30 Wednesday morning to consider the bill, passed the legislation after 27 hours of deliberation.\n\nBut the work seemed to many to be almost certainly in vain. Within the House itself, the bill is facing united opposition from Democrats, who say it will deprive millions of people of access to affordable health care. That wouldn\u2019t normally be a problem, given that the Republicans have a majority in the House.\n\nHowever, many of the most conservative Republicans in the body have come out against it as well, insisting that a system of tax credits that the bill would use to replace the ACA\u2019s complicated set of subsidies, amounts to a new entitlement program.\n\nRelated: 3 Big Winners in the GOP Health Care Plan \u2013 and 3 Big Losers\n\nOthers are incensed at House leadership for rushing to pass the bill before the Congressional Budget Office has the time to provide an official budget score, which would details both the costs of the new plan and an estimate of the impact it would have on the number of Americans who have health insurance.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House took the extraordinary step of preemptively attacking the credibility of the CBO, which is widely respected in Washington for delivering non-partisan analysis of legislation. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking at the CBO for accuracy, you\u2019re looking in the wrong place,\u201d White House Press Secretary Spicer said during a briefing.\n\nAnd if the AHCA\u2019s chances in the House look iffy, it looks doomed in the Senate. The bill would be packaged as part of a budget reconciliation package, and therefore would not be subject to the filibuster and could be passed with a bare majority. But the GOP has only a 52-48 majority in the chamber, meaning that if they lost two votes they would need Vice President Mike Pence to break a tie (as both Al Gore did in a 1993 budget reconciliation bill and Dick Cheney did in 2003.) If they were to lose three senators, the bill would die in the Senate.\n\nThe problem is that so far more than half a dozen Republicans have expressed opposition to the bill. Four were concerned about the expectation that it would throw millions of people off of Medicaid rolls, which were greatly expanded under the ACA. Others, like Utah Sen. Mike Lee and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, said the bill, which retains some features of Obamacare, did not live up to conservatives\u2019 promises to replace the law.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Won\u2019t Be Cheap: GOP Plan Could Cost $700 Billion\n\nOn Thursday morning, Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton took his colleagues in the House to task on Twitter, blasting them for ramming through a piece of legislation in the same way that Republicans criticized Democrats for passing the ACA in 2010.\n\n\u201cHouse health-care bill can't pass Senate w/o major changes,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTo my friends in House: pause, start over. Get it right, don't get it fast. GOP shouldn't act like Dems did in O'care. No excuse to release bill Mon night, start voting Wed. With no budget estimate! What matters in long run is better, more affordable healthcare for Americans, NOT House leaders' arbitrary legislative calendar.\u201d\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, has thrown its weight behind the bill. President Trump, after earlier in the week warning Congressional Republicans that they would face an electoral \u201cbloodbath\u201d if they failed to pass the bill, called conservative House leaders into the Oval Office and reportedly berated them for \u201chelping the other side\u201d by calling the bill \u201cObamacare lite.\u201d\n\nDuring the meeting, CNN reported, White House staff expressed openness to moving up the proposed changes to Medicaid to 2018 rather than 2020, as the bill currently would. While that might bring along a few House conservatives, though, it would likely only harden opposition to the bill in the Senate.\n\nHe promised to hold football stadium rallies in states where Democrats are facing tough reelection battles, and reportedly said that his fallback position, should the bill not survive, would be to stop supporting the ACA, let the insurance markets collapse, and try to force the blame on Democrats."}, {"date": "2017/03/09", "title": "Trump Uses His \u2018Discredit Tactic\u2019 on CBO to Hedge Against Negative Report", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/09/Trump-Uses-His-Discredit-Tactic-CBO-Hedge-Against-Negative-Report", "text": "By launching an attack on the credibility of Washington\u2019s premier budget scorekeeper, the Trump administration signaled on Wednesday that it expects to receive a highly negative report next week from the Congressional Budget Office on the cost and likely impact of the House GOP\u2019s plan for replacing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe CBO is considered the gold standard for non-partisan budget analysis and economic forecasting in the complex and politically charged world of budget politics. It\u2019s track record over the years for forecasting government spending, assessing the likely impact of major programs and budget deals, and predicting the deficit has been solid, if far from perfect.\n\nRelated: 3 Big Winners in the GOP Health Care Plan \u2013 and 3 Big Losers\n\n\u201cCBO has I think done a very credible job, but the job itself is very difficult, and often the outcome and the forecasts are very different,\u201d said Doug Holtz-Eakin, a former CBO director between 2003 and 2005 and a Republican policy adviser. \u201cYes, it is easy to predict the future.

White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, a former Tea Party conservative House member who is pushing for passage of the bill, will oversee the findings. Earlier in the day, Mulvaney told MSNBC that he wasn't worried about what the CBO report would show and that \"the only question about CBO: Is it going to be really good, or is it going to be great when the numbers finally come out.\"\n\nRelated: Conservatives Don\u2019t Like What They See in the Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nSpicer\u2019s comments touched off an uproar among economists and budget analysts, who complained that the Trump White House was once again attempting to discredit an important institution that disagreed with him, just as he has done in going after the intelligence community and the judiciary.\n\n\u201cI think this is clearly an attempt to dismiss in advance the likely insurance coverage estimates that CBO is going to produce showing that the large share of those losing coverage due to repeal would likely become uninsured compared to current law under the House plan,\u201d said Edwin Park, a health policy expert with the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nBill Hoagland, the senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former Republican Senate Budget Committee staff director, said he was alarmed that Trump and his aides would attempt to undermine confidence in the CBO and threaten to throw the budget process into disarray.\n\n\u201cThe biggest loser in all of this is a loss of trust in institutions that Trump has created,\u201d Hoagland said in an interview. \u201cThis would be very, very damaging to the congressional budget process to undercut CBO.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Won\u2019t Be Cheap, GOP Plan Could Cost $700 Billion\n\nA Democratic-controlled Congress created the CBO in 1974 as the ultimate arbiter of the impact of spending on the budget and deficit, and the leadership chose Alice Rivlin as the agency\u2019s first director. Hoagland got one of his first jobs in Washington as an aide to Rivlin. Since then, he has served as a staunch defender of the agency under both Democratic and Republican directors.\n\nOver the years, the agency has had many run-ins with the White House and the majority party in Congress over the cost and impact of huge new programs. Those disputes have ranged from the financial implications of President George W. Bush\u2019s Medicare prescription-drug program to the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to the Clinton administration\u2019s failed national health care initiative to the passage of the Affordable Care Act during the first term of the Obama administration.\n\nOne storied conflict pitted then- CBO director Robert D. Reischauer, a prominent Democrat, against Clinton and his wife, Hillary over cost estimates of their proposed government-sponsored health care plan in 1994. Reischauer\u2019s analysts added billions of dollars to the estimated long-term cost of the proposed program \u2013 a finding that opponents seized upon to help block passage.\n\nThis time it\u2019s CBO director Keith Hall, a conservative who was handpicked for the job by the House and Senate Republican leaders, who is coming under fire from a Republican president who worries that he may provide opponents with more ammunition to block the GOP health plan. Hall, a former commissioner of the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics, succeeded Democrat Douglas Elmendorf as CBO director in April 2015.\n\nRelated: Fiscal Cost of House GOP Obamacare Replacement Remains a Mystery\n\nDeborah Kilroe, a spokesman for Hall, declined to respond to Spicer\u2019s attack.\n\nSpicer didn\u2019t say precisely which forecasts he had in mind in going after the CBO, although no one questions that the agency\u2019s initial estimates of Obamacare\u2019s long-term cost and enrollment figures were off.\n\nCBO\u2019s original analysis of the 2010 Affordable Care Act provided long-term projections of enrollment that proved to be overly optimistic, although subsequent events including the 2015 Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of the law resulted in fewer states enrolling people in an expanded Medicaid program than originally predicted.\n\nMoreover, CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated when the law was passed in March 2010 that it would cost $214 billion a year by 2019, although today the estimate is down to $148 billion.

It also didn\u2019t take long for Donald Trump to throw his considerable political weight behind it as an answer to his promise to protect Americans through the process. It might take a long time to sort out whether the American Health Care Act (AHCA) actually fulfills either of those promises, or whether conservatives have enough patience and trust to see whether the AHCA is just the start of a longer process to fully uproot the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nSo far, the reviews of the AHCA on the Right have been somewhat short of enthusiastic. In fact, four influential conservative and libertarian groups announced their opposition to the AHCA: the Heritage Foundation, Americans for Prosperity, FreedomWorks, and the Club For Growth all recommend that House Republicans vote no on AHCA and force leadership to start over.\n\nRelated: 3 Big Winners in the GOP Health Care Plan \u2013 and 3 Big Losers\n\n\u201cRather than accept the flawed premises of Obamacare,\u201d Heritage announced, \u201ccongressional Republicans should fully repeal the failed law and begin a genuine effort to deliver on longstanding campaign promises that create a free market health care system that empowers patients and doctors.\u201d\n\nThe bill didn\u2019t get a much more favorable assessment from the Republican Study Committee (RSC), an influential policy group within the House Republican caucus. In a memo distributed on Monday after the plan was released, the committee included tax credits among its \u201cmajor concerns,\u201d concluding that the AHCA \u201cis, in principle, Obamacare\u201d for its tax-credit subsidies for purchasing health insurance. The replacement for the ACA still \u201cis fundamentally grounded on the idea that the federal government should fund insurance purchases.\u201d Furthermore, the tax credits threaten to add up to dramatic costs, making the AHCA \u201ca Republican plan that deficit spends at the same rate as the current plan.\u201d\n\nThe decision to keep the controversial Medicaid expansion in place drew even more ire from the RSC, criticism that was echoed among House conservatives. The bill plans to keep the Obamacare expansion with its 90 percent federal share of payment in place for three years, and then to phase it out over the next five years at the normal 57 percent reimbursement from Washington.\n\nThat assumes that a future Congress would have the political will to maintain that phase-out, which the RSC called \u201cdoubtful\u201d for the same reasons that Republican leadership avoided phasing it out immediately. \u201cThe major cause for the delay is to avoid the political consequences and pain of unwinding expansion, especially in Republican-held states with upcoming gubernatorial contests,\u201d their analysis accuses, adding that \u201cit is unlikely that any future Congress will have a stronger political will in terms of reforming Obamacare than the sitting Congress[.]\u201d\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Won\u2019t Be Cheap: GOP Plan Could Cost $700 Billion\n\nIn so many words, the RSC accused Republicans and the Trump White House of surrendering on Obamacare repeal. But have they surrendered, or merely taken the first steps through a labyrinth of obstacles?\n\nOne challenge facing Republican leadership is the reconciliation process in the Senate. Harry Reid famously used that budgetary exception to pass Obamacare on a majority vote, eliminating the use of the filibuster. However, only legislation with a specific impact on the federal budget can cite reconciliation to avoid the filibuster. That limits what the repeal bill can do and still be passed on a majority vote. The AHCA necessarily only addresses those portions which qualify under Senate rules.\n\nThe next complicating factor is Donald Trump\u2019s promise to ensure that Americans don\u2019t get abandoned in the process. That\u2019s almost certainly why the AHCA does not eliminate the Medicaid expansion immediately, as House conservatives had hoped, and why this plan continues the practice of subsidies for health-insurance purchases. The need to extend both of those for the next few years stems from the difficulty of getting a full replacement program through the Senate; Republicans clearly hope to have a filibuster-proof majority after the 2018 midterms, but need to leave some measures in place before then.\n\nRelated: A Test for the Dealmaker: Selling the Controversial GOP Health Care Plan\n\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily make the AHCA the best bill that can pass under these circumstances, but it does explain why Republican leadership may have refrained from producing a final, full-scale repeal-and-replace bill in favor of a transition plan. And the White House has responded to criticism of the plan by offering to negotiate amendments through the legislative process. Tom Price, former chair of the RSC and now Secretary of Health and Human Services, made that explicit on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThis is a work in progress,\u201d Price told The New York Times\u2019 Glenn Thrush, adding that they plan to work through the \u201clegislative process.\u201d Likewise, Trump later tweeted that the bill was \u201cout for review and negotiation,\u201d even while warning Republicans on Capitol Hill in a private meeting that the GOP will face an electoral \u201cbloodbath\u201d if they don\u2019t take some action to roll back Obamacare soon.\n\nSo far, Trump\u2019s sales pitch has not produced too much success, but it\u2019s still early in the process. To get conservatives and moderates on board, Trump and the rest of the Republican leadership will need to commit to a free-market end solution when they have more political weight to replace the rest of the ACA while pointing to these efforts as just a transitional effort that protects voters in the meantime. If this really does represent the end game of the Obamacare repeal and replace effort, though, then not even Trump\u2019s Art of the Deal prowess can salvage this sale."}, {"date": "2017/03/08", "title": "3 Big Winners in the GOP Health Care Plan \u2013 and 3 Big Losers", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/08/3-Big-Winners-GOP-Health-Care-Plan-and-3-Big-Losers", "text": "President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) are promoting the Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act in the face of mounting opposition.\n\nThe plan -- which scraps most of the mandates and tax subsidies in the 2010 Affordable Care Act and replaces them with a new system of tax credits based on age and income -- has drawn sharp fire from conservatives who have dismissed it as \u201cObamacare lite\u201d and from Democrats who warn that it would result in millions of Americans losing their health insurance.\n\nRelated: Conservatives Don\u2019t Like What They See in the Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nThe fate of the plan is highly uncertain at this point.

And an alliance of arch-conservative and moderate Republicans in the Senate could torpedo the legislation if it makes it that far.\n\nIf the Republicans succeed in repealing and replacing a major federal health care program -- for the first time in history -- there will be numerous winners and losers in their wake. Paul B. Ginsburg, director of the Center for Health Policy at the Brookings Institution, said that generally speaking, wealthier, healthier and younger people would do well under the House GOP plan, while older, poorer and sicker people would be worse off.\n\n\u201cI think the people that lose the most are low income people in general, but particularly those who are older but under 65\u201d and not eligible for Medicare, he said in an interview. \u201cAnd I think that health care providers will have significant losses that line up with the losses of coverage by the low income people.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Won\u2019t Be Cheap, GOP Plan Could Cost $700 Billion\n\nHere are the likely winners and losers in the Republican\u2019s current health care plan:\n\n1. Winners: Upper-middle income Americans.\n\nMillions of people who made too much money to qualify for tax credit subsidies under Obamacare would qualify under the GOP plan, which is based more on age than income. Tax credits under the GOP plan would start at $2,000 a year for a person under the age of 30 and rise to a maximum of $4,000 for a person 60 or older. The benefit begins to phase out for individuals with incomes over $75,000 and married couples with incomes over $150,000.\n\nMore importantly, middle and upper income Americans would enjoy major tax relief because the Republicans intend to repeal Obamacare taxes that raised the rate on the federal payroll tax and on capital gains.\n\n2. Winners: Young adults.\n\nThe GOP plan would be a boon for the nation\u2019s Millennials, who no longer would be subject to the mandate that they purchase health insurance or pay a penalty. They would be free to either purchase cheaper insurance policies offering less coverage or buy nothing at all until they need it.\n\nThe individual mandate was necessary under Obamacare to bring younger, healthier people into the insurance pool to help offset the cost of older, sicker people. And insurance companies had no choice but to charge younger people rates fairly close to what they were charging older people.\n\nBut with the GOP plan, insurers could boost their premiums on older Americans to as much as five times what they charge younger people \u2013 a move that could have the effect of bringing down Millennials\u2019 premiums and copayments.\n\n3. Winners: States that shunned expanded Medicaid coverage.\n\nA 2015 Supreme Court ruling allowed states to decide whether to take advantage of expanded Medicaid for the poor under Obamacare, and many red states rejected the offer to signal their opposition to the Affordable Care Act. But lawmakers from those states have long complained of the inequity of the federal government picking up 90 percent of the cost of the additional coverage in the states that accepted the plan while the other states received nothing.\n\nRelated: Fiscal Cost of House GOP Obamacare Replacement Remains a Mystery\n\nFor those 19 states that did not expand Medicaid, the new House GOP bill would provide $10 billion spread over five years. States could use that money to subsidize hospitals and other providers that treat poor patients.\n\n1. Losers: The insurance industry.\n\nInsurers would celebrate the repeal of some of the Obamacare taxes that have added to their operating costs. That includes a two to three percent tax on health care premiums. But they would continue to be saddled with mandates and rules that have constrained their profitability.\n\nThose mandates include a requirement that they insure people with pre-existing conditions; a ban on one-year or lifetime limits on benefits; a requirement that their plans cover 10 essential categories of benefits; and a cap on how much customers can be asked to pay for coverage through deductibles and co-payments. Moreover, with fewer people able to purchase health insurance with diminished tax credit supports under the GOP plan, the individual health care market will become more unstable, likely resulting in more major insurers pulling out of the market.\n\n2. Losers: Low income Americans.\n\nThe existing law is designed to help low income people the most, by limiting the availability of tax credit subsidies to people with income levels between 138 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty levels. That means that only Americans with annual incomes of between $12,070 and $48,284 a year currently qualify for Obamacare tax subsidies. And their premiums for more modest health insurance policies and out of pocket costs are capped at roughly 10 percent of their annual income, to make the coverage affordable.\n\nRelated: GOP Obamacare Replacement Plan Has Major Gaps in Cost and Coverage\n\nAll of that would change under the House GOP law, because the tax credits would no longer be tied to income but to a person\u2019s age, with the tax credits highest for older Americans, even those with substantial incomes.\n\nThe proposed legislation would effectively slash subsidies that currently help many low-income people buy health insurance. And it would not take into account that health insurance costs vary by region of the country. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation calculation, a typical 60-year-old person in Nebraska who currently qualifies for a $18,470 subsidy to help purchase insurance coverage, with additional subsidies to cover out of pocket costs, would receive a subsidy of only $4,000, with no additional assistance, under the GOP plan.\n\n3. Losers: Medicaid beneficiaries.\n\nCurrently, 31 states and the District of Columbia have signed up for an expanded Medicaid program under Obamacare in which the federal government pays about 90 percent of the bill for health care coverage to roughly 10 million low income adults who previously didn\u2019t qualify for the program. Ryan and other conservatives have long attempted to rescind the program and cut back on Medicaid spending more generally, in the face of resistance from some Republican as well as Democratic governors.\n\nThe GOP replacement plan would eliminate Medicaid expansion by 2020. States could continue to provide coverage if they choose, but they would receive far less federal assistance to do so. Moreover, Congress would also convert traditional Medicaid into fixed per capita payment to the states. Those steps taken together would almost certainly slash enrollments in Medicaid, which currently total about 70 million, and reduce the benefit level over time.\n\nEdwin Park, vice president for health policy at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, recently issued an updated analysis of the plan\u2019s proposed changes to the Medicaid program and determined that the American Health Care Act would cost states $370 billion in federal aid over ten years."}, {"date": "2017/03/08", "title": "You Get What You Pay For: Banks Spent Billions on Lobbying During the Election", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/08/You-Get-What-You-Pay-Banks-Spent-Billions-Lobbying-During-Election", "text": "Banks and other financial companies expecting big benefits from Republican-led deregulation spent record amounts on lobbying in the last election cycle, according to an advocacy group report released on Wednesday.\n\nThe financial sector spent $2.8 billion on political activity from the beginning of 2015 to the end of 2016, including $1.2 billion in campaign contributions \u2013 more than twice the amount given by any other business sector, according to the study from Americans for Financial Reform.\n\nRelated: Putting Wall Street First: GOP Attacks Plan to Help Millions Save for Retirement\n\nThat works out to $3.7 million per member of Congress and is the most ever tracked by the group, which analyzed spending data going back to 1990.\n\nFurthermore, the actual amount is probably higher, because it did not include so-called \"dark money\": funds donated to political advocacy by nonprofit groups.\n\nWells Fargo & Co , Citigroup Inc , Prudential Financial Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc all spent more than $10 million each, the report said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Goldman Sachs released an investment analysis saying that large money center banks stood to profit significantly from the kind of financial deregulation expected from Republican President Donald Trump's administration and a Republican Congress.\n\nRelated: The One Way Trump\u2019s Administration Really Is a Fine-Tuned Machine\n\nAs much as $218 billion in excess capital could be returned to shareholders or reinvested in the banks themselves if all the deregulation the industry is seeking comes about.\n\nAmong senators not running for president, Democrat Charles Schumer, now the minority leader, received the largest amount, with $5.3 million coming from financial firms.

But few are quite as enthusiastic as the private prison industry.\n\nTwo of the biggest players in the business, GEO Group and CoreCivic \u2014 the latter formerly known as Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) \u2014 saw their stock jump right after Trump's election. As of late February, GEO's stock was up 98 percent and CoreCivic's was up 137 percent. The industry is even opening at least two new for-profit centers in Georgia and Texas.\n\nRelated: To Build His Wall, Trump Would Cut FEMA, Airline and Waterway Security\n\nThe reasons for the champagne popping are pretty straightforward.\n\nAcross the country, over 2.2 million people are held in federal, state, and local prison facilities. Six percent of state prisoners and 16 percent of federal prisoners are held in private prisons run by companies like GEO and CoreCivic. The federal government's share of the private prison population amounts to 21,000 inmates, spread across 12 contracts. And back in August of 2016, President Obama's Justice Department sent out a memorandum instructing its officials not to renew any of those contracts.\n\nGiven that the state and local prison population is far larger, this certainly wasn't a death blow to the industry. But it hurt their bottom line.\n\nThen in late February, the Trump administration scrapped that decision. Trump's recently-installed attorney general, Jeff Sessions, sent the Bureau of Prisons his own memo stating the Obama-era order \"impaired the bureau\u2019s ability to meet the future needs of the federal correctional system.\"\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s What Trump\u2019s \u2018Merit-Based\u2019 Immigration System Would Look Like\n\n\"Therefore, I direct the bureau to return to its previous approach,\" he concluded.\n\nThe Trump administration may want to slash the budgets of the State Department and the EPA, but it also wants to ramp up spending on things like the military and law and order. So the private prison industry is breathing a sigh of relief that the federal money hose will stay on.\n\nThe thing is, the profit motive introduces all sorts of perverse incentives into the job of running prisons: The less a company spends per inmate on things like health care, guards, upkeep, etc., the more it can pocket as profit from the contract fees the government pays the industry. As a result, private prisons are generally more dangerous than public ones, and the industry abounds with accusations of wrongful deaths and mistreatment of prisoners. The industry even uses its inmate population as a source of ultra-cheap labor from which it can further profit.\n\nThis is precisely why Obama's Justice Department made the decision it did. A review it conducted last year concluded that private prisons \"simply do not provide the same level of correctional services, programs, and resources\" and \"do not maintain the same level of safety and security\" as the federal government's own facilities.\n\nThis isn't all.\n\nRelated: The Hidden Effect of Trump\u2019s New Immigration Orders\n\nThe federal government relies on the private prison industry to detain immigrants as well. For all the talk from Republicans about how Democrats are too nice to undocumented immigrants, the Obama administration actually oversaw a record-breaking 2.5 million deportations from 2009 to 2015. By November 2016, the number of immigrants held in some sort of detention facility rose was an eye-popping 41,000. And fully 65 percent of those held by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) were in private prisons.\n\nThese facilities raise the same humanitarian concerns. In 2014, for example, GEO Group was sued by nine former immigrant detainees, alleging they were forced to work for $1 a day. Just last week, that suit was granted class-action status, meaning as many as 60,000 immigrants could now be represented by it.\n\nThe private prisons used by ICE fall under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and thus weren't subject to the memo from Obama's Justice Department. But DHS ran its own inquiry into its use of private prisons and came to a fatalistic conclusion: Between fiscal constraints and the number of people moving through the system, immigration enforcement would have to keep relying on private prisons.\n\nNow, the memos and executive orders from the Trump administration suggest it wants to double ICE's detention capacity to 80,000 per day, in keeping with its renewed crackdown. As DHS's previous investigation suggests, much of that capacity will have to come from expanding private contracts. \"Historically, ICE has relied heavily on the private prison industry every time the detention system has expanded,\" Carl Takei, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union's National Prison Project, told Mother Jones.\n\nWhat makes this business arrangement especially perverse is that the private prison industry has a profit incentive to encourage the federal government to take a particular approach to law and immigration enforcement. The more brutal and draconian the federal government is about detaining undocumented immigrants, the larger the prison population becomes and the more prison companies profit. The same is true for the harshness of our sentencing laws, the scale of the drug war, and other policies. Conversely, CoreCivic observed in a 2005 report that when the government is more lenient and more willing to decriminalize activities \"demand for our facilities and services could be adversely affected.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, GEO and CoreCivic are both enthusiastic donors to the GOP. And now the Trump White House is resuscitating federal contracts with private prisons, aiming to massively ramp up immigration detentions, and even taking an unfriendly stance towards marijuana decriminalization.\n\n\"When coupled with the above average rate of crossings along the southwest border, these executive orders appear likely to significantly increase the need for safe, humane, and appropriate detention bed capacity that we have available,\" Damon Hininger, the president and CEO of CoreCivic, recently said.\n\nOf course, the \"safe, humane and appropriate\" part is subject to interpretation.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Week.

The existing program is an entitlement and per-state spending is not capped.\n\nThe proposal would also effectively eliminate the Medicaid expansion under which the ACA allowed certain eligible working-age adults access to the program. The federal government previously bore 90 percent of the costs of that expansion.\n\nHowever, according to Park, \u201cStarting in 2020, states would receive only the regular federal Medicaid matching rate \u2014 on average, 57 percent of Medicaid costs, with states covering the other 43 percent \u2014 for any new enrollees under the expansion instead of the ACA\u2019s matching rate of 90 percent. This means that expansion states would have to pay 2.8 to 5 times more in terms of their own costs.\u201d\n\nRelated: House GOP Obamacare Replacement Plan Has Major Gaps in Cost and Coverage\n\nPeople who were on the plan as of the end of 2019 would be allowed to remain, with the ACA\u2019s original matching rate still applying, but new recipients would not. But because most people on Medicaid tend to fall off the rolls within a few years, the end result would be an ever-dwindling share of recipients were still eligible for the 90 percent match.\n\nStates would still technically be allowed to offer expanded coverage, but Park notes that \u201cwithin just a few years, the overwhelming share of Medicaid expansion spending would eventually be subject to the regular matching rate. To maintain the expansion as it\u2019s now operating in the expansion states, we estimate that these states would have to increase their share of costs by about $253 billion over ten years.\u201d\n\nThe cap on per-patient spending would also rise more slowly than the cost of care is expected to in coming years, meaning that the block grants to states will, in effect, buy less and les coverage as time goes on.\n\n\u201cIn response,\u201d writes Park, \u201cstates would have to contribute much more of their own funding or, far likelier, substantially cut eligibility, benefits, and provider payments, with those cuts growing more severe each year.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/03/07", "title": "Conservatives Don\u2019t Like What They See in the Obamacare Replacement Plan", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/07/Conservatives-Don-t-What-They-See-Obamacare-Replacement-Plan", "text": "It was always going to be difficult for Republicans to get a plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act through the Senate, where losing as few as two senators would require Vice President Mike Pence to cast a tie-breaking vote, and losing three would doom the measure to failure.

It protects young adults, patients with pre-existing conditions, and provides a stable transition so that no one has the rug pulled out from under them.\u201d\n\nEarly Tuesday morning, President Trump tweeted, \u201cOur wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review and negotiation. Obamacare is a complete and total disaster - is imploding fast!\u201d\n\nHowever, there are numerous questions about the effect the House GOP plan would have on both individuals seeking health coverage on the open market and on the federal budget.\n\nThe popular elements of the ACA \u2014 particularly the ban on denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions and the elimination of benefit caps \u2014 were also very expensive for insurers. The trade-off that made those concessions palatable to insurers was that coverage for all Americans was mandated, assuring an increase in the number of policyholders to offset the increased costs of sicker customers.\n\nBy requiring insurers to continue offering those benefits without the promise of an expanded pool of insurance customers, the bill virtually guarantees some combination of higher prices and fewer benefits for policies offering the same level of coverage as under the ACA.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Replacement: What Republicans Can Learn From Socialized Medicine\n\nAt the same time, the House plan would remove some of the minimum requirements for health plans, allowing insurers to offer bare-bones policies that offer relatively little coverage in exchange for lower premiums.\n\nThe impact of the bill on the federal budget remains something of a mystery. Both the House Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce Committees are expected to take up the legislation as early as Wednesday, before the Congressional Budget Office can estimate the cost of the legislation or its impact on overall levels of health insurance coverage.\n\nBoth are major questions. The bill would repeal several taxes that were used to fund the subsidies in the Affordable Care Act, costing the government billions of dollars in annual revenue.

It would eliminate a requirement that larger companies provide health insurance for their workers.\n\nAnd it would replace Obamacare\u2019s premium subsidies for low and middle-income people with a \u201crefundable\u201d tax credit plan that would help many more Americans buy insurance on the open market. All but wealthier Americans would qualify for set premium supports ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 a year, with the highest support level going to older people who generally have higher premiums and medical costs than younger, healthier people.\n\n\u201cObamacare is a sinking ship, and the legislation introduced today will rescue people from the mistakes of the past,\u201d Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), the House Majority Leader, said in a statement.\n\nThe GOP alternative approach would also embrace ideas that have been aired repeatedly by Ryan, GOP policy analysts and President Trump himself, including tax-exempt health savings accounts, allowing insurers to sell their policies across state lines, and creation of so-called \u201crisk pools\u201d in every state to help provide coverage for hard to insure older and sicker people.\n\nRelated: How 3 GOP Senators Could Stop Obamacare Repeal in Its Tracks\n\nFinally, the plan would preserve two of the most popular features of Obamacare \u2013 the ban on insurance companies discriminating against applicants with pre-existing medical conditions and a provision allowing children to remain on their parents\u2019 health care policies through age 26.\n\nAnd yet for all the Republicans\u2019 complaints about Obamacare\u2019s soaring premiums, shrinking choices of health insurance plans and onerous mandates and rules, they have finally come up with a plan that is highly flawed and woefully incomplete \u2013 and lacking in vital details as to how much it will cost and how many Americans will be able to hang onto their insurance.\n\nThe House Republicans\u2019 \u201cAmerican Health Care Act\u201d creates a new set of winners and losers among consumers, with younger, healthier and wealthier people faring much better than under Obamacare while older, sicker people doing less well.\n\nThis is the result of a combination of factors, including a new tax credit premium subsidy plan that benefits a much broader income group than does Obamacare, as well as changes that would allow insurers to charge more than they can now for health care policies in the individual market and scale back the benefits they must provide.\n\nThe Republican approach would also jettison an Obamacare stricture preventing insurers from charging their oldest enrollees, in their 50s and 60s, any more than three times what they charge their youngest customers. And consumers who have a lengthy break in their health insurance coverage \u2013 either because they lost their jobs or decided to do without coverage for a while -- could be slapped with a steep 30 percent surcharge when they seek to purchase a new policy.\n\nRelated: Boehner \u2018Started Laughing\u2019 When Republicans Vowed to Replace Obamacare\n\n\u201cIn the aggregate, these changes could be advantageous to younger and healthier enrollees who want skimpier (and cheaper) benefit packages,\u201d noted Sarah Kliff of Vox. \u201cBut they could be costly for older and sicker Obamacare enrollees, who rely on the law\u2019s current requirements.\u201d\n\nHouse and Senate Democrats have shown no indication they will support a Republican repeal and replacement effort, and they immediately denounced the House GOP plan as a serious setback in federal health care policy. \u201cTrumpcare doesn\u2019t replace the Affordable Care Act, it forces millions of Americans to pay more for less care,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), said in a statement.\n\nAmong the most glaring problems of the House GOP replacement plan:\n\nThe tax credit had to be scaled back so much to placate conservative critics that it\u2019s not likely to be able to match or even come close to the tax subsidies provided to low and middle-income people under Obamacare.\n\nRelated: A First for Obamacare: Majority of Americans Now Support It\n\nUnlike Obamacare, which provides premium subsidies based on income to low and moderate income people, the House GOP plan would make the tax credit available to individuals earning up to $75,000 a year and couples making up to $150,000. Younger Americans would qualify for tax credits of between $2,000 and $2,500 while older people in their 50s and 60s would qualify for credits of between $3,500 and $4,000.\n\nWhile on the face of it, older Americans would fare best of all, their higher tax credits would be offset by having to pay much higher premiums than before under Obamacare. Moreover, the 9.4 million people currently receiving premium subsidies through Obamacare exchanges get on average $291 per month or a significant portion of the $386 per month average premium for people who obtained coverage through Healthdcare.gov. Critics warn that many people would have a hard time under the GOP subsidy plan finding insurance in the private market that they could afford.\n\nRelated: It\u2019s High Time for Tax Reform, but the Republicans Are Doing It Wrong\n\nMany conservative Republicans and outside groups have opposed refundable tax credits, largely because people with lower incomes, who pay less in income taxes, would receive the full credit even if it exceeds their tax bill. Conservative critics including Sens., Rand Paul (R-KY) and Ted Cruz (R-TX), have dismissed the refundable tax credit as \u201cObamacare Lite\u201d and want it stricken from any final replacement plan.\n\nRepublican leaders have yet to find a way to finance their program because business leaders and conservative groups complained too much about a proposal for raising tens of billions of dollars by imposing a cap on a highly generous tax exemption for employer-sponsored health care policies. In the short term, Republicans will leave in place a handful of Obamacare tax increases that have long been criticized by the GOP. Those include taxes on insurers, hospitals, drug companies and even tanning salons.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no way of telling at this point how much the plan will cost or how many people are likely to lose their coverage. That\u2019s because the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation have yet to complete their analysis of the plan. GOP leaders appear willing to forge ahead with committee action on their plan this week, even without the analysis.\n\nDemocrats are clamoring for evidence that the GOP approach would result in millions of Americans losing their health care coverage in the coming year or two, and want to see the CBO report first. \u201cThe American people deserve to see what Republicans are trying to do to their health care,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Lofty Vision of Renewal Comes with a Huge Price Tag\n\n\n\nThe GOP bill includes what some moderate Republicans consider a \u201cpoison pill\u201d \u2013 a one-year elimination of federal Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood to placate the party\u2019s influential anti-abortion forces. Although federal law prohibits Planned Parenthood from using federal funds and grants for abortion services, abortion foes argue that the federal funding is fungible and might end up indirectly supporting abortions.\n\nFinally, the American Health Care Act would permit the 31 states with expanded Medicaid benefits for childless adults and others to continue that coverage through January 2020 when the program would be frozen and then gradually phased out. This represents a victory for the 15 Republican governors whose states opted for the expanded, federally funded Medicaid who fought to prevent an immediate end to the program.\n\nHowever, some moderate Republicans are not satisfied with the compromise and are vowing to oppose the plan unless they are assured that Medicaid would be spared major cuts or converted into block grants or per capita payments to the states. On Monday, four Republican senators signed a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell saying that an earlier draft of the House GOP plan did not adequately protect people from losing their expanded Medicaid coverage.\n\nThe senators \u2013- Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2013- threatened to oppose the legislation unless that Medicaid coverage was preserved.

Nearly 30 other CRA resolutions have been introduced; more are scheduled for votes this week.\n\nSpecific rules have also been targeted for removal, like the Labor Department directive that investment advisors act in the best interest of their clients, the requirement that automakers average 54 miles per gallon in their vehicle fleets by 2025 and the EPA\u2019s expansion of rivers and streams protected under the Clean Water Act. Trump has suspended a proposal to force disclosure of all airline passenger fees and stopped a reduction in mortgage insurance fees through the Federal Housing Administration. Industry executives and their lobbyists have written up wish lists for which rules they want taken down, and the administration is dutifully following through.\n\nThis mainly pushes the regulatory state back to where it was last year; the lion\u2019s share of Obama-era rules remain on the books. But if the books sit on a shelf, nobody has to care about the contents. The way you really gut regulations is by hiring people who have no interest in enforcing them. Instead of writing a rule to overhaul the H1-B visa program for high-skilled workers, you merely stop processing expedited applications. Instead of rolling back Securities and Exchange Commission rules, you just don\u2019t send SEC investigators to major bond conferences; traders get the implicit message. Simply hiring Scott Pruitt, whose political career has been dedicated to working with industry to undermine the EPA, to oversee that very agency, cripples environmental regulation overnight.\n\nRelated: Big Oil Gets a Win as Trump Ends Transparency Rule\n\nRelatedly, a government-wide hiring freeze and devastating budget cuts at specific agencies provides an excuse to maintain yawning gaps in oversight. Unfilled positions throughout the government have been left vacant seemingly by design, to overburden the regulators into laissez-faire non-compliance. The White House even put moles inside every agency to search for more rules to neutralize. And what about dissident, independent regulators like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, whose budget Congress cannot touch? The administration is building a case to decapitate its leadership.\n\nDeregulation has been so successful because the White House and Republicans in Congress agree on its importance. But what is the actual purpose of all this clear-cutting? More limited government is a conservative end in itself, but ask any Republican and they\u2019ll call deregulation a jobs program. Does that hold up?\n\nNo. Just thinking back to 2008, when a concerted effort to neglect mortgage and securities regulations led to the largest job loss in nearly a century, should disabuse anyone of this notion. Former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan admitted to Congress that year that \u201cvoluntary regulation does not work,\u201d a flaw in his thinking that he somehow only figured out after Wall Street nearly blew up the economy.\n\nConservatives characterize regulations as \u201cjob-killing\u201d through a cock-eyed viewpoint I\u2019d call \u201ccost-cost analysis.\u201d They tally up the financial burdens of complying with federal regulations \u2014 $1.9 trillion in 2016, per the Competitive Enterprise Institute \u2014 while ignoring any of the public benefits to stopping pollution or hazardous workplaces or self-dealing on Wall Street. A 2011 retrospective study of the Clean Air Act found the benefits outweighed the costs by 25-1. But the ability to breathe freely isn\u2019t a part of the deregulators\u2019 calculations.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Opportunity to Slash 179,000 Pages of Federal Regulations\n\nIn reality, virtually every independent study on the subject finds that regulations do not affect the overall level of jobs in the economy. Certain sectors might see a reduction, while others rise. Some jobs become obsolete, while others flourish. Lack of demand has a much larger impact on job loss than regulations ever will. The yoke of regulations has become a convenient excuse for industries destined to fail. For example, Republicans claim regulators have waged a \u201cwar on coal.\u201d However, market forces, like the cost of natural gas and other energy sources dropping well below that of coal, are far more to blame for the industry\u2019s demise.\n\nUndeniably, deregulation saves companies lots of money in compliance and legal costs. But you need only look at one indicator, the stock market, to understand to whom that money ultimately flows. Trump\u2019s election has coincided with a boom in equity prices. And what do stocks measure? Expected future profits, not capital investment or job creation. Soaring stocks, particularly in industries to which the market believes Trump will hand a lifeline, tell you what gets done with all of the savings on compliance. It goes to the executives and the shareholders, not to workers or consumers. The benefits, in short, don\u2019t get passed on; they stay in the C-suites and the stock portfolios.\n\nIn essence, deregulation represents a giant tax cut for corporate America. The idea that it unleashes corporations only so they can share their newfound fortunes borders on the ridiculous. While America chokes, drinks water with more dirt in it, handles unsafe chemicals on the job and allows financiers to reopen their gambling parlors, corporate executives celebrate, not by hiring more employees but by counting their money."}, {"date": "2017/03/06", "title": "House Republicans\u2019 Obamacare Replacement Plan Is Finally Ready for Debate", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/06/House-Republicans-Obamacare-Replacement-Plan-Finally-Ready-Debate", "text": "House Republicans on Monday released long-anticipated legislation to supplant the Affordable Care Act with a more conservative vision for the nation\u2019s health care system, replacing federal insurance subsidies with a new form of individual tax credits and grants to help states shape their own policies.\n\nUnder two bills drafted by separate House committees, the government would no longer penalize Americans for failing to have health insurance but would try to encourage people to maintain coverage by allowing insurers to impose a surcharge of 30 percent for those who have a gap between health plans.\n\nThe legislation would preserve two of the most popular features of the 2010 healthcare law, letting young adults stay on their parents\u2019 health plans until age 26 and forbidding insurers to deny coverage or charge more to people with pre-existing medical problems. It would also target Planned Parenthood, rendering the women\u2019s health organization ineligible for Medicaid reimbursements or federal family planning grants \u2014 a key priority for anti-abortion groups.\n\nThe debate, starting in House committees this week, is a remarkable moment in the annals of government health-care policymaking. The Affordable Care Act, former president Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement passed in 2010 only with Democratic support, ushered in the most significant expansion of insurance coverage since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid as part of President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society programs of the mid-1960s.\n\nThere is no precedent for Congress to reverse a major program of social benefits once it has taken effect and reached millions of Americans.\n\nTaken together, the bills introduced Monday night represent the Republicans\u2019 first attempt \u2014 and best shot to date, with an ally in the White House \u2014 to translate seven years of talking points about demolishing the ACA into concrete action.\n\nAt the same time, major aspects of the plans, notably the strategy for tax credits and Medicaid, reflect the treacherous terrain that Republicans face to win enough votes within their own conferences in the GOP-controlled House and Senate.\n\nThe bills must address concerns of both conservatives concerned about the cost of the overhaul and worries that it might in effect enshrine a new federal entitlement, as well as more moderate members who want to ensure that their constituents retain access to affordable health care, including those who received Medicaid coverage under the ACA.\n\nEven so, signs emerged on Monday that Republicans in Congress\u2019s upper chamber could balk either at the cost of the proposal or if it leaves swaths of the country without insurance coverage.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) one of at least three conservative senators who opposes the plan to provide income-based tax credits, tweeted: \u201cStill have not seen an official version of the House Obamacare replacement bill, but from media reports, this sure looks like Obamacare Lite!\u201d\n\nAnd four key Republican senators, all from states that opted to expand Medicaid under the ACA, said they would oppose any new plan that would leave millions of Americans uninsured.\n\n\u201cWe will not support a plan that does not include stability for Medicaid expansion populations or flexibility for states,\u201d Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Shelley Moore Capito (R. W.Va.), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) wrote in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\n\nAt a speech in Janesville, Wis., March 3, Vice President Pence once again promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act, saying that they would \"at the same time,\" replace it with \"a better law.\" (The Washington Post)\n\nThe four senators were split on exactly what proposals would meet their standards, but with 52 Republicans, McConnell would not have enough votes to pass repeal without the support of at least two of them.\n\nDemocrats, too, have given no indication that they intend to work with Republicans, and top party leaders decried the GOP plan Monday as a betrayal of everyday Americans. \u201cTrumpcare doesn\u2019t replace the Affordable Care Act, it forces millions of Americans to pay more for less care,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.).\n\nIn particular, the plan to target Planned Parenthood has already generated fierce pushback from Democrats and doubts from some Republicans who have noted that federal funds are already barred from funding abortions and that Planned Parenthood provides routine medical care to millions of American women.\n\nThe tax credits outlined by the Ways and Means Committee\u2019s portion of the legislation incorporates an approach that Republicans have long criticized: income-based aid to help Americans afford health coverage.\n\nUntil now, the GOP had been intending to veer away from the ACA subsidies that help poor and middle-class people obtain insurance, insisting that the size of tax credits with which they planned to replace the subsidies should be based entirely on people\u2019s ages and not their incomes. But the drafts issued Monday proposed refundable tax credits that would hinge on earnings as well as age \u2014 providing bigger credits for older and poorer Americans.\n\nThis big pivot, developed by the Ways and Means Committee under the guidance of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), stems from a combination of problems that were arising with the idea of age-only credits that would have been available to any individual or family buying insurance on their own, no matter how affluent.\n\nEstimates from congressional budget analysts and the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget kept showing that the credits would be both too small to provide enough help to lower-income people and too expensive overall for a GOP determined to slash federal spending that the ACA has required.\n\nThose analysts have not had time to assess how this new configuration would affect federal spending or the number of people with insurance coverage.\n\nWhile the number of Americans who can afford health insurance has never been the priority for the GOP that it is for Democrats, Trump has made clear that he is sensitive to any changes that would strand large numbers of people who gained coverage under the ACA.\n\n[Conservative groups and lawmakers demanding \u2018full repeal\u2019 could derail Obamacare rollback]\n\nCompared with the ACA\u2019s subsidies, the tax credits would go to more people but provide less financial help to lower-income people, according to Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nMeanwhile, the portion of the legislation drafted by the Energy and Commerce Committee would substantially redesign Medicaid in a way that attempts to balance the GOP\u2019s antipathy for the ACA\u2019s expansion of the program against the concerns of a significant cadre of Republican governors \u2014 and the senators from their states \u2014 who fear losing millions of dollars that the law has funneled to help insure low-income residents.\n\nMedicaid would be converted from its current form of entitlement to anyone eligible into a per capita cap on funding to states, depending on how many people they had enrolled. In states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA, the government for now would continue paying for virtually the entire cost of the expansion.\n\nThirty-one states, plus the District of Columbia, have adopted that expansion. Starting in 2020, however, the GOP plan would restrict the government\u2019s generous Medicaid payment \u2014 90 percent of the cost of covering people in the expansion group \u2014 only to people who were in the program as of then. States would keep getting that amount of federal help for each of those people as long as they remained eligible, with the idea that most people on Medicaid drop off after a few years.\n\nFor the other 19 states that did not expand Medicaid, the legislation would provide $10 billion spread over five years. States could use that money to subsidize hospitals and other providers of care that treat many poor patients.\n\n[A divided White House still offers little guidance on replacing Obamacare]\n\nWhile members of the two committees working on the replacement drafts were determined to begin considering legislation this week, final work on them was still underway over the weekend and Monday, according to three individuals with knowledge of the process.\n\nThe change in thinking about tax credits emerged since Friday when a White House meeting chaired by Budget Director Mick Mulvaney and attended by key GOP congressional figures was called to finalize key provisions.\n\nAt the same time, the shift to take income into account could create a potentially difficult ripple effect for Republicans, who regard a reduction in the federal government\u2019s role in health care as a central reason to abandon the sprawling 2010 health care law. One motivation for the GOP thinking that credits could depend only on age was that the Internal Revenue Service would no longer have needed to verify the eligibility of people for financial help, as it has for ACA subsidies. If income is taken into account, the IRS would still need to be involved.\n\nThe Republican plan would offer tax credits ranging from $2,000 per year for those under 30 to $4,000 per year for those over 60. The full credit would be available for individuals earning up to $75,000 a year and up to $150,000 for married couples filing jointly. The credits would phase out for individuals earning more \u2014 for each $1,000 in additional income, a person would be entitled to $100 less in credit, meaning a 61-year old could make up to $115,100 and still receive some credit.\n\nThe income-based phase-out of the credit allows the GOP plan to be funded without taxes on employer-provided insurance that had been considered earlier in the drafting process. In addition, the latest proposal would eliminate the ACA\u2019s \u201cCadillac\u201d tax, a tax on the most generous employer-provided health plans that was expected to take effect in 2020. It also retains the tax exclusion currently to other employer-provided health benefits.\n\nAt a closed-door GOP conference meeting last week, several House Republicans expressed concerns that the committees might start to work on the legislation without a complete fiscal assessment. To be eligible for special budget rules known as \u201creconciliation\u201d \u2014 allowing bills to pass in the Senate by a simple majority \u2014 the legislation cannot increase the deficit after its first 10 years in effect.\n\nThis article was originally published in The Washington Post.

They were disappointed.\n\nA new executive order signed today reaffirms the elimination of the Visa Interview Waiver Program, which allows frequent travelers to the United States an expedited way of renewing their visas. It also proposes an extensive new program of \u201cUniform Screening and Vetting Standards for All Immigration Programs\u201d that will almost certainly make travel to the United States much more inconvenient for people from many countries.\n\nRelated: Whatever the Courts Say, Trump\u2019s Travel Ban Is Already Working\n\nThe new order replaces the controversial one that Trump signed in late January, and which was subsequently challenged in court after it left hundreds of people with valid travel documents stranded in airports around the world.\n\nAmong other things, the order signed today does a lot of cleanup work necessitated by its predecessor. It clarifies the status of legal permanent residents and people holding valid visas, and goes into detail about possible case-by-case exceptions. The new order removes Iraq from the list of countries whose residents are barred from entering the U.S. for 90 days, a move that had infuriated the many Iraqis actively fighting alongside U.S. advisers against the terror group ISIS. The other six countries from the original list -- Iran, Yemen, Somalia, Syria, Libya and Sudan -- remain.\n\nThe order also creates a 120-day halt to the Refugee Admissions Program, citing concerns that terrorists might be able to infiltrate groups of legitimate refugees to gain entry to the country.\n\nHowever, while the highest profile element of the new executive order is its effect on refugees and residents of the designated countries, there is good reason to worry that it will have a negative effect on many U.S. businesses that rely on tourism.\n\nRelated: Is Trump\u2019s Travel Ban Already Hurting US Tourism?\n\nFirst of all, eliminating the Visa Interview Waiver Program will make it much more inconvenient for business travelers from many countries to repeatedly enter the United States. Every time a visa expires, they will be required to submit to a sit-down interview with a consular official in their home country in order to get it renewed. Previously, they were allowed to drop off their passports at a U.S. embassy or consulate where a visa application would be processed without scheduling an interview.\n\nThe executive order also contemplates a ramped-up vetting process that will make it more difficult and time consuming for people interested in traveling to the United States as tourists to get here in the first place.\n\nThe order calls for \u201ca uniform baseline for screening and vetting standards and procedures, such as in-person interviews; a database of identity documents proffered by applicants to ensure that duplicate documents are not used by multiple applicants; amended application forms that include questions aimed at identifying fraudulent answers and malicious intent; a mechanism to ensure that applicants are who they claim to be; a mechanism to assess whether applicants may commit, aid, or support any kind of violent, criminal, or terrorist acts after entering the United States; and any other appropriate means for ensuring the proper collection of all information necessary for a rigorous evaluation of all grounds of inadmissibility or grounds for the denial of other immigration benefits.\u201d\n\nThere was already significant concern among the businesses that rely on travelers that the first version of the Trump travel ban was costing them business. And they represent a significant share of the U.S. economy, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council, bringing in nearly half a trillion dollars in 2015, or just over 2.5 percent of gross domestic product.\n\nRelated: Trump Adds a Nixonian Loyalty Test to His Travel Ban\n\nAnd the travel industry may be only the most obvious victim of a drop-off in travel to the United States.

AshLee Strong, a spokesperson for Ryan, declared that the Republicans were \u201cnow at the culmination of a years\u2019 long promise to keep our promise to the American people\u201d to repeal Obamacare.\n\nYet GOP leaders and the White House are caught between conflicting pressures. On the one hand, conservative lawmakers and advocacy groups are demanding the evisceration of every facet of the 2010 Affordable Care Act \u2013 including all mandates, premium subsidies and tax increases to finance the program. On the other hand, more moderate Republican lawmakers and governors, fearful of stripping millions of Americans of Obamacare and expanded Medicaid coverage, are urging a more cautious approach.\n\nAlthough the latest House GOP plan has been kept under strict lock and key to give opponents less time to review and attack the approach, details began leaking out over the weekend suggesting that there are still three major disputes holding back agreement in the House.\n\n1. Refundable tax credit. Ryan and Price have long favored a refundable tax credit that would be available to all Americans for use in purchasing health insurance in the private market. Unlike Obamacare, which provides premium subsidies based on income to low and moderate income people, the House GOP plan would make the tax credit available to all Americans \u2013 but based on age rather than income. In general, older, wealthier Americans would receive more in credits than younger, less wealthy people.\n\nRelated: Boehner \u2018Started Laughing\u2019 When Republicans Vowed to Replace Obamacare\n\nBut many conservative Republicans have opposed refundable tax credits, largely because people with lower incomes, who pay less in income taxes, would receive the full credit even if it exceeds their tax bill. Conservative critics including Sens., Rand Paul (R-KY) and Ted Cruz (R-TX), have dismissed the refundable tax credit as \u201cObamacare Lite\u201d and want it stricken from any replacement plan.\n\nFor now the tax credit remains in the House GOP plan, but House Republicans are considering a change that would deny the credit to the wealthiest Americans, according to Politico. No decision has been reached yet on what the threshold should be.\n\n2. Medicaid expansion. Currently, 31 states and the District of Columbia have signed up for an expanded Medicaid program under Obamacare in which the federal government pays about 90 percent of the bill for health care coverage to roughly 10 million low income adults who previously didn\u2019t qualify for the program. Conservatives want to rescind the program and cut back on Medicaid spending, while many governors and lawmakers are demanding that the expanded program remain in place.\n\nThe latest House Republican plan would eliminate Medicaid expansion by 2020, according to Politico. States could continue to provide coverage if they choose, but they would receive far less federal assistance to do so. Moreover, Congress would also convert traditional Medicaid into a block grant or per capita payment to the states. Those steps taken together would almost certainly slash enrollments in Medicaid, which currently total about 70 million, and reduce the benefit level over time.\n\nRep. Greg Walden, chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, told reporters over the weekend that the Republicans don\u2019t intend to \u201cpull the rug out from under\u201d Medicaid beneficiaries, but that the program isn\u2019t financially \u201csustainable\u201d without major surgery.\n\nRelated: A First for Obamacare: Majority of Americans Now Support It\n\n3. Taxes. Any GOP replacement plan will cost a lot of money, perhaps even more than Obamacare\u2019s $1.2 trillion, 10-year price tag. So if the existing Obamacare taxes on individuals, businesses and the health care industry are stricken from the books, as conservatives demand, the Trump administration and GOP lawmakers will have to replace those lost revenues.\n\nRepublicans could claim billions of dollars in savings through budgetary maneuvers and dynamic scoring to offset some of the cost, at least on paper. But House GOP leaders are also pushing to cap the tax exclusion for employer-provided health insurance \u2013 the biggest loophole in the federal tax code. The House plan caps the tax exemption for employer-sponsored plans at the 90th percentile of premiums, meaning that the 10 percent most expensive health insurance plans would be taxed."}, {"date": "2017/03/06", "title": "Did Trump Just Declare War on the FBI?", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/06/Did-Trump-Just-Declare-War-FBI", "text": "The tension between the White House and the Federal Bureau of Investigation reached what could be a tipping point on Monday morning, when a spokesperson for President Trump said that the president does not accept FBI Director James Comey\u2019s claim that there was no wiretapping of Trump Tower.\n\nOver the weekend, Trump accused his predecessor Barack Obama of ordering a wiretap of Trump Tower during the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign.

The wiretapping has been discussed in The New York Times, BBC, Fox News and we believe that it should be looked at by the House Intelligence Committee.\u201d\n\nThe stories she cited, as Stephanopoulos pointed out immediately, do not actually back up Trump\u2019s claim that there was a presidential directive to place Trump Tower under surveillance.\n\nTrump adviser Kellyanne Conway joined the fray on Fox & Friends, restating Trump\u2019s claim that there was wiretapping and hinting that Trump knows things that others do not. \"He's the president of the United States,\" Conway said. \"He has information and intelligence that the rest of us do not.\" Whether Trump knows things that Comey does not was not addressed.\n\nTrump himself invoked the specter of Richard Nixon and the Watergate scandal over the weekend, comparing Obama\u2019s alleged surveillance of his office tower to the former president\u2019s use of the executive branch to harass his enemies.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Weekend Tweets Cause an Uproar Over Wiretap Accusation\n\nHowever, the more apt comparison here might be another moment in Nixon\u2019s troubled history: his demand that Attorney General Elliot Richardson fire Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox, who was investigating the Watergate affair. Nixon\u2019s order prompted Richardson to resign. He was followed out the door by Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus, who also refused to fire Cox.\n\nRichardson and Ruckelshaus were put in a position where they were forced to choose between serving the president and maintaining their personal integrity. Comey\u2019s position is similar, except that rather than ask him to compromise his principles, Trump has questioned the FBI director\u2019s integrity indirectly.\n\nAs one of the nation\u2019s top law enforcement officials, Comey is in what seems to be an untenable position. Being questioned by the president, however unfairly, will open up Comey and the agents who work for him to claims that other cases are being brought under dubious circumstances. For that reason, his resignation has become a real possibility.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t resign, it\u2019s hard to see how he doesn\u2019t get fired. Given the extraordinary power of the FBI director, it would be difficult for the White House to fail to demand Comey\u2019s resignation. If the president really believes that Comey isn\u2019t speaking truthfully to the public, the only responsible step would be to immediately replace him."}, {"date": "2017/03/06", "title": "Competing Narratives in Trump \u2018Wiretap\u2019 Story Lack Facts", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/06/Competing-Narratives-Trump-Wiretap-Story-Lack-Facts", "text": "The storm of controversy unleashed over the weekend by President Trump\u2019s extraordinary Twitter-based accusation that his predecessor, Barack Obama, ordered unspecified government agents to wiretap Trump Tower in the weeks before last year\u2019s presidential election had descended, by Monday, into an exercise in hair-splitting by both the president\u2019s supporters and his opponents.\n\nLate Sunday, The New York Times reported that Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey had asked the Department of Justice to officially deny reports that his agency had been directed by the Obama White House to tap the phone lines in Trump Tower. That came after Ken Lewis, a spokesman for the former president, issued a statement that read, \u201cA cardinal rule of the Obama administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Weekend Tweets Cause an Uproar Over Wiretap Accusation\n\nCrucially, neither of those denials goes as far as to say that there was no surveillance of people within Trump\u2019s orbit prior to the campaign. In fact, leaks from intelligence agencies have, for months, indicated the opposite, even if the surveillance was not necessarily directed at them.\n\nTrump\u2019s former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was forced to resign after information leaked revealing that he had a number of contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak in December, and then misled others in the administration about them. Other reports have suggested that multiple people working for the Trump campaign had repeated contacts with Russian officials during the run-up to the election.\n\nPlainly, there was considerable investigative work related to the connections between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence officials. However, what that does not do, despite the assertions of Trump\u2019s supporters, is prove that the most incendiary element of Trump\u2019s weekend Twitter rampage is the truth.\n\nTrump repeatedly and emphatically claimed that President Obama personally directed surveillance activity against him, and insinuated that he did so with the aim of compromising the election process.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s the Real Puzzle About the Trump-Russia Connection\n\nTerrible! Just found out that Obama had my \"wires tapped\" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! \u2014 Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017\n\nFirst, it should be noted that if Obama really did direct the powers of the surveillance state against the Republican presidential candidate with the aim of throwing the election to Democrat Hillary Clinton, it was a pretty spectacular failure. This is particularly so, given that some of the information about the alleged contacts between Trump associates and the Russians appears to have been collected prior to the election, but was only leaked afterward.\n\nRelated: Sessions Recusal Replaces One Set of Questions with Another\n\nBut there is no good reason to assume, as some of Trump\u2019s allies are willing to do, that the surveillance resulted from a direct White House order. The FBI and the nation\u2019s security services routinely monitor the communications of Russian officials and agents operating in the United States. If a member or members of the Trump administration were picked up during that monitoring because they were the second party in a conversation -- as appears to have happened with Flynn, who reportedly spoke to Kislyak on the phone from Trump Tower -- it is not evidence of an effort to surveil Trump.\n\nBoth sides, in this case, seem to be trying to twist the other\u2019s position into the most extreme version possible.\n\nTrump\u2019s detractors are claiming that his allegation of surveillance at Trump Tower is completely unfounded. But they aren\u2019t completely divorced from the truth. It\u2019s known at this point that at least some Trump associates had their communications monitored, even if they weren\u2019t necessarily the target of that monitoring.\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters are quick to jump on the idea that if that monitoring occurred, then it must have been both directed at Trump and ordered by the White House. At this point, there is little evidence of the first claim and none at all of the second.\n\nNone of these conversations would be happening, of course, if the president wasn\u2019t given to tweeting wild accusations at 6:35 on a Saturday morning."}, {"date": "2017/03/06", "title": "Obamacare Replacement: What Republicans Can Learn From Socialized Medicine", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/03/06/Obamacare-Replacement-What-Republicans-Can-Learn-Socialized-Medicine", "text": "As Republicans struggle to repeal and replace Obamacare, they can find useful ideas in unexpected places: countries that have adopted socialized medicine. While the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service and other health bureaucracies may seem to be the wrong place to seek guidance for a private-market plan, they offer approaches to cost-effectiveness that Republicans will need to embrace if they hope to implement a new health care reform without getting hammered in 2018.\n\nThe core problem for Republicans is that progressives have won the philosophical debate by persuading the public that health care is a right. Polls show that an overwhelming majority of Americans believe the government should ensure universal access to health care. Although conservatives and libertarians make the point that so-called positive rights, like a right to health care, can only be provided through some form of compulsion, this argument no longer resonates. A system that fails to guarantee access to essential care regardless of ability to pay is no longer politically feasible.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Won\u2019t Touch Entitlement Reform\u2026Yet\u200b\n\nOnce we recognize that Americans have bought into a fundamentally socialistic idea, the fiscally responsible approach is to fund universal service in the most cost-effective way. Relative to other advanced nations, the United Kingdom offers an especially inexpensive model for providing health care. In 2015, health care spending in the U.K. was only $4,003 per person, less than half the $9,451 per person we spend in the U.S. Despite its sharply lower spending, the U.K. enjoys higher life expectancy at birth than the U.S. \u2014 81.4 years versus 78.8 years here. While violent crime, accidents, poor nutrition and lack of exercise contribute to relatively low life expectancy in the U.S., it is hard to believe that we would significantly outperform the U.K. even if these factors were somehow equalized.\n\nTo understand why the U.K. gets better results (at least in terms of longevity), we need to take a brief detour into budgeting theory. Governments use two methods to spend money: appropriations and entitlements. In the U.S., most federal agencies are funded through appropriations, meaning Congress assigns them a fixed budget each fiscal year. Agency leaders must then manage within their budgets, implementing cost-saving measures during the year if they are at risk of running out of money. But most medical care is funded through entitlements. Under Medicare and Medicaid, health providers can be reimbursed for whatever services they provide, with no predetermined limit (although there are some exceptions). Because entitlements are unmanaged, they are more subject to escalating costs. As reimbursement rules change, providers find ways to maximize their revenue, while program administrators have no incentive to push back.\n\nRelated: New Report Warns Millions Could Lose Health Care Under GOP Plan\n\nIn the U.K., most medical care is provided by the National Health Service through appropriations. Due to budgetary pressure, health authorities make trade-offs that are now unthinkable in America, but that don\u2019t greatly impact broadly measured health outcomes. Mammograms are generally not available to women under 50 because the benefits of earlier testing usually do not justify the risks of undergoing the procedure. The NHS also does not offer routine colonoscopies, and provides far fewer circumcisions for newborn boys.\n\nThe NHS and other large health care bureaucracies engage in a practice economists call non-price rationing: doling out a scarce resource through government mandate rather than by a market process. While this approach is normally maligned by free-market economists, it is preferable to the alternative we have here in the U.S., which is basically no rationing whatsoever.\n\nPerhaps the worst manifestation of U.K. rationing is the long waits for surgical procedures. Although the NHS officially limits waiting times for elective surgery to 18 weeks, patients often must wait far longer. That said, the U.K. does provide a couple of mechanisms that limit this problem. First, the media and opposition political figures have the freedom and the incentive to embarrass the government into improving patient outcomes. Patients suffering or dying due to long waits can become the focus of news stories and at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions in Parliament.\n\nRelated: How 3 GOP Senators Could Stop Obamacare Repeal in its Tracks\n\nAlso, Britain has a robust private health care system that can take some of the weight off of the NHS. About 10 percent of U.K. residents have private health insurance \u2014 paid directly or through an employer \u2014 that provides access to consultations and procedures over and above what they can get through the NHS. Although progressives might complain that allowing a private market results in a two-tier system, they should realize that total health care equality is a pipe dream.\n\nNon-price rationing produces some bad outcomes, but it has little impact on the U.K.\u2019s overall results because a lot of the medical procedures are unnecessary. Research shows that, beyond a certain basic level, additional care provides little or no benefit. Indeed, research on doctor strikes show that death rates either remain the same or fall when physicians deny access to their services.\n\nTight NHS budgeting is also associated with lower drug prices, more modest salaries for doctors and more deliveries of babies at home by midwives. By contrast, the combination of pervasive third-party payment arrangements and limited cost controls in the U.S. enriches health providers and encourages waste. TV commercials encourage patients to demand brand-name prescription drugs for conditions that could be treated by generic or over-the-counter medications \u2014 if they require pharmaceutical intervention at all.\n\nRelated: The Medical Technology That Could Save the US Billions Each Year\n\nTwenty years ago, a case of heartburn might have been handled by rest or a few Tums; now, it\u2019s diagnosed as Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease and treated with prescription Nexium. While a one-month supply of Nexium retails for $250, a similar quantity of generic Omeprazole can be had for $17 and over-the-counter Prilosec costs only $18. The main reason doctors prescribe and patients demand the branded prescription drug is that third-party payers cover most of the bill \u2014 often with government subsidies.\n\nHospitals also benefit from generous third-party payments. Sutter Health, a not-for-profit hospital chain in Northern California, paid its CEO $7.5 million in 2015. Eighteen other executives received compensation in excess of $1 million each, yet Sutter still reported net income of $81 million. About 60 percent of the organization\u2019s revenue came from state and federal sources. In other words, California and U.S. taxpayers helped the hospital chain and its executives make millions.\n\nCongress can fund universal care without breaking the federal budget by squeezing drug companies, hospitals and other health care providers. House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s plan to introduce block grants for Medicaid, which will effectively oblige states to implement non-price rationing, may be the first step in this direction.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Lofty Vision of Renewal Comes with a Huge Price Tag\n\nThe block grant approach could be extended to individuals now receiving large subsidies on Obamacare exchanges and those with costly-to-insure pre-existing conditions. States could respond by giving hospitals fixed annual grants for attending to patients not carrying private insurance, thereby compelling these providers to economize. States could also negotiate lower prices with drug providers and/or migrate patients to generic and over-the-counter remedies. While lobbyists make it difficult for legislators to implement such policies, transitioning away from the entitlement model to one based on appropriations is the way forward."}, {"date": "2017/03/05", "title": "Trump\u2019s Weekend Tweets Cause an Uproar Over Wire Tap Accusation", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/05/Trump-s-Weekend-Tweets-Cause-Uproar-Over-Wire-Tap-Accusation", "text": "The White House on Sunday refused to walk back President Trump\u2019s startling claim that former President Barack Obama orchestrated a wire tap of Trump Tower late in the 2016 campaign despite a glaring lack of evidence.\n\nIn an apparent effort to distract attention from his administration\u2019s mounting woes over a Justice Department and a congressional investigation into possible ties between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russian operatives, the hyperbolic Trump on Saturday dispatched early morning Twitter blasts from his West Palm Beach resort declaring that Obama \u201chad my wires tapped.\u201d\n\n\n\nRelated: Sessions Recusal Replaces One Set of Questions with Another\n\nTrump described the former president as a \u201cbad (or sick) guy\u201d and likened his behavior to \u201cNixon/Watergate.\u201d Trump\u2019s top advisers reportedly were startled by the president\u2019s actions and scrambled to contain the damage, just days after Trump received glowing reviews of his address to a joint session of Congress.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders told ABC News today that there have been \u201cquite a few\u201d reports from both main stream and far-right news organizations suggesting that the FBI may have wire tapped Trump\u2019s organization as part of an investigation into links between Trump associates and the Russian government.\n\nTrump\u2019s angry tweets Saturday may have been in response to a report Friday by the alt-right website Breitbart and commentary from conservative talk radio host Mark Levin alleging that Obama used \u201cpolice state\u201d tactics to monitor Trump\u2019s organization, according to The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cAll we\u2019re saying is, let\u2019s take a closer look,\u201d Sanders told ABC\u2019s Martha Raddatz. \u201cIf this happened, if this is accurate, this is . . . the greatest overreach and the greatest abuse of power that we have ever seen.

Unfortunately, the current tax code is anything but simple, and the price tag of that complexity is enormous. In particular, our high tax rates distort business decisions and are destructive to economic growth. According to an Internal Revenue Service report, corporations alone spent $104 billion complying with the tax code in 2012. That's a ton of money, especially considering that corporate tax revenues are only about $500 billion a year.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s high time for tax reform. Unfortunately, the House Republicans may be jeopardizing the first opportunity they have had in over 30 years to implement desperately needed tax changes by insisting on one very problematic tax feature on the corporate side called the border adjustment tax. The reform would slap a 20 percent tax on imports to the United States while exempting exports. For the proposal to not become a protectionist tax increase, proponents assume a large and unrealistic strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\n\n\u200bRelated: Republican Hopes for Tax Reform Hinge on a Trillion-Dollar Gimmick\n\nOne rationale for the border adjustment tax is that other countries\u2019 tax codes give an unfair advantage to their companies over U.S. ones. That\u2019s actually false. First, other countries may have Value Added Taxes that are rebated at the border when companies sell their goods abroad; however, they also have a corporate income tax. The United States is lucky this way, in that it only has a corporate income tax.\n\nSecond, at the retail level the United States taxes goods imported from Japan, for instance, and domestic goods equally. Also each country taxes their companies with a corporate tax. So that\u2019s fair. There\u2019s parity of treatment in Japan too, where goods imported from the U.S. are taxed at the retail levels by the Japanese government the same way as Japanese goods. Again, each country taxes their companies with the corporate tax as well. Also worth noting is that economists have repeatedly debunked the claim that Value Added Tax systems boost exports.\n\nNow, it\u2019s true that U.S. companies are at a competitive disadvantage, but this is because our corporate income tax system has the highest statutory rate of all developed countries, and because \u2014 unlike most of our competitors \u2014 it taxes U.S. companies\u2019 profits no matter where they\u2019re earned in the world. The solution to this disadvantage is to reduce the rates and move toward a territorial system. That\u2019s what the House plan is trying to do, but it\u2019s going about it the wrong way by adding an import tax and exempting our exports. This behavior opens the United States to a costly challenge before the World Trade Organization, which carries its own set of risks for our country.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Lofty Vision of Renewal Comes with a Huge Price Tag\n\nRather than adopt a destructive border tax to address imaginary trade distortions, Congress could address the real problems with our tax code by following the example of the United Kingdom, which decided to leave its competitive disadvantage behind and move to a non-border tax territorial system in 2009. The benefits proved effective by getting rid of a major corporate incentive to leave the U.K. Japan made the same move in 2009 and followed up a few years later by cutting the tax rate.\n\nFinally, it seems that another popular reason for the border adjustment tax is that the new levy, no matter how problematic it is, will help pay for the tax reforms we like. Indeed, the tax is credited for raising $1.2 trillion over 10 years while the economic growth comes from the other aspects of the plan. While the concern for our deficit is understandable, the idea of paying for a pro-growth tax reform by raising taxes is troublesome. Congress should instead pay for lower tax rates and a move to a territorial system through reductions in spending.\n\nThankfully, there are easy ways to achieve that goal. Corporate welfare programs that benefit special corporate interests at the expense of everyone else cost $56 billion annually. Improper payments total $137 billion a year, while there are easily tens of billions of dollars to save from unauthorized appropriations (spending that occurs without having been authorized by Congress). The Congressional Budget Office estimates that we could save $68 billion annually by imposing caps on federal spending for Medicaid, $126 billion by repealing all insurance coverage provisions of the Affordable Care Act, $41 billion by repealing the individual mandate and $42 billion by ending the tax preferences for employment-based health insurance. We could also save $36 billion a year if Congress converted multiple assistance programs for lower-income Americans into smaller block grants to states, $9 billion if we tightened eligibility rules for food stamps and up to $19 billion by reducing Social Security benefits for new beneficiaries.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Won\u2019t Touch Entitlement Reform\u2026Yet \u200b\n\nAcademic research consistently shows major benefits to economic growth and efficiency from lowering the corporate income tax rate and moving to a territorial regime. That should be the focus of any corporate tax reform proposal. There are plenty of spending reform options to pay for a reduction in the corporate rate to 20 percent and a move toward a territorial regime without resorting to a border-adjustment tax, which is poorly understood and presents unnecessary risks to the U.S. economy.\n\nVeronique de Rugy is a senior research fellow with the Mercatus Center at George Mason University."}, {"date": "2017/03/05", "title": "Here\u2019s What Trump\u2019s \u2018Merit-Based\u2019 Immigration System Would Look Like", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/05/Here-s-What-Trump-s-Merit-Based-Immigration-System-Would-Look", "text": "Twice last week, President Trump spoke out in favor of changing the rules under which immigrants are allowed into the United States, praising something he called a \u201cmerit-based\u201d system. For Trump, who ran for office on promises of mass deportations, banning Muslims from entering the country, building a wall on the Mexican border and other strongly anti-immigration positions, any positive comments about foreigners entering the country are notable, and deserve some unpacking.\n\nAt present, there are several ways for foreigners to legally come to the United States to live, either temporarily or permanently. In 2015, for example, the US granted lawful permanent resident status, commonly known as a \u201cgreen card\u201d to 1,051,031 people. Recipients included winners of the \u201cgreen card lottery,\u201d also known as the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program, which provides a limited number of people from countries with relatively low immigration to the US the ability to come here.\n\nRelated: As AG, Sessions Could Radically Influence Immigration Enforcement\n\nOthers earn the right to live in the US permanently by other means. Relatives of legal residents have a path, often tortuous, to legal status. This is by far the most common method of earning a Green Card, with 63 percent of them issued to relatives of current legal residents each year. Refugees seeking asylum in the US are also eligible for legal resident status.\n\nPeople from other countries can also enter the country on work and student visas. These typically require them to demonstrate that they have either been offered legal employment in the US or that they have been accepted as students in an accredited academic program.\n\nSome of these methods are plainly objectionable to Trump and his administration. Soon after taking office he issued an executive order barring refugees from entering the country. He also objects to allowing the relatives of existing residents an easier path to entry than others.\n\nWhite House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon has also raised questions about allowing skilled immigrants into the country on work and student visas. For example, he said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got all the engineering schools full of people from South Asia and East Asia.

It\u2019s a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet in America we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cSwitching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration and instead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more benefits. It will save countless dollars, raise workers\u2019 wages and help struggling families, including immigrant families, enter the middle class. And they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed.\u201d\n\nTrump returned to the subject on Friday, reacting to the appearance of author Nick Adams on the television program Fox & Friends. Adams, an Australian by birth who emigrated to the US in 2016, is a rising figure in conservative circles. He founded the hyper-patriotic group Foundation for Liberty and American Greatness (FLAG). In his book, he documents his struggle to obtain a green card, arguing that the US immigration system is biased in favor of illegal immigration.\n\nRelated: Study Finds Illegal Immigrants Pay $11.8B in Taxes\n\nNick Adams new book, Green Card Warrior, is a must read.

In Canada, prospective immigrants face a points-based system for earning the right to enter the country as legal residents.\n\nA 100-point scale accounts for various factors with high levels of education or training in desirable fields weighted heavily. The system also favors people who are fluent in either English or French, the two official languages of the Canadian government. It gives extra points, though fewer of them, to younger immigrants and those with family members already in the country.\n\nAustralia, similarly, focuses its immigration policy strongly on admitting younger, economically independent candidates. The country accepted slightly more than 262,000 new permanent legal residents last year, 57 percent of whom were allowed in because they possessed particular skills or educational credentials.

He would prefer to limit immigration in ways that privilege the economically independent and make it much harder for poorer, less-educated people to enter the country.\n\nThat would mark a sharp, official break with the United States\u2019 longstanding self-image as a place where people with little opportunity for advancement in their own countries can come to America to seek their fortune.

Because the Republicans hold a narrow 52 to 48 seat majority in the Senate, those three senators could stop the repeal movement in its tracks.\n\nNot long ago, the only threat to moving ahead with the plan was seen as the possible defection of moderate Republican lawmakers and governors. But now, as House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) prepares to push through a budget measure that would repeal much of the Obamacare law and garnish it with elements of a replacement plan, the real threat is coming from the far right.\n\nRelated: Democrats Claim They Can Block Obamacare Repeal by Republicans\n\nWith broad support from outside conservative groups, including Freedom Works, Americans for Prosperity and Heritage Action for America, the three senators are taking a hard line. Their plan is similar to a measure passed by the Republicans in January 2016 that gutted every mandate, tax increase and subsidy in the ACA legislation, along with an I.O.U. to come back later with a fully defined Republican alternative. President Obama vetoed the bill, but the Republicans promised to pass it again after the November election.\n\nAnything short of that, the three argue, would be a gross violation of the Republicans\u2019 pledge to the country. Although the 2010 Affordable Care Act subsequently helped insure millions of Americans, President Trump and GOP leaders have denounced it as an abject failure.\n\n\u201cWhen you spend six years promising, \u2018If only we get elected, we\u2019ll repeal Obamacare,\u2019 you cannot renege on that promise,\u201d Cruz said on Friday in an op-ed in Politico. \u201cFailure is not an option. Breaking our word would be a catastrophe. The voters would, quite rightly, never again trust Republicans to deliver on anything.\u201d\n\nPaul and Lee echoed those same sentiments this week. And beyond that is their disdain for the work going on in the House, where Ryan, Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California and the top Republicans on the Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce Committees are feverishly working behind closed doors to devise a plan they can take to the floor within the next few weeks.\n\nRelated: A First for Obamacare: Majority of Americans Now Support It\n\nThe House Republicans are attempting to fashion a hybrid budget resolution that cherry picks the best of Obamacare \u2013 including a ban on insurers discriminating against people with pre-existing medical conditions and allowing children to remain on their parents\u2019 health insurance policies until age 26 \u2013 while scrapping the rest in favor of more conservative, market-oriented measures.\n\nRyan got burned politically when an earlier version of the plan leaked out late last month at the start of a weeklong congressional recess and helped to fuel protests and acrimony at town hall meetings across the country. This time, he is treating the new version like a top secret under lock and key.\n\nPaul mocked Ryan and the other House GOP leaders by presenting himself outside the door of a Capitol conference room on Thursday and demanding to be let inside to read the latest version of the Obamacare repeal legislation. House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland and other Democrats made a similar show of pique at being denied a peek at the evolving legislation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like a copy of the bill,\u201d Paul declared to a House GOP aide who came to the door, and to a group of reporters who gathered at the entrance. \u201cIf you\u2019d recall, when Obamacare was passed in 2009 and 2010, [House Democratic Leader] Nancy Pelosi said you\u2019ll know what\u2019s in it after you pass it. The Republican party shouldn\u2019t act the same way.\u201d\n\nRelated: 8 Big Changes Under Tom Price\u2019s Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nPaul never made it passed the door, but he and his conservative allies are not likely to approve of whatever eventually emerges from the room. Few details have slipped out so far about the shape of the newly revised GOP health care replacement legislation.\n\nHowever, the House GOP plan is likely to include measures largely endorsed by President Trump in his address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night. Those include interstate sales of health insurance policies; the greatly expanded use of tax-exempt medical savings accounts, creation of \u201crisk pools\u201d in every state to cover older, sicker Americans; changes to Medicaid coverage for the poor and some form of a federal tax credit that would replace the Obamacare tax subsidy that helps people cover their premium costs.\n\nVice President Mike Pence made a joint appearance with Ryan in the speaker\u2019s hometown of Janesville, Wisconsin, on Friday, where he seemingly embraced Ryan\u2019s approach to health care reform. \"Let me make you a promise: the Obamacare nightmare is about to end,\" Pence declared.\n\nPence said he and Trump were working with Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to \u201cput the finishing touches on our plan, even as this weekend rolls on.\u201d\n\nRyan presented members of the House Republican conference with a timeline for action on Thursday that called for committee action beginning next week and passage of the budget resolution on the floor within three weeks. If they manage to do that, the bill would then go to the Senate for uncertain action. But the question of how best to replace Obamacare\u2019s income tax subsidy for lower income Americans is proving to be one of the biggest stumbling blocks to a compromise among Republicans in both chambers.\n\nRelated: Boehner \u2018Started Laughing\u2019 When Republicans Vowed to Replace Obamacare\n\nRyan and Tom Price, the former House Republican member and now secretary of health and human services, have long favored a \u201crefundable\u201d tax credit that would be available to all Americans \u2013 but one based on age rather than income. Under Obamacare, eligible individuals and families with low or moderate income receive a refundable tax credit to purchase health insurance on government-run exchanges. That means that people who pay little in federal taxes could still qualify for premium support.\n\nPrice, the former House Budget Committee chair, pioneered a substitute fixed refundable tax credit. This one is pegged to a person\u2019s age rather than their income and can be used to buy their insurance policies in the private market. Those tax credits would be fairly modest, ranging from $1,200 a year for people 18 to 35 years of age to $3,000 for those 51 and older. In many regions of the country, that would hardly begin to cover the premiums for a relatively comprehensive health insurance plan. Ryan tweaked that approach by providing a credit of up to $4,000 a year.\n\nBut many conservative Republicans have opposed refundable tax credits of any stripe. That\u2019s because people with lower incomes, who pay less in income taxes, receive the full credit even if it exceeds their tax bill. The non-refundable credits may be used only to offset actual tax liability. Some say they oppose the refundable tax credit idea because it is tantamount to a new government entitlement, like Medicare or Medicaid, by allowing Americans to receive a larger credit than they pay in taxes.\n\n\"We are sending federal assistance in a newly created method that somehow we think will work better than what we've had\u201d in Obamacare, Rep. Mark Meadows, chair of the Freedom Caucus, said.\n\nRand Paul and Rep. Mark Sanford (R-SC) have offered an alternative backed by the conservative House Freedom Caucus that provides an individual tax break that can\u2019t result in a refund.

Last year, the IRS reported a staggering $458 billion average annual difference between taxes that were owed and actually paid \u2013 the so-called \u201ctax gap.\u201d\n\nRelated: IRS Now Pegs Tax Cheating by Americans at $458 Billion Annually\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin testified during his recent Senate confirmation hearings that one of his goals is to beef up the agency\u2019s enforcement division to vastly improve tax collections and help bring down the deficit. Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner John Koskinen have argued that stepped up enforcement efforts would more than pay for themselves, garnering $6 to $7 of additional tax revenue for every $1 spent uncovering tax non-compliance.\n\nYet the Office of Management and Budget has proposed slashing the IRS budget by 14.1 percent in fiscal 2018, according to The New York Times. That would bring down the agency\u2019s operating budget to just $9.65 billion \u2013 a far cry from the $12.1 billion budget just six years ago.\n\nThe IRS is one of many federal agencies and departments that are being targeted for steep cuts next year to help offset the $54 billion of increased spending on the military that President Trump proposed this week. The State Department, the Environmental Protection Agency and scores of social programs have also been targeted for cuts in a budget document prepared by OMB Director Mick Mulvaney.\n\nThe IRS budget overall has come down by 17 percent since 2010, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. That has forced the agency to severely scale back enforcement operations, employee training and badly needed upgrades to information technology systems.\n\nRelated: IRS May Have Allowed Insurers to Escape Millions in Fees and Penalties\n\nThroughout that period, the IRS has reduced its staffing by 14 percent, from 94,600 to 81,600. Some of that reduction was warranted, especially as the tax filing system moved rapidly from the antiquated filing of paper tax returns to almost exclusively on-line or electronic filings.\n\nHowever, some experts say that steady decline in spending on IRS operations and enforcement over the years has resulted in a serious reduction in customer service, the closing of dozens of walk-in assistance centers, a decline in the number of audits to ferret out tax cheating and a gradual erosion in compliance and public confidence in the tax system. The number of IRS staffers devoted to audits and enforcing the tax law has dropped from more than 50,000 to below 39,000 since 2010, or 22 percent.\n\nNew internal data released this week by the IRS Criminal Investigation unit in its annual report show that the number of individual tax return audits fell in 2016 to the lowest level since 2004.\n\nDennis J. Ventry Jr., a member of the IRS advisory council and a law professor at the University of California-Davis, told Times that the agency had already been squeezed dry.\n\nRelated: Why the IRS Is Catching Fewer Tax Cheats\n\nLast year, seven former IRS commissioners wrote a letter to Congress, saying that over the past half century, \u201cnone of us has ever witnessed anything like what has happened to the IRS appropriations over the last five years and the impact these appropriations reductions are having on our tax system.\u201d\n\nAlan Cole, an economist with the Tax Foundation, said in an email Friday that even with the advent of automated, computerized tax filings and communications, the IRS still has \u201ctoo many responsibilities\u201d with a diminished budget, \u201cespecially because it has to handle health care and other ancillary objectives.\u201d\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the IRS is responsible for determining whether filers have purchased health insurance, as required by law, and process the applications of lower-income Americans for tax credits to help many cover the cost of their premiums. Under an executive order signed by Trump in late January, however, the IRS has scrapped plans to more aggressively enforce the mandate requiring individuals to show that they have purchased health insurance on their tax returns.\n\nSome economists say that OMB\u2019s latest assault on IRS funding must be viewed in the larger context of the president\u2019s overall plan to slash taxes by trillions of dollars over the coming decade, vastly expand funding for national defense and immigration enforcement and other measures likely to drive up a national debt that is fast approaching $20 trillion.\n\nRelated: IRS Warns That Scammers Have a New Trick to Get Your W-2 Form\n\nRoberton C.

On Thursday, just hours after Attorney General Jeff Sessions was forced to recuse himself from any investigation of the campaign\u2019s ties to Russia, another Trump adviser revealed that Trump and his team had been more aggressive in inserting Russia-friendly policy planks into the Republican Party platform than they previously admitted.\n\nOver the summer, as the Republicans were preparing to formally nominate Trump as their presidential candidate, controversy broke out over a proposed change to the language in the party\u2019s platform with regard to Ukraine. A member of the platform committee proposed an amendment that expressed support for the provision of lethal weapons to the government in Kiev, which was then fighting a Russia-backed insurgency on the heels of Moscow\u2019s invasion of Crimea.\n\nRelated: Sessions Recusal Replaces One Set of Questions with Another\n\nReports at the time indicated that Trump\u2019s representatives at the meeting moved quickly to water down the language, but the campaign denied it forcefully.

Zero,\u201d said Manafort.\n\nIn an interview with ABC after the convention, Trump seemed to confirm that he was not party to his campaign\u2019s discussions about the GOP\u2019s position on Ukraine. \u201cI wasn't involved in that. Honestly, I was not involved.\"\n\nTurns out, though, that not only did someone on the Trump campaign want to soften language toward Russia, but that somebody may have been Donald Trump himself.\n\nAccording to CNN reporter Jim Acosta, former Trump national security adviser J.D. Gordon said on Thursday that last March, at a meeting in Washington months before the Republican convention, Trump said that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to go to World War III over Ukraine\u201d and said that he favored a much lower level of support for the government in Kiev, one that did not involve providing weapons.\n\nRelated: Demands for a Special Counsel to Investigate Trump\u2019s Russia Ties Just Got Louder\n\nGordon said that he specifically advocated for the change in platform language that was ultimately inserted, and did so because he believed it was what Trump had requested.\n\nAs recently as January, Gordon told Business Insider that Trump and Manafort were not engaged in policy discussions at that level of detail. In an email Friday, he told the website that he did not see his comments as contradictory, and that the apparent disconnect between his January statements and CNN\u2019s report was a matter of \u201csemantics.\u201d\n\nThe CNN story comes on the heels of fresh reports of meetings between Trump associates, including Gordon, and Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak. Gordon and Trump advisers Carter Page and Walid Phares reportedly met with Kislyak during the Republican convention at an event in Cleveland. In addition, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and close adviser Jared Kushner and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn met with Kislyak in Trump Tower in December.\n\nFlynn later resigned his position with the White House after lying to others in the administration about the extent of his contacts with Kislyak.\n\nTo be clear, there is nothing necessarily wrong about any of the meetings or contacts that Trump associates have had with the Russian ambassador. Flynn might have crossed a line if he interfered with the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to conduct foreign policy before Trump was sworn in. But for the most part, the meetings with Kislyak could easily be dismissed as business-as-usual interactions between foreign policy advisers and professional diplomats.\n\nRelated: Trump Has a New Reason for His Military Buildup: Job Creation\n\nWhat makes the matter so puzzling, and to some minds even troubling, is apparent resistance among members of the Trump administration to come clean about the frequency and content of their discussions with Russia and their efforts to promote policy positions friendly to the Kremlin.\n\nIf nothing else, it\u2019s providing a source of free and seemingly unlimited ammunition to the administration\u2019s critics.

The second was with two members of his staff present.\n\nSessions announced that he would recuse himself from the ongoing investigation into connections between President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign staff and the Russian government, which the US Intelligence Community has accused of interfering in the election on Trump\u2019s behalf.\n\nSessions claimed, in effect, that he had misunderstood a question posed by Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) during his confirmation hearing. Asked whether he knew of any contact between Trump campaign officials, of which he was one, and figures in the Russian government, he said that he did not, adding, \u201cI did not have communications with the Russians.\u201d\n\nRelated: Kremlin: Ambassador Didn\u2019t Meet Sessions (But It Would Have Been OK If He Did)\n\nOn Thursday, Sessions said that he had understood the question to be about whether he had had discussions about the election with Russian officials, which he says he did not. \u201cIn retrospect, I should have slowed down and said I did meet one Russian official a couple times, and that would be the ambassador,\u201d he explained during his press conference.\n\nSessions\u2019 announcement that he would recuse himself was plainly meant to defuse a controversy that looked increasingly dangerous for the Trump administration, but in several ways, all it did was to refocus the questions that will be brought up by political opponents and even concerned allies.\n\nSessions is still in charge.\n\nThe fact that he has recused himself from the investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s alleged connections to the Kremlin won\u2019t come close to satisfying Democrats who remain furious at the possibility that Russian interference may have cost Democrat Hillary Clinton the presidency.\n\nThe job of overseeing the investigation and making the difficult calls associated with it, such as whom to subpoena and whether or not any charges should ultimately be brought will fall to the deputy attorney general, who works for...Jeff Sessions.

The on-the-ground element of the investigation is being spearheaded by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and its director, James Comey.\n\nMany Democrats have come to harbor serious distrust of Comey because of actions his agency took during the presidential election. Leaks from the FBI to major media outlets late last year seemed designed to shoot down the idea that there was a significant investigation into a Trump-Russia connection under way. At the same time, FBI agents were feeding information damaging to Clinton to Trump surrogate and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani.\n\nWhen, less than two weeks before the election, Comey went public with the news that the FBI was investigating a possible security breach connected with Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state, only to report days later that nothing new had been discovered, Democrats accused him of aiding the Trump campaign.\n\nRelated: Trump Has a New Reason for His Military Buildup: Job Creation\n\nMore Russian contacts keep emerging.\n\nEven as Sessions was speaking to the press Thursday, new reports were emerging of other contacts between officials in the Trump campaign and Russian Ambassador Kislyak. The New York Times on Thursday reported that in December, prior to Trump taking office, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Trump son-in-law and close adviser Jared Kushner met with Kislyak in Trump Tower. That 15-minute meeting was considered a typical formality since members of the new administration-elect to meet were being introduced to ambassadors of many countries at that point.\n\nAlso on Thursday USA Today reported that two Trump campaign officials, J.D. Gordon and Carter Page, met with Kislyak during the Republican National Convention in July, just as news about alleged Russian interference in the US presidential election was breaking.\n\nTo be clear, neither of these meetings was necessarily nefarious.

What's difficult, having only been there a week, is to have these kinds of recommendations made and then look at our priorities and say, 'You know what, we've got to make sure that we look at these programs.'\"\n\nRelated: A Military Buildup and Big Tax Cuts: Is the Debt Set to Soar Under Trump?\n\nAs state attorney general, Pruitt was closely aligned with the oil and gas industry and sued the EPA at least 14 times in recent years, challenging the agencies legal authority to regulate mercury pollution, smog and carbon emissions. A cache of 6,000 emails released last week as part of a law suit in Oklahoma showed that Pruitt carefully coordinated his efforts to thwart the Obama administration\u2019s climate change initiatives with high level energy and utility company officials. In some cases, industry lawyers drafted letters for him to send to federal regulators.\n\nPruitt said during his Senate confirmation hearings that he did not believe climate change was a \"hoax,\u201d as Trump once insisted. However, he did argue that climate change needed more study and more debate, despite the huge body of existing research linking greenhouse gas emissions to global warming and rising sea levels.\n\nPruitt narrowly won Senate confirmation after his critics said his appointment to the EPA was tantamount to putting the fox in charge of guarding the hen house. Yet now, barely a week into his tenure as the new EPA administrator, he is bridling against the budget cuts. He complained that they would wreak havoc with grants to states, multi-state air quality improvement efforts, and the cleanup of toxic Superfund and abandoned industrial brownfield sites.\n\nHe stepped up his complaints on Thursday, during a gathering of the nation\u2019s mayors in Washington, signaling his intention to fight many of the proposed cuts.\n\nRelated: Five Big Challenges Facing Trump\u2019s New Budget Chief\n\n\u201cI want you to know that with the White House and also with Congress, I am communicating a message that the brownfields program, the Superfund program, water infrastructure \u2026 are essential to protect,\u201d Pruitt said.\n\nThe EPA, the State Department and a handful of other agencies have been targeted by the administration for steep cuts to help offset the cost of a $54 billion increase in defense spending and a military buildup ordered by Trump.\n\nAlthough the EPA has operated under budget constraints for years, OMB\u2019s proposal to slash the annual budget from $8.2 billion to $6.1 billion next year \u2013 a 25 percent reduction \u2013 would constitute an unprecedented assault on the premier environmental protection agency that has operated or the past half century.\n\nTrump, a climate change skeptic, has vowed to get rid of the EPA \u201cin almost every form.\u201d The administration and its GOP allies on Capitol Hill have already begun the process of overturning many of the Obama administration environmental regulations they claim have deterred energy exploration and economic expansion\n\nRelated: Why a Small Interest Rate Hike Means a $50 Billion Hit to the Federal Budget\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, Trump\u2019s plan would slash the EPA\u2019s staff from its current level of 15,000 to 12,000, with many of the agency\u2019s top scientists slated for eventual termination. Grants to states, along with air and water programs, would be cut by 30 percent. A massive cleanup of the Chesapeake Bay would receive just $5 million in the coming fiscal year, down from $73 million.\n\nThe EPA\u2019s Office of Research and Development potentially could lose up to 42 percent of its funding. And the new budget plan would eliminate funding completely for that office\u2019s contribution to the U.S. Global Change Research Program, an important climate change initiative launched in 1989 by former President George H.W. Bush.\n\n\u201cThis is going to the heart of our air and water protection,\u201d McCarthy said of the proposed budget cuts in an interview on MSNBC. \u201cThis is going to the heart of how EPA protects public health and American families, so that you can turn you tap water on and expect to have clean drinking water.

But still, it\u2019s possible that now that he is ensconced as administrator learning first-hand the challenges and responsibilities of the EPA, Pruitt could be taking a more nuanced approach to overhauling and downsizing the agency.\n\n\u201cIt remains to be seen how much he has actually changed,\u201d said Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cHow much of this is a combination of the turf protection that hits and getting yourself into the culture of an agency? Or maybe it\u2019s a sharper understanding that the cuts that they\u2019re going to make are actually going to hit places like Oklahoma hard, because a lot of that money goes for cleaning up toxic sites and other kinds of things that are right in their wheelhouse.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t mind creating the toxic sites, but they want somebody else to pay for cleaning them up,\u201d he added. Oklahoma currently has seven Superfund sites, with most of them at abandoned oil refineries.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Congress will have the final say in how deeply to cut EPA programs. The early indication is that Democrats and some Republicans are opposed to taking a meat axe to the agency\u2019s budget.\n\nAlthough the Republicans have frequently extracted cuts in EPA programs, many Republicans have refused to go along with massive, one-time cuts in spending, according to The Hill. Indeed, 56 House Republicans voted against a floor amendment to cut the agency\u2019s budget by 17 percent.\n\nSen.

Should the Fed hike again in March, following a hike in December, and signal two further hikes in 2017, it will surely attract Trump's ire.\n\nWall Street is unlikely to be pleased with a casting of the Federal Reserve as a political entity.

Rob Portman said, \"Jeff Sessions is a former colleague and a friend, but I think it would be best for him and for the country to recuse himself from the DOJ Russia probe.\u201d\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said it would be \"easier\" for all concerned if Sessions agreed to step back from the investigation. \"I think the trust of the American people -- you recuse yourself in these situations, yes.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/03/02", "title": "Trump Could Face His First Fiscal Crisis Over Raising the Debt Ceiling", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/02/Trump-Could-Face-His-First-Fiscal-Crisis-Over-Raising-Debt-Ceiling", "text": "President Trump had plenty to say Tuesday night before Congress about increased spending on defense, new infrastructure, a $23 billion wall along the southern border with Mexico and billions of dollars more for steep tax cuts \u2013 but nary a word about the looming $20 trillion national debt.\n\nAfter frequent references to the historic flow of government red ink throughout his campaign, Trump was stone silent yesterday on the challenges of slowing the growth of publicly held debt, which currently is on track to grow to 77 percent of the overall economy by 2025, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Lofty Vision of Renewal Comes with a Huge Price Tag\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty remarkable,\u201d said Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, an anti-deficit watchdog. \u201cHe should have at least teed up the problem and talked about the need for hard choices and bipartisan negotiations . . . and how he wants to put the nation in a better fiscal position.\u201d\n\nThere are any number of reasons Trump may have decided to duck the subject of the debt, including a reluctance to have to explain to conservatives his campaign pledge not to cut Social Security and Medicare, the two premier federal entitlements that are the primary drivers of the long-term debt.\n\nYet a debate over entitlements and the long term debt will be unavoidable this year, especially when the government begins bumping up against its limit on borrowing to cover revenue shortages and must raise the debt ceiling or suffer the consequences of a first-ever default by the Treasury.\n\nRaising the debt ceiling has always been a politically onerous task because neither party wants to be perceived by voters as accommodating runaway government spending. New debt ceiling authority almost always is decided in tandem with other major spending and tax disputes. And the party in power frequently must make concessions to the minority in order to corral enough votes to pass the debt ceiling legislation in the two chambers.\n\nRelated: Putting Trump\u2019s \u2018Historic\u2019 $54 Billion Military Spending Boost Into Context\n\nThe stakes couldn\u2019t be higher: Failure to raise the debt ceiling would do irreversible damage to the U.S. credit rating, trigger an uproar in U.S. and global markets, drive up the future cost of borrowing, postpone Social Security payments and tax returns, and force layoffs of non-essential government workers.\n\n\u201cIt would be the kind of damaging blow to the U.S. economy that might not be correctible for a decade,\u201d said Stan Collender, an authority on the federal budget and an economics blogger for Forbes. \u201cAfter 250 years of the U.S. history, making interest payments on the debt was never a question. It would now be something that was at least in the back of the minds of all U.S. creditors.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration had several near misses on raising the debt ceiling during its stormy relations with congressional Republicans. In August 2011, Standard & Poor\u2019s downgraded the government\u2019s Triple-A rating after Congress and the White House deadlocked for weeks over a budget deal, and the Treasury came within an eyelash of defaulting. It took the intervention of Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, two long-time friends, to save the day and avert an economic crisis.\n\nIn 2015, President Obama and Republican congressional leaders agreed to suspend the federal debt ceiling until March 15, 2017. After that date \u2013 barely two weeks from now \u2013 the Treasury will surpass its cumulative $20 trillion borrowing authority.\n\nAt that point, newly ensconced Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is expected to order \u201cemergency measures\u201d to effectively buy more time for the government to pay its creditors and cover revenue shortfalls to keep the government operating.\n\nRelated: Debt Ceiling: What Is It and Why Does It Matter?\n\nIn the past, those emergency maneuvers have included delaying the reinvestment of assets in the Federal Employees\u2019 Retirement System G-Fund, the Exchange Stabilization Fund and the civil service and postal retirement fund. By postponing those reinvestments, the Treasury slows the growth of its overall debt, or at least on paper.\n\nThose steps would likely enable the Treasury to continue making all payments until at least mid-August, but it's unclear what would happen beyond then, according to Shai Akabas, the director of fiscal policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center and an expert on the debt ceiling.\n\nThe Trump administration and GOP leaders have yet to reveal their strategy for averting a debt ceiling crisis this summer, and it\u2019s far from clear whether Senate and House Democrats will agree to cooperate or find ways to put up obstacles to increasing the Treasury\u2019s borrowing authority.\n\nTrump raised plenty of eyebrows during the campaign by lightly dismissing the importance of the debt ceiling. He suggested that if push came to shove, he would negotiate down the debt with the country\u2019s biggest creditors, who include China and Japan.\n\nFormer Rep. Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, the new director of the Office of Management and Budget, has long been a skeptic of the dangers of the Treasury defaulting on some of its debt.\n\nRelated: Mnuchin Says He Takes the Debt Ceiling More Seriously Than Trump\n\nHe said during his Senate confirmation hearing that while defaulting on America\u2019s debts would have grave worldwide economic consequences, \u201cI do not believe that breaching the debt ceiling will automatically or inevitably lead to that result.\u201d That\u2019s because Mulvaney and other conservatives contend that the government can \u201cprioritize\u201d its payments, with the biggest and most important creditor getting paid first while others would have to wait.\n\nHowever, Mnuchin, the former Goldman Sachs banker and billionaire hedge fund manager, doused the concerns of lawmakers that Trump and Mulvaney might play games with the debt during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee in January.\n\nIt was then that Mnuchin told Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) that he agreed \u201c100 percent\u201d that Trump must never again question America\u2019s willingness to stand by its debt obligation."}, {"date": "2017/03/02", "title": "Why Trump Won\u2019t Touch Entitlement Reform\u2026Yet", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/03/02/Why-Trump-Won-t-Touch-Entitlement-Reform-Yet", "text": "Will the White House bend to fiscal conservatives on entitlement reform? Their policy preferences say no, but their choices \u2013 and House Speaker Paul Ryan \u2013 hint at a yes \u2026 eventually. The crossed signals on this key issue portend a bumpy ride between now and the midterm elections.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump offered a clear answer about his goals when it came to the federal budget. He wanted more money for the military and homeland security, especially immigration enforcement, and less spending on most other domestic policy areas. Trump made clear that he had no interest in tinkering with Medicare and Social Security, retirement programs on which his working-class base have staked their own futures. In fact, Trump made that clear from the start of his presidential primary campaign in May 2015, in an interview with CBN News\u2019 David Brody.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s a First Draft of the GOP\u2019s Plan to Overhaul Social Security\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican,\u201d Trump declared, \u201cand I\u2019m not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid.\u201d Trump used that pledge to differentiate himself from the fiscally conservative GOP presidential field, all of whom cited the national debt and the coming crisis of tens of trillions in unfunded entitlement mandates as a need to act now. \u201cEvery other Republican\u2019s going to cut,\u201d Trump explained, \u201cand even if they wouldn\u2019t, they don\u2019t know what to do, because they don\u2019t know where the money is. I do.\u201d\n\nBrody pointed out on Monday that the new budget proposal from the White House, as well as remarks from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, shows that Trump plans to keep that promise. \u201cIndeed, in a newly published blueprint of the budget that is set to hit government agencies Monday,\u201d Brody writes, \u201cthere are no cuts at all to those programs.\u201d\n\nHowever, that message got muddied a bit on the same day. Newly confirmed budget director Mick Mulvaney, previously a fiscal conservative in the House of Representatives, briefed reporters on the White House budget proposal, emphasizing that it only contained \u201ctoplines\u201d for each agency and entirely focused on discretionary spending. \u201cSo you're not going to see anything in here that has to do with mandatory spending, entitlement reforms, tax policies, revenue projections, or the infrastructure plan,\u201d Mulvaney explained.\n\nRelated: Americans Are More Willing to Cut Social Security Than Once Thought\n\nAt the mention of entitlement reform, reporters pounced. \u201cWhy not address entitlements,\u201d one asked, \u201cwhich is the biggest driver of spending?\u201d When Mulvaney noted that \u201cskinny\u201d budget plans rarely addressed \u201clarger policy decisions,\u201d the reporter wondered whether \u201cdown the line, could we see some type of budget that deals with entitlements?\u201d\n\nPress secretary Sean Spicer had to shoot down the speculation later in the briefing, noting twice that Trump had promised to leave Medicare and Social Security alone. \u201cAnd so he\u2019s going to keep his word to the American people.\u201d\n\nPaul Ryan didn\u2019t quite buy it. In an interview Tuesday with Matt Lauer on NBC\u2019s Today show, Ryan said entitlement reform was inevitable \u2013 and Trump knows it. \u201cCan he balance the budget without it?\u201d Lauer asked. Ryan replied, \u201cWe have to reform them for the next generation,\u201d at which Lauer pressed, \u201cBut does the President agree with that?\u201d Ryan responded, \u201cI believe he does.\u201d\n\nAt the very least, someone\u2019s confused. And that confusion could set up false expectations that will only deepen some bitterness within the Republican coalition, unless all members of leadership get on the same page, and focus on what\u2019s possible rather than what isn\u2019t.\n\nRelated: Mnuchin Promises No Budget Cuts to Social Security and Medicare\n\nNothing has changed politically on this question since the election, except for the demonstration by Trump about the importance of sticking to his campaign pledges. A new Morning Consult/Politico poll shows almost 70% of voters acknowledging that Trump has either met or exceeded expectations on his campaign agenda in the first month.\n\nA majority (56/27) credit him with keeping his promises. Given the lack of personal popularity Trump has and the hostile media environment in which he works, the White House has to understand that this will be his most potent form of political capital. Backtracking on Medicare and Social Security would strip Trump of his only political cover \u2013 the votes of middle America.\n\nFurthermore, Democrats and their progressive base have already arrayed themselves into a \u201cresistance\u201d rather than an opposition. The numbers do not exist to pass meaningful entitlement reform, as Democrats have little incentive to work with Trump in any policy area, let alone one for which they routinely demagogue Republicans. Even if Paul Ryan doesn\u2019t recall the ads in which Democrats showed him pushing Grandma off a cliff in a wheelchair, Trump and his team will. A round of speculation after the election that merely suggested that Trump might be open to entitlement reform was enough for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to revive that campaign.\n\nEven if Trump agrees with Ryan, as the Speaker claimed in his interview with Lauer, that doesn\u2019t put entitlement reform on the table in this session. Mulvaney hinted, and Spicer made explicitly clear, that the Trump administration wants to focus on discretionary spending in its first budget plan. That part of the budget gives Trump wide latitude for cutting government; even if Congress appropriates funds, the White House does not have to spend all of it in each policy area. Fights over legislative turf have already begun to crop up, which should keep both sides of Capitol Hill busy for the next several months on more routine fiscal matters.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Economic Plan: Spend Like a Democrat, Regulate Like a Republican\n\nA focus on keeping campaign promises could boost entitlement reform in the longer run, though. Trump will get his first test with the electorate in the 2018 midterms. Traditionally, first-term presidents do poorly, but Republicans have a huge structural advantage in the Senate races, defending only eight of the 33 seats up for election.\n\nDemocrats have to defend ten seats in states Trump won in November, and Republicans could end up with a filibuster-proof majority in the next session of Congress. Success depends on Trump keeping that political capital in play by delivering on his 2016 campaign pledges.\n\nAfter that, combined with two years of efforts to reduce spending and debt through the discretionary process, may give Trump and Republicans an opportunity to pull everyone together for a serious effort and success at entitlement reform. Until then, the opening won\u2019t exist. Republicans might want to swallow hard and stop talking about it rather than miss the chance to get a lot more accomplished."}, {"date": "2017/03/01", "title": "A Plan to Drastically Cut EPA Staff and Programs Is on Trump\u2019s Desk", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/01/Plan-Drastically-Cut-EPA-Staff-and-Programs-Trump-s-Desk", "text": "The Office of Management and Budget has suggested deep cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s budget that would reduce its staff by one-fifth in the first year and eliminate dozens of programs, according to details of a document reviewed by The Washington Post.\n\nWhile White House officials have already indicated that they plan to increase defense spending at the expense of other discretionary funding, the new document spells out exactly how this new approach will affect long-standing federal programs that have a direct impact on Americans\u2019 everyday lives.\n\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s 2018 budget blueprint will prioritize rebuilding the military and making critical investments in the nation\u2019s security. It will also identify the savings and efficiencies needed to keep the nation on a responsible fiscal path,\u201d it reads. \u201cYour [funding] level highlights the trade-offs and choices inherent in pursuing these goals.\u201d\n\nAcknowledging that the steep cuts \u201cwill create many challenges,\u201d the document adds, \u201cit also can serve as catalyst for how the agency functions in the next 10 or 20 years or beyond.

Multiple individuals briefed on the plan confirmed the request by OMB, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe proposal also dictates cutting the agency\u2019s grants to states, including its air and water programs, by 30 percent, and eliminating 38 separate programs in their entirety. Programs designated for zero funding include grants to clean up brownfields, or abandoned industrial sites; the radon program; climate-change initiatives; and funding for native Alaskan villages.\n\nThe agency\u2019s Office of Research and Development could face a cut of up to 42 percent, according to an individual apprised of the administration\u2019s plans. The document eliminates funding altogether for the office\u2019s \u201ccontribution to the U.S. Global Change Research Program,\u201d a climate initiative that then-President George H.W. Bush launched in 1989.\n\nS. William Becker, executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies (NACAA), said in an email that the proposed cuts would devastate critical federal financial support for communities across the country.\n\n\u201cThese cuts, if enacted by Congress, will rip the heart and soul out of the national air pollution control program and jeopardize the health and welfare of tens of millions of people around the country,\u201d Becker said.\n\nCraig Kenworthy, who serves as executive director of the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency and co-president of NACAA, said in an interview that air officials across the United States would not be able to meet their statutory responsibilities if their funding were cut that deeply. He noted that the Benton Clean Air Agency in central Washington has five staff members responsible for duties including monitoring air quality, issuing permits and letting local farmers know when they can burn fields.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically saying to the local agencies, \u2018So you still have to meet all the federal requirements, and then you\u2019re going to lose a quarter to a third of your budgets,\u2019\u201d Kenworthy said, noting that he worries that environmental groups could sue them if they don\u2019t fulfill their legal responsibilities. \u201cI understand there may be some people in the new administration who may not like some of the current Clean Air Act requirements \u2026 but we still have to meet them.\u201d\n\nAny such cuts would have to be codified through the congressional appropriations process and would likely face resistance from some lawmakers. Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), who used to chair the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment and Related Agencies, said he did not think Congress would approve such a steep drop in funding.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not that much in the EPA, for crying out loud,\u201d Simpson said, noting that he and other Republicans had already reduced the agency\u2019s budget dramatically in recent years. \u201cBut if the goal is, we\u2019re going to cut 15,000 employees down to 2,000 \u2013 okay, why 2,000? Why not 2,700? Why not 1,500? You know?\u201d\n\nRep. Ken Calvert (R-Calif.), who succeeded Simpson as chair of the subcommittee, said he could not comment because he had not seen numbers come out of the White House. But he added, \u201cObviously, you can\u2019t pick up $54 billion out of EPA.\u201d\n\nJennifer Hing, a spokeswoman for the House Appropriations Committee, declined to comment Wednesday on the proposed EPA cuts but said in an email that the panel \u201cwill carefully look at the budget proposal once it is sent to Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Chairman strongly agrees that more investment in our national defense is needed and that all federal programs should be reviewed as to their worth and value,\u201d Hing added. \u201cAs always, the power of the purse lies with Congress, and any budget decisions will go through the regular budget and appropriations process.\u201d\n\nRep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), the top Democrat on the Interior appropriations subcommittee, said the proposal to cut the EPA\u2019s budget has gotten Americans\u2019 attention\n\n\u201cPeople are waking up to this,\u201d McCollum said, adding that she has expressed her concerns to Calvert but is unsure how much he will do to resist Trump\u2019s plans. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be up to him to get his caucus in line.\u201d\n\nRegardless of the final budget numbers, the instructions to EPA serve as a blueprint for how the new administration plans to delegate many responsibilities to the states even as it cuts the money they will receive from the federal government.\n\nIt tells the agency that it should get states \u201cto assume more active enforcement roles\u201d when it comes to enforcing federal environmental standards and it should curtail its compliance monitoring activities.\n\n\u201cEPA is to evaluate ways to reduce federal enforcement inspections while keeping a consistent and effective enforcement program,\u201d the document reads.\n\nThe EPA declined to comment on the budget proposal Wednesday. But newly confirmed EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who has been a longtime critic of the agency and has insisted that one of his top goals will be to roll back key Obama-era regulations, cautioned this week that the particulars of the budget remain in flux.\n\n\u201cI am concerned about the grants that have been targeted, particularly around water infrastructure, and those very important state revolving funds,\u201d Pruitt told the publication E&E News after Trump\u2019s address to Congress on Tuesday. \u201cThe importance is setting priorities as an agency and then allowing the budget to be formed around that. What\u2019s difficult, having only been there a week, is to have these kinds of recommendations made and then look at our priorities and say, \u2018You know what, we\u2019ve got to make sure that we look at these programs.\u2019\u201d\n\nPruitt said he already had spoken with OMB Director Mick Mulvaney about the agency\u2019s funding.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important for us is to educate OMB on what the priorities of the agency are, from water infrastructure to Superfund, providing some of those tangible benefits to our citizens,\u201d Pruitt said, \u201cwhile at the same time making sure that we reallocate, re-prioritize in our agency to do regulatory reform to get back within the bounds of Congress.\u201d\n\n[Pruitt to EPA employees: \u2018We don\u2019t have to choose\u2019 between jobs and the environment]\n\nIt is unclear whether Pruitt\u2019s appeal would produce any changes: The document states that any requests from agencies to increase or reallocate funds must be accompanied by budgetary offsets. Those could include \u201calternative funding cuts, balance cancellations or viable user fees.\u201d\n\nIt instructs agency officials to \u201cmake sure any appeal is consistent with campaigns or other policy statements.\u201d\n\nAgencies must submit any alternative budget proposals to OMB\u2019s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs by Friday, the document states, and OMB will convene a meeting April 15 to discuss the \u201cinitial draft of the workforce reduction plan.\u201d\n\nAs details of the blueprint emerged, environmental advocates and the EPA\u2019s most recent administrator criticized the White House proposal.\n\n\u201cThis budget is a fantasy if the administration believes it will preserve EPA\u2019s mission to protect public health,\u201d Gina McCarthy, who served as the agency\u2019s leader from 2013 through the end of the Obama administration, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cIt ignores the need to invest in science and to implement the law. It ignores the lessons of history that led to EPA\u2019s creation 46 years ago. And it ignores the American people calling for its continued support.\u201d\n\nAnother key area targeted for cuts is the EPA\u2019s enforcement and compliance division. The White House budget proposal outlines millions of dollars in budget reductions and says states should \u201cassume more active enforcement roles.\u201d\n\n\u201cBasically, the direction is to reduce enforcement, which is already pretty strained,\u201d said Eric Shaeffer, head of the Environmental Integrity Project, an advocacy group, and a former head of the EPA\u2019s Office of Regulatory Enforcement. He noted that the EPA already has shed about 2,000 positions since 2008. \u201cThe notion there\u2019s been this big buildup at EPA is just flat wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been bleeding positions for years.\u201d\n\nSchaeffer added that much of the enforcement responsibility already lies with states, but that state programs are often \u201cwoefully underfunded\u201d and often at the mercy of state politics and pressure from large companies who can fend off enforcement actions. He said having the EPA as a backup enforcer can give state officials leverage they wouldn\u2019t otherwise have. In addition, he said many states don\u2019t have criminal statutes for environmental crimes, so only the EPA could bring a criminal action. And federal enforcers are typically the only ones that take on cases against large polluters that operate across state lines.\n\nIn addition, the White House plan proposes slashes funding the massive Chesapeake Bay cleanup project from about $73 million annually to about $5 million in the next fiscal year.\n\nWill Baker, president of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said he doubts such drastic cuts would become a reality \u201cbecause the program is working so well.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got great bipartisan support,\u201d Baker said, noting that lawmakers from Virginia and Maryland recent wrote a letter detailing the program\u2019s success. \u201cWe think the Trump administration and the Pruitt EPA will want to take advantage of a program that\u2019s so successful, so non-controversial and that is really working.\u201d\n\nBaker, who pointed out that Pruitt also pledged to support the ongoing Chesapeake cleanup during his recent confirmation hearings, said the involvement of numerous states in the cleanup make the federal government\u2019s participation essential.\n\n\u201cThe EPA role in the cleanup of the Chesapeake is nothing less than fundamental,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just important, it\u2019s critical.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental justice advocates were particularly alarmed at the cuts they may face under the new administration. The document notes that it supports the idea of environmental justice, but it would eliminate that office within EPA and \u201cassumes any future EJ-specific policy work can be transferred to the Office of Policy.\u201d\n\nCheryl Johnson, executive director of the group People for Community Recovery in Chicago, noted that the part of the South Side where she and her neighbors live is known as \u201cthe toxic doughnut\u201d because it includes 200 leaking underground storage tanks and 50 landfills. The EPA program has given her group and others money to conduct technical assessments of the area\u2019s facilities and provide training to educate local residents, she said, and a place where they could appeal to force local polluters to come into compliance with federal standards.\n\n\u201cOh, my goodness, it would devastate a community like mine,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cEliminating the environment justice department is like putting us in a chamber, to be disposed of.\u201d\n\nMike DeBonis contributed to this report, which was originally published in The Washington Post.

In a recent post they explained the basics of national-level trade accounting and pointed out that for a country like the U.S., there are plenty of reasons to be thankful about a trade deficit, not alarmed.\n\n\u201c[A] trade deficit automatically implies that the country is saving less than it\u2019s investing,\u201d they point out.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Needs the Border Tax to Secure Across-the-Board Tax Reform\n\nOkay, that sounds bad on its face, but they continue, \u201cAnother way to understand this is that the rest of the world is investing in that country, thereby contributing to its production capacity.\u201d\n\nThey key element of the post is here: \u201cIs it bad to have a trade account deficit? If this means that your economy is booming and local production cannot keep up with demand, then no. If it implies that there is a current account deficit and, hence, foreigners are investing in your country, then also no. If this means that you can have more investment without having to save more, because the rest of the world is picking up the slack, no again. If you are worried that in the future dividends will flow abroad, then yes. But that will happen only if your economy is in good shape in the first place and will be able to afford paying such dividends.\u201d\n\nSo, as the president and Congress go back and forth over issues of trade policy, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that reducing the trade gap is not beneficial in and of itself, and in some cases, might actually be a net negative for the country."}, {"date": "2017/03/01", "title": "The Pentagon Is Going Green, With or Without Trump", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/01/Pentagon-Going-Green-or-Without-Trump", "text": "President Donald Trump and his top advisors have often scoffed at government support of green energy. His chief strategist called it \u201cmadness.\u201d\n\nBut the largest U.S. government agency - the Department of Defense - plans to forge ahead under the new administration with a decade-long effort to convert its fuel-hungry operations to renewable power, senior military officials told Reuters.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Shouldn\u2019t Give the Pentagon Another Dime\n\nThe reasons have nothing to do with the white-hot debate over climate change. In combat zones, green energy saves lives by, for instance, reducing the need for easily attacked convoys to deliver diesel fuel to generators at U.S. bases. Mobile solar-power units allow soldiers to prowl silently through enemy territory.\n\nAt sea, gas-electric hybrid battleships save fuel and allow for fewer stops \u2013 making them less vulnerable to attacks like the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000, when al-Qaeda militants killed 17 U.S. soldiers during a refueling stop in Yemen.\n\nThe military\u2019s zeal for renewable power has already had broad impacts on energy contractors, generating hundreds of millions in contracts for solar companies and helping to reduce fuel consumption by the world's largest single petroleum buyer.\n\nThe armed forces nearly doubled renewable power generation between 2011 and 2015, to 10,534 billion British thermal units, or enough to power about 286,000 average U.S. homes, according to a Department of Defense report.\n\nThe number of military renewable energy projects nearly tripled to 1,390 between 2011 and 2015, department data showed, with a number of utilities and solar companies benefiting. Many of those projects are at U.S. bases, where renewable energy allows the military to maintain its own independent source of power in case of a natural disaster or an attack - or cyber attack - that disables the public grid.\n\nThe White House did not respond to Reuters requests for comment on the military\u2019s use of green energy. Although Trump has blasted solar subsidies, vowed to boost fossil fuel development and questioned the science behind climate change, military leaders remain confident that the president won\u2019t halt their march toward renewable power.\n\nRelated: Putting Trump\u2019s \u2018Historic\u2019 $54 Billion Military Spending Boost Into Context\n\n\"We expect that it's going to continue during the Trump administration,\" said Lt. Col. Wayne Kinsel, head of the infrastructure unit of the Air Force Asset Management Division for Logistics, Engineering and Force Protection. \"It's really not political.\"\n\nOther senior officials in the Navy, Air Force and Army also told Reuters that they expected their renewable energy programs to continue.\n\nLt. Col. J.B. Brindle, a Defense Department spokesman, said the agency \"spends very little appropriated funding\" on renewable energy projects, but declined to give any figures or to answer additional questions about such efforts.\n\nTrump's Secretary of Defense, Jim Mattis, has long supported efforts to reduce troop dependence on petroleum. He saw first-hand the vulnerability of diesel convoys to attacks by militants while serving as Commander of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command in Afghanistan and Iraq in the early 2000s. As far back as 2003, he urged Navy researchers to find innovative ways to unleash the military from the \"tether of fuel.\"\n\nLAUNCHED BY A REPUBLICAN\n\nThe military's push into alternative energy started under Republican President George W. Bush in 2007, when he signed a law requiring the Pentagon to get 25 percent of the electricity for its buildings from renewable energy by 2025.\n\nThe effort accelerated under President Barack Obama, who required the Army, Air Force and Navy to each deploy 1 gigawatt of renewable power and directed the Army to open a lab developing energy technologies for combat vehicles.\n\nIn an apparent nod to Obama's efforts to curb global warming, the Pentagon also reported to Congress in 2015 that the droughts and floods caused by climate change pose a security threat \u2013 contributing to foreign political and economic instability that could require substantial troop deployments.\n\nFormer Defense Secretary Ash Carter said in his parting memo in January that the Navy has already met its goal, producing 1 gigawatt of electricity - while the other forces are on track to meet their targets.\n\nRelated: From Strip Clubs to Combat Ships, McCain Blasts $13 Billion in Pentagon Waste\n\nThe programs have their opponents. The conservative Heritage Foundation, for example, has railed against the military's support of renewable power and biofuels.\n\n\"The administration right now needs to focus specifically on combat power,\" said Rachel Zissimos, a Heritage researcher. \"Investing money on optional initiatives right now I think is problematic.\"\n\nHIGH STAKES FOR MILITARY SUPPLIERS\n\nSolar companies such as SunPower Corp and utilities including Sempra Energy and Southern have won utility-scale renewable energy contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years, according to the companies and Department of Defense documents reviewed by Reuters.\n\nSouthern, for example, has 11 solar projects totaling 310 megawatts on bases in states including Georgia and Alabama. In December, Sempra completed the 150-megawatt Mesquite Solar 3 in Arizona to provide about a third of the power needed at 14 Navy and Marine bases in California for 25 years.\n\nSunPower has already landed a major deal under the Trump administration - a $96 million contract finalized on Feb. 3 to provide power to Vandenberg Air Force base in California until 2043, according to a Pentagon database.\n\nSempra and Southern said they were committed to serving their customers but declined to comment on whether they were discussing new contracts with the military. SunPower did not comment.\n\nLast year, the Navy began outfitting Arleigh Burke destroyers with gas-electric hybrid engines developed by L3, which won a $119 million contract in 2013.\n\nTesla, which produces electric cars and batteries, is another company that analysts say could benefit from military contracts. A Tesla spokesman said the company is \"supportive\u201d of the military's interest in clean energy but declined comment on whether it was pursuing Defense Department contracts.\n\nThe U.S. military's use of oil, meanwhile, fell by more than 20 percent between 2007 and 2015. The bulk of the decline likely stems from declining combat operations rather than rising efficiency and use of renewable energy. But traditional military fuel suppliers - such as Exxon Mobil, BP, and Shell - nonetheless have a lot at stake if the military accelerates its move away from fossil fuels. (For a graphic on Pentagon's oil purchases click http://tmsnrt.rs/2laqCBJ)\n\nThe military\u2019s average annual oil bill was about $14.28 billion between 2007 and 2015.\n\nRelated: Conflicting Signals on How Trump Will Pay for His $54 Billion Military Buildup\n\nBP is constantly reviewing its marketing strategies to ensure growth, a spokesman said.\n\n\"As fuel slates change, we will adapt, and continue to provide our customers with the products they demand,\" he said in response to questions about the potential impact of the military\u2019s increased use of renewable fuels.\n\nSOLAR-POWERED SOLDIERS\n\nHauling fuel to the battlefield has been a hazard for militaries since at least World War I and continues to take a grim toll. One in nearly 40 fuel convoys in Iraq in 2007 resulted in a death or serious injury, according to a study commissioned by the Defense Department. In Afghanistan the same year, one in 24 fuel convoys suffered casualties.\n\nMarines in Afghanistan began carrying solar panels in 2009 to forward bases in battles with Taliban fighters. They used them to power batteries for communications, GPS and night-vision goggles. The panels not only reduced the need for convoys, they allowed marines to shut off generators, hushing operations and making them harder for enemies to detect.\n\nArotech subsidiary UEC has sold $25 million worth of the solar arrays and expects a bigger business in systems working with batteries and solar to slash dependence on generators, said business manager Nancy Straight.\n\nCol. Brian Magnuson, the head of the Marines' expeditionary energy office, established in 2009, said his office aims to replace diesel-powered generators on the battlefield with solar power, and to reduce energy use with efficiency measures such as insulated tents and the deployment of advanced batteries.\n\n\"These technologies are a way to become more effective in combat,\" Magnuson said. \"This is about war-fighting capability.\u201d (For a graphic on a boom in military green energy projects, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2mbWXrM)"}, {"date": "2017/03/01", "title": "Shootout Over the Army\u2019s New $580 Million Handgun", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/01/Shootout-Over-Army-s-New-580-Million-Handgun", "text": "Since the first Glock was designed and built by an Austrian curtain-rod manufacturer, Gaston Glock, in 1982, the sleek weapon has become the most popular handgun in America among both cops and criminals.

It has filed a protest with the General Accounting Office, contesting the awarding of the contract to Sig Sauer.\n\nThe basis for contesting the contract is not clear from the filing, but by law, the GAO has 100 days from a bid protest filing to render a decision on whether the procurement process was flawed, so a judgment is due by early June.\n\nRelated: The Army Is Developing Its Most Lethal Gun Yet\n\nThe attorney for Glock was not immediately available for comment.

There are actually two planes that share that designation. The VC-25A is a highly modified version of the Boeing 747-200B airliner. Even though it entered service in 1990 with President George H.W. Bush, the jets \u2014 tail numbers 28000 and 29000 \u2014 were ordered in the mid-1980s by President Ronald Reagan.\n\nAccording to Boeing, each aircraft carries a crew of 26 along with roughly 70 passengers including the president, government officials, Secret Service agents, and guests. The 4,000-square-foot space in the VC-25A's cabin allows the aircraft to function as a flying White House with the ability to run a country from 40,000 feet. At the same time, the 747-200B's General Electric CF6-50 series engines were replaced with the more powerful CF6-80 series engines from the newer 747-300.\n\nRelated: The Very Worst US Airline of 2017 \u2014 and the Best\n\nOther presidential upgrades include:\n\nMidair-refueling capability\n\nMissile-defense systems\n\nElectronic countermeasure defense systems\n\nAn operating room\n\nThe ability survive the electromagnetic pulse emitted from a nuclear detonation\n\nThe communications capabilities to manage a wartime crisis from anywhere in the world\n\nOn major trips, both VC-25As make the trip \u2014 one with the president aboard and the other acting as backup in case of an emergency.\n\nAccording to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by Judicial Watch, the VC-25A cost a whopping $206,000 an hour to operate during a 2014 trip to Los Angeles by President Barack Obama. According to the documents, this figure included fuel, flight consumables, and maintenance.\n\nThis far exceeds the $20,000 to $25,000 an hour it costs an airline to operate a commercial 747, Airways senior business analyst Vinay Bhaskara told Business Insider in an email.\n\nThe VC-25As are operated by the Presidential Airlift Group at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland and are part of the US Air Force's 89th Airlift Wing.\n\nOther travel costs\n\nThen there are the limos. Affectionately known as \"The Beast,\" the presidential limos are heavy-duty armored vehicles built on a General Motors commercial truck platform with a Cadillac body. These monsters feature everything from full-ballistic protection to an on-board cache of blood for the president in case of a medical emergency.\n\nAccording to Autoweek, each one of Obama's 12 Beast limos cost $1.5 million. Trump will get a new version of the Beast. It's unclear how much the new model will cost.\n\nOn trips, these limos travel ahead with the advance team so they are waiting for the president once his plane arrives. This means they have to be transported ahead of time in a fleet of Boeing C-17 Globemaster III cargo planes.\n\nAnd in instances in which the president is in a hurry, he has the option to bypass the Beast and go with Marine One, the call sign for the presidential helicopter. The helicopters \u2014 Sikorsky VH-3D Sea Kings or VH-60Ns or Boeing MV-22s \u2014 usually fly in a formation of three. These are operated by the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) in Quantico, Virginia.\n\nSo, there you have it. Why is it so expensive for the president to fly? It's the custom jumbo jet, the staff and crew needed to operate the planes, the limos needed to transport the president to and from the plane, the cargo plane needed to transport the limos, and the helicopters in case the president wants to skip the car ride.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Business Insider.

His demand comes as the pharmaceutical industry launches a public relations campaign aimed at reducing public anger and the threat of increased regulation.\n\nTrump, who once complained that the pharmaceutical industry is \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d by overcharging consumers and government agencies, said that his administration and Congress must \u201cwork to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Lofty Vision of Renewal Comes with a Huge Price Tag\n\nWhile Trump didn\u2019t provide specifics for what needs to be done, he and a number of lawmakers, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-MD), have floated some ideas. Those include speeding up the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of generic drugs to compete with costlier brand name drugs, lifting a ban on Medicare officials negotiating the price of drugs, and allowing the importation of cheaper drugs from Canada and other countries.\n\nPrescription drug prices have climbed at a double-digit rate in recent years and are projected to continue to rise at roughly that pace. Over the past two years, the pharmaceutical industry has been rocked by high-profile cases of drug companies raising their prices by as much as 5,000 percent for some life-saving drugs that have been on the market for years.\n\nLess than two weeks after taking office, Trump summoned the heads of many top drug manufacturers to the White House. Although Trump subsequently tempered his comments on drug industry pricing by focusing more on the need to step up price competition, he is under pressure from Sanders and other Democrats to make good on his campaign promises to halt price gouging and soaring prices.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and its well-paid lobbyists have vigorously fought most of the reform proposals that have been advanced by Trump and lawmakers. They have argued, for example, that importation of cheaper drugs could jeopardize public health and that Medicare already benefits from deep discounts and rebates offered by major drug companies.\n\nRelated: Trump Jolts the Pharmaceutical Industry with Vow to \u2018Bring Down Drug Prices\u2019\n\nWhile there\u2019s no indication that drug manufacturers intend to dramatically curb their price increases, some are mounting a charm offensive to try to polish their tarnished image.\n\nDrug companies that once treated information about their retail pricing practices and discounting like state secrets are scrambling to adopt new price transparency practices in an effort to overcome their reputation as price gougers. And many in the industry are striving to hold their average drug price increases to below 10 percent.\n\nThe latest company to step up to the plate is Johnson & Johnson, the prescription drug and medical supplies behemoth, which on Monday issued its first-ever public report on price increases for its prescription drugs. The company disclosed that the list price of its drugs rose on average by less than 10 percent a year over the past five years. What\u2019s more, the net price that the company received after granting discounts and paying fees to middlemen increased by just five percent or less per year, according to Johnson & Johnson.\n\nThose numbers might suggest a relatively prudent approach to marketing \u2013 and a far cry from Turing Pharmaceutical\u2019s 5,000 percent price hike for a 62-year old drug used in treating parasitic infections, or Mylan\u2019s 670 percent increase in price for a two-set pack of EpiPen allergy auto-injectors used to treat children suffering from violent reactions to bee stings and food allergies.\n\nYet Johnson & Johnson\u2019s drug price increases were still more than twice the U.S. rate of inflation, meaning that drug prices rose at a much faster clip than prices for food, clothing and other goods and services. Also, the company\u2019s disclosures were based on annual averages, which means that in many cases the company charged much steeper price increases for their drugs.\n\nRelated: How Big Pharma Lobbyists Keep Medicare Drug Prices High\n\nAt the same time that Johnson & Johnson went public with its price list, other major companies wary of a public and political backlash are intentionally holding their drug price increases to below 10 percent, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nFor example, Allergan\u2019s CEO, Brent Saunders, announced that his company would raise prices by two or three percentage points rather than the 7.4 percent average increase that the company set in January, at the start of a new marketing season.\n\nA more dramatic illustration of this trend came after Marathon Pharmaceuticals sparked an outcry two weeks ago by establishing an $89,000 a year starting price for a muscular-dystrophy treatment that has been on the market for decades and could be purchased abroad for $1,600. After lawmakers and other complained about the pending action, Marathon announced it was postponing the price hike.\n\nThroughout the industry, drug companies are more carefully calibrating their price increases to avoid drawing unwelcome attention and criticism, especially from Trump.\n\nA new analysis by the investment firm Raymond James & Associates found that drug manufacturers didn\u2019t raise list prices for as many of their drugs in January as they did the previous year, and that they initiated fewer increases of 10 percent or more. Just 5.5 percent of all the price hikes reached the 10 percent level last month, according to the report, compared with 15 percent that did so in 2016, and 20 percent two years ago.\n\n\u201cYou have to give credit to the government-relations departments of the major drug companies,\u201d said Joseph Antos, a health care expert with the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cThey read the newspaper.

That idea, along with another Obamacare feature allowing children to remain on their parents\u2019 health insurance policies until they turn age 26, have both been met with universal support on Capitol Hill.\n\nSecond, Trump said he favors granting tax credits to help consumers purchase health insurance policies of their choice, although he doesn\u2019t say what kind of credit. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and other House GOP leaders have pushed the idea of a refundable tax credit based on age, with older and wealthier Americans getting the lion\u2019s share of the benefit. However, many conservatives have opposed that approach, saying that it is too close to the current tax subsidy in Obamacare and that its adoption would create a new entitlement.\n\n\n\nRelated: Republicans Risk Passing New Health Bill by Defunding Planned Parenthood\n\nTrump also favors expanded tax-exempt Health Savings Accounts to help consumers cover some of their medical costs, but that\u2019s a no brainer and has become boilerplate for most of the replacement plans making the rounds.\n\nThird, Trump signaled support for changes in the Medicaid program to \u201cgive our great state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.\u201d This is an important point because Trump once said he would protect Medicaid, along with other entitlement programs, and now he is embracing an approach that likely would lead to converting Medicaid to state block grants.\n\nWhile the block grant or per capita payment approach would result in billions of dollars of savings to the federal government in years to come, it would likely force states to sharply reducing coverage and benefits to low-income Americans, which costs $6,833 per person annually, on average. The idea is highly controversial and has been strongly opposed by some Republican governors as well as the Democrats.\n\nRelated: A First for Obamacare: Majority of Americans Now Support It\n\nThe last three principles are proposals Trump campaigned on: Tort reform to protect doctors from excessive and costly litigation; more freedom for major insurance companies to sell policies across state lines and efforts to \u201cbring down the artificially high price of drugs.\u201d\n\nAs Politico reported, Republicans lack consensus on some of the most basic questions, such as \u201chow much to spend to reshape the health system, how much financial help to give Americans to buy insurance and how to come up with the money to pay for it all.\u201d\n\nTrump at one time boasted that he would repeal and replace Obamacare \u201csimultaneously\u201d shortly after he took office, but his repeated promises to unveil a comprehensive plan that would provide less expensive and better quality coverage than Obamacare have all fallen through. During his meeting with the National Governors Association at the White House on Monday, Trump acknowledged, \u201cNow, I have to tell you, it\u2019s an unbelievably complex subject.

For the next 30 years, young men were drafted unless they were deferred, like Trump, for attending college and having bad feet.\n\nIn 1968, 3,547,902 U.S. military personnel set a record. Today, the number of military personnel is 38 percent of that level, 1,354,054. But does the country need massive numbers of fighting forces when we drop bombs from planes that have no pilots? Do we need 20th-century weapons and hardware when the priorities are cyber security and high-tech weaponry?\n\nThe Budget Control Act of 2011, which specified $917 billion of cuts over 10 years and triggered the sequester, forced the Pentagon to choose between new technology and old war machinery. In an outright act of defiance, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus simply refused to include the $17 billion in cuts over five years ordered by his boss, Defense Secretary Ash Carter.\n\nMabus and peers know how to fight for their turf.

Here are 10 reasons to say no.\n\nThey Can't Balance Their Books?\n\n1. We have no idea how the Pentagon spent more than $8.5 trillion since 1996 because they still can't properly submit to an audit. Congress passed a law in 2009 requiring the Defense Department to be audited this year. But a Reuters investigation found that the Pentagon uses moribund accounting systems that are completely incompatible with modern accounting practices and computing. If you don\u2019t want anyone to see what you\u2019re doing, make sure they can\u2019t look.\n\n2. The Army needs remedial courses in basic math. The Army actually presented their books to the Inspector General last year for an audit. The result was not encouraging: The IG found $2.8 trillion of accounting mistakes and many missing receipts and invoices to support the figures.\n\n3. There is a backlog of more than half a trillion dollars in unaudited contracts with outside vendors \u2014 and nobody knows how much of that money paid for actual goods and services. The sloppiness of the Pentagon\u2019s procurement systems is such that almost anyone inside or outside could rip them off and they probably wouldn\u2019t know it.\n\nCooking the Books and Outright Fraud\n\n4. Looks like the Pentagon will lie or cheat to keep the money flowing. The Pentagon buried an internal study that exposed $125 billion in administrative waste in its business operations fearing Congress would use the findings as an excuse to slash the defense budget, according to a report in The Washington Post.\n\n5. Here\u2019s a doozy, again from the Reuters investigation: \u201cBookkeepers insert phony numbers in the U.S. Department of Defense\u2019s accounts. The secretary of defense's office and the heads of the military and Defense Finance and Accounting Service have for years knowingly signed off on false entries. \u2018I don't think they're lying and cheating and stealing necessarily, but it's not the right thing to do,\u2019 Pentagon Comptroller Robert Hale told Reuters. \u2018We've got to fix the processes, so we don't have to do that.\u2019\u201d Whoa\u2014so we don\u2019t have to do that?\n\nRelated: Conflicting Signals on How Trump Will Pay for His $54 Billion Military Buildup\n\nThat\u2019s Not My Job\n\n6. Who cares if we waste $33 billion? The Defense Department could save itself a cool $33 billion if Pentagon leaders took a firmer hand with wasteful programs and imposed some basic budget discipline, according to the Center for International Policy. Among the examples:\n\n$150 million for luxurious private villas for contractors in Afghanistan\n\n$720 million in late fees for leased shipping containers\n\n$468 million for C-27A transport aircraft in Afghanistan that had to be scrapped\n\n$857 million on excess parts and supplies\n\n$49 million on sports advertising\n\n$1 billion to get rid of $16 billion of outdated munitions, which may have been useable\n\n7. The Pentagon may be learning disabled. A yearlong ProPublica investigation into Afghanistan reconstruction that found a widespread failure to apply lessons from Iraq was in part to blame for upwards of $17 billion in waste. One of the best was a $43 million natural gas station that's unsafe to use.\n\nIncompetence\n\n8. The Pentagon sucks at missile systems: It spent $40 billion over a decade on the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) domestic missile defense system that has repeatedly failed the most rudimentary tests of its effectiveness in shooting enemy missiles out of the sky. A few years earlier, an investigation by the Los Angeles Times concluded that the $2.2 billion Sea Based X-Band Radar, which is responsible for spotting enemy missiles, doesn\u2019t work and is essentially nothing more than an enormous waste of tax dollars that has left the U.S. vulnerable to attack.\n\n9. The Pentagon doesn\u2019t know how to take inventory of its stores of weapons ammunitions and supplies. When they run out of anything, they simply buy more and keep stuff that even your grandfather wouldn\u2019t sell on eBay.\n\nThe Defense Budget Is Already Huge\n\n10.

He hit on the issues that animated both his campaign and the first days of his presidency: restricting immigration, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, funding a massive infrastructure program, and investing huge sums in a military buildup. At the same time, he failed to address many of the challenges the country faces on the world stage, including Russian aggression and the ongoing crises in Syria and across the Middle East.\n\nRelated: Putting Trump\u2019s \u2018Historic\u2019 $54 Billion Military Spending Boost Into Context\n\nTrump\u2019s performance earned immediate accolades from pundits accustomed to watching him deliver unscripted speeches in which he lurches from topic to topic, hurling epithets at his opponents and red meat to his base. CNN commentator Van Jones and Fox News host Chris Wallace, hardly ideological soulmates, independently proclaimed that with the speech Trump \u201cbecame president of the United States.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth pausing to consider just how far the bar has been lowered here. As presidential addresses go, this was not Lincoln\u2019s Second Inaugural or even FDR\u2019s first. For the most part, Trump delivered a workman-like recitation of the words on his teleprompter and avoided saying anything too outrageous. The rapturous reception seems to reflect as much surprise at his ability to behave like a president for the space of an hour as it does the reaction to the actual content of his remarks.\n\nAs many presidents have done before him, Trump populated the audience with guests meant to magnify the emotional punch of some parts of his remarks. In a particularly memorable moment, he drew attention to Carryn Owens, the widow of Navy SEAL William Ryan Owens, who died during a raid in Yemen six days into Trump\u2019s term.\n\nThe president has faced considerable criticism for the operation, which also took the lives of more than a dozen civilians. No senior terrorist figures were captured or killed in the raid, and there have been conflicting reports about the value of the intelligence that was gathered from it. And, in a sharp break from precedent, Trump suggested in an interview with Fox News that the responsibility for Owens\u2019 death lay with \u201cthe generals\u201d who devised the operation, not with him as commander-in-chief.\n\nRelated: Conflicting Signals on How Trump Will Pay for His $54 Billion Military Buildup\n\nHowever, Trump lingered on the subject for some time Tuesday night, leading a lengthy standing ovation for Mrs. Owens, and quoting Secretary of Defense James Mattis as saying, \u201cRyan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.\u201d\n\nDirecting his words to a weeping Mrs. Owens, he added, \u201cRyan's legacy is etched into eternity. Thank you. Ryan is looking down right now. You know that. And he is very happy because I think he just broke a record.\u201d The \u201crecord\u201d appeared to be a reference to the long round of applause.\n\nA recurring theme in Trump\u2019s remarks was a call to Democrats in Congress to come together with Republicans to pass some of Trump\u2019s legislative priorities. The opposition party, which has little formal power in the capital, has been resisting the confirmation of many of the president\u2019s cabinet appointees and has so far shown little appetite for compromise.\n\n\u201cEverything that is broken in our country can be fixed,\u201d Trump said. \u201cEvery problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope. Our citizens deserve this, and so much more \u2014 so why not join forces to finally get it done? On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the American people.\u201d\n\nRelated: There\u2019s Good News for Trump Buried in This New Poll\n\nAs he summed up, though, he seemed to belittle the concerns of the members of Congress who have opposed his agenda. \u201cThe time for small thinking is over.

The American people want tax reform. American companies want tax reform. Investors and markets want tax reform. Democrats? They don\u2019t want anything Mr. Trump wants. Period.\n\nThat\u2019s why policymakers, led by Paul Ryan, have settled on the border adjustment tax (BAT). It\u2019s the only way Republicans in Congress can overhaul our Byzantine tax system through the budget reconciliation process. And that cumbersome approach is the only path available to the GOP, given that they lack 60 votes in the Senate.\n\nRelated: Why Ryan\u2019s \u2018Border Adjustment\u2019 Import Tax Is So Controversial\n\nUnder reconciliation, the proposal must be revenue neutral over the ten-year budget window and thereafter. Since the evolving plan includes sharp reductions in personal and corporate rates, among many other changes, there is substantial lost revenue \u2013 and the only vehicle available to make that up is the border adjustment tax.\n\nThere are many proposed changes to both personal and corporate taxes in the plan coming out of the House. Here we focus on changing the way corporations are taxed, and on the merits of the border adjustment tax.\n\nLevying a new tax may seem complicated \u2013 this revamp after all is supposed to simplify our tax code \u2013 but compared to the 75,000 pages of our current tax rules, adopting the new approach would be like reading Dick and Jane after a semester of Ulysses. Numerous deductions disappear and the plan adopts territorial taxation, used by most other countries \u2013 which eliminates the unproductive stockpiling of earnings overseas. Most important, the corporate rate drops from 35% to 20%.\n\nWhat makes it all work is the 20% border adjustment tax, which raises more than a trillion dollars over a decade.\n\nPresident Trump has sent mixed signals about his support for the BAT, and there appears to be some division amongst his White House staff. Most recently Steve Bannon threw his considerable weight behind the plan, joining other influential figures like Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus.\n\nNational Economic Council director Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin are said to oppose the tax, but some feel these relative newcomers to tax minutia will soon realize that the scheme drafted by Paul Ryan and others is the only possible way to meet the criteria set out by Congress\u2019 own budget rules. Several groups have worked on tax policy for nearly a decade; if there were an easier approach, they would have found it.\n\nRelated: With Businesses Split on U.S. Border Tax, Wider Reform Looks Shaky\n\nFor instance, many might think that revenues lost to dropping the corporate rate could be recaptured simply by eliminating the numerous tax breaks that companies currently enjoy. Our stated tax rate for companies is 39.1 percent, compared to an OECD average of 24.1 percent, one of the highest in the world. Our effective corporate rate \u2013 what companies actually pay on average after taking advantage of various deductions \u2013 is 27.9 percent, also one of the highest globally.\n\nSo why would slicing the rate to 20 percent be so tough? The problem is that most companies pay the lower rate mainly because they earn so much money overseas. It\u2019s not because of depletion allowances or because of investment tax credits; it\u2019s because Apple, for instance, earns more than two-thirds of its income overseas and pays taxes on those earnings at very low rates. Further, like many large companies, Apple keeps its foreign-earned cash overseas. Our government has no authority under current law to tax overseas operations until the money is brought home.\n\nThe border adjustment tax is like the Value Added Tax employed by 167 countries around the world. The idea is to tax goods coming into the country but not those flowing out. In effect, our government would reward exporters and penalize importers. In Europe, in part to attract investment and encourage exports, governments have lowered corporate income tax rates in recent years but made up for lost revenues by hiking their VATs.\n\nAs a consequence, companies making goods domestically in Germany, for instance, pay a 15 percent corporate tax rate (local fees add substantially to the total) but the federal government recoups revenues lost to that low rate through a 19 percent VAT on all domestic sales. The 19 percent levy on goods sold overseas is refunded, giving German exporters a significant competitive advantage.\n\nRelated: CEOs of 16 U.S. Companies Urge Congress to Pass Border Tax\n\nThere are already companies lining up to endorse and also to oppose the border adjustment tax. A group called the American Made Coalition, which includes exporters like GE, Boeing, and Pfizer, are in favor of the measure while Americans for Affordable Products \u2013 retailers like Walmart and others that depend heavily on imports \u2013 are dead set against it. The latter group says prices will rise, hurting consumers and the economy.\n\nSome economists, like Martin Feldstein, argue that any consumer price hikes caused by a border tax will quickly be resolved through currency realignments. Thus, the cost to Americans of goods made overseas but paid for in dollars will drop. That connect-the-dots seems too theoretical, and the timing too uncertain, to boost confidence in the plan.\n\nIt is more likely that there will be perceived winners and losers, at least in the short run. Consequently, pushing the proposed plan will be a heavy lift for Republicans in Congress, especially with the likes of Elizabeth Warren screeching about how it is a gift to the billionaire class and a scourge to working people.\n\nBut Trump can turn that around and argue that the border tax will create jobs for working people \u2013 the kind who helped elect him. He has fractured the age-old alliance between labor and Democrats; last year he earned more union votes than any Republican since Reagan, by pushing a growth and jobs agenda. Trump needs to enlist union leaders to sell his tax overhaul to the country and to skeptical members of Congress.\n\nRelated: Walmart Warns That Trump's Tax Plan Could Hurt Consumers\n\nHe will ask Americans: are you willing to pay slightly more for your made-in-China t-shirts in order to put more people to work?

While it\u2019s just about 1.4 percent of the $3.9 trillion in federal spending for 2016, it represents a 9.2 percent increase above the $584 billion spent on defense last year. The request comes less than three months after The Washington Post reported that the Pentagon buried a proposal to cut $125 billion in wasteful administrative spending over five years. And as Slate\u2019s Fred Kaplan explains:\n\nThe wars we\u2019re fighting now don\u2019t require huge, expensive weapons systems. President Obama\u2019s last budget, which the Pentagon is spending now, allotted $7.5 billion for the war against ISIS, $6.7 billion for cyber defenses, and $1.2 billion for counterterrorist drone operations. Double all that, and you\u2019ve spent an extra $15.4 billion, less than one-third of Trump\u2019s increase.\n\nAs you can see in the Defense Department\u2019s topline budget chart below, the $54 billion increase would boost military spending back to where it was during the early years of the Obama presidency, before the caps imposed by sequestration. (Budget expert Stan Collender notes that those spending caps imposed under the 2011 Budget Control Act will be a legal obstacle to Trump\u2019s budget plans.)\n\nRelated: Trump's Military Buildup Makes Even His Generals Nervous\n\nOn the other hand, our defense budget is already far bigger than it was a decade ago, and nearly double what it was in 2001 \u2014 and that largely holds true even if you don\u2019t count the extra money allotted for \u201cOverseas Contingency Operations,\u201d the funds allocated separately that pay for our wars.\n\nCurrent dollars in billions.

Those are the biggest drivers of federal spending. Adding in interest on the federal debt takes leaves discretionary spending \u2014 on defense and everything else \u2014 at about 31 percent of federal spending. Since Trump has promised not to cut Social Security or Medicare, and will face pressure not to raise the deficit, boosting defense spending by $54 billion thus requires slashing spending by 12 percent in areas where there\u2019s relatively little left to cut \u2014 areas like infrastructure, scientific and medical research, environmental protection, foreign aid and others.\n\nRelated: A Military Buildup and Big Tax Cuts \u2014 Is the Debt Set to Soar Under Trump?\n\nHere\u2019s one other way to look at the $54 billion boost to the defense budget, provided by Statista: U.S. defense spending already dwarfs that of the rest of the world, and the annual increase would be roughly equal to the entire military expenditures of France ($51 billion in 2015), the U.K. ($55 billion in 2015) or Russia ($66 billion in 2015).\n\nYou will find more statistics at Statista"}, {"date": "2017/02/28", "title": "Your Guide to the Players in the Trump-Russia Investigation", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/28/Your-Guide-Players-Trump-Russia-Investigation", "text": "High profile Republicans, both in and out of office, are sounding increasingly serious about the need for an investigation that can put the rumors of contact and potential coordination between Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and the Russian government to rest -- or prove them true.\n\n\u201cWe need answers,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan said on NBC in an interview that aired Tuesday morning. \u201cWe need to make sure that nothing happened that shouldn't have happened as we go forward.\u201d\n\nRelated: Schumer: Trump\u2019s Address to Congress \u2018Less Important than Other Presidents\u2019\n\n\u201cBoth the House and the Senate intelligence committees are beginning their investigations right now.

He is alleged to have had several conversations with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. in the weeks after Trump was elected but before he took office. It has been alleged that he suggested that Russia not react to sanctions imposed by the Obama administration over apparent interference in the presidential election, because the sanctions might be eased or reversed by Trump. While the conversations themselves may have been legal, Flynn reportedly lied about them to senior White House officials and was subsequently fired.\n\nRelated: There\u2019s Good News for Trump Buried in This New Poll\n\nPaul Manafort\n\nAn attorney and the one-time head of the Trump campaign, Manafort is well known for his service to dictators and autocrats over the years.

Manafort has denied any contact with Russia during his time with the Trump campaign.\n\nCarter Page\n\nA minor figure in the Trump campaign, Page was mentioned early on as an adviser on foreign policy issues, but took a leave of absence after it was reported that he was under investigation for his contacts with a Russian political figure under U.S. sanctions. A graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and a former Marine, Page is the founder of Global Energy Capital, an investment firm focused on the oil and gas sector in Russia and Central Asia.

Pressed by the White House, CIA Director Mike Pompeo reportedly called reporters at the Times and The Washington Post to say reports about the investigation were incorrect, but provided no details.\n\nRelated: Trump's Military Buildup Makes Even His Generals Nervous\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes\n\nThe California congressman in charge of the Intelligence Committee is courting controversy by overseeing an investigation into the Trump campaign, because he himself was deeply involved in it. Nunes this week even suggested that there was really little need to investigate the Trump campaign and said he was actually more interested in finding out who has been leaking information to reporters. Paul Ryan\u2019s talk about the \u201cincreased scope\u201d of the committee\u2019s investigation, though, might signal a change in tack.\n\nSenate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr\n\nBurr, a Republican from North Carolina, also appears to have prejudiced himself somewhat this week by obliging the White House\u2019s request for officials to push back against the idea that the campaign had contact with Russia. Like Pompeo, he called reporters and denied that the stories about the investigation were accurate. Also like Pompeo, he offered no details. Burr has also appeared reluctant to support an aggressive inquiry into the issue by his committee, and reports that he had called reporters to prejudge its results have led many to question his ability to be impartial."}, {"date": "2017/02/28", "title": "At Least 20 States Are Fighting Battles Over Voting Restrictions", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/28/Least-20-States-Are-Fighting-Battles-Over-Voting-Restrictions", "text": "Amid President Donald Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claims of massive voter fraud in the 2016 election, bills have been introduced in at least 20 states that would make it more difficult for many people to vote.\n\nIn some states, such as Texas and Arkansas, lawmakers are responding to court rulings that struck down or scaled back earlier attempts to restrict voting. Bills in other states would make changes to early voting and registration deadlines.\n\nRelated: Why Are Republicans Making It Harder to Fight Voter Fraud?\n\nProponents of the legislation say the proposed limitations, such as requiring a photo ID and eliminating Election Day registration, are necessary to restore public confidence in the electoral system. They say the measures protect the integrity of the ballot box by confirming voters\u2019 identities and whether they are qualified to vote. In state legislatures the measures are backed mainly by Republicans, though polls show that most Democrats also support a photo ID requirement.\n\n\u201cConfidence has been eroded. Even if it\u2019s just anecdotal evidence, people are questioning whether the ballot is secure,\u201d said Arkansas state Rep. Mark Lowery, a Republican who is sponsoring a photo ID law there. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a lack of confidence in the election, it undermines confidence in democracy itself.\u201d\n\nBut critics point to a lack of evidence of voter fraud, and say the restrictions are unnecessary and unfairly discriminate against minorities and poor people, who may not have a birth certificate, passport or driver\u2019s license.\n\n\u201cMany of these laws are nothing new,\u201d said Danielle Lang with the Campaign Legal Center, which has sued over many restrictive state voting laws. \u201cBut there\u2019s a different message coming from this administration, and it\u2019s one that will embolden states.\u201d\n\nAccording to an analysis this month from the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, bills in 21 states would impose new restrictions on voting. At least twelve states are considering bills that would require a photo ID to vote, or expand existing ID requirements. Legislators in Texas and Virginia want to require proof of citizenship to register to vote, which would prevent unauthorized immigrants from casting ballots. Bills in Connecticut and Iowa, among others, would eliminate Election Day registration. Some states such as Colorado, Iowa and Texas are considering bills that would shorten the early voting period. Still others would limit who can collect and turn in ballots for other people.\n\nWith some of the proposals, lawmakers are attempting to modify laws that have been struck down or blunted in court, in hopes that they will be able to withstand judicial review.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s GOP Echo Chamber Amplifies His Claim About Voter Fraud\n\nIn Arkansas, for example, where a 2013 photo ID law was struck down by the courts, Lowery and other Republicans have introduced a bill that would expand the accepted forms of identification, such as a driver\u2019s license, to include student IDs and public assistance cards that have a photo.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t buy the argument that there would be a lot of people who don\u2019t have a photo ID,\u201d Lowery said, but broadening the accepted forms of ID will make it easier for people who do have trouble getting some types of ID.\n\nCritics who have challenged the laws before say the new attempts may not take care of the legal problems with the restrictions.\n\nJonathan Brater with the Brennan Center said that as courts reviewed voting laws over the last year, they often found that they were discriminatory \u2014 and that there was little evidence they were addressing real problems. The new laws, he said, \u201care going to face some of those same barriers in court.\u201d\n\nSince Election Day, Trump has repeatedly called the election \u201crigged\u201d and claimed, without evidence, that between 3 million and 5 million undocumented immigrants voted illegally.\n\nBut research has found in-person voter fraud to be extremely rare, as are cases of voting by people who aren\u2019t U.S. citizens. News reports following the 2016 election found nearly no cases of fraud. One recent study found that Hispanics are the most affected by voter ID laws, with turnout 7 percent lower for Hispanic voters in states with strict voter ID laws.\n\nTrying Again\n\nIn Texas, a 2011 law allowed people to vote only if they had one of seven approved forms of ID, including a driver\u2019s license, military ID or passport. But a ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blunted the law by allowing people who did not have one of the accepted IDs to vote as long as they filled out an affidavit first. A legal battle over whether the law was intended to discriminate against minorities is ongoing. A federal court in Texas is scheduled to hear arguments in the case this week.\n\nRelated: Trump's voter fraud probe could pave way for tougher voting rules\n\nMeanwhile, the state is considering a number of bills that would restrict access to voting.\n\nIn addition to bills requiring proof of citizenship to vote, the state is considering shortening its early voting period, limiting absentee voting, and changing its photo ID law. A bill introduced last week would allow those without a photo ID to present a utility bill or paycheck along with an affidavit. But it would impose harsh penalties \u2014 up to 10 years in prison \u2014 for people who use the alternatives when they do possess an ID.\n\nThe bill is designed to comply with the earlier U.S. Circuit Court ruling that said the state should offer free birth certificates and give people without IDs a way to cast a ballot.\n\nEzra Rosenberg with the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which has brought one of the cases against the law, said the bill addresses some of the court\u2019s concerns. But he said the harsh penalties for people who have an ID but instead use one of the alternatives could intimidate voters.\n\nIn Kansas, officials tried to require voters to prove their citizenship before their votes could be counted in state elections, something that wasn\u2019t required of people who registered to vote using the federal form or at a Department of Motor Vehicles office. A state court judge said Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a Republican, lacked the authority to require those voters to cast provisional ballots in state elections, and a federal court judge issued an injunction requiring Kansas to count the votes of all registered voters for the 2016 election.\n\nKobach\u2019s office has now asked for legislation to expand the power of the office, allowing them to set aside ballots cast in state and local elections until a voter can show proof of citizenship.\n\n\u201cThis bill does exactly that \u2014 what the state court judge says we did not have the authority to do,\u201d said Bryan Caskey, the deputy assistant secretary of state for elections.\n\nMicah Kubic, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, which has previously challenged Kobach\u2019s proof of citizenship requirement, said passing the legislation won\u2019t help the state withstand future court battles.\n\n\u201cState courts have ruled he does not have the authority under statute to do this, but if the Legislature gives him the authority under statute to do it, it doesn\u2019t mean constitutional issues get waived away,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: Trump says Pence will lead voter fraud panel\n\nIn Arkansas, legislators are considering a constitutional amendment that would require photo ID to vote after a similar 2013 law was struck down. The Arkansas Supreme Court said the law contradicted the state constitution by adding an additional requirement to vote without the necessary two-thirds vote of the Legislature. Arkansas lawmakers have the power to amend the voting rights and procedures section of their constitution without referring the changes to voters if approved by a two-thirds majority of each house.\n\nLowery said his proposal would avoid problems by requiring an ID to verify someone\u2019s voter registration rather than making it a prerequisite to vote.\n\n\u201cWe believe we have listened to the court,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve sought the two-thirds super majority, and we\u2019ve written the legislation in such a way that it only deals with verifying voter registration.\u201d\n\nLang said tailoring a law to deal with registration rather than voting is a \u201cdistinction without a difference\u201d because the law could still stop people from voting.\n\nRita Sklar, executive director of the ACLU of Arkansas, agreed. \u201cThe problem is they are doing the same thing over and over again when it\u2019s been shown that is has the effect of disenfranchising voters.\u201d\n\nLegislators are also still weighing a separate constitutional amendment requiring photo ID to vote. If approved, voters would settle the matter in the 2018 election.\n\nVarying Approaches\n\nThe number of states with photo ID laws and other restrictive voting laws has expanded considerably since a 2013 U.S. Supreme Court decision struck down a provision of the federal Voting Rights Act that required some states and counties, mainly in the South, to get the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s approval before changing election laws. Voters in 14 states faced new restrictions on voting in the 2016 election.\n\nThe photo ID bills proposed this year in a dozen states vary widely. In North Dakota, only a driver\u2019s license, a non-driver ID or a tribal ID would be acceptable. In other states, student IDs, concealed carry permits and military IDs could also be used.\n\nIn Iowa, Republican Secretary of State Paul Pate defended the state\u2019s elections as \u201cclean and fair\u201d after Trump claimed the system was rigged. He is now pushing a bill that would require ID to vote and would make voter ID cards without photos available to people who don\u2019t have photo ID. The bar codes on the IDs would allow the state to ensure that ballots are not cast in two places.\n\nMany of the other bills include strict photo ID requirements, which can be tough for people who lack the underlying documentation, such as a birth certificate, needed to get an ID. Some can\u2019t afford the costs of getting an official birth certificate or were born under circumstances in which they never had one. Such is the case for many Native Americans living in North Dakota.\n\nJoel West Williams with the Native American Rights Fund, which represents several Native Americans who are suing over two of the state\u2019s previous photo ID laws, said the requirements put people in a \u201cloop where you have to have an ID in order to get documents you need in order to get an ID.\u201d\n\nLike Texas, North Dakota is considering tweaks to its photo ID laws while they are still being challenged in court. A bill there would allow people to use a utility bill or government check to supplement IDs without addresses, something common among tribal IDs. But Williams said the changes likely wouldn\u2019t help Native Americans because many get mail at a P.O. box instead of their physical address.\n\nIn some states, such as Texas, lawmakers want to require proof of citizenship to vote.\n\n\u201cThe honor system is nice. It\u2019s quaint,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t do enough, said Texas state Sen. Van Taylor, a Republican whose bill would require linking the state\u2019s voter registration database with a Department of Public Safety database that has citizenship information for people with state IDs.\n\nHe points to the story of a Mexican woman brought to the U.S. as a child who was sentenced to eight years in prison after she registered to vote and later cast ballots in 2012 and 2014 as proof that noncitizens do vote in elections. The woman, who has previously voted Republican, said she was unaware she was not allowed to vote.\n\nTaylor\u2019s proposal would likely affect many of the same people affected by the state\u2019s photo ID law. And having a state-issued ID doesn\u2019t necessarily prove that someone is a citizen: there are more than 139,000 people with Texas IDs whose citizenship status is unknown to the state, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety.\n\n\u201cPoor people don\u2019t have passports,\u201d said James Harrington, founder of the Texas Civil Rights Project, which pushes to expand voting rights. He said requiring proof of citizenship is not purely partisan, but will likely impact Hispanics. \u201cIt\u2019s targeted at preventing the inevitable demographic change of control of the state \u2026 people who represent Hispanic interests are going to be quite different from the people who are in power now.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared on Stateline.

Ryan, meanwhile, told reporters outside the White House that \u201cWe\u2019re going to give people choice and freedom, and that\u2019s what a patient-centered health care system does.\u201d\n\nRyan, a former House Budget Committee chair and policy wonk, has taken the lead in designing a GOP replacement plan that would repeal most of the ACA\u2019s mandates, income-based tax subsidies and business and personal tax increases necessary to finance the program. He would replace them with a more market-oriented approach, including refundable, age-based tax credits to help cover premiums that would provide more assistance to older, wealthier Americans than younger, poorer consumers.\n\nRelated: Republicans Risk Passing New Health Bill by Defunding Planned Parenthood\n\nRyan\u2019s plan would also encourage the use of tax-exempt medical savings accounts, provide older, sicker people with coverage through state-operated \u201chigh risk pools\u201d and gradually phase out expanded Medicaid coverage for low-income people. It would also convert the traditional Medicaid program for 74 million low income people to block grants to the states to help control costs and limit the availability of coverage.\n\nHowever, Ryan\u2019s plan is just one of many circulating on Capitol Hill and at the White House. And as time begins to run out for the Republicans to pull together and pass an approach that garners widespread support within the party, Trump spent part of the weekend conferring with Republican governors John Kasich of Ohio, Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Rick Scott of Florida on various alternative plans they have been promoting.\n\nKasich has proposed scaling back but not repealing some of the ACA\u2019s more generous benefits -- including reducing the number services that insurers must provide in individual policies and tightening eligibility requirements. But like many of the other Republican governors whose states opted for expanded Medicaid, Kasich doesn\u2019t want to see his constituents lose those hard-won and vital benefits.\n\nRelated: A First for Obamacare: Majority of Americans Now Support It\n\nBy yesterday, the president voiced surprise at how difficult and complicated it is to draft a new health care plan \u2013 something former President Barack Obama and a Democratic majority spent the better part of two years trying to do before Congress passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010 \u2013 without the help of a single Republican.\n\n\u201cNobody knew that health care could be so complicated,\u201d Trump said yesterday. He once again ruminated on how much easier it would be if he and the Republicans simply stepped back and allowed the ACA to collapse of its own weight, instead of rolling up their sleeves and jumping into the fray. In that way, he said, the Democrats would have to take all the blame while he and the Republicans could escape political responsibility in the 2018 mid-term election.\n\n\"Let it be a disaster, because we can blame that on the Dems that are in our room -- and we can blame that on the Democrats and President Obama,\" Trump said in remarks to the National Governors Association. \"But we have to do what's right, because Obamacare is a failed disaster.\"\n\nTrump and the Republicans have a lot riding on success in passing budget reconciliation legislation that repeals major portions of Obamacare and replaces it with GOP-designed alternative within the next month or so \u2013 well past their original Jan. 27 deadline for pulling the legislation together. Trump on several different occasions told reporters that his administration was within days of unveiling replacement legislation that would simultaneously repeal and replace Obamacare, but each time the deadline slipped by.\n\nRelated: Boehner \u2018Started Laughing\u2019 When Republicans Vowed to Replace Obamacare\n\nIn a sign of the Republicans mounting desperation, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Republican leaders have concluded their best chance is to \u201cset a bill in motion\u201d and then gamble that rank and file members will conclude they have no choice but to support it. This \u201cnow or never\u201d approach to force GOP lawmakers into line has been tried in the past by Democratic and Republican leaders with mixed success.\n\nIf they prevail in repealing Obamacare, then the Republicans will be on a roll, and some Democrats may have no choice but to join with them to fine tune replacement legislation that would do the least damage to their constituents. Refusing to join in would invariably mark their party as naysayers unwilling to address what most observers agree are serious flaws in the health insurance program.\n\nBut if they gamble and lose, Trump and the Republicans would suffer a humiliating setback that would be hard to explain away to their political base, after the Republicans gained control of the White House and both chambers of Congress.\n\nBecause Republicans hold a narrow 52 to 48 seat majority in the Senate, it would take the defection of just three moderate Republicans to block legislation dismantling Obamacare from passing, even under special budget reconciliation rules Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Ryan intend to use in both chambers to prevent a Democratic filibuster.\n\nAlready, a few Republicans including Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Bob Corker of Tennessee and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana have raised strong objections to some of the leading GOP replacement proposals, especially those that would phase out expanded Medicaid coverage in 31 states and the District of Columbia or cut funding for Planned Parenthood \u2013 which would be called for in Ryan\u2019s plan.\n\nPelosi and the Democrats would have a much steeper climb in trying to block the repeal of Obamacare in the House, where the Republicans hold a 247 to 188 seat advantage and GOP lawmakers for years have been promoting legislation to kill the healthcare program. However, the House Republican caucus is badly divided over how to proceed.\n\nFor one things, many of the 35 members of the arch conservative Freedom Caucus are demanding a complete repeal of Obamacare, expanded Medicaid and the taxes used to fund the program as the price for their support. But others are determined to preserve expanded Medicaid for low income people in their districts as well as some of the other more popular features of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate the power of Medicaid,\u201d Pelosi said in assessing the Democrats\u2019 chances of blocking action in the House."}, {"date": "2017/02/28", "title": "How Democrats Can Un-Rig the Party and Start Winning Again", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/02/28/How-Democrats-Can-Un-Rig-Party-and-Start-Winning-Again", "text": "Former Labor Secretary Tom Perez was elected as Democratic National Committee chair over the weekend after remnants of the Obama coalition, frightened by Keith Ellison\u2019s strident progressivism, mounted a campaign to stop his ascendancy. This has led leftists already burned by the Bernie Sanders-Hillary Clinton wars to renew cries that the Democratic Party is rigged for the establishment and its continued love affair with special interests. (The fact that the DNC voted down a ban on accepting corporate money moments before electing Perez doesn\u2019t mollify these sentiments.)\n\nI know Perez to be a progressive yet loyal soldier of the Obama years who did a lot of great work at the Labor Department within an acceptable range that didn\u2019t include radical challenges to financial power. And the willingness of Perez\u2019s backers \u2014 led by President Obama \u2014 to threaten party unity to keep Ellison out of the chair is a sad commentary. The obviously pre-arranged olive branch, with Perez appointing Ellison as deputy chair, could paper over these divisions, and the very presence of President Donald Trump certainly will, in the near term.\n\nRelated: How Trump Could Spark a New GOP Split \u2013 or Maybe a Love Fest\n\nIf we want to talk about rigging elections, though, we shouldn\u2019t look at the DNC. Its role is mostly irrelevant in that regard; it\u2019s a party-building and fundraising organization. Other groups within the Democratic Party do dominate elections, bringing a rigid, stale sensibility to the issue of who can represent the leftward pole in our politics. And those organizations more credibly steer the debate Sanders fans are waging over how to change the country.\n\nI\u2019m talking mainly about the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), the campaign arm for Democrats within the House of Representatives now chaired by Rep. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico. For decades now, no matter who has led it, the DCCC has been run on the principle that only a certain type of Democrat can win a House race. It anoints candidates well in advance of any election, gets involved in primaries, favors candidates with money and endorsements and discourages donors from giving to candidates they don\u2019t like. Unlike in a high-profile presidential campaign, this preferential treatment can absolutely make the difference in who represents the party in House races.\n\nThis is all done largely out in the open. It\u2019s called \u201ccandidate recruitment\u201d and \u201celectoral strategy.\u201d Read the archives of Howie Klein\u2019s indispensable Down With Tyranny blog and you\u2019ll see this play out in election cycle after cycle. His chronicle of how Democrats have misfired consistently in Republican Darrell Issa\u2019s California House district, which has been winnable for years, is a good primer.\n\nRelated: Key Question for Dems \u2014 Is the New Boss the Same as the Old Boss?\n\nThe strategy comes with fairly clear and open biases. To be seen as an attractive candidate by the campaign committees, one major attribute \u2014 maybe the biggest \u2014 is whether you are rich enough to self-fund the campaign, or have enough rich friends who can bankroll it for you. While not necessarily an ideological tactic, the life experience and worldview of a self-funding politician necessarily differs from a teacher or ironworker or community activist. There\u2019s a comfort with power that goes along with wealth, a mindshare that is hard to overcome.\n\nNext, it\u2019s seen as critical that you \u201cfit\u201d the district, based on a largely arbitrary left-right continuum. Fitting the district does not necessarily equal speaking to a district\u2019s concerns, like a farm community dominated by agribusiness or a small business sector that cannot compete with big box stores. The local issues of local people are not part of the equation. It\u2019s more about the candidate choosing from a grab-bag menu of \u201cmoderate\u201d positions at odds with the Democratic platform, to prove some manner of independence.\n\nOther facts are less central to the DCCC\u2019s thinking: backing core Democratic values, for example, or pre-existing support within the district or having lived in the district a long time (or ever). The DCCC consistently airlifts in its own candidates, big-footing the ones locals have endorsed but whom the Party has determined cannot win for whatever reason.\n\nRelated: Why Republicans Have Everything to Gain by Impeaching Trump\n\nThese strategies play to the biases of consultants with their own set ideas about elections, which not coincidentally involve lots of advertising placement on which they make commissions. If they had a track record of success, maybe you could grudgingly overlook the inherent lean in their worldview. But this is the crew that oversaw the 2010 and 2014 electoral disasters, without using the more favorable 2012 and 2016 political environments to pick up many seats at all.\n\nLast November, Hillary Clinton won 23 House districts that Republicans still hold; in Pete Sessions\u2019 32nd district of Texas, Democrats didn\u2019t even field a candidate. Stories of the DCCC ignoring seats where a candidate might have been successful are legion. The DCCC has even been slow to organize in the special election in Georgia to replace Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, a district Trump barely won, though they\u2019ve now paid for a handful of staffers there.\n\nThere\u2019s an argument to make that the technical competence of the DCCC and its Senate counterpart, the DSCC, matters less than the national political environment come election time. Democratic dominance in a special election this weekend that decided control of the Delaware State Senate testifies to that. Newly energized activists wanting to stick it to Donald Trump can overcome the DCCC\u2019s foibles.\n\nRelated: A First for Obamacare \u2014 Majority of Americans Now Support It\n\nBut that means the work of the party committees matters even more. If a wave of anti-Trump sentiment can lift Democrats to victory, having candidates who are actually willing to tackle the nation\u2019s biggest challenges is paramount. If, as in the Great Recession election of 2008, for example, anyone with a D in front of their name is poised to win, progressives must make sure that D doesn\u2019t go to just anyone, but those who will do something meaningful with the privilege.\n\nWe have an uneasy concentration of wealth and power that has threatened liberty and democracy. The economy works for a narrow band of elites, not the broad class of citizens. A party of the left must represent those who want to counteract that, or else the governing debates when elections end will be nothing more than a sideshow, patches on a fraying system where Big Money wins regardless of the outcome.\n\nThere are small signs that the DCCC is becoming more responsive to the grassroots. Activists have grown restless with an ossified House leadership that isn\u2019t making room for younger and more ideological members. State and local Democratic parties are being overrun with new energy and recruits. There is actual hope that a movement of engaged citizens can turn the Party around.\n\nBut it requires paying attention to the real choke points in Democratic politics, of which the DCCC is among the worst. Who sits in Congress when the next Democratic president speaks before a joint session will determine the success of their agenda. The time to build a coalition that will really address what\u2019s held back our democracy begins today."}, {"date": "2017/02/28", "title": "Trump\u2019s Big Naval Buildup Could Cost $750 Billion Over 30 Years", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/28/Trump-s-Big-Naval-Buildup-Could-Cost-750-Billion-Over-30-Years", "text": "Realizing President Trump\u2019s goal of vastly strengthening America\u2019s naval might won\u2019t come cheap, and there are already signs that it is setting off an arms race on the high seas with an increasingly wary China.\n\nA just-released report by the nonpartisan General Accounting Office (GAO) on the Navy\u2019s shipbuilding plans for the near future and the next 30 years estimates that raising the number of combat-ready vessels from the current 272 to \u201ca fleet of 308 battle force ships\u201d would cost a total of $566 billion dollars \u2013 or an average of $18.9 billion a year in 2016 dollars.\n\nRelated: The US Navy\u2019s $13 Billion Answer to China and Russia\n\nThe CBO says that is \u201c36 percent more than the historical average of $13.9 billion (in 2016 dollars) in annual funding for new-ship construction.\u201d\n\nBut Trump has said he wants a much larger number of combat vessels \u2013 as many as 350 ships \u2013 and a Navy \u201cforce assessment\u201d released last December calls for a fleet of 355.

Navarro, an economist with strong academic credentials but views that are well outside the mainstream of thought on trade policy, is the author of the book Death by China, which describes what Navarro sees as a slow strangulation of the U.S. economy by Chinese trade policy.\n\nRelated: Trump Has No South China Sea Strategy \u2014 and Needs One Fast\n\nLike some other trade hawks, Navarro has been among the critics of the WTO who see the dispute resolution system as sclerotic and biased toward Chinese interests.\n\nLast year Navarro and incoming Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross co-wrote a white paper that touched on the way U.S. goods are taxed by other countries and seemed to suggest that the U.S. ought to threaten to leave the WTO entirely.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump understands that the only way to correct this unfair tax treatment is for the US to use its status as the world\u2019s largest economy, the world\u2019s largest consumer, and the world\u2019s largest importer to put pressure on the WTO to change this unequal treatment,\u201d Navarro and Ross write. \u201cWithout the US as a member, there would not be much purpose to the WTO, but prior occupants in the White House have been unwilling to lead on this issue despite its significant negative impacts.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/02/27", "title": "How States Are Pushing Back Against Sneaky Automatic Renewals in Consumer Contracts", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/27/How-States-Are-Pushing-Back-Against-Sneaky-Automatic-Renewals-Consumer-Contracts", "text": "Ever sign up for a magazine or maintenance service and then get surprised by a renewal charge that pops up on your credit card bill months later? Have you gotten frustrated when you can\u2019t figure out how to cancel, or it\u2019s too late to avoid the charges?\n\nIt\u2019s called automatic renewal, and the practice increasingly is showing up in consumer contracts for all sorts of services and products, from home appliance maintenance and health club memberships to internet security software and subscriptions.\n\nRelated: How Much More Your Mortgage Could Cost as Interest Rates Rise\n\nDriven by consumer complaints, a growing number of states are stepping in to restrict the practice by requiring businesses to disclose their auto-renewal policies clearly and conspicuously up front, get customers\u2019 express consent to renew before charging them, or give notice in writing about how to opt out before the cancellation deadline passes and they get charged for renewal.\n\nAt least 22 states impose requirements on some types of automatic contract renewals. And this year, legislation that would restrict their use has been introduced in at least eight states, including Kansas, Minnesota and Wyoming.\n\nThe laws vary. In some states, such as California and Oregon, they apply to most consumer contracts. They not only have specific disclosure requirements and cancellation notice instructions, but they also require companies to provide customers with easy ways of canceling, such as toll-free phone numbers and email addresses. In other states, such as New Hampshire and Arkansas, the laws target only specific types of businesses, such as health clubs or home security companies.\n\n\u201cBut their main goal is to make sure consumers are informed before they sign the contract and are aware of the terms and what it takes to stop the renewal down the road,\u201d said Heather Morton, a legislative analyst for the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nAdvocates for the requirements say they protect customers from unwittingly entering into self-perpetuating agreements and then getting stuck paying for something they don\u2019t want.\n\nNew Jersey Assemblyman Daniel Benson calls auto-renewals \u201czombie contracts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey seem to never die. You see those charges and try to cancel, but you\u2019re too late and it keeps repeating itself,\u201d said Benson, a Democrat who for years has tried to pass an auto-renewal bill in his state and is sponsoring one again this year.\n\nBusinesses that oppose restrictions on auto-renewals, including cellphone and home security companies, direct marketers and magazine publishers, say they are unnecessary and burdensome. And, they say, the requirements can be a pain for customers who want seamless services without the hassle of frequently renewing contracts online or by mail.\n\nRelated: Millennials Aren\u2019t Going Cashless -- but the End of Cash Is Coming\n\n\u201cWe are extremely customer-friendly and we do self-regulate,\u201d said Rita Cohen, a senior vice president for MPA - the Association of Magazine Media, a trade association that has opposed auto-renewal bills in a number of states. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for overly restrictive legislation.\u201d\n\nCohen says auto-renewals are \u201cextremely valuable\u201d to consumers and magazine publishers because they ensure customers\u2019 subscriptions aren\u2019t interrupted. Creating state-by-state requirements makes compliance difficult for her industry, which does national promotions, she said. It\u2019s also costly for publishers to have to continuously produce renewal notices.\n\nNew York Democratic Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz, who sponsored bills to restrict auto-renewals in previous sessions and is trying again this year, said the restrictions would not be a big burden for companies \u2014 but any burden should be on them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to do anything to hurt these businesses,\u201d Dinowitz said. \u201cBut I believe the onus shouldn\u2019t be on the consumer to say no, but on the company to convince the consumer to renew.\u201d\n\nConsumer Complaints\n\nConsumer advocates say auto-renewals, also called \u201cevergreen clauses,\u201d aren\u2019t bad in and of themselves because some customers prefer them out of convenience. But often, they say, contract language about auto-renewals is buried in the fine print. Consumers don\u2019t explicitly give their permission before the contract is renewed and learn of a renewal only when they see a charge on their credit card statement. By then, it may be too late to cancel.\n\nRelated: Spend or Save Your Tax Refund? Here\u2019s What Most People Are Doing This Year\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very lucrative way of getting money out of consumers\u2019 pockets without them actually being aware of it,\u201d said Sally Greenberg, executive director of the National Consumers League.\n\nLila McKinley, an attorney for Connecticut\u2019s Department of Consumer Protection, said her state has a law restricting auto-renewals, but her office still gets complaints about them. Some consumers say that the language can be hard to find in contracts or that when they dial a number to cancel, \u201cthey can\u2019t get in touch with a real, live person,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother problem, consumer advocates say, arises when customers sign up for a \u201cfree trial\u201d and forget about it, or don\u2019t realize they\u2019ll automatically keep getting charged after the trial period ends.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lured by a free sample or reduced rates initially, whether for a service or a product. That\u2019s the reason the consumer takes the bait,\u201d said Richard Holober, executive director of the Consumer Federation of California. \u201cThen the burden is on the consumer to figure out how to get out of it. The company, in a few months, has made its profit on a transaction that hasn\u2019t been honest and up front.\u201d\n\nMany industry officials say they already have a code of conduct when it comes to dealing with customers so new regulations are overkill.\n\nIn a memo opposing a New York bill last year, CTIA, the wireless communications industry\u2019s trade association, wrote that its nationwide code, which requires carriers to disclose contract details at the time of sale, has helped consumers make informed decisions. It warned that passing restrictions in New York could limit consumers\u2019 choice because they would threaten national regulations that allow companies to offer consumers greater wireless access at a lower cost. A patchwork of state regulations could limit consumers\u2019 choices and increase their costs.\n\nThe Data and Marketing Association, formerly the Direct Marketing Association, another trade group that opposed the New York bill, said marketers should clearly disclose the terms and conditions of a contract and get clear, informed consent from consumers before auto-renewal billing.\n\nBut the group called the proposed restrictions unnecessary and costly, and said they would be \u201cignored by bad actors.\u201d The bill included up-front disclosure requirements and cancellation notice instructions. It also had a provision that if a business continued providing a product to a consumer without getting his consent under an auto-renewal agreement, it would be treated as an \u201cunconditional gift.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Next Financial Bubble? Auto Loans Soar as Delinquencies Rise\n\nCourt Battles\n\nThe controversy over auto-renewal provisions hasn\u2019t just played out in legislative chambers. It\u2019s also moved to the courts.\n\nA number of companies have been sued over their policies by state attorneys general or in class-action lawsuits brought by consumers.\n\nIn 2014, Sirius XM Radio agreed to a $3.8 million settlement with attorneys general from 45 states and the District of Columbia for allegedly using misleading advertising and billing practices, including auto-renewals without customers\u2019 consent.\n\nIn 2015, LifeLock, an identity theft protection company, reached a $2.5 million settlement in a class-action lawsuit that alleged its auto-renewal practices violated California\u2019s consumer protection law.\n\nAnd last year, McAfee agreed to pay up to $80 million in two class-action lawsuits alleging the security software company had automatically renewed customers\u2019 subscriptions at a higher price than promised.\n\nAll three companies denied the allegations in the lawsuits and did not admit fault.\n\nWhile those cases involved large companies that do business nationwide, squabbles over evergreen clauses also can be very local.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had complaints about everything from contracts with heating and air conditioning companies to people who run lawn services to exterminators,\u201d said Pennsylvania state Rep. Thomas Murt, a Republican who co-sponsored a bill in the 2015-16 legislative session to restrict the use of the clauses. The bill died in committee, but he plans to reintroduce it this year.\n\nMurt said the requirements that he seeks to impose on businesses would be \u201cpretty milquetoast.\u201d He wants any auto-renewal clauses in contracts to be in big, bold print and for companies to notify consumers about renewals 30 to 60 days beforehand so they can cancel.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how what we\u2019re trying to do is an unfair burden on any business owner,\u201d Murt said. \u201cWe are defending the honor of consumers here.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared on Stateline.

They quoted another general, John Hyten, head of the U.S. Strategic Command (guardian of the nuclear arsenal), who has said that \u201cthere is no such thing as a war in space, there is just war, it\u2019s with an adversary and if it extends into space we have to figure out how to fight it.\u201d\n\nAs if on cue, the global military information site IHS Jane\u2019s 360 reported late last week that Russia plans to arm some of its MiG-31BM interceptor aircraft with anti-satellite weapons. \u201cA new missile is being developed for this aircraft capable of destroying targets in near-space,\" a Russian Aerospace Forces squadron commander said on Zvezda TV, a channel run by the Russian Defense Ministry, according to Jane\u2019s.\n\nOne major reason that defending satellites and space-based systems has become so imperative is that the Air Force is relying more and more on attack drones, which are controlled from afar through satellite links.

The proposals he puts forward will force many in Washington, including Trump himself, to confront some uncomfortable realities.\n\nAccording to news reports over the weekend, primarily from The New York Times, Trump is planning to propose a major increase to the Defense Department\u2019s budget, in line with his promise last week to oversee \u201cone of the greatest military buildups in American history.\u201d\n\nRelated: A Military Buildup and Big Tax Cuts: Is the Debt Set to Soar Under Trump?\n\nThe decision to greatly increase the Pentagon\u2019s budget means one of three things has to happen in order to cover the costs: the Treasury could borrow more money, increasing the national debt; Congress could raise taxes to offset the increased Defense spending; other federal programs could be slashed.\n\nOver the weekend, Congressman Jim Jordan, an influential leader of the House Freedom Caucus, appeared on ABC and made it plain that option number one, increased borrowing, was off the table.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to pay for these things,\u201d he said when asked about how to handle Trump\u2019s budget request. \u201cWe make this job way too complicated.\u201d\n\nJordan\u2019s wing of the party is substantial enough to block legislation in the House of Representatives unless Republican leadership can bring a large number of Democrats along, and it has shown, in the past, willingness to thwart the wishes of GOP leadership.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Deportation Plan Could Cost Hundreds of Billions of Dollars\n\nGiven the adamant opposition to tax increases among Republicans in general, the only option that remains is major spending cuts elsewhere, and according to the Times and The Wall Street Journal, that\u2019s where Trump will go looking for the cash he wants to send to the Pentagon.\n\nAccording to those reports, the Environmental Protection Agency and the State Department are both facing the prospect of tens of billions in spending reductions, though it is unclear how the burden would be divided. The EPA\u2019s budget, for example, was only $8.1 billion in 2016. The State Department\u2019s budget was $51 billion, already dramatically lower than in previous years.\n\nAt the Center for Economic and Policy Research, economist Dean Baker points out that if the EPA is really expected to give up \u201ctens of billions\u201d in spending, presumably over the traditional 10-year budget window, it would likely represent at least a 25 percent decrease in its overall budget.\n\nFor the State Department, the percentage would be lower but would come after a previous round of budget cutting. It would also be difficult to reconcile a major reduction in spending on the United States\u2019 main vehicle for engaging other countries around the world at a time when the President himself insists that he \u201cinherited a mess\u201d on the global stage.\n\nRelated: Why a Small Interest Rate Hike Means a $50 Billion Hit to the Federal Budget\n\nOther cuts in spending are expected to focus on social safety net spending. While Trump will likely avoid cuts to the biggest-ticket items in the budget, like Medicare and Social Security, which he promised not to touch, other programs, like food aid to the poor and other assistance programs could face reductions.\n\nAny move to increase defense spending would require Congress to do away with the sequester imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011, which imposed across-the-board spending reductions in equal measure on Defense and non-Defense spending.\n\nWhile many Congressional Republicans likely wouldn\u2019t be bothered by changing the rules to allow more spending on the Pentagon and less on domestic priorities, the Democrats will surely focus what little leverage they have on trying to protect the social safety net."}, {"date": "2017/02/27", "title": "New Report Warns Millions Could Lose Health Care Under GOP Plan", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/27/New-Report-Warns-Millions-Could-Lose-Health-Care-Under-GOP-Plan", "text": "As pressure mounts on the Trump administration and congressional GOP leaders to come up with a replacement for Obamacare that won\u2019t lead to huge losses in health care coverage for Americans, a new study presented at the National Governors Association over the weekend suggests that millions would be hurt under an emerging House GOP plan.\n\nThe analysis prepared by the health research firm Avalere Health and the consulting firm McKinsey and Company doesn\u2019t offer nationwide projections for declines in coverage if the House Republican plan were approved by Congress as a replacement for the Affordable Care Act. However, the analysis -- first reported Saturday by VOX -- indicates that there could be reductions of 30 percent to 50 percent in the number of individual market enrollees based on hypothetical state models. As it stands, the average retention rate of Obamacare insurance is 76-80 percent or a 16- 20 percent drop annually from signup to paying for premiums.\n\nRelated: Republicans Risk Passing New Health Bill by Defunding Planned Parenthood\n\nStill, if those projections are extrapolated nationwide, it suggests that many of the 7.7 million people who obtained health coverage through the exchanges would no longer be able to afford it.\n\nPresident Trump last month boasted that the GOP replacement plan would provide health care coverage for \u201ceverybody,\u201d but he and his senior advisers subsequently backed away from that. Republicans now say that their approach would provide \u201cuniversal access\u201d to affordable health care, but without guaranteeing that everyone currently enrolled can hang on to their insurance.\n\nThe White House on Sunday refused to say whether Trump would guarantee that the 7.7 million of Americans currently enrolled in Obamacare would continue to have coverage under a Republican substitute plan. During an appearance on the ABC News show This Week, Deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, \u201cthe goal is that we make sure that people don\u2019t lose their coverage and we have to put a high priority on the people who need it most.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut at the same time, we cannot survive under the current system,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have to make a massive overhaul to the health care system in America . . .

The past week has been marked by angry protests at town hall meetings and marches in Washington, D.C., and other cities involving Democrats and some Republicans who are fearful of losing their health insurance coverage.\n\nIf Trump and GOP leaders have their way, Congress will vote in the coming weeks to repeal key elements of the Affordable Care Act, including income-based tax subsidies for mostly low and moderate income people to help cover their premium costs and expanded Medicaid coverage in 31 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nIn place of Obamacare, the House plan would offer a series of free-market based measures, including age-adjusted tax credits that would benefit older, wealthier people far more than younger, poorer Americans. The Republicans would also gradually replace Medicaid with a program of block grants or per capita payments to the states that would save the federal government billions in the coming years but reduce coverage for lower-income people.\n\nRelated: Boehner \u2018Started Laughing\u2019 When Republicans Vowed to Replace Obamacare\n\nThe consultants\u2019 report to the governors outlines what would happen under the GOP approach in a hypothetical state that has 300,000 people enrolled in the individual health care market and expanded Medicaid for the poor.

Many of those states are run by Republican governors or GOP-dominated state legislatures. The report presents a hypothetical model of a state with 235,000 currently enrolled in the individual market.

Completely shut out of power in the nation\u2019s capital, and facing greatly diminished influence in state government, the party has spent the three and a half months since the wipeout of the November elections in an internal debate about how to move forward.\n\nOver the weekend, the first tentative answer to that question came with the election of former Labor Secretary Tom Perez to chair the Democratic National Committee. The party, despite broad repudiation at the polls in November, has decided not to stray too far from its current ideological orientation. A majority of the voting members of the DNC rejected a more leftward direction embodied by Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellison, who came in second in the balloting.\n\nRelated: The Deep Current of Fear at CPAC Turns to Palpable Paranoia\n\nPerez is closely associated with Hillary Clinton, who lost the presidential election to Donald Trump in November, and for that reason was seen by some as too closely tied to a leadership structure that failed the party in 2016.\n\nOn Sunday, in appearances on multiple talk shows, Perez admitted that the party had failed to reach as broad an audience as it needed to in the election, and said he would pursue a new strategy of local engagement, promising to be active in \u201cevery ZIP code.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to rebuild our party in the 50 states and territories and that\u2019s exactly what we are going to do,\u201d he told Chuck Todd on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \u201cWe also have to redefine our mission.

When we lead with these values I believe we succeed.\u201d\n\nIf the promise to make the Democrats compete everywhere in the country sounds familiar, it should. In 2005, after George W. Bush was reelected to the presidency and Republicans solidified their hold on both the House and the Senate, a demoralized party turned to Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor, whose \u201c50-State\u201d strategy helped the party rebound, taking control of both Houses of Congress in 2006 and the White House in 2008.\n\nIn his first move as DNC chair, Perez reached out to Ellison, who accepted the offer to serve as Deputy Chairman of the group. They publicly embraced on stage at the party gathering in Atlanta in an effort to show that any difference had been put aside.\n\nAfter President Trump used Twitter to attack the DNC leadership race as \u201crigged\u201d -- a tactic he used during the Democratic primary to try to aggravate the dissension between Clinton supporters and those backing Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Perez shot back:\n\nRelated: Americans Sour on Trump and Congress as Replacing Obamacare Flounders\n\n\u201cOur unity as a party is our greatest strength, and it\u2019s his worst nightmare.\u201d\n\nBut just how unified the party really is remains to be seen. In an interview on CNN Sunday Sanders, whose strong primary performance has made him a major power broker in the party despite his status as a registered Independent, was notably cautious in his statements about Perez. He had been a vociferous Ellison backer before the election.\n\n\u201cRight now Tom Perez has a real opportunity in his hands and I hope he seizes it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that is to understand that, in fact, the way the Democratic party has been run for decades has not worked. We need a total transformation.\n\n\u201cWe have to open up the party to working people, to young people, and make it crystal clear that the Democratic Party is going to take on Wall Street it\u2019s going to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, it\u2019s going to take on corporate America that is shutting down plants in this country and moving our jobs abroad abroad.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why a Small Interest Rate Hike Means a $50 Billion Hit to the Federal Budget\n\nHe pointed out that he had attended a rally of 5,000 people in heavily Republican Kansas on Saturday, and that there had been 150 other Democratic rallies across the country that same day. The job of the DNC, he said, \u201cis to motivate the grassroots.\u201d\n\nHowever, when Sanders was asked by Jake Tapper if he would share his massive database of supporter emails and other information gathered during his campaign, he waffled. In the end, he left the impression that he would be making decisions on which Democratic candidates to support on an individual basis, rather than handing over his supporter list to the DNC wholesale.\n\nThe implication is that he is concerned Perez will turn out to be more of the same thing the Democratic establishment has been offering for the past eight years.\n\nAnd if that is Sanders\u2019 worry, it\u2019s also Republicans\u2019 hope.

The tax exclusion costs the federal government an estimated $260 billion in income and payroll taxes in 2017, which makes it the single largest tax expenditure. The Republicans would cap the tax exemption for workers paying premiums on high-end health care policies.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublicans would preserve the ban on discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions in one form or another, but they will impose a \u201ccontinuous coverage exclusion\u201d to protect insurers from excessive losses.\n\nIn place of Obamacare\u2019s income-based tax subsidies that help low and middle-income people the most, Republicans would create \u201crefundable\u201d tax credits that vary by age and help older Americans the most. The tax credit would be stepped, beginning with $2,000 a year for people under the age of 30, and would increase by increments of $500 for each successive age group. The highest annual credit -- $4,000 \u2013 would go to people 60 and older.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo help relieve insurance companies saddled with risk pools top heavy with older and sicker people, the GOP plan would provide states with a total of $100 billion over the coming decade to provide coverage to these people who may have trouble acquiring policies in the individual market. Whether that would be nearly enough to meet the cost is a point of contention.\n\nInsurers complain that many people wait until they are sick to purchase health insurance instead of when they are healthy and not in need of costly medical attention. The House GOP proposal includes penalties for individuals who fail to maintain continuous coverage. If they permit their insurance to lapse and then decide to re-enroll, they would be hit with a 30 percent boost in premiums for a year.\n\nRelated: Americans Sour on Trump and Congress as Replacing Obamacare Flounders\n\nA major wild card in the unfolding debate was the House leadership\u2019s decision to include a provision to defund Planned Parenthood and other health organizations that provide abortions, according to The Hill. The one-year ban on Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood has long been sought by congressional Republicans and anti-abortion forces and would be a major victory for them.\n\nPlanned Parenthood provides sexual and reproductive health care, education, information, and outreach to 2.5 million women and men in the United States every year. About three percent of all Planned Parenthood health services are abortion related, according to the organization, but federal dollars cannot be used to fund those services.\n\nStill, anti-abortion activists argue that all funding for Planned Parenthood is fungible, and they want to make sure federal funding doesn\u2019t indirectly facilitate abortions.\n\nAccording to The Hill, the Republicans would have a tough time passing Obamacare repeal and replace legislation if it includes a ban on Planned Parenthood funding. The Republicans hold a slender 52 to 48 majority in the Senate, and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said last week she would not vote for any repeal that defunds Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cTaxpayer dollars should not be used to pay for abortions, but I will not vote to deny Alaskans access to the health care services that Planned Parenthood provides,\u201d she said. It would take the defection of just three Senate Republicans to halt the repeal and replace movement in its tracks."}, {"date": "2017/02/24", "title": "A Military Buildup and Big Tax Cuts: Is the Debt Set to Soar Under Trump?", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/24/Military-Buildup-and-Big-Tax-Cuts-Debt-Set-Soar-Under-Trump", "text": "With ambitions to more than match the Reagan-era military buildup, President Donald Trump and his advisers are preparing a budget plan calling for huge spending increases on defense while cutting domestic programs deeply.\n\nTrump last month ordered Defense Secretary James Mattis to come up with a comprehensive plan within two months to improve overall readiness in the armed services by fiscal 2019, including updating the nuclear arsenal and strengthening defenses against a possible nuclear attack by North Korea or Iran. He is also calling for a major buildup of all four branches of the military, including more troops, jet fighters, ships and other weaponry.\n\nRelated: Five Big Challenges Facing Trump\u2019s New Budget Chief\n\nTrump this week mentioned the importance of reining in a national debt fast approaching $20 trillion, and he lectured senior White House economic advisers that \u201cwe need to do a lot more with less\u201d in his first comments about the budget in advance of the release of his proposals by mid-March.\n\nHowever, he also indicated that a balanced budget was unrealistic for the time being as he tries to reconcile his fiscal responsibility rhetoric with campaign pledges to slash taxes by trillions of dollars, build a wall along the nearly 2,000-mile long southern border, protect Social Security and Medicare from cuts and bulk up the military.\n\nWilliam A. Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a one-time policy adviser to President Bill Clinton, said on Friday that Trump\u2019s \u201cbudgetary logic\u201d is dangerously similar to that of the Reagan administration, which pursued a big defense buildup and tax cuts, only to touch off nearly two decades of struggle to contain rampant deficits -- including major cuts in social safety-net programs.\n\n\u201cIf history repeats itself, the beginning of the Trump administration will be the high water mark for deficit spending, and then the equilibrating political forces will set in,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems like a formula for rising government spending, falling government revenues and much larger deficits \u2013 on top of large existing deficits.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why a Small Interest Rate Hike Means a $50 Billion Hit to the Federal Budget\n\nLast month, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that after seven years of declines, the federal budget deficit is projected to surge again and will add nearly $10 trillion to the federal debt over the next decade. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget calculated last year that Trump\u2019s corporate and individual tax cuts and spending initiatives would add $5.3 trillion more to the national debt in the next ten years.\n\nAlthough much of this is still in the planning stages, the new administration is likely to ask Congress to raise spending caps to provide an additional $30 billion to $40 billion for defense in the current fiscal year that runs through Sept. 30, and $54 billion more next year. That would bring total spending on personnel, military hardware and other defense contracts to at least $603 billion in fiscal 2018, according to Justin Bogie, senior policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation.\n\nBut even that massive figure \u2013 one that would eclipse defense spending by President Ronald Reagan in the early 1980s \u2013 doesn\u2019t tell the entire story. Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress will likely approve another $74 billion of emergency spending in 2018 from a special Overseas Contingency Account that has been used finance U.S. combat operations in the Middle East. Those funds don\u2019t need to be offset by corresponding spending cuts in other parts of the budget and will directly add to the deficit.\n\nAt the same time, Trump and his advisers are expected to offset some of that increased defense spending by slashing non-defense discretionary spending by as much as $54 billion next year. This would involve lowering the domestic program spending ceiling that was set under the 2011 Budget Control Act from $516 billion to $462 billion.\n\nRelated: The GOP\u2019s Big Tax Dilemma: Repealing Obamacare Taxes\n\nThe New York Times reported last week that an Office of Management and Budget \u201chit list\u201d has targeted nine long-standing programs with strong Democratic support, including the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the Legal Services Corporation, AmeriCorps and the National Endowment for the Arts and the Humanities.\n\nBut even if all of those programs were eliminated, it would only save about $2.5 billion a year \u2013 a relative drop in the bucket compared to all of Trump\u2019s spending that needs to be offset.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation, which is closely allied with the Trump administration, has proposed scores of other cuts that would save billions more \u2013 including funding for National Infrastructure Investment (TIGER) grants, technology innovation, Department of Energy loan programs, and other business incentive programs that conservative critics dismiss as \u201ccrony capitalism.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the real highlight will be on the discretionary spending side,\u201d Bogie said in an interview. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see a big plus-up in defense to pay for a lot of the campaign promises that Trump put out there. You\u2019re going to see a big slash to a lot of these non-defense programs that a lot of people like and that have been funded for many years to pay for that.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Robert Greenstein, president of the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told The New York Times yesterday that he is worried \u201cthat we are going to see the biggest cuts that any president has ever proposed in programs for low- and moderate-income families.\u201d\n\nRelated: Prospects Dim for Deficit Control as Trump Drives for Defense Buildup\n\nBut fiscal conservative groups -- wary that Trump and his advisers may be leading the country into a renewed era of trillion-dollar-a-year budget deficits comparable to the red ink that flowed during the worst of the Great Recession -- say the new president must seriously address rising entitlement costs.\n\nMaya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said on Thursday that Trump\u2019s first budget \u201cwill tell us just how serious he is about taking on our record-high national debt.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/02/24", "title": "Trump\u2019s Deportation Plan Could Cost Hundreds of Billions of Dollars", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/24/Why-Trump-s-Deportation-Plan-Could-Cost-Hundreds-Billions-Dollars", "text": "As President Donald Trump rolls out more details of a plan that could deport millions of undocumented U.S. immigrants, the true cost of such an undertaking is coming into sharper focus.\n\nIn a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday, Trump outlined what he called his administration's \"swift and strong action to secure the southern border.\" He said his administration would be \"throwing\" gang members, drug dealers and criminal aliens out of the country and \"will not let them back in.\"\n\nRelated: The Hidden Effect of Trump\u2019s New Immigration Orders\n\nUntil there are more details of the plan, much of which will require congressional approval, estimates are sketchy.

It could also wipe out a chunk of the American economy roughly the size of the annual gross domestic product of Texas.\n\nRelated: Mark Cuban: Trump's Immigration Ban Is Bad for Business\n\nThe new Trump initiative includes hiring thousands of new immigration agents, building new detention centers and constructing a southern border wall that was a centerpiece of Trump's election campaign.\n\nBreaking down deportation costs\n\nLast March, American Action Forum, a center-right policy institute led by former CBO director Douglas Holtz-Eakin, estimated it would take between $100 billion and $300 billion to arrest and remove \"all undocumented immigrants residing in the country, a process that we estimate would take 20 years,\" the group said.\n\nOnce those undocumented immigrants were removed, it would take another $315 billion in higher enforcing costs to stop them from coming back, according to AAF.\n\nThat estimate includes just the hard cost of removing undocumented workers; it doesn't take into account the economic impact that would result from the removal of some 11 million people from the labor force and the resulting loss of consumer spending.\n\nAAF estimated the removal of that many people would shrink the pool of U.S. workers by 6.4 percent, which means that 20 years from now, the U.S. economy would be nearly 6 percent smaller.\n\nThat works out to a loss of $1.6 trillion in lost wages, spending and other economic activity.\n\nTo put that in perspective, the gross domestic product for Texas last year was about $1.5 trillion, second behind California.\n\nThis article originally appeared on CNBC.

These are essential infrastructure,\u201d said Democratic Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin, who is in his second term. \u201cThis is a sacrosanct part of our taxing policy that has been in existence since 1913.\u201d\n\nBut some Republicans on Capitol Hill want to end the tax-exempt status of muni bonds as part of broader changes to the federal tax code. That has many state and local officials worried.\n\nA city\u2019s ability to borrow depends on investors\u2019 willingness to lend it money by purchasing bonds. And the tax-exempt status of muni bonds is part of what makes them so attractive to investors, especially high-income taxpayers looking to reduce their tax bills.\n\nBut exempting the bonds from federal taxes is projected to cost the U.S. Department of the Treasury as much as $617 billion in revenue over the next decade, according to the Tax Foundation, an independent tax analysis group. To many in Washington, recouping that money makes the tax exemption a tempting target.\n\nRelated: U.S. infrastructure legislation back on Congress' radar\n\nU.S. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican, said at a Heritage Foundation event in December that he thinks there\u2019s \u201cmerit\u201d to eliminating the deduction as part of a broader tax policy makeover that would lower rates. \u201cThe added benefit here is that the federal tax code will no longer subsidize higher taxes at the local level,\u201d Brady said.\n\nHouse Republicans released a tax policy blueprint last year that proposed eliminating most itemized deductions, including those taken for interest earned on municipal bonds. The proposal would keep intact deductions for mortgage interest and charitable giving. They are now drafting a new version of the plan.\n\nA Meeting With Trump\n\nEven though they are called \u201cmunicipal\u201d bonds, states and other entities such as school districts and water authorities also rely on them. In 2016, there were $423.8 billion in new municipal bond sales, which include bonds issued by state authorities, water and sewer districts, local authorities, municipalities, counties, and colleges and universities.\n\nThe tax-free bonds come in three varieties. Most municipal bonds used to finance infrastructure projects are \u201cgeneral obligation\u201d bonds, which means the governmental body that issues them puts its \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d behind them. In other words, the city or county issuing the bonds pledges that its taxpayers will pay them off, no matter what happens. Cities and counties also issue \u201crevenue bonds,\u201d which they pay back using fees, such as tolls or public utility fees. Then there are \u201cprivate activity\u201d bonds, which are used mostly for housing and are secured by mortgages.\n\nShortly before President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, Benjamin and other mayors of cities large and small met with the incoming president, who assured them that he opposed taxing any of the types of bonds. \u201cHe said he understood and would be fully supportive\u201d of the tax-free bonds, said Larry Jones, assistant executive director of the nonpartisan U.S. Conference of Mayors. \u201cHowever, we have yet to see how he would treat tax-exempt bonds in any budget proposal or tax reform proposal. We\u2019ve been making our case on the Hill.\u201d\n\nRelated: Rural State Republicans Challenge Trump\u2019s Infrastructure Spending Plan\n\nGovernors also have expressed support for keeping the bonds tax-exempt. \u201cMunicipal bonds remain a critical tool to financing the construction or improvement of schools, streets, highways, hospitals, bridges, water and sewer systems, ports, airports and other public works,\u201d the National Governors Association said in a statement earlier this month.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s assurances, muni-bond supporters have reason to be wary. During the presidential campaign, Trump\u2019s economic advisers Peter Navarro and Wilbur Ross (since nominated to be secretary of commerce) questioned the wisdom of relying on tax-exempt bonds to rebuild the nation\u2019s infrastructure, as Trump has pledged to do. Instead, they suggested awarding federal tax credits to private firms to do the work. The tax credits might not replace municipal bonds, but they could crowd the market for infrastructure investing.\n\nA Traditional Target\n\nMuni bonds also came under fire during the last major revision of the federal tax code, in 1986.\n\nFrank Shafroth, director of the State and Local Government Leadership Center at George Mason University, was the National League of Cities\u2019 director of federal relations during that debate. In a recent interview, he recalled the mad scramble to keep muni bonds tax-exempt as President Ronald Reagan and Republicans in Congress sought to eliminate or scale back the exemption.\n\nShafroth said awarding tax credits to private firms, as Trump\u2019s economic advisers have proposed, \u201cwould not help with the vast number of projects\u201d because, he said, those tax credits would most likely go to big, new projects, where they would be worth the most to private companies, not smaller efforts like road repair or school reconstruction.\n\nRelated: Trump criticizes billions in spending on U.S. air traffic control\n\nElizabeth Kautz, the mayor of Burnsville, Minnesota, just south of Minneapolis, emphasized that her city relies on municipal bonds to pay for street repaving and other basic maintenance, not to build shiny new stuff.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like you do it once and it\u2019s done,\u201d Kautz said. \u201cThere are always improvements and maintenance you have to do.\u201d She said the city has a fiduciary responsibility to citizens to make these improvements and to issue the bonds to finance them.\n\nBut critics of muni bonds argue that they make borrowing money for infrastructure projects so easy that some cities and towns unnecessarily construct things.

Therefore, she called for a trial, starting March 13, in which the plaintiffs will have to prove the bank acted with \u201cintentional wrongdoing or reckless indifference\u201d in order to receive damages.\n\nThe decision is the latest stain on JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, which has been hit with record-breaking fines for mismanagement and misleading investors, among other offenses, in the wake of the housing market collapse in 2008. It also serves as a timely reminder that the fallout from the financial crisis continues a decade later, yet it comes at a time when the Trump administration is looking to roll back some of the Dodd-Frank regulatory reforms that sought to rein in risky activity by large, systemically important banks.\n\nRelated: Overhauling Dodd-Frank May Not Succeed, but Also May Not Matter\n\nIn the suit filed on behalf of Ballantyne and Orkney, the judge agreed with the companies\u2019 assertion that the bank ignored guidelines to invest no more than 50 percent of funds in risky subprime mortgage securities. In Ballantyne\u2019s case, the bank invested as much as 90 percent of its funds in subprime and \u201calt-a\u201d (between subprime and prime) securities. In Orkney\u2019s, the total reached 77 percent.\n\n\u201cBasically they built a house of cards,\u201d said a source close to the case. \u201cIf you\u2019re wrong, the consequences are devastating.\u201d\n\nIn the court document, JPMorgan denies it committed gross negligence, asserting among other factors, that the insurers did not object to the investments it made on their behalf for a period of 90 days, thereby waiving the right to legal recourse.\n\nRelated: Trump Takes Aim at America's Consumer Watchdog\n\nThe current suit largely mirrors a July 2015 case in which JPMorgan paid $388 million to the Fort Worth Employees' Retirement Fund and other investors who accused the bank of misleading them about the quality of mortgages underlying securities it issued in 2007. JPMorgan settled the suit without admitting wrongdoing.\n\nCritics of the bank say these and other cases belie the conventional storyline that surrounded JPMorgan in the wake of the crisis, which held that CEO Jamie Dimon had the foresight to shed investments in the mortgage-backed securities market when most of his competitors did not. In this \u201clast bank standing\u201d version, Dimon came to the rescue of the banking system, buying a faltering Bear Stearns and the remains of Washington Mutual after the largest U.S. thrift failed.\n\nBut while JPMorgan was wisely unloading its exposed position to subprime mortgages, the manager in charge of the Ballantyne and Orkney accounts was staying the course in the subprime market. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit and other critics say JPMorgan applied its foresight selectively, protecting its own investments more than those of its clients. They say failures of execution at the mid-level were validated by an absence of oversight at the top.\n\nRelated: Why JPMorgan\u2019s Risk Management Failed\n\n\u201cThis case [Ballantyne and Orkney] presents a situation where, as it typically does, JPMorgan Chase put its own interests ahead of the interests of its customers,\u201d said Helen Davis Chaitman, a New York trial attorney and co-author of J.P. Madoff: The Unholy Alliance between America's Biggest Bank and America's Biggest Crook.\n\nAll told, JPMorgan was fined more than $35 billion from 2011 to 2014, nearly all of it tied to the financial crisis and the company\u2019s promotion and use of mortgage-backed securities, according to Dividend.com. In November 2013, the bank settled two major claims for selling bad mortgage securities between 2005 and 2008. In the first it paid $4.5 billion to settle claims by a group of institutional investors. Later that month, it agreed to a $13 billion settlement with the Justice Department \u2014 the largest government such fine against a single U.S. firm \u2014 to resolve claims related to the sale of mortgage-backed securities by the bank itself as well as Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual.\n\nRelated: JPMorgan to Pay Lehman $797.5 Million to End Litigation Over Collapse\n\nThe agreement included a statement of facts in which the bank admitted that the mortgage-backed securities it sold did not comply with underwriting guidelines and were not fit for sale. Nevertheless, Dimon did not admit to a violation of law and JPMorgan asserted that much of the improper conduct occurred at Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual.\n\nDespite those fines and the public relations battering it took from a slew of lawsuits, the bank\u2019s profits have risen, as has its stock.\n\nJPM data by YCharts\n\nNow, with the Trump administration looking to undo banking regulations in the Dodd-Frank Act, Chaitman, the lawyer, says it will be up to the courts to eliminate incentives for the kind of behavior that led to the financial meltdown in the first place.\n\n\u201cHopefully,\u201d she says, \u201chonest hard-working Americans will find protection from judges who understand the importance of enforcing the law.\u201d\n\nBraden Phillips is a freelance journalist who has covered business and other subjects for many newspapers over the last 25 years.\\"}, {"date": "2017/02/24", "title": "Following Bannon\u2019s Lead, Trump Blasts Media in Nationalist Speech at CPAC", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/24/Following-Bannon-s-Lead-Trump-Hits-Media-Nationalist-Speech-CPAC", "text": "Donald Trump avoided the Conservative Political Action Conference in the heat of the Republican primary last year, amid rumors that some attendees would stage a walkout during his remarks.

But that is down from 58 percent at the beginning of the year, before it became painfully obvious that Trump and the congressional Republicans have been unable to agree on a replacement plan that could pass muster with a majority of lawmakers and key health care interests and consumers.\n\nA total of 32 percent of American voters are \u201cvery concerned\u201d or \u201csomewhat concerned\u201d that they will lose their current health insurance if the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, is repealed, according to another Quinnipiac University survey.

The idea is to save the federal government billions of dollars in the coming years while giving state officials more flexibility to set eligibility requirements and spending levels to provide health care services to the nation\u2019s poor and disabled.\n\nBut there is one serious catch: While the extensive use of block grants has proven over the years to be a great financial boon for Congress and the federal government in attempting to rein in spending, it has been a bad deal for the states and hundreds of millions of Americans dependent on federal assistance.\n\nRelated: Why the GOP Plan for Medicaid Could Be a Bad Deal for the States\n\nFederal funding for 13 major block grant programs for housing, health, and social services has dropped by 27 percent or $14 billion since 2000 or by 37 percent when adjusting for inflation and population growth, according to a new analysis by the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nDavid Reich, a senior fellow on federal fiscal policy and a co-author of the study, said in an interview Wednesday the simple fact is that \u201cfunding for block grants tends to decline over time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you convert programs to block grants and combine programs into block grants, very likely \u2013 based on history \u2013 the funding is going to go down \u2013 it\u2019s not going to keep pace with need,\u201d he added.\n\nIn the distant past, Congress poured tens of billions of dollars into state coffers through categorical grants and formulas that were targeted for specific activities and purposes. But that began to change in the 1980s during the Reagan administration when those funds were bundled into broader spending categories under the rubric of block grants.\n\nRelated: How Block Grants Cap Federal Costs -- and Make States the Bad Guys\n\nThe original purpose was manifold \u2013 to grant the states more authority and flexibility to tailor services to constituents\u2019 needs while looking for ways to make savings to stay within the block grant amounts. Over time, however, Congress and the executive branch viewed the block grant system primarily as a money saver.\n\nToday, block grants range from home investment partnerships and job training to substance abuse prevention and community development action.\n\nThe largest block grant in the study -- the 1997 welfare reform program known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) \u2013 currently receives $16.57 billion annually and has lost a third of its value due to inflation. It was designed to encourage more people to work rather than to rely on welfare. At the same time, the amount of basic assistance TANF provides has fallen even more as states shift those resources to other programs.\n\nLow income and impoverished Americans are not left in the lurch, however, since they have access to a variety of other federal safety net programs including food stamps (SNAP), Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Housing Assistance, Child Nutrition Program (CHIP), Feeding Programs (WIC & CSFP), Low-Income Home Energy Assistance, and Lifeline (a free cellphone service).\n\nThe Community Development Block Grant totals $2.99 billion annually, down 51 percent from 2000. The $1.85 billion that goes for substance abuse prevention and treatment totals $1.85 billion, down 19 percent from 2000.\n\nThe loss of funding for these and other programs is even more pronounced when measured against the relative size of the economy, which has grown substantially since 2000. In 2000, total block-grant funding equaled 0.36 percent of the economy, according to the report. By 2017, this share of GDP had dropped to 0.20 percent, a decline of more than two-fifths. It\u2019s not clear if the community development programs failed to meet performance benchmarks or if the substance abuse and prevention treatment dollars were replaced by grants to existing medical facilities or rehab centers.\n\nRelated: Trump Cracks Down on Sanctuary Cities \u2013 and It Could Cost Them Billions\n\nAmong the 13 programs in the study, only the Child Care and Development Fund and the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant have grown since their inception, in 1997 and 1993, respectively.\n\n\u201cAn unfortunate irony here is that while policymakers assert state flexibility as a prime reason to block-grant programs, this flexibility can later be used to justify cutting them or eliminating them entirely,\u201d the report states.\n\nA good example was when Congress created the Social Security Block Grant in 1982 to give the states more administrative and policy flexibility over the services provided. Over time, conservative lawmakers complained that the program was giving the states too much flexibility and that it had turned into a \u201cno-strings-attached\u201d slush fund.\n\nNow conservatives are considering giving states block grants for Medicaid.\n\nThe 1965 Medicaid law today covers about 81 million people, including poor children and pregnant women, the disabled and poor older people. Republicans have long complained about runaway spending, fraud and waste. Medicaid spending grew 9.7 percent to $545.1 billion in 2015, or 17 percent of total national expenditures on health, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. That increase was twice the rate of growth in spending for Medicare for the elderly.\n\nRelated: What Obamacare Repeal Could Mean for Your Workplace Health Plan\n\nWhat's more, government spending on Medicaid expansion under Obamacare turned out to be much higher than original projections, according to an analysis by Forbes. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimated in its 2014 Medicaid Actuarial Report that newly eligible enrollees would cost $4,281, on average, in 2015. Yet in a 2015 report issued in July 2016, CMS raised the per capita cost to $6,366\u2014a 49 percent increase.\n\nA dramatic upward revision of enrollment and spending for each enrollee significantly altered the bottom line cost for expanded Medicaid, Forbes noted. In April 2014, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the federal share of Medicaid expansion spending would be $42 billion in 2015. The actual federal cost turned out to be roughly $68 billion \u2014 or 62 percent higher than predicted.\n\nGOP efforts to convert Medicaid from a federal entitlement covering all eligible people to block grants to the states dates back to the Reagan administration.\n\nAs now portrayed by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), a block grant would essentially cap federal Medicaid funding as a way of achieving major savings in the coming decade. At present, the federal government picks up a fixed percentage of states\u2019 Medicaid costs \u2014 on average 57 percent \u2014 and the states cover the rest. Under a block grant approach, states would receive a fixed amount based on a formula, with the states responsible for picking up any additional costs above the cap.\n\nLast November, CBPP issued an analysis showing that a block grant proposal included in a House GOP budget plan for fiscal 2017 would cut federal Medicaid funding by $1 trillion \u2014 or nearly 25 percent \u2014 over ten years, relative to current law. Another analysis by the Urban Institute of a previous block grant proposal promoted by Ryan in 2012 projected that between 14 million and 21 million people would eventually lose their Medicaid coverage."}, {"date": "2017/02/23", "title": "The US Navy Sends a Powerful Message to Beijing in the South China Sea", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/23/US-Navy-Sends-Powerful-Message-Beijing-South-China-Sea", "text": "Amid new reports that China is constructing structures that may be able to house long-range missiles on artificial islands in the South China Sea, the U.S. is flexing its naval muscle in the same waters.\n\nRelated: The US Navy\u2019s $13 Billion Answer to China and Russia\n\nIn a story Wednesday, Reuters says it was told by two U.S. officials that China has built almost two dozen concrete structures with retractable roofs that resemble housing for surface-to-air missiles.\n\nReuters quoted a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry as saying, \"China carrying out normal construction activities on its own territory, including deploying necessary and appropriate territorial defense facilities, is a normal right under international law for sovereign nations.\"\n\nThe structures, about 60 feet long and 30 feet high, have been erected on artificial islands built on reefs in the Spratly Islands, where military-grade airstrips have already been installed, Reuters said.

The Grand Old Party has its best opportunity since perhaps Reconstruction to remake government from the federal level all the way down to the counties and cities, while at the same time clear the regulatory decks for economic expansion.\n\nAnd yet, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer described their situation as \u2026 dire. In an appearance on ABC\u2019s The View, Schumer told the host panel that Republicans in Congress have begun itching to abandon Trump after just thirty days in office. \"A lot of the Republicans, they're mainstream people,\u201d Schumer explained. \u201cThey will feel they have no choice but to break with him,\u201d over what Schumer declared as Trump\u2019s radical agenda. \"My prediction is [if] he keeps up on this path,\u201d Schumer concluded, \u201cwithin three, four months you're going to see a whole lot of Republicans breaking with him.\u201d\n\nRelated: This Year\u2019s CPAC Conference \u2013 Light on Leaders, Long on Trump Appointees\n\nPerhaps the perspective of the top Senate Democrat might be a bit skewed. At least thus far, Congress has moved in lockstep with the new administration, while it appears that Schumer\u2019s colleagues on Capitol Hill have deviated far from the mainstream path. At least four House Democrats have openly encouraged impeachment efforts against the new president, so much so that other House Democrats have begun asking them to please stop talking about it.\n\nTwo other House Democrats \u2013 Jackie Speier and Earl Blumenauer \u2013 have suggested using the 25th Amendment to remove the president. Speier explained in a CNN interview that Trump\u2019s alleged \u201cincapacity\u201d consisted of using the same communication style that won Trump the election. \u201cHe has got to get a grip,\u201d Speier told Brianna Keilar, \u201che has to start acting presidential. \u2026 You don\u2019t take on people saying nasty things about them.\u201d That might come as a surprise to the voters who saw him do just that to Republicans and Democrats alike over the course of the election cycle and gave him a 306-232 Electoral College win for it.\n\nIn comparison, Republicans on Capitol Hill seem much less flustered with their new status in single-party governance. The House and Senate have begun repealing Barack Obama\u2019s final-hours regulations through the rarely used Congressional Review Act. That allows Congress to not only overturn regulations but also forbids later administrations from re-enacting them without Congressional approval. With Trump in the White House engineering a parallel advance of deregulatory policy in the executive branch, it looks much more like a honeymoon than a pending divorce.\n\nRelated: Trump Scores a Bipartisan Win With His Pick for National Security Adviser\n\nSchumer\u2019s counterparts in Republican leadership hardly sound alarmed at Trump\u2019s first month in office either. Both Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan have expressed their misgivings over Trump\u2019s communication style, but both have also concurred with Trump\u2019s policy directions. Ryan went to the Mexican border this week to build support for funding Trump\u2019s wall, while McConnell told Salena Zito that Trump has done exactly what any other Republican president would do.\n\n\"Everything that has happened, since he has taken office, has been reassuring to me,\u201d McConnell says of Trump\u2019s performance. \u201cHe has picked an absolutely stunning individual for the Supreme Court, [and] we have already put in place the mechanism to repeal and replace Obamacare.\u201d\n\nOf course, the marriage between populists, conservatives, and party-line Republicans will get tested in the future. Will the different factions focus on common goals and stay united through Trump\u2019s first term, offering flexibility on areas of potential disagreement? One key test will take place this week in National Harbor, Maryland. The annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) begins Thursday and will feature appearances from both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. Even that pairing signals a change of sorts and a potential sign of post-election focus. A year ago, Trump backed out of a commitment to speak rather than conform to the moderator format used for all other candidates, while Pence has long been a favorite of the conservative activist groups that attend CPAC.\n\nRelated: How Illegal Immigrant Advocates Demonize Trump and Terrify People\n\nThe CPAC event carries significant weight within think-tank and grassroots circles. Does it mean anything for the millions of voters who don\u2019t attend political conferences? Perhaps this year more than most, yes. Before 2016, Republicans and conservatives didn\u2019t put a lot of trust in one another, and neither trusted populists at all. That played out at previous CPACs and other conferences, but without the power to govern, the clashes were largely academic.\n\nSingle-party governance has raised the stakes significantly in 2017. With only some limited exceptions for Democratic obstructionism \u2013 both on presidential appointments and on potential filibusters on legislation \u2013 the three-way alliance must show it can deliver on promises made in the election cycle. Trump has to make government work; Republicans have to shrink government while ensuring that the Rust Belt voters don\u2019t wind up paying the price for it.\n\nRelated: How John McCain Became The Face of GOP Resistance to Trump\n\nAll of the competing interests will meld together at CPAC \u2013 on the main stage, in the breakout sessions, and in the halls and concourses. Lawmakers will speak and engage on these topics to get a sense of whether they have support for specific policies and general agendas.

If there is indeed a proposal on the way, Trump and Congress will have to find a way to pay for revamping a healthcare system that is now largely funded through taxes that are a core element of the ACA.\n\nThese include the ACA\u2019s employer mandate, the Medicare surtax, and a number of other tax-related provisions in the law that would provide some $900 billion in revenue over the next decade. Presumably, repeal would also eliminate the controversial \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on high-cost health insurance policies provided by insurers.\n\nRelated: Five Questions Republicans Can\u2019t Answer About Their Obamacare Replacement\n\nThe Cadillac Tax, which is set to go into effect in 2020, imposes a 40 percent income tax on individual insurance with a value of more than $11,000 per year ($29,000 for a family). In essence, it removes the tax exemption for generous employer-provider health insurance. It\u2019s projected to raise $100 billion by 2027.\n\nBut the tax doesn\u2019t affect the one percent nearly as much as it hits unions, which traded salary increases over the years for more generous health plans. As a result, the push back from the Alliance to Fight the 40, is gaining strength from businesses, unions and some in the medical community.\n\nBut, as the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget notes in a recent blog post, whatever plan Republicans develop to replace the ACA will have to be paid for as well, and eliminating all of the current laws tax revenue just means the money will have to come from somewhere else.\n\nOne option for keeping some funding in place, CRFB argues, is keeping the Cadillac Tax in place. Another, perhaps better one, is peeling back the income tax exclusion for Employer-Provided Insurance either partially or entirely.\n\nAs a revenue source, keeping the Cadillac Tax in place would generate a lot of revenue, ramping up to more than $100 billion a year by the mid-2030s. It would also push back against rising healthcare spending.\n\nRelated: Congress Pushes Back as Trump Spurs Anti-Vaccine Movement\n\nBut at CRFB, the preferred move is different: striking at the tax exclusion directly.\n\n\u201cA more direct limit to the ESI tax exclusion would also slow health care cost growth, increase wages, and reduce future deficits. In fact, recent analysis suggests a direct limit to the ESI exclusion could achieve these goals in a more progressive and efficient way and would have the further benefit of better equalizing the tax treatment of wage- and non-wage income,\u201d they write.\n\n\u201cFor example, by our very rough estimates, fully eliminating the income tax exclusion beginning in 2020 would save $1.3 trillion through 2027, more than enough to replace all the revenue loss from repealing the ACA's taxes and its mandates. Policymakers could also replace the income tax exclusion with a fixed tax credit or deduction, which would retain the incentive to provide insurance but end the incentive to hold the most costly insurance and generate $100 to $200 billion of revenue, depending on how fast they indexed the new tax benefit.\u201d\n\nHowever, all taxes are politically unpopular, and existing tax benefits are very hard to eliminate in Congress. Combine that with the general reluctance among republicans in Congress to get their hands anywhere near a tax increase, and it makes it the CRFB plan an extreme long shot."}, {"date": "2017/02/22", "title": "Congress Pushes Back as Trump Spurs Anti-Vaccine Movement", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/22/Congress-Pushes-Back-Trump-Spurs-Anti-Vaccine-Movement", "text": "Alarmed by the growing anti-vaccination movement that has been fanned by President Trump, Republican and Democratic leaders of the premier congressional health committees have mounted a campaign to persuade parents to get their young kids vaccinated against measles, whooping cough and other serious diseases.\n\nFor many, it seems like the height of irrationality and recklessness to risk the health of America\u2019s young people by denying them vaccines that have all but eradicated most serious childhood diseases, including polio. Yet a growing number of parents in this country have seized on long-discredited research to argue that vaccinations can lead to autism in their children.\n\nRelated: Republicans Eye Medicaid Cuts to Help Finance New Health Plan\n\nTrump has embraced this unfounded notion to the point of considering launching a national commission to investigate possible links between vaccines and autism \u2013 one headed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic who has spearheaded efforts to roll back child vaccination laws.\n\nWith the anti-vaccine movement picking up steam, most notably in Texas, perplexed GOP and Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday signed a letter to their colleagues in the House and Senate seeking to enlist them in trying to restore sanity to this public health care debate and bring the discussion back into the realm of scientific research, according to Axios.\n\n\"We write to you today to highlight the importance of immunizations, which protect Americans, especially infants and children, against outbreaks of serious and deadly infectious diseases,\u201d the letter stated. \u201cVaccines save lives.\u201d\n\nThey added that as members of Congress, \u201cwe have a critical role to play in supporting the availability and use of vaccines to protect Americans from deadly diseases.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Health Care Spending Could Rise Even Faster in the Next 10 Years\n\nThe lawmakers signing the letter included Sens.

Greg Walden (R-OR) and Frank Pallone Jr. (D-NJ), the chair and ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nPublic health officials have warned that the growing movement away from childhood vaccinations is undermining the extraordinary progress made over the years in combatting deadly or crippling childhood diseases. Worldwide, vaccines prevent the death of an estimated 2.5 million children every year, although deadly diseases like measles continue to pose a problem in areas where not enough children are vaccinated, according to a report by The Washington Post.\n\nIn Texas, where parents legally can exercise a \u201cpersonal-belief exemption\u201d to prevent their children from being vaccinated, the number of school-aged children who are not being vaccinated has climbed dramatically since 2003. The number of cases of parents exercising a personal belief exemption soared from 2,314 during the 2003-2004 school year to 44,716 during the past school year, according to the Post.\n\nResearch published nearly 20 years ago sought to show a link between childhood vaccines and autism, but that data was subsequently discredited due to falsified information. Since 2003, there have been nine studies funded or conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that found no link between vaccines and autism.\n\nRelated: Republicans Eye Medicaid Cuts to Help Finance Their New Health Plan\n\nNonetheless, Trump, who has no scientific background or training, has repeatedly raised the possibility of a link between the two. Most recently, during a Feb. 14 meeting with special education principals and teachers, Trump said: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with autism?

Not all of them were happy about it.\n\nLast year, conservative darling Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, an early and consistent Trump critic, delivered a speech that served as a barely concealed plea not to vote for the billionaire former reality television star. It also coincided with a controversial speech delivered by former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, in which he called then-candidate Trump \u201ca phony and a fraud.\u201d\n\nRelated: How John McCain Became The Face of GOP Resistance to Trump\n\nAt the time, many CPAC attendees were seemingly conflicted about Trump but were livid at the possibility that establishment Republicans like Romney might drive him away with his many followers in tow.\n\nRon Nervitt, a retired federal employee from Williamsburg, VA said, \u201cI\u2019m not a Trump supporter but I think what the Republicans are doing in trying to scuttle him is terrible.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Trump wins, it\u2019s \u2018Oh, my God,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cBut if Trump gets scuttled? \u2018Oh, my God.

Chuck Grassley of Iowa was swamped with questions as well at two town hall meetings in Iowa.\n\nDuring one of those meetings at the Iowa Falls community center, Chris Petersen, 62, a pig farmer and self-described progressive Democrat who suffers from diabetes, told Grassley he frets about losing his health insurance, according to Politico.\n\nRelated: The New Obamacare Rules Help Insurers But Not Consumers\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Obamacare, we wouldn\u2019t be able to afford insurance,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cOver 20 million will lose coverage, and with all due respect, sir, you\u2019re the man who talked about the death panels [in opposing enactment of Obamacare in 2009]. You\u2019re going to create one great big death panel in this country for people who can\u2019t afford to get insurance.\u201d\n\nGrassley sought to reassure the crowd by saying that there were three or four main GOP health care plans being circulated in Congress that would preserve the most popular features of Obamacare. He ventured to speculate that under any of those alternative GOP plans, the 20 million people currently covered by Obamacare won\u2019t lose their coverage.\n\nBut without the CBO and Joint Committee on Taxation scoring any of those plans, it\u2019s virtually impossible to assess their impact. What\u2019s more, there\u2019s no way of knowing for sure how much of their replacement plan Republicans will be able to enact under the expedited budget reconciliation budget rules they intend to employ this spring or summer to repeal the heart of Obamacare\u2019s mandates and regulations.\n\nRelated: The IRS Has Just Made Obamacare\u2019s Individual Mandate Optional\n\n\u201cThe House Republican talking points begin by indicting the ACA\u2019s health insurance marketplaces and Medicaid in an attempt to justify rushing to repeal the former and radically overhaul the latter,\u201d the liberal-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities said in a report last week. \u201cBut in fact, these programs are providing affordable, quality health insurance for tens of millions of Americans, and the ACA has improved coverage for tens of millions more.

If not, how many will be dropped from the rolls?\n\nIf someone is currently on either the traditional or expanded Medicaid program for low-income or disabled people, will he or she still have coverage once the Republicans cut and overhaul the programs and turn them into per capita payments or block grants to the states?\n\nWill consumers currently using Obamacare have to pay more in premiums and out-of-pocket costs their health care under the new system?\n\nWhat about sick and elderly people who currently are guaranteed health care coverage under Obamacare?

In addition, the new guidelines rolled out by Homeland Security indicate that people who have lived in the country for two years or more will not be vulnerable to \u201cexpedited removal.\u201d Trump has also made it clear that he would prioritize deporting criminals.\n\nThe hysteria over recent ICE operations is a great example of how Trump\u2019s policies are being misrepresented. Last week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials arrested 680 individuals, \u201cstoking fears that the Trump administration is increasing the arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants,\u201d as The Times reported.\n\nAnother news organization proclaimed that \u201cPanic\u201d and \u201cterror\u201d is\u2026running through immigrant communities in the US following raids carried out across at least six states as part of Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to crack down on illegal immigrants.\u201d\n\nBut the head of ICE in LA said, \"These operations take weeks and sometimes months of planning, so this operation was in the planning stages before the current administration came out with the executive orders.\" In other words, the raids had nothing to do with Trump.\n\nRelated: Trump to Spare U.S. 'Dreamer' Immigrants From Crackdown\n\nInstead, they were a continuation of Obama\u2019s deportation program. It turns out that in 2009, ICE arrested on average 675 people per week.

Remember that Obama was called the \u201cDeporter in Chief\u201d by La Raza because his administration threw people out of the country at an unprecedented rate. As the LA Times noted last fall, \u201cSince taking office in 2009, Obama has expelled 2.5 million people, more than any other president.\u201d\n\nRelated: Team Trump on Immigration Disruption: \u2018It\u2019s a Small Price to Pay\u2019\n\nOne supposed change highlighted by The New York Times yesterday is that under the new rules from Homeland Security, \u201canyone convicted of any criminal offense is vulnerable to deportation.\u201d Under Obama, they claim, only \u201cundocumented immigrants convicted of serious crimes were the priority for removal.\u201d But a study by the paper\u2019s own reporters of some 3.2 million deportations shows that to be false.\n\nWriting in 2014, the paper stated, \u201cSince President Obama took office, two-thirds of the nearly two million deportation cases involve people who had committed minor infractions, including traffic violations or had no criminal record at all. Twenty percent \u2014 or about 394,000 \u2014 of the cases involved people convicted of serious crimes, including drug-related offenses, the records show.\u201d\n\nThe executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group, said in 2014: \u201cFor years, the Obama administration\u2019s spin has been that they are simply deporting so-called \u2018criminal aliens,\u2019 but\u2026In truth, this administration \u2014 more than any other \u2014 has devastated immigrant communities across the country, tearing families away from loved ones, simply because they drove without a license, or re-entered the country, desperately trying to be reunited with their family members.\u201d\n\nA former Homeland Security official said at the time, \u201cIt would have been better for the administration to state its enforcement intentions clearly and stand by them, rather than being willing to lean whichever way seemed politically expedient at any given moment.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump Moves Ahead With Wall, Puts Stamp on U.S. Immigration, Security Policy\n\nThat is of course what the Trump White House is doing. One such \u201cenforcement intention\u201d is ending Obama\u2019s \u201ccatch and release\u201d program, in which illegals apprehended at the border are free to stay in the U.S. and told to appear in court at a later date for a review of their circumstances. Most people fail to show for their appointed hearing; instead, they disappear into the shadows.\n\nAlso, among those denied entry to the U.S., Trump\u2019s order mandates repatriation back to their home countries. The administration thinks this is the best way to cut down on people arriving in the U.S. Send them home; others will get the message. The Obama administration also took that approach, when dealing with the surge in Central American refugees, but abandoned it in the face of criticism.\n\nTrump wants to add more border agents and more judges to expedite hearings and better manage the chaotic flow across our border. He calls on those officials to comply with the law \u2013 for example, to \u201cend the abuse of parole and asylum provisions currently used to prevent the lawful removal of removable aliens.\u201d\n\nMostly, Trump wants to tighten up enforcement of existing rules, a position the Left has found to be valuable fodder for their campaign to discredit the new president. Guadalupe Garcia de Reyos, a mother of two convicted of using a fake Social Security number who was recently deported after 8 years in the U.S. has become the poster child of the inhumanity of the Trump White House. Eleven-year-old Arlette Rocha, who hanged herself in 2010 because Obama\u2019s team deported her father, is long forgotten.\n\nThese are real people with tragic stories; Americans are sympathetic. But they are also unhappy that our borders are porous. In fiscal 2016, border agents apprehended 409,000 illegals at the southern border alone. Brandon Judd, head of the National Border Control Council, claims that for every person caught, another gets into the country. If that is the case, in one year we have nearly half a million people who come in without proper papers. That is not the way a rule of law nation is supposed to function."}, {"date": "2017/02/21", "title": "The Hidden Effect of Trump\u2019s New Immigration Orders", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/21/Hidden-Effect-Trump-s-New-Immigration-Orders", "text": "Most of the attention being paid to the two memoranda from the Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly that implements President Trump\u2019s executive order on Immigration has focused on the elements of the directives that are clear and unambiguous. But immigrants\u2019 rights activists are also worried about one section of the new instruction to the Office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement that is rather vague.\n\nThe two memoranda, dated February 20, order numerous concrete moves by the agencies that enforce the country\u2019s immigration laws. Both ICE and Customs and Border Protection have been instructed to build new detention facilities near the border with Mexico, presumably to accommodate a large influx of detainees. Immigration officers are given much wider latitude to initiate deportation proceedings, and plans are in process to ship undocumented immigrants back to their home countries before a court has heard their cases. And ICE is instructed to hire 10,000 new officers.\n\nRelated: Trump Scores a Bipartisan Win With His Pick for National Security Adviser\n\nAll of this and more has generated widespread angst in immigrant communities across the country. But another part of one of the orders is worrying immigrant activists who fear that it could have implications beyond run-of-the-mill arrests and deportations.\n\nSection D of the memo titled \u201cEnforcement of the Immigration Laws to Serve the National Interest\u201d contains a directive for the establishment of a program meant to provide help and information to people who have been victims of criminal activity by undocumented immigrants. Known as the Victims of Immigrant Crime Engagement (VOICE) Office, the program would be funded, at least in part, by eliminating services that provide assistance to undocumented individuals.\n\n\u201cCriminal aliens routinely victimize Americans and other legal residents,\u201d the memo reads. \u201cOften, these victims are not provided adequate information about the offender, the offender's immigration status, or any enforcement action taken by ICE against the offender.\u201d\n\nTherefore, Kelly instructs ICE to create the VOICE office and to \u201creallocate any and all resources that are currently used to advocate on behalf of illegal aliens (except as necessary to comply with a judicial order) to the new VOICE office, and to immediately terminate the provision of such outreach or advocacy services to illegal aliens.\"\n\nRelated: White House Denies Plan to Use Guard Troops as Deportation Force\n\nWhat exactly that means, though, is unclear to experts in immigration law and policy.\n\nWilliam A. Stock, the president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association said that the language might refer to the remnants of the Office of the Public Advocate, a short-lived unit in ICE created to \u201cserve as a point of contact for individuals, including those in immigration proceedings, NGOs, and other community and advocacy groups, who have concerns, questions, recommendations or important issues they would like to raise.\u201d\n\nRepublicans in Congress immediately moved to defund the office, which many considered to be a taxpayer-funded advocate for illegal immigrants. Some of its operations were folded into the Office of Community Engagement within ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations.\n\n\u201cSome Republican House members, particularly Diane Black of Tennessee, accused the Public Advocate office of being able to \u2018lobby for illegal immigrants, and since it was defunded, some anti-immigration advocates have charged that is what the Office of Community Engagement does,\u201d said Stock.\n\nRelated: Extreme Muslim Immigration Ban Suggests Bannon Is Running the White House\n\nHe added, \u201cIn my experience, what OCE actually does is try to facilitate communication between ICE and communities of US citizens who may be affected by enforcement and removal actions, such as local law enforcement, local and state officials, and the broader community.\u201d\n\nUndermining OCE, he said, in combination with an administration bent on visibly accelerating the rate of deportation, could lead to unfair proceedings.\n\n\u201cI am concerned that pressure on ICE and CBP to achieve high removal numbers and create a climate of \u2018enforcement only\u2019 immigration actions will cause officers and leaders to give less consideration to humanitarian considerations and due process than is necessary for a fair removal process,\u201d Stock said.\n\nOther immigrants\u2019 rights activists said they were worried about how far into the system the directive to eliminate \u201cadvocacy\u201d and \u201coutreach\u201d might reach.\n\nAvideh Moussavian, a policy attorney with the National Immigration Law Center, pointed out that the language in the administration\u2019s policy pronouncements goes out of its way to describe a climate of criminality in the immigrant community.\n\nRelated: Team Trump on Immigration Disruption: \u2018It\u2019s a Small Price to Pay\u2019\n\n\u201cSo much of the emphasis of the executive order and these implementing memos really reflects a strongly held belief that Americans are somehow at greater security risk because of the presence of non-citizens immigrants.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Moussavian said, illegal immigrants are disproportionately victims of crime, because perpetrators assume they will be reluctant to go to the authorities.\n\n\u201cGiven their lack of status they are targeted,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery day we hear stories of immigrants being targeted as victims of crime based on the perception that they are undocumented immigrants.\u201d\n\nThere are actually special non-immigrant visas available to victims of crime. \u201cT\u201d visas are issued to some victims of human trafficking, while \u201cU\u201d visas are available to undocumented victims of various crimes in the US including domestic violence, assault, rape, involuntary servitude and more.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Immigration and Obamacare Policies Could Trigger a GOP Backlash\n\nOne question troubling activists now is whether \u201cadvocacy\u201d and \u201coutreach\u201d include making victims of human trafficking aware of their potential eligibility for a T visa and providing them guidance? Or providing similar help to domestic abuse victims regarding their eligibility for a U visa?\n\nThe language in the implementing order is unclear, and ICE did not reply to a request for clarification.\n\n\u201cWhile I know of no specific effort to curtail programs that make victims aware of immigration relief such as T and U visas, it is also true that letting them know of such relief and having them apply for it could slow down removal operations in those cases, which would harm the administration\u2019s enforcement priority,\u201d said Stock of AILA."}, {"date": "2017/02/21", "title": "EPA Chief\u2019s Magical Thinking: Push Energy Production and Protect the Planet", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/21/EPA-Chief-s-Magical-Thinking-Push-Energy-Production-and-Protect-Planet", "text": "The Trump administration offered a foretaste of its environmental policy with a speech on Tuesday by Scott Pruitt, the new Environmental Protection Agency administrator.

Marijuana doesn\u2019t address her underlying disease, but it does relieve her painful symptoms.\n\nRelated: How West Virginia Became Ground Zero for the Opioid Epidemic\n\nNationwide, an estimated 1.4 million patients in 28 states and the District of Columbia use legal medical marijuana for a varying list of conditions. A much smaller number of patients in 16 states use limited extracts of the plant, primarily to treat seizure disorders.\n\nIn the midst of an opioid crisis, some medical practitioners and researchers believe that greater use of marijuana for pain relief could result in fewer people using the highly addictive prescription painkillers that led to the epidemic.\n\nA 2016 study by researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found that states with medical marijuana laws had 25 percent fewer opioid overdose deaths than states that do not have medical marijuana laws. And another study published in Health Affairs last year found that prescriptions for opioid painkillers such as OxyContin, Vicodin and Percocet paid for by Medicare dropped substantially in states that adopted medical marijuana laws.\n\nIn December, the New York Health Department said it would start allowing some patients with certain types of chronic pain to use marijuana as long as they have tried other therapies. The state\u2019s original medical marijuana law, along with those in Connecticut, Illinois, New Hampshire and New Jersey, did not include chronic pain as an allowable condition for marijuana use, in part over concerns that such a broad category of symptoms could result in widespread and potentially inappropriate use of the controversial medicine.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Health Secretary Invested in a Company Linked to the Opioid Epidemic\n\nAdvocates for greater use of medical marijuana argue that including chronic pain as an allowable condition could result in even further reductions in dangerous opioid use.\n\nBut some physicians remain cautious about recommending the botanical medicine as a pain management tool.\n\nScant Research\n\nDr. Jane Ballantyne, a pain specialist at the University of Washington and president of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, which promotes the use of alternatives to opioids for chronic pain, said she does not recommend that her patients try marijuana.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt marijuana is much safer than opiates. So we don\u2019t discourage its use.\u201d But in general, she said, \u201cnon-drug treatments are far more helpful than any drug treatment, and marijuana is a drug.\u201d\n\nAt Mount Sinai Hospital here in the city, Dr. Houman Danesh, director of integrative pain management, suggests patients try physical therapy, yoga, acupuncture, stem cell therapy, nutrition counseling, hypnosis and behavioral health counseling before resorting to opioids or any other medications. He said lack of sufficient research to back up marijuana\u2019s safety and efficacy has kept him from adding it to his pain management toolkit, but he doesn\u2019t rule it out in the near future.\n\nIn January, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a review of 10,000 medical marijuana studies published since 1999, showing that substantial evidence supports the use of marijuana or its extracts for the treatment of chronic pain. Existing research also supports its effectiveness in treating multiple-sclerosis-related muscle spasms and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, according to the literature review. But the study cautioned that both the positive and negative health effects of marijuana need to be studied further.\n\nRelated: States Worry That Obamacare Repeal Could Hurt Opioid Addiction Efforts\n\nHistorically, research on marijuana has been hamstrung by the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, which classifies marijuana along with heroin and LSD as illegal substances with \u201cno currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\u201d As a result, the supply of legal marijuana that can be studied and federal funds to pursue academic research are limited.\n\nSlow and Cautious\n\nSince 1996, when California voters ushered in the first law legalizing medical marijuana, the progression of states adopting similar laws has been slow and steady. California\u2019s law was only one paragraph long and it didn\u2019t limit the use of marijuana to any specific conditions. Since then, most state laws have included more detail about marijuana\u2019s allowable uses.\n\nEnacted in 2014, New York\u2019s medical marijuana law is considered among the most cautious in the nation. Americans for Safe Access, a patient advocacy group, gives the state a letter grade of C when it comes to balancing product safety and ease of access to the emerging medicine.\n\nNew York allows doctors to certify patients to purchase marijuana at a limited number of highly regulated dispensaries \u2014 20 statewide, including four in New York City \u2014 for the treatment of 10 conditions: cancer, HIV infection or AIDS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS, Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord damage, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, neuropathies and Huntington\u2019s disease.\n\nIn the fall, after two years of operation, the state health agency declared its medical marijuana program a success and expanded its rules to allow nurse practitioners to certify patients for marijuana use. The state also approved home delivery for patients too ill to travel and announced it would certify more manufacturers of marijuana extracts to increase the supply of tinctures, liquid capsules, sprays and vape cartridges available for patients who rely on them.\n\nRelated: The Tiniest Victims of the Heroin Crisis: A Baby With Opioid Withdrawal Is Born Every 25 Minutes\n\nRemarkable Results\n\nSibulski\u2019s physician, Dr. Howard Shapiro, started certifying patients for marijuana about a year ago and quickly became a believer. He\u2019s one of only 371 doctors out of nearly 33,000 in the city\u2019s five boroughs registered to certify patients for medical marijuana. Statewide, only 863 out of roughly 96,000 physicians have signed up for the program.\n\nTechnically, doctors can\u2019t prescribe marijuana for their patients because federal law prohibits it. But under New York and most other state laws, doctors can verify that patients are suffering from an allowable condition, which authorizes patients to purchase marijuana on their own at a regulated dispensary. So far, Medicaid, Medicare and most private insurance do not cover medical marijuana, so patients must pay out of pocket.\n\nAs a primary care doctor who takes a holistic approach to medicine, Shapiro said trying medical marijuana was a natural for him. But he said he worried that \u201ca bunch of druggies would start showing up.\u201d Instead, he said the patients he began seeing were all very sick and none of them appeared to be seeking drugs for fun. The improvement he saw in those first patients was remarkable, he said.\n\n\u201cI really think medical marijuana is the drug of the future,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find out that it does a lot of things we already think it can do, but don\u2019t have scientific studies to prove it.\u201d\n\nOut of 109 patients he\u2019s seen over the past year, all but a handful reported substantial improvement in their pain and other symptoms within a month or two of using medical marijuana, he said.\n\nFor Shapiro\u2019s patients, the cost of marijuana treatment ranges from $300 to $400 a month, depending on their level of use. Sibulski said her monthly bill is about $400.\n\nRelated: 44% of Americans Say They Know Someone Addicted to Pain Killers\n\n\u201cI urge my patients to purchase only a two-week supply at first, so they don\u2019t waste money on a dose that may not be effective,\u201d Shapiro said. Most patients start out with a 1-to-1 ratio of THC, the intoxicating component of marijuana, to CBD, the second major component, which has proven to be medically effective for a range of conditions.\n\nPatients typically need to work with the dispensary to adjust their ratio so that the medication alleviates their symptoms but doesn\u2019t get them too high to function, Shapiro explained. It\u2019s a trial-and-error process, he said.\n\nMost marijuana patients take a tincture or liquid capsule every four to six hours during the day and use a vape pen to inhale a faster-acting dose of marijuana extract when they have breakthrough symptoms. Sibulski said she uses a vape pen before she gets out of bed in the morning, because it almost instantly wards off her abdominal spasms. She then takes an oral dose, which kicks in within one to two hours.\n\nLast Resort\n\nAt 36, when she quit her job last year, Sibulski said she feared she would be permanently disabled and never be able to return to work. She had seen multiple specialists and tried a medicine cabinet full of prescribed drugs, including OxyContin and muscle relaxers, to relieve her pain and abdominal spasms, but nothing worked.\n\nOnce she was unemployed, Sibulski said she experimented on her own with street-purchased marijuana and found that it worked better than anything else she had tried.

That\u2019s when she realized she couldn\u2019t pass a drug test, which she said most employers she spoke to required.\n\nIn December, Sibulski found Shapiro through a Yelp listing and brought him her medical files so he could consider certifying her to use pharmaceutical-grade marijuana.

As a certified marijuana patient, she\u2019s hoping potential employers will waive that part of the drug test.\n\nDr. Stephen Dahmer, a primary care doctor and chief medical officer of Vireo Health of New York, one of five state-approved medical marijuana producers, said Sibulski\u2019s story is typical.\n\n\u201cMany marijuana patients are what we call the \u2018intractables.\u2019 They try everything the medical system has to offer, and they finally find relief from medical cannabis,\u201d he said.\n\nDahmer says he agrees with the state\u2019s cautious approach. \u201cWe physicians take an oath to \u2018do no harm.\u2019 But unfortunately, he said, it means a lot of patients who could benefit from marijuana aren\u2019t getting access to it. \u201cIt\u2019s my hope that the door will open wider in the future and medical marijuana will become a first-line treatment.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared on Stateline.

Others have caused puzzlement, like putting celebrated neurosurgeon Ben Carson in charge at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nRelated: F-18 vs. F-35: Why Is Trump Talking Up the Super Hornet?\n\nThe announcement on Sunday that Trump had chosen Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster to be his closest adviser (officially, at least) on matters of national security -- and the news that, unlike a previous well-qualified candidate, he had accepted -- generated something close to a sigh of relief in the national security community.\n\nThe 54-year-old Philadelphia native has served in the Army for more than 30 years, and has a long history of brilliance both on the battlefield and in academia. He distinguished himself in both the first and second Iraq wars. In 1991, as a captain leading a tank unit in the Battle of 73 Easting, he oversaw a decisive victory over a numerically superior Iraqi force. In 2004, as a colonel, he oversaw the pacification of the city of Tal Afar, which became a case study in fighting insurgencies.\n\nBetween those deployments, McMaster earned a Ph.D. in military history from the University of North Carolina. His dissertation on the failure of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to stand up to the Lyndon Johnson administration during an escalation of the Vietnam War that he saw as hopeless turned into the bestselling book Dereliction of Duty.\n\nSen. John McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has been free with his criticism of the Trump administration in recent weeks, but he had nothing but praise for this move. \u201cI give President Trump great credit for this decision,\u201d he said after the announcement on Sunday.\n\nRelated: How John McCain Became the Face of GOP Resistance to Trump\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, the hawkish lawmaker from Arkansas, served in the Army with McMaster, and reportedly pressed the Trump administration to hire him. He described the general as \u201c\u201cone of the finest combat leaders of our generation and also a great strategic mind. He is a true warrior scholar.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, Susan Rice, who served as President Obama\u2019s National Security Adviser, wrote, \u201cCongrats to Lt Gen McMaster. I wish you every success as National Security Advisor. Hope you will be able to choose your team, have direct reporting and daily access to POTUS, and can eliminate Strategic Initiatives Group. Please trust, empower, support the extraordinary professional, largely career NSC staff. They won't let you down.\u201d\n\nRice was referring to two things that have caused concern among national security professionals. The Strategic Initiatives Group is an assemblage of administration employees centered on White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. It is largely seen as a shadow National Security Council that might challenge the authority of the real NSC, which McMaster will chair.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of respect for HR,\u201d Michael McFaul, who served as ambassador to Russia under President Obama, wrote on Twitter. \u201cHR will not roll over and salute Bannon.\u201d\n\nRice had also been referring to the tension over NSC staffing that has characterized the search for Flynn\u2019s replacement. One candidate, retired Admiral Robert Harward, reportedly turned down the job in part because he was told that he would not have full control over who served on his staff.\n\nRelated: Why Can\u2019t Trump Get His Story Straight on Intelligence Leaks and Fake News?\n\nOn Sunday, prior to the announcement that McMaster had been selected, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said that the administration\u2019s position was now that the new national security adviser would have full authority to staff the NSC in the way he or she saw fit.\n\nMcMaster\u2019s appointment will go a long way toward calming national security professionals who were genuinely distressed at the prospect of Flynn running the NSC.

Grover Norquist genetically manufactured the entire caucus in a lab to robotically give speeches about how tax cuts spawn economic growth. So why are Republicans having such a tough time coming up with a viable tax cut plan?\n\nThe answer lies with the Republican\u2019s inability to say no to anyone. They have played Santa Claus for so long, promising to pull an endless supply of free money out of their white sack, they cannot comprehend the very concept of a trade-off.\n\nThe House Republican tax rewrite looks very familiar. A full 99.6 percent of its benefits flow to the wealthy, according to analysis from the Tax Policy Center. It would cut individual, corporate and capital gains rates, and eliminate the tax on inheritances. It would increase the deficit by more than $3 trillion in the first decade. That sounds like a re-run of George W. Bush\u2019s 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, which failed to stimulate much growth but made the very wealthy very happy.\n\nThere\u2019s a new wrinkle this time: a controversial measure called a border adjustment tax, which exempts exports from taxation while effectively imposing a 20 percent tax on imports.\n\nRelated: Why Ryan\u2019s \u2018Border Adjustment\u2019 Import Tax Is So Controversial\n\nAnyone claiming they know the consequences of this isn\u2019t telling the truth. Many assume raising taxes on imports and lowering them on exports will boost domestic manufacturing and reverse the trade deficit. But some economists believe that the dollar would grow stronger in reaction, making domestic products more expensive and wiping out the benefit, while also straining emerging markets that carry debt based in dollars. Others disagree that the effects on trade would cancel out, because countries would act to prevent the strong dollar impacts. In that scenario, consumer-facing importers like retailers and gas companies could pass on the tax in the form of higher prices, shifting the burden to their customers. Or, by simplifying the collection of tax, the real losers could be companies that manipulate the system. Oh yeah, the whole thing might also be illegal under global trade rules.\n\nThis uncertainty has created political enemies for the border tax, particularly among powerful businesses that import a lot of goods. They aren\u2019t buying the argument that exchange rates will save their business model, or that they could quickly shift production to the U.S. to compensate. So retailers have formed anti-border tax lobbying coalitions, using the potential for higher consumer prices as a key talking point. Retail executives met with Trump to express their dismay last week. Koch Industries, a major oil importer, has also pushed hard against the provision. Domestic manufacturers, meanwhile, are supporting the border tax with their own front groups, signaling a lobbyist battle royale in which Congress simply tries to negotiate between competing corporate interests.\n\nRetailers have found success among Republican senators, who aren\u2019t as wedded to the tax plan. Utah\u2019s Orrin Hatch, who chairs the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, isn\u2019t taking a position on border adjustment yet. But Georgia Sen. David Perdue stated flatly that the tax \u201cis a bad idea and should not become a permanent part of the tax code.\u201d Perdue was the longtime CEO of Dollar General, a low-margin retailer that imports almost everything, precisely the type of company worried by this idea.\n\nRelated: The $1 Trillion Border Tax Could Sink Paul Ryan\u2019s Fiscal Plan\n\nAfter House Speaker Paul Ryan tried to calm nerves in a closed-door Senate meeting, Sen. Tom Cotton, who represents Walmart\u2019s home state of Arkansas, defied him on the Senate floor. Cotton said he and his colleagues \u201cwill not keep our powder dry and see working Americans railroaded with a precooked deal that raises their taxes and increases the prices of the stuff they buy every single day.\u201d President Trump\u2019s economic advisers are split on the idea, and when his tax blueprint is released in a couple weeks, it may or may not include border adjustment.\n\nIf this import tax causes so much strain among Republicans and their corporate benefactors, why are they bothering with it? The biggest reason is that, because of our current trade deficit, a tax on imports looks like it raises over a trillion dollars, allowing Republicans to plow more money into tax cuts for the rich. I say \u201clooks like\u201d because again, we don\u2019t know how border adjustment will play out. But the way budget scoring works, with its focus on the current baseline, ensures that border adjustment appears to raise money. It\u2019s a gimmick, but one Republicans need to make their plan work.\n\nOffsetting the tax cuts satisfies an anti-deficit Tea Party faction, while helping solve the biggest problem with avoiding a Democratic filibuster. Under budget reconciliation, Republicans can pass big tax cuts with only 50 Senate votes. However, under reconciliation rules they cannot pass a plan that increases the deficit after the first 10 years. The Bush tax cuts, also passed under reconciliation, simply phased out after 10 years to meet this obligation. But offsetting tax cuts with revenue-raisers in the out years can also be part of the solution.\n\nRelated: Dueling Trump and GOP Tax Plans Would Cause Much Larger Deficits\n\nRepublicans don\u2019t have a Plan B for raising a trillion dollars. A previous tax code rewrite included a bank tax; Wall Street opposed it. Another lengthened the time for depreciation of assets for write-offs; multinational corporations with major equipment investments opposed it. There\u2019s always the option of not offsetting any of the tax cuts and claiming that massive economic growth will pay for everything. But Congress\u2019 budget scorers can\u2019t fully comply with this directive, making that trillion dollars critical to building a revenue-neutral plan that can be made permanent in reconciliation.\n\nThis is where Republicans run into an uncomfortable fact: They don\u2019t want to say no to anyone. In a very real sense they don\u2019t believe they have to.\n\nConservative economic theory has become so corrupted by the idea that tax cuts solve everything that an overhaul of the tax code creating winners and losers does not compute. Republicans don\u2019t want to upset the retailers or the manufacturers, the wealthy or the middle class, the budget hawks or the military spenders. So they\u2019ve concocted an elaborate fantasy world, where nobody has to be damaged by radical shifts in the tax code that transfer wealth upwards.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Budget Cuts Distract from Nation\u2019s Much Larger Fiscal Problems\n\nThis problem has spilled over into the Obamacare replacement as well. Republicans want to repeal the taxes that fund Obamacare \u2014 all of which fall on the wealthy \u2014 in part to create a lower revenue baseline for their tax plan. But they still have to find some money to fund a replacement. The biggest funding source available comes from limiting the tax break on employer-based health insurance, which cost $216 billion just last year. But that would hit workers with huge taxes on their health care and a likely loss of coverage for many.\n\nWithout Obamacare repeal resetting the revenue base, tax reform is really in peril. Republicans may go from two huge legislative victories to none. And that\u2019s because they have no interest in legislating, particularly in navigating the often painful compromises that necessarily result. It\u2019s a funny thing about running the government \u2014 you have to govern."}, {"date": "2017/02/21", "title": "Why Ryan\u2019s \u2018Border Adjustment\u2019 Import Tax Is So Controversial", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/21/Why-Ryan-s-Border-Adjustment-Import-Tax-So-Controversial", "text": "The centerpiece of House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s major corporate tax reform \u2013 a 20 percent \u201cborder adjustment\u201d tax on all imported goods to help offset the more than $1.2 trillion cost of across the board tax cuts for corporations and individuals\u2014just took another hit over the weekend.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said on Sunday during an appearance on the CBS News\u2019 Face the Nation that the House plan won\u2019t garner even 10 votes in the Senate, where the Republicans currently hold a 52 to 48 seat advantage over the Democrats.\n\nRelated: The $1 Trillion Border Tax Could Sink Paul Ryan\u2019s Fiscal Plan\n\n\u201cThe Congress is stumbling,\u201d Graham said. \u201cRepublicans in the Congress \u2013 we\u2019re all tied up in knots.

That includes repealing taxes associated with Obamacare as well lowering corporate and individual taxes.\n\nHowever, without the border adjustment tax provision, which is estimated to raise more than $1.2 trillion over the coming decade, the amount that will be needed to offset the massive tax cuts would raise the deficit even further.\n\nRyan and Ways and Means Committee Chair Kevin Brady (R-TX) wrote last year, in first announcing their plan, \u201cFrom the perspective of America\u2019s place in the global economy, the new tax system will focus on investment in America and investment for America.\u201d\n\nRelated: Dueling Trump and GOP Tax Plans Would Cause Much Larger Deficits\n\n\u201cThe focus on business cash flow, which is a move toward a consumption-based approach to taxation, will allow the United States to adopt, for the first time in history, the same destination-based approach to taxation that has long been used by our trading partners.,\u201d they added. \u201cThis will end the self-imposed unilateral penalty for exports and subsidy for imports that are fundamental flaws in the current U.S. tax system.\u201d\n\nBut the border adjustment idea is proving to be a tough sell. And even Trump, who is eager to push through a major tax cut this year, has said that Ryan\u2019s plan may be \u201ctoo complicated\u201d to sell to Congress and the public.\n\nSo what exactly is Ryan\u2019s plan, what would it do, and why is it so controversial? Here is a layman\u2019s guide to the plan.\n\nHow would the border adjustment work? It would alter the current corporate tax structure by essentially imposing a tax or levy of 20 percent on all imports \u2013 including components and parts used in assembly \u2013 while exempting U.S. exporters from any taxes. Viewed another way, U.S. companies would no longer have to report revenue generated by their overseas sales as taxable income, but for the same token, they could no longer claim expenses incurred by importing goods and materials as deductible from their federal tax obligation.\n\n\u201cThis would shift the current corporate income tax from an origin-based tax\u2014one that applies to the production of goods and services in the United States\u2014to a destination-based tax\u2014one that applies to the consumption of goods and services in the United State,\u201d according to a Tax Foundation analysis.\n\nRelated: Ryan Declares GOP Has a \u2018Mandate\u2019 to Enact Sweeping Changes\n\nWhy is it so controversial? The proposed border adjustment is arguably the most revolutionary idea in corporate tax reform movement in decades and \u2013 if approved \u2013 would transform the corporate income tax code into something similar to the European value-added tax or VAT.\n\nRyan argues that his plan is needed to rectify a trade disadvantage that the current tax system creates for U.S. producers. While most countries levy taxes based on consumption within their borders, the United States taxes its companies based on their income -- including from exports. As a result, he says, U.S. exporters get hit with taxes at home and abroad, putting them at a huge competitive disadvantage.\n\nHowever, Ryan\u2019s plan would also, overnight, create new categories of corporate winners and losers and invariably drive up prices for U.S. consumers.\n\nWho would benefit most from the change? Clearly, the border adjustment approach would be a boon to export-driven companies, including manufacturers of electronic equipment, machinery, aircraft, munitions, cars, and tobacco. American companies shipped $1.4 trillion worth of goods around the globe in 2016, down slightly from previous years. Supporters of the House plan say it would encourage domestic investment and reward companies that manufacture in the U.S.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Budget Cuts Distract from Nation\u2019s Much Larger Fiscal Problems\n\nWho would be the biggest losers? Any business that relies heavily on imports would be stung by the border adjustment tax, and that includes retailers, foreign car dealers, toy manufacturers and oil refineries. Major retailers like Wal-Mart and Target that obtain many of their products from Asia and other markets with cheap labor would be hard hit by the border adjustment.\n\nCompanies heavily reliant on imports would no longer be able to deduct their import costs as a regular business expense and would have no choice but to pass on their added tax obligation to consumers in the form of higher retail prices. Cody Lusk, president of the American International Automobile Dealers Association, recently told the Wall Street Journal that his members view the proposed 20 percent tax on imports as \u201ca very, very serious potential blow to the auto sector and the economy.\u201d\n\nSen. David Perdue (R-GA), the former top executive of Dollar General and Reebok, has led the opposition to Ryan\u2019s plan and recently described it in a letter to colleagues as a regressive plan that \u201chammers consumers,\u201d according to The Hill.\n\nRelated: Five Big Challenges Facing Trump\u2019s New Budget Chief\n\nWould the border adjustment tax strengthen or weaken the dollar? Ryan and other proponents contend that their plan would result in a stronger U.S. dollar, which in turn would somewhat ameliorate the economic disparities between the winners and losers. A stronger dollar would make imports less expensive and exports costlier. That change alone would negate the tax\u2019s effect on importers and exporters, according to Bloomberg. However, opponents say it\u2019s not as simple as that, and that other factors can alter currency valuations."}, {"date": "2017/02/20", "title": "In the Age of Trump, Who Can US Allies Believe?", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/20/Age-Trump-Who-Can-US-Allies-Believe", "text": "Under other circumstances, comments about Vice President Mike Pence made by Rep.

Get ready for another round of battles over public employee benefits.\n\nThis month, UC Berkeley\u2019s Haas Institute, a progressive research center, has stepped into the maelstrom, arguing that the problem is overblown. In a policy brief, analyst Tom Sgouros correctly points out that a pension plan need not be fully funded to continue making payments over long periods of time, and even questions whether 100 percent funding is an appropriate objective.\n\nWhile Sgouros and like-minded public finance experts make some valid points, they may be surprised to learn that public employee pensions are becoming a driver of income inequality.\n\nRelated: Ratings Agency Sends a Dire Warning About Trump's Economic Plan\n\nSgouros is right that, for most governments, pension underfunding is a not a near term solvency issue. Take CalPERS, the nation\u2019s largest public pension system, as an example. Although only 73 percent funded, CalPERS is far from broke. As of June 30, 2016, it had $299 billion in net assets. In 2016, CalPERS collected $15 billion in member and employer contributions, while incurring $21 billion in benefit and administrative costs. Since 2007, contributions have been increasing at a 5 percent annual rate while expenses have been rising 8 percent a year. Over the long term, this is unsustainable, but a crisis is far in the future. Assuming expenses and contributions continue growing at historical rates and investment returns are zero, CalPERS would not run out of money until 2032.\n\nSuggestions that the nation is facing a wave of pension-driven municipal bankruptcies are overheated. We have not seen a major city bankruptcy since mid-2013, and it is not clear that the few bona fide government financial crises that have occurred over the last decade were primarily the result of pension underfunding. Flat or declining revenue and a failure to maintain adequate general fund reserves better explain fiscal emergencies that confronted Vallejo, Stockton, San Bernardino, Detroit and Puerto Rico in recent years. Pension obligations come due over an extended time frame and at highly predictable rates, so it is hard to imagine them triggering an emergency without one or more other factors coming into play.\n\nFiscal hawks like me are prone to exaggerate the pension funding crisis for a variety of reasons. Many of us have accounting and financial management backgrounds, which engender a strong preference for balanced books. The fact that politicians make pension promises without setting aside enough funds to cover them under conservative assumptions is morally offensive. For us, witnessing that type of behavior is akin to an environmentalist seeing a smoke stack belching out greenhouse gases. Like the environmentalist anxious to draw public attention to climate change, we want the public to share our concerns about fiscal unsustainability \u2014 and can sometimes omit necessary nuance from our arguments.\n\nRelated: States Face a $1 Trillion Pension Problem \u2014 Here Are the Worst 10\n\nBut critiques of pension funding may have pecuniary motives in some cases. For example, if governments can be convinced to increase funding levels, that means pension systems will have more money to allocate to mutual funds and other money managers. Since these financial players normally quote their fees as a percentage of assets under management, more pension funding leads to higher revenues.\n\nIf government agencies can be convinced to replace their defined benefit programs with defined contribution plans, financial interests stand to make even more money. Individually managed employer-sponsored retirement plans \u2014 known as 401(k) plans in the private sector \u2014 generate substantial fees for the firms that manage them. The median management fee for a 401(k) plan is 0.67 percent of fund assets, while the expense ratio for equity funds offered by 401(k) plans averages 0.53 percent. Combining these two amounts, we find that plan participants pay about 1.20 percent annually in overhead for shareholdings in a defined contribution plan. This compares with an average management overhead for defined benefits plans of only 0.43 percent. So moving employees from defined benefit to defined contribution plans can provide a windfall to the financial industry.\n\nPensions and Income Inequality\n\nAlthough progressives may be right that the sky isn\u2019t falling, they may be surprised to learn about the impact that certain pensions have on income inequality. In California, over 50,000 public sector retirees are receiving annual pension benefits in excess of $100,000 \u2014 and in many cases, way over $100,000. In a new video, California Policy Center profiles four retirees receiving up to $350,000 annually.\n\nRelated: $1.7 Trillion in Unfunded State Pensions Is Squeezing Vital Public Programs\n\nThese high-income beneficiaries are not the clerks, caregivers and bus drivers typically represented by unions like AFSCME and SEIU. Instead, they are retired managers, academics, physicians and public safety officers. Among the retired police and fire officers, many put in 30 years of service earning retirement credits at a rate of 3 percent per year. This entitles them to retire at 90 percent of final compensation, which is often \u201cspiked\u201d through last-minute promotions and payouts for unused sick and vacation time. The average California Highway Patrol officer who has retired since 1999 receives $96,270 per year and more than 1,000 CHP retirees collect over $100,000 annually.\n\nSenior managers at public agencies have the power to affect retirement rules, allowing them to cash out in the process. In 2004, administrators in the inland California city of Redding convinced Council members to approve a supplementary retirement benefit program offered by Public Agency Retirement Services (PARS). A year-and-a-half later, Redding City Manager Mike Warren retired. Now, in addition to his annual CalPERS benefit of $198,000, he receives $50,000 each year from PARS. Warren\u2019s total pension income of $248,000 annually is almost six times Redding\u2019s median household income of $43,000. Meanwhile, the city now has to contribute $6 million per year to fund its supplementary pensions, a large burden for a struggling community of 92,000 people.\n\nPolicy Options\n\nReformers and progressives may be able to agree on policies that rein in the biggest pension payouts, as a matter of fairness and to free up public funds for other uses. But changes designed to contain windfall pension benefits are difficult to implement in states that have adopted the California Rule, which protects public sector workers from reductions in retirement benefits.\n\nRelated: The Retirement Revolution That Failed \u2014 Why the 401(k) Isn\u2019t Working\n\nOne option that may get around this restriction is to impose a surtax on retirement benefits exceeding a certain level. For example, a state could tax retirement benefits over $100,000 at a rate of 25 percent, and benefits over $200,000 at a marginal rate of 50 percent. Such a tax would not impact anyone receiving a pension of $100,000 or less. If enacted, this policy would have to survive a California Rule court challenge and address the risk of retirees moving out of state to avoid the tax.\n\nAnother idea is to implement some form of risk sharing for benefits above a certain level. One problem with most defined-benefit plans is that taxpayers are on the hook when pension assets don\u2019t grow at the sometimes lofty rates assumed. It may be fair to provide this type of security to public employees at lower income levels, but, at some point, funding this guarantee becomes regressive: with low-income city residents paying extra sales taxes to guarantee large pension payouts.\n\nA way to address this inequity is to limit the annual service credit pension formula to salaries up to $50,000. For income above that level, member and employer pension contributions would be held in a separate account that grows at the same rate as that earned by the pension system. At retirement, this balance would then be annuitized and paid on top of the guaranteed benefit. This proposal has some similarities to a defined contribution approach, but the money remains in the public employee pension system, avoiding extra fees.\n\nPublic employee pensions are unlikely to trigger a tsunami of municipal bankruptcies any time soon, but the need to fund these plans is placing pressure on local government budgets and crowding out other spending priorities. Under the circumstances, it seems fair to ask higher income pension beneficiaries and future beneficiaries to contribute to a solution."}, {"date": "2017/02/19", "title": "Priebus Claims Report of Trump Campaign Contacts with Russians Is \u2018Garbage\u2019  ", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/19/Priebus-Claims-Report-Trump-Campaign-Contacts-Russians-Garbage", "text": "White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, during multiple appearances today on the Sunday talk shows, stopped just short of agreeing with his boss President Trump that the media is the \u201cenemy of the American people\u201d and is no longer a credible news source.\n\nContrary to Trump\u2019s unprecedented rants against the news media \u2013 most recently during his 45-minute, campaign-style rally in Melbourne, Florida, on Saturday before an adoring crowd of 9,000 \u2013 Priebus insisted that Trump still supports the First Amendment. \u201cHe believes in the free press,\u201d Priebus declared but stressed the media is biased on both sides of the ideological spectrum.\n\nRelated: How John McCain Became The Face of GOP Resistance to Trump\n\nThe former Republican National Committee chair offered a full-throated defense of Trump\u2019s complaints about \u201cfake news,\u201d especially a New York Times report last week that members of Trump\u2019s campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year leading up to the November 8 election.\n\nPriebus dismissed the newspaper\u2019s story \u2013 based on intelligence intercepts that were described to The Times by unnamed sources \u2013 as \u201cgarbage\u201d and totally unfounded.\n\n\u201cI can assure you, and I\u2019ve been approved to say this, that the top levels of the intelligence community have assured me that the story is not only inaccurate but it\u2019s grossly overstated,\u201d Priebus said during an appearance on Fox News Sunday. \u201cIf I can say that to the American people, then what does it say about the story?\u201d\n\nThe Times reported that American law enforcement and intelligence agencies intercepted the communications around the same time that Russia was trying to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election by hacking into the Democratic National Committee.

In remarks to attendees, McCain systematically repudiated the president\u2019s nationalist rhetoric and his repeated insistence that the US should be less engaged in international affairs.\n\nRelated: 6 Remarkable Moments From Trump\u2019s Wild Press Conference\n\nThe Munich conference, an annual event that draws senior leaders from around the world, was founded as a means of promoting peace and stability.

He has not been the most consistent or even the strongest critic of the administration within his party. Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul were strong critics of Trump during the presidential campaign, at a time when McCain was playing the role of a loyal supporter while enduring Trump\u2019s insults in an effort to assure his own re-election.\n\nBut McCain has a combination of things that make him stand out. The first is his visibility. As a former Republican presidential nominee, he has extraordinary name recognition with the public. He also has close relationships with many in the media, his claim of \u201chating\u201d the press notwithstanding, and tends to get lots of generally favorable coverage. See, for example, this cover story in New York Magazine.\n\nThe second, and perhaps most significant, is that he has the ability to get under Trump\u2019s skin. This is most likely a side effect of his visibility. Trump is known to be a voracious consumer of cable news, and can hardly have avoided seeing McCain\u2019s critical comments about him. The president\u2019s personal Twitter feed overflows with negative comments about McCain, often in reaction to the senator\u2019s public statements.\n\nLast week, when McCain criticized a US military raid in Yemen that went badly and resulted in the death of an American special operator, Trump responded furiously on Twitter, accusing him of emboldening the enemy. His White House Press Secretary, Sean Spicer, also criticized McCain\u2019s comments, questioning his understanding of military operations (McCain is a Navy veteran and serves as Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee) and suggesting that he was somehow dishonoring the fallen warrior.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Historically Low Approval Rating Proves One Thing \u2013 He\u2019s Doing It His Way\n\nMcCain\u2019s response was cutting.\n\nJohn McCain vs. Sean Spicer.

Last year, the government\u2019s liabilities for cleaning up contaminated sites totaled $447 billion, according to Treasury Department figures, or more than double the $212 billion estimated price tag in 1997. But that latest estimate doesn\u2019t begin to reflect all of the future cleanup responsibilities federal agencies may be facing, according to the GAO report, meaning that the ultimate cost could be billions higher.\n\nRelated: Budget Watchdog Tells Trump Government Spending Is on an Unsustainable Path\n\nMany of the contaminated sites are byproducts of the Cold War era, when the government dramatically stepped up its development and stockpiling of nuclear weapons. Throughout the Cold War, the federal government enlisted hundreds of factories and research centers in Tennessee, New Mexico, Kentucky, Maine and elsewhere to help develop nuclear weapons and other forms of atomic energy.

He is widely viewed as the chief architect of the assault against former President Barack Obama\u2019s climate change policies that were aimed at sharply reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the nation\u2019s aging power plants and manufacturing plants.\n\nPruitt also shares in Trump\u2019s conviction that the federal government has overstepped its bounds in pressing for ever-tougher air standards that add billions of dollars to the operating costs of industry. He has frequently argued that much of the EPA\u2019s clean air regulatory authority should be shifted to the states.\n\nNow the fox has been put in charge of the hen house, triggering major protests not only by environmental groups and Democrats but by scores of career government workers at the EPA throughout the country who called their senators in an effort to block Pruitt\u2019s confirmation, as The New York Times reported yesterday.\n\nThe Climate Change Crisis Trump Refuses to Acknowledge\n\nTypically, career employees maintain a low profile during the transfer of power to a new administration, with the understanding that policy changes are inevitable and that they must roll with the punches. But the outpouring of opposition to Pruitt from EPA scientists, lawyers and others in the agency is extraordinary, according to the Times, and signals that civil war could break out if Pruitt seeks to dismantle the core mission of the EPA.\n\nChristine Todd Whitman, the former Republican New Jersey governor and EPA commissioner under President George W. Bush, told the newspaper that \u201cWhat it means is that it\u2019s going to be a bloodbath when Pruitt gets in there.\u201d\n\nEnvironmentalists have long complained about Pruitt\u2019s close ties with the oil and gas industry. He has received more than $300,000 from oil and gas companies during his campaigns over the years, according to The Washington Post. He also headed the Republican Attorneys General Association, which garnered generous contributions from Koch Industries, ExxonMobil and other companies.\n\nEven as Senate Republicans moved towards confirming Pruitt over the strong objections of environmental groups and Democrats, an Oklahoma judge on Thursday ordered Pruitt to hand over thousands of emails related to his communications with the fossil fuel industry. The Center for Media and Democracy has for the past two years sought those emails in attempting to document the link between Pruitt and the oil and gas industry.\n\nRelated: Obama--This May Be \u2018The Last Generation\u2019 That Can Stop Climate Change\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and other Democrats urged the GOP leadership to delay a final vote on confirmation until after a one-week recess in order to see what emerges from the emails. But Senate Republicans rejected what they viewed as another stalling tactic by the Democrats and pressed ahead to confirm Pruitt\u2019s nomination.\n\n\u201cAttorney General Pruitt has been more thoroughly vetted than any nominee for EPA administrator,\u201d said Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY), chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, in a statement. \u201cIt is time to confirm him.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/02/17", "title": "The $1 Trillion Border Tax Could Sink Paul Ryan\u2019s Fiscal Plan", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/17/1-Trillion-Border-Tax-Could-Sink-Paul-Ryan-s-Fiscal-Plan", "text": "For House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), slashing tax rates is second in importance only to repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA House GOP \u201cBetter Way\u201d plan unveiled by Ryan last year would reduce the number of individual tax rates from seven to three at substantially lower levels, nearly double the standard deductions while closing many loopholes, slash investment income taxes and lower the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent.\n\nRelated: Republicans Eye Medicaid Cuts to Finance Health Care Plan\n\nBut the centerpiece of Ryan\u2019s tax plan \u2013 and what sets it apart from President Trump\u2019s approach -- is a \u201cborder adjustment\u201d tax the speaker wants to slap on all imported goods, including materials used in U.S. manufacturing, while exempting all exported goods.\n\nThe controversial measure has seriously split the business community and its allies on Capitol Hill. Proponents see it as a major incentive for more domestic investment and expansion, while opponents warn that it would drive up retailers\u2019 import costs and force them to raise prices for consumers.\n\nThe plan has drawn fire from car dealers, toy manufacturers, oil refiners and others. And on Thursday, Americans for Prosperity, a libertarian group founded by the Koch Brothers, formally launched a campaign to defeat the measure targeted at members of the House and Senate tax writing committees, who will be wrestling with the issue later this year.\n\nAlso on Thursday, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX), the number two Republican in the Senate, may have delivered the crowning blow by telling reporters that the border tax idea \u201cis on life support\u201d and that he didn\u2019t see GOP votes in the Senate lining up behind it.\n\nRelated: Dueling Trump and GOP Tax Plans Would Cause Much Larger Deficits\n\n\u201cThe hard reality is the border tax is on life support, and given the imperative of 51 senators and 218 House members and one president, I think we need to look for other options,\u201d Cornyn said. Trump has said he would unveil a tax plan of his own within several weeks, but has yet to take an official position on the border adjustment tax.\n\nWithout the border adjustment tax provision, Ryan\u2019s overall tax cut for individuals and businesses would collapse. That\u2019s because it is estimated to raise more than $1 trillion over the coming decade, which is the amount that will be needed to offset the massive tax cuts and take down the current corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent.\n\nRyan, a former chair of the House Ways and Means Committee and an ardent proponent of the first major rewriting of the federal tax code since 1986, delivered a ringing defense of the border adjustment tax and his overall tax reform proposals during a news conference on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis is existential to our economy, and we know this,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cAnd so we\u2019re going to get tax reform done and there\u2019s going to be a whole bunch of drama.\u201d\n\nBut the border adjustment idea is proving to be a tough sell. And even Trump, who is eager to push through a major tax cut this year to make good on one of his most important campaign promises, has said that Ryan\u2019s plan may be \u201ctoo complicated\u201d to sell to Congress and the public.\n\nAccording to a Tax Foundation analysis, the border adjustment would \u201celiminate the ability for companies to deduct the cost of imports,\u201d while at the same time eliminating the tax on income attributable to exports.\n\nRelated: Ryan Declares GOP Has a \u2018Mandate\u2019 to Enact Sweeping Changes\n\n\u201cThis would shift the current corporate income tax from an origin-based tax\u2014one that applies to the production of goods and services in the United States\u2014to a destination-based tax\u2014one that applies to the consumption of goods and services in the United State,\u201d according to the analysis.\n\nAs The Wall Street Journal recently noted, the border adjustment tax would also transform the business tax system \u201cso that companies selling goods and services in the U.S. largely couldn\u2019t escape taxes by putting their addresses, intellectual property or jobs outside America in low-tax countries.\u201d\n\nScott Hodge, president of the conservative leaning Tax Foundation, said in an interview Friday that it is far too soon to write off the border adjustment tax idea, but that without it, Ryan and other House GOP leaders would have a hard time coming up with an alternative.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very key element of the plan \u2026 and because it\u2019s new, it\u2019s going to naturally be the focus of a lot of attention,\u201d Hodge said.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s either dead or even on life support,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is the natural process of things with major tax reform.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/02/17", "title": "White House Denies Plan to Use Guard Troops as Deportation Force", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/17/White-House-Denies-Plan-Use-Guard-Troops-Deportation-Force", "text": "The White House on Friday morning tried to shoot down a report that the Trump administration had drafted a plan to use National Guard troops to arrest undocumented immigrants. The report, which the Associated Press published shortly after 10 a.m., is based on an 11-page draft proposal that has been circulating within the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nHowever, some elements of the story first posted by the AP do not appear to be backed up by the document. Specifically, the news agency suggested that the number of troops involved could reach 100,000, a figure that appears nowhere in the draft memo.\n\n\u201cThis is not true. DHS also confirms it is 100% false,\u201d White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer tweeted not long after the story broke.\n\nRelated: Does Anyone Still Want to Work for the Trump Administration?\n\nSpicer also addressed the report on Air Force One, as the president traveled to his vacation home in Florida for the third weekend in a row. \u201cThere is no effort at all to utilize the National Guard to round up unauthorized immigrants,\u201d he said\n\nIt was unclear just how much the White House was pushing back against the story. The claim that there is no current effort to use the National Guard to enforce immigration law is not the same thing as denying that such a plan was or is in the works. And Spicer\u2019s categorical claim that the story was \u201c100%\u201d false seems to suggest Spicer is challenging even the provenance of the memo.\n\nHowever, other reporters from different outlets who cover DHS said that the idea of using the National Guard in this capacity has been under discussion for weeks. It was not immediately clear who leaked the memo to the AP, or for what purpose.\n\nSupporters of the Trump administration also took issue with the AP\u2019s framing of the story. The headline on the original piece posted on the service\u2019s website, \u201cTrump weighs mobilizing Nat Guard for immigration roundups,\u201d suggests that the proposal had made its way to the president\u2019s desk. In fact, it is at least possible that the plan was never discussed beyond the staff level at DHS.\n\nSpicer blasted the AP for releasing the story without comment from the administration, but the original version of the news service\u2019s story noted that both the White House and the Department of Homeland Security had failed to even respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe memo does suggest that members of the National Guard could be effectively deputized under section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows the DHS director to authorize \u201cqualified officers or employees\u201d of a state to act in the capacity of federal immigration officers.\n\n\u201cPursuant to Title 32 of the United States Code, State National Guard components are employees of their respective states and are under the command of their governors when they are not in federal service. Based on their training and experience, these men and women are particularly well-suited to assist in the enforcement of federal immigration law and augment border security operations by [DHS] components.\u201d\n\nIt further directs immigration officials to immediately invite \u201cgovernors of the states adjacent to the land border with Mexico and those states adjoining such border states\u201d to add their National Guard units to the 287(g) program.\n\nThe memo also appears to order the immediate detention of any person found crossing the border illegally until they can be deported or any claim to asylum can be adjudicated, something that would require a dramatic expansion of DHS detention facilities.\n\nThe new detention facilities would be located close to the border, the memo notes, ordering top officials to \u201ctake all necessary action and allocate all available resources to expand their detention capabilities and capacities at or near the border with Mexico to the greatest extent practicable.\n\nThe AP reported that the memo appeared to come from John Kelly, the retired Marine Corps general who President Trump appointed to run DHS. However, it is not uncommon for draft memos to carry the name of the official who would ultimately have to approve them before that approval is actually given.\n\nRelated: 6 Remarkable Moments From Trump\u2019s Wild Press Conference\n\nA national security expert who looked at the AP story said that the proposal seems to bear the hallmarks of an early-stage draft, perhaps from more junior staff.\n\n\u201cIt appears to be another one of those cases where somebody had an idea, and drafted up a memo about it, maybe without a lot of knowledge about how government actually works,\u201d said Heather Hurlburt, the former head of the National Security Network, now with the New America Foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that DHS can just do on its own. There are sort of obvious historical reasons why the guard forces belong more to the states than they do to the feds.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Republicans Have Everything to Gain by Impeaching Trump\n\nRegardless of how far up the chain of command the idea of using a National Guard deployment went in the administration, the report had more than a ring of truth given Trump\u2019s promises during the presidential campaign. He vowed to deport more than 11 million undocumented immigrants within two years and said that there would be a \u201cdeportation force\u201d mobilized for that purpose. The Border Patrol estimates that between 2013 and 2015, 2.1 million people crossed into the United States illegally over the southern border.\n\nMany commentators concerned about the draft proposals immediately warned that it would violate the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law that bars federal troops from being used as law enforcement personnel inside the United States. However, that law does not apply to state National Guard units operating under the control of their states\u2019 governors within the territory of their own state or nearby states at the invitation of their governors.\n\nThe proposal, according to the AP, specifically says that state governors would have the discretion to mobilize and that the troops would remain under state control.\n\nIn fact, National Guard troops have been used in a law enforcement capacity in the wake of some natural disasters. They have also been deployed repeatedly in recent years to assist law enforcement agencies operating on the border.\n\nRelated: Why Can\u2019t Trump Get His Story Straight on Intelligence Leaks and Fake News?\n\nHurlburt pointed out that there are legitimate worries about the wisdom of giving National Guard troops the authority to enforce immigration law.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason law enforcement personnel are highly trained and don\u2019t just walk into the job and start arresting people,\u201d she said. \u201cImagine deputizing ... people who are trained to do different things?

Mick Mulvaney (R-SC), who was narrowly confirmed by the Senate on Thursday as the new White House budget director, has the unenviable task of trying to reconcile his career as a fiery deficit hawk with President Trump\u2019s unrestrained calls for new spending and tax cuts.\n\nTrump has promised an historic buildup of the military and nuclear arsenal, construction of a wall along the southern border, a $1 trillion infrastructure program, safeguarding of Social Security and Medicare, and tax cuts for businesses and individuals that could add at least $7 trillion to the long-term debt. The president has said that a strong military is \u201cmore important\u201d than a balanced budget.\n\nRelated: Republicans Eye Medicaid Cuts to Help Finance Their New Health Plan\n\nBy contrast, Mulvaney, the one-time Tea Party champion, has been an ardent foe of defense spending and has repeatedly called for major savings in entitlement programs, including Social Security. The South Carolina Republican preferred a government shutdown to voting to raise the debt ceiling, and he only favors major tax cuts if they are offset by budget cuts or other savings.\n\nPressed during his Senate confirmation hearing last month to explain how he intends to advocate for Trump\u2019s fiscal policies while preserving his principles and integrity, the 49-year-old Mulvaney replied, \u201cMy job is to be completely and brutally honest with him.\u201d\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget is the nexus of any administration\u2019s spending and tax revenue policy making, and it has enormous influence over the operations of the federal bureaucracy and regulatory review.\n\nRelated: Are Republicans Losing Momentum on Obamacare Repeal?\n\n\u201cFirst of all, he\u2019s either going to be the most influential member of the cabinet or the next one out the door,\u201d said Stan Collender, a Washington budget expert and blogger. \u201cA lot of what Trump wants to do and the House and Senate Republicans want to do on taxes and spending are things he has fought against.\u201d\n\nAs he hits the ground running this week after barely winning Senate confirmation by a margin of 51 to 49, here are five of Mulvaney\u2019s biggest challenges as Trump\u2019s new budget chief:\n\nDefense \u2013 Mulvaney has long complained about wasteful defense spending, but he better get over it. Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, was the only Republican to vote against Mulvaney\u2019s nomination yesterday. McCain declared that it would be \u201cirresponsible to place the future of the defense budget\u201d in Mulvaney\u2019s hands.\n\nSince winning the election, Trump has promised a major build-up of all branches of the military and a \u201cstate of the art\u201d missile defense system. Trump and many Republican leaders are eager to lift a spending cap on defense by $30 billion to $40 billion. Mulvaney has reluctantly indicated he will play ball with Trump and McCain to boost defense spending but only so long as it\u2019s offset with cuts across the federal budget, according to Politico.\n\nRelated: Why Health Care Spending Could Rise Even Faster in the Next 10 Years\n\nEntitlement Spending \u2013 Trump campaigned on a pledge to protect Social Security and Medicare from cuts \u2013 a promise that is regularly highlighted in a TV ad sponsored by the AARP, the nation\u2019s premier advocate for seniors. But during his confirmation hearings, Mulvaney said he remains in favor of raising the retirement age for Social Security to 70 and reiterated his commitment to achieving other savings in Medicare.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling how this year\u2019s looming battle over health care policy \u2013- including the Republicans effort to repeal and replace Obamacare \u2013- will play out. Yet House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and other conservative policy makers continue to harbor an intense interest in tossing Social Security and Medicare into the mix.\n\nThe Budget \u2013 Newly elected presidents rarely submit a formal budget to Congress during their first few months in office, but Trump and Mulvaney will have to face some thorny spending issues for the current fiscal year that were left over by the last Congress.\n\nIn a move to simplify the post-election legislative session and placate conservative Republicans unwilling to take a chance on former President Barack Obama extracting some last-minute domestic spending concessions, Ryan announced last December a stopgap fiscal 2017 spending bill that would keep the government operating at roughly last year\u2019s levels through March 31.\n\nThat has given Trump and his advisers time to weigh in on unresolved spending issues, including finding more money for defense and cutting more deeply into domestic programs backed by Democrats, including Planned Parenthood.\n\nRelated: The IRS Has Just Made Obamacare\u2019s Individual Mandate Optional\n\nDebt Ceiling \u2013 With the national debt currently at $19.97 trillion and rising, Trump and GOP leaders will soon find themselves stuck with the thankless task of raising the legal debt ceiling for borrowing by the Treasury. The party in power must always assume responsibility for raising the debt ceiling, giving the minority the opportunity to blame the majority for profligate spending. The Treasury will officially begin to bump up against its borrowing limits March 16, leaving the administration with only a few months to act before facing a fiscal crisis and a possible government shutdown.\n\nAs a freshman member of Congress, Mulvaney challenged the need to raise the debt ceiling and even now suggests that the federal government should consider prioritizing Treasury payments, rather than paying all its debts. But that cavalier attitude could get Mulvaney into trouble. And the new Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, declared recently that \u201cthere should be no uncertainty that we are paying the bills.\n\nObamacare Repeal and Tax Cuts \u2013 Passing just one budget resolution in a year can be a heavy lift for the party in power; passing two in the same calendar year may be unprecedented. Yet congressional Republican leaders and the new Trump administration are counting on adoption of fiscal 2017 and 2018 resolutions under fast-track rules as the vehicles for dismantling Obamacare and passing major tax cut legislation.\n\nBoth of these resolutions are highly complex documents that will invariably be laden with highly controversial health and tax policies requiring careful review by the OMB, as well as the Treasury, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Internal Revenue Service and key White House advisers.

In fact, it\u2019s an open question as to whether or not it has already been happening, just behind the scenes.\n\nThe Trump administration has more than 1,200 Senate-confirmed positions that it needs to fill. The Washington Post and the Partnership for Public Service have teamed up to track the nominations of the 696 \u201ckey\u201d executive branch positions. It has now been exactly 100 days since Trump woke up on November 9 as the president-elect and his team has publicly announced nominations for just 44 of them.

There are problems with all three of these alternatives, but one has fewer than the other two.\n\nUnless China brings the North Koreans around, forceful intervention overestimates Beijing\u2019s leverage in Pyongyang and its willingness to exert what influence it has. China has seen the North as a useful if troublesome buffer since the Korean War. Most important, military analysts say the North could destroy a quarter to a third of Seoul within a matter of minutes after it is attacked. This risk alone takes the military option more or less off the table.\n\nDoing nothing just got a lot less tenable. Last Sunday\u2019s test sent a missile 310 miles into the Sea of Japan. That\u2019s slightly less than half the distance between the North and the Japanese coast, but Kim\u2019s signal is clear: We\u2019re upping the ante, and there\u2019s more where this came from.\n\nThat leaves negotiation. With a record of failures in view, let\u2019s call it the least unpromising alternative.\n\nTalks with the North on its nuclear program go back to the mid-1990s when President Clinton signed an \u201cAgreed Framework\u201d to bring Pyongyang back into the International Atomic Energy Agency. When that accord fell apart in 2002, six countries met regularly -- South Korea, Japan, Russia, and China -- until 2009.\n\nRelated: U.S. Will Strengthen Pacific Allies Against North Korea Hostility\n\nIt is time to try again, for two reasons:\n\nMany Asians\u2014including Japan\u2019s premier\u2014mark down Obama\u2019s sanctions against North Korea as a failure, and they would be correct. Sanctions hurt, but they don\u2019t get other nations to do things much differently. See Russia. See Iran.\n\n\n\n\n\nTurn last week\u2019s test upside down, and it could be a positive signal. Kim looks at the Iran nuclear accord, and then at Trump\u2019s inclination to negotiate a better relationship with Russia, and wonders if he has a chance to make a deal with the artful dealmaker. Note in this connection: Kim may have eliminated a dynastic rival if he had his half-brother assassinated this week, but the president who craves acceptance also furthered his reputation as an international pariah.\n\nJapan, China, and South Korea\u2019s main opposition party, the Democrats, are now on the record favoring a new round of talks. So are many influential China experts and former officials in the U.S. For his part, Trump appears to leave the door open. Look again at his statement while he stood at the podium with Abe: He didn\u2019t mention the missile test. And it was after his talks with Trump that Abe suggested to parliamentarians back home, Let\u2019s try something new.\n\nIf talks materialize, there\u2019s a clear advantage for returning to the six-party format. China and Russia are powerful influences, given the Kim dynasty\u2019s long shared ideological history with Beijing and Moscow.\n\nThere\u2019s a big advantage for Trump, too: Even beginning a negotiation process would help repair the president\u2019s stony start in his relations with Beijing.

He began by announcing that attorney Alexander Acosta, the dean of Florida International University Law School and a former member of the National Labor Relations Board, would be his replacement nominee for secretary of labor.\n\nRelated: Why Can\u2019t Trump Get His Story Straight on Intelligence Leaks and Fake News?\n\nHe also said that next week his administration will release a new executive action on border security meant to accomplish some of the things that a previous order, currently stalled in litigation, was unable to do.\n\nHowever, much of the press conference was consumed not by policy discussion, but by Trump\u2019s defense of his presidential campaign and of his administration\u2019s actions in the first weeks of his term.\n\n\u201cI turn on the TV, open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos. Chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite,\u201d he said at one point. \u201cThis administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can\u2019t get my cabinet approved.\u201d\n\nTrump was pressed by three different reporters on whether or not anyone working for his campaign had contacts with Russian intelligence agents or other Russian officials. Multiple sources in the Intelligence Community have told news organizations that several of Trump\u2019s associates had multiple contacts with Russia. After twice refusing to give a direct answer, he finally said, \u201cNobody that I know of.\u201d He then wondered out loud, \u201cHow many times do I have to answer this question?\u201d\n\nHere are a few more remarkable moments from the event:\n\n* On Obamacare: Trump seemed to suggest that members of Congress facing protests over the planned repeal of the Affordable Care Act represent only their Republican constituents. \u201cWe\u2019ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster, folks. It\u2019s disaster. I know you can say, oh, Obamacare. I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they are not the Republican people that our representatives are representing.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump's Risky Message: He Doesn't Trust His Intelligence Chiefs\n\n* On the Electoral College: He repeated his false claim that his Electoral College margin in the November election was the largest since Ronald Reagan. When it was pointed out that what he had said was untrue, he said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, I was given that information. I was given \u2014 I actually, I\u2019ve seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory, do you agree with that?\u201d\n\n* On intelligence leaks: Trump has insisted that leaks about his campaign\u2019s contact with the Russians are serious breaches of security, but that the news stories revealing the leaks are fake. Asked to clarify, he said, \u201cYou know what they said, you saw it and the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake.\u201d\n\n* On Russia: Asked about recent Russian provocations, including the presence of a surveillance ship off the coast of Delaware, the apparent violation of a nuclear missile treaty and the buzzing of American ships by Russian warplanes, he blamed it all on the media. \u201cI want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people, the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia.\u201d\n\nHis rationale, apparently, is that Russian President Vladimir Putin is becoming increasingly aggressive because \u201cHe\u2019s sitting behind his desk and he\u2019s saying, you know, I see what\u2019s going on in the United States, I follow it closely. It\u2019s going to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he\u2019s got with this fake story.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Republicans Have Everything to Gain by Impeaching Trump\n\n* On anti-Semitism: Given two opportunities to specifically condemn the rise in anti-Semitic threats in the United States since his election, he avoided doing so both times. He suggested that much of it is attributable to his political opponents trying to make him look bad. At one point he berated a reporter for insinuating that he himself is an anti-Semite, despite the fact that the man prefaced his question by explicitly saying that he was suggesting no such thing.\n\n* On meeting the Congressional Black Caucus: When an African American reporter asked Trump if he would be working with the Congressional Black Caucus on his plan to revitalize troubled inner cities, Trump asked, \u201cAre they friends of yours?\u201d She replied, \u201cI'm just a reporter.\u201d Trump said, \u201cWell, set up the meeting.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/02/16", "title": "10 Things to Know About Stephen Feinberg, Trump\u2019s Potential Intelligence Czar", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/16/10-Things-Know-About-Stephen-Feinberg-Trump-s-Potential-Intelligence-Czar", "text": "Angry about leaks from the intelligence community, President Trump has asked a secretive private-equity billionaire to take a hard look at the multiple agencies that surreptitiously gather information in the name of protecting America, according to NBC News.\n\nHere is what you need to know about Stephen Feinberg, the co-founder of Cerberus Capital Management and one of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign advisers.\n\n1. Feinberg is closely connected to controversial White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and Trump\u2019s influential son-in-law Jared Kushner, according to The New York Times.\n\nRelated: Trump's Risky Message: He Doesn't Trust His Intelligence Chiefs\n\n2. He has no direct intelligence gathering or national security experience. However, Cerberus owns a private military contractor, DynCorp International, that provides security services to government agencies. In 2010, DynCorp had $3 billion in revenues, the majority of which came from the U.S. government.\n\n3. A Bronx-born Princeton grad who excelled at tennis and joined the ROTC, the 56-year-old Feinberg began his Wall Street career at Drexel Burnham Lambert, which specialized in junk bonds and was driven into bankruptcy in 1990 after an insider-trading scandal that famously snared \u201cjunk bond king\u201d Michael Milken. The prosecutor who went after Drexel was then-U.S. Attorney Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and eventual Trump campaign surrogate who was passed over for a cabinet position.\n\n4. Feinberg is a major Republican donor. In the 2016 race, he first donated $200,000 to the Jeb Bush presidential campaign. When Bush, battered by Trump, dropped out, Feinberg switched to his fellow billionaire. He donated almost $1.5 million to Rebuilding America Now, a super PAC supporting Trump, according to OpenSecrets.org.\n\nRelated: America Gets Its First Real Test of the CEO Presidency\n\n5. Cerberus, named after a mythological three-headed dog known as the \u201chound of Hell,\u201d has more than $30 billion under management.\n\n6. The senior leadership of Cerberus includes former Vice-President Dan Quayle and former Treasury Secretary John Snow. So Feinberg is not only a big-time GOP donor, he also is connected to the Republican establishment.\n\n7. Feinberg has a reputation for avoiding the spotlight, and encourages his colleagues to do the same. He reportedly once said, \"If anyone at Cerberus has his picture in the paper and a picture of his apartment, we will do more than fire that person. We will kill him. The jail sentence will be worth it.\"\n\n8. Cerberus had major stakes in Chrysler and the financial arm of General Motors and was deeply involved in the government bailout of the auto industry under President Obama. Other Cerberus investments range from cosmetics (Avon) to fast-food (Strategic Restaurants) to pharma (PaxVax) and real estate (Haya).\n\n9. Not listed on the Cerberus website is its ownership of Freedom Group, a firearms holding company that controls such brands as Remington, Marlin and Bushmaster, maker of the AR-15 used by the Beltway snipers in 2002 and in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Conn.\n\n10.

Tom Price, the new Health and Human Services Secretary, attended a portion of the session.\n\nRelated: Why Health Care Spending Could Rise Even Faster in the Next 10 Years\n\nAlthough Ryan offered only a few clues as to how House Republicans would rewrite the Obamacare legislation, media reports and some health care lobbyists say it will begin with the complete repeal of federal mandates requiring many businesses to provide health insurance to workers and requiring all uninsured Americans to purchase coverage or pay a penalty.\n\nThe measure would eliminate all of the Obamacare taxes on insurers, drug companies, medical device manufacturers and other businesses, as well as on upper-income people. Those taxes are projected to generate more than $1 trillion over the coming decade and were crucial to underwriting the cost of Obamacare\u2019s insurance exchanges and subsidies for lower-income Americans.\n\nRepealing all those taxes is a major point of contention between House and Senate Republicans because many argue that the revenues will be needed to help finance the cost of the GOP replacement plan. However, Ryan, and Ways and Means Committee Chair Kevin Brady (R-TX) believe they can offset the lost revenues and pay for their initiative by capping the federal tax exclusion on large employer-based insurance plans and extracting huge savings from Medicaid.\n\nPremiums paid for employer-sponsored health insurance are excluded from taxable income, which reduces the amount workers owe as income and payroll taxes by roughly $250 billion annually. That is the largest tax break in the federal tax code and has long been eyed by both parties as a revenue source for other programs.\n\nRelated: Are Republicans Losing Momentum on Obamacare Repeal?\n\nThe emerging GOP plan \u2013 similar to one Ryan promoted last summer \u2013 offers a handful of incentives for consumers to purchase health insurance on their own. Those include tax-exempt health savings accounts to help cover medical costs and so-called refundable federal tax credits, paid in advance, that would go to most Americans, including people with low or no taxable income.\n\nCurrently, low-income people who qualify for premium subsidies under Obamacare must file for the credits on their federal tax returns \u2013 meaning that they don\u2019t receive the subsidy until after they have purchased their health care plans.\n\n\u201cThey call them refundable tax credits, but they are subsidies, and they are subsidies that say \u2018we will pay some people some money if you do what the government makes you do,\u2019\u201d Ryan said today. \u201cThat is not a tax credit, that is not freedom.\u201d\n\nThe House GOP approach would preserve a number of features of the existing Obamacare law, including preventing insurers from discriminating against applicants with pre-existing medical problems and allowing children to remain on their parents\u2019 private health care plans until they turn 26. And it would experiment with federally financed, state-run \u201chigh-risk pools\u201d that provide coverage to older and sicker Americans who would have trouble finding affordable health insurance in the private market.\n\nRelated: The IRS Has Just Made Obamacare\u2019s Individual Mandate Optional\n\nThe House proposal will undergo additional drafting during the upcoming Presidents\u2019 Day recess, and Ryan and others are anxiously awaiting analysis of their proposals from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation. Those two agencies will be responsible for determining, among other things, whether the GOP approach would eliminate coverage for millions of Americans, as many critics predict, and whether it will add to the deficit.\n\nOne of the most controversial issues is how the Republicans will treat Medicaid as part of their overall effort to replace Obamacare. While Medicaid currently guarantees health care coverage for poor and disabled people, Ryan and others are promoting a plan to convert the half-century old entitlement to block grants to the states, placing a fixed cap on how much to spend and giving states more latitude to tighten eligibility requirements.\n\nThat move alone would save the government hundreds of billions of dollars in the coming years while eliminating many of their coverage. The joint federal-state Medicaid program currently covers nearly 72 million Americans and spent approximately $545 billion during fiscal 2016, or $7,569 per person.\n\nRelated: The New Obamacare Rules Help Insurers But Not Consumers\n\nBut many Senate Republicans and some more moderate House Republicans oppose that approach to transforming Medicaid. Some are advancing an alternative approach that would base Medicaid funding on the number of people who qualify for it rather than on a fixed cap.\n\nRyan also hinted today that they are working out a plan that would allow the 31 states and the District of Columbia that opted for expanded Medicaid coverage under Obamacare to preserve the coverage at least temporarily. At the same time, the plan would provide additional health insurance funding to the 19 other states \u2013 mostly controlled by Republicans\u2014that refused to take part in the Medicaid expansion.\n\nLawmakers from states that shunned the expanded Medicaid program argue that they are entitled to additional funding if the other states continue to receive the expanded Medicaid funding. Ryan told reporters today that he was looking for a compromise so that \u201cwe do it in a way that doesn\u2019t disadvantage either side.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/02/16", "title": "6 Dumb Mistakes Trump Has Made -- and 6 Dangerous Ones", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/02/16/6-Dumb-Mistakes-Trump-Has-Made-and-6-Dangerous-Ones", "text": "Trump apologists will tell you that every new Administration makes rookie mistakes, takes a queasy shakeout cruise, stumbles before it finds its footing \u2013 or they trot out any other hackneyed metaphor they can memorize.\n\nOh, and all that is especially true because the no-longer-Teflon Don is a guileless outsider unschooled in the swampy ways of Washington.\n\nThey are not entirely wrong.\n\nRelated: Don\u2019t Bet on Trump Getting Impeached Just Yet\n\nBill Clinton\u2019s first months \u2013- in a portent of what was to come \u2013- featured the scandal known as Travelgate in which seven members of the White House Travel Office were fired, allegedly so that friends of the Clintons could benefit financially from making travel arrangements for Hillary and Bill.

The leaks from the intelligence services indicate that during the election Trump\u2019s team had extensive contact with Russian authorities, including intelligence agents. If that information is accurate -- and Trump\u2019s fury over the revelation of what he characterizes as classified information surely suggests it may be -- then it is hard to reconcile with Trump\u2019s simultaneous alternate narrative, in which the Russia story is the fruit of a Democratic plot with no basis in fact.\n\nUnfortunately, a lack of internal consistency isn\u2019t limited to Trump\u2019s tweets.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Trump doubled down on that line of analysis at a surprise press conference, saying that the claims about Russia were both leaks and fake news.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s War with Intelligence Agencies Escalates Dangerously\n\nOn Wednesday, discussing the resignation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, the president lashed out at the media, blaming reporters for his departure from the administration.\n\n\u201cGen.

Those worries were exacerbated this week by reports in Times and CNN that during the presidential campaign Trump aides and associates were in frequent contact with Russian intelligence officers.\n\nTrump\u2019s National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, was forced out after reports surfaced indicating he had misled the administration about the extent of his discussions with a Russian diplomat prior to Trump taking office.\n\nRelated: With Flynn Out, Trump Faces Pressing Questions About National Security\n\nThe Journal story backs up a report from New York Observer columnist and former National Security Agency official John Schindler, who earlier this week made a similar claim.\n\nAt the same time that the agencies in the Intelligence Community are doubting Trump\u2019s trustworthiness, the president himself is apparently feeling the same way about them. In public comments and tweets over the past several days he has repeatedly complained about leaks of information about his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia. The president has alternately blasted the press for stories he calls \u201cfake news\u201d and criticized the Intelligence Community for allowing sensitive information to be leaked, naming the FBI and the NSA in particular, which seems to imply that the so-called \"fake news\" has a basis in fact.\n\n\u201cThe real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by \"intelligence\" like candy,\u201d Trump tweeted Wednesday morning. \u201cVery un-American!\u201d\n\nOn Thursday morning, the tweets continued. \u201cLeaking and even illegal classified leaking has been a big problem in Washington for years.

The first four weeks of the Donald Trump administration has produced decidedly mixed results, but at the same time offered some glimpses of hope for populist voters.\n\nFor the last few decades, voters and activists have openly argued that the biggest problem with government is that it\u2019s run by politicians. Frustration with government inaction \u2013 or in some cases too much action \u2013 have fueled efforts to impose term limits on legislatures in order to turn out the lifers. The founding fathers never meant for political office to be a career, the argument went, but for citizens to serve their country for a short period of time and then return to the private sector.\n\nRelated: Another Body Blow to the Trump White House as Labor Pick Withdraws\n\nThat includes the presidency. Constant stories of waste, fraud, and abuse anger voters, prompting an almost constant refrain: If I ran my business this way, I\u2019d be out of business. What this country needs, they argue, is an outsider who knows how to run a private-sector organization \u2013 someone without the political ties and big-donor relationships that inevitably bring back to the same old failures and frustrations. That would lead America back to greatness \u2013 or at least reverse decades of stagnation and bureaucratic bungling.\n\nDespite these long-argued beliefs, only in 2016 did America roll the dice in a presidential election. Republicans nominated their first presidential candidate without public sector or military command experience, and then US voters gave him the job. Donald Trump embodied the anti-establishment fervor that has percolated for decades.\n\nTo be fair, Donald Trump is a rarity in big business. His business is private. He doesn\u2019t answer to shareholders and a board of directors. His performance and behavior aren\u2019t scrutinized by human resource surveys, 360 reports and other employee and down-the-line manager assessments of top management that could humble even a Bill Gates. And unlike most top CEOs, Trump probably doesn\u2019t have a management coach.\n\nAs it turns out, running government requires a different skill set than running businesses, even though the two overlap to a large degree. Trump\u2019s inexperience in governance has created some of his problems, while some problems have carried over from the campaign. The story of Russian intelligence contacts with key campaign officials, revisited this week by The New York Times, offers the best example of this gap.\n\nRelated: Don\u2019t Bet on Trump Getting Impeached Just Yet\n\nTrump had run his primary campaign relatively light on consultants and pollsters, insisting that he could bankroll himself and save voters and taxpayers money. That made for a very popular argument on the campaign trail, and Trump clearly didn\u2019t suffer from a lack of support because of it. However, the campaign didn\u2019t effectively vet the smaller coterie of strategists and consultants who did make it into the campaign, leaving no one to question whether their economic ties to Russian businesses might leave them vulnerable to intelligence access.\n\nThe Times\u2019 report on an FBI investigation of those ties states that campaign officials had numerous connections to suspected intelligence operatives, but that no evidence of cooperation with those operatives has emerged. It has still resulted in an embarrassing turnover at the White House, with national security adviser Michael Flynn resigning on Monday night. Perhaps this might have happened anyway, but a president with previous experience in vetting employees with political considerations in mind might have seen this kind of difficulty on the horizon sooner rather than later. It may not be a coincidence that Vice President Mike Pence, a seasoned political hand, has taken over the process of selecting Flynn\u2019s replacement.\n\nThe White House has argued that Flynn was a victim of the \u201cdeep state\u201d and of bureaucrats, and that may well be true. Still, that teaches another lesson the hard way to those without experience in governance. In private business, loyalty and action typically run up and down within the organization, and even the factions that develop are largely contained within the whole and not from outside the business.\n\nRelated: Merkel Deports More Refugees While Blasting Trump\u2019s Refugee Ban\n\nThat is not true in government, and especially not within Washington DC in any Republican administration. A CEO president might expect that his orders will get carried out by people afraid to lose their jobs, but bureaucrats have civil-service protections and loyalties to parties and ideologies. It takes time, considerable patience, and skills on gathering consensus to make lasting change in Washington.\n\nBusiness tycoons do not necessarily believe in consensus as much as they believe in coming out on the winning end of deals. Rushing action without that consensus and buy-in from key stakeholders resulted in the other major stumble in Trump\u2019s first month: his executive order on a temporary block on entry to the US by nationals from seven countries with higher risks for terrorist infiltration.\n\nRather than wait to consult with the agencies involved or even to get a legal team together first to defend it, the White House rushed it into enforcement and provided the media with a cornucopia of video hits to emphasize the impact of the policy. A judge stopped enforcement of the order with a temporary restraining order, and the administration then lost a chance to win an appeal because of the disorganized approach to the defense of the EO. That policy remains on hold, whereas someone more acquainted with the pitfalls of governance would have seen those attacks coming and been prepared to meet them.\n\nRelated: 4-Star General Warns of \u2018Unbelievable Turmoil\u2019 in Trump\u2019s White House\n\nDo these stumbles refute the argument that a CEO president like Trump can work? Not yet. After all, we have only gone four weeks into this experiment, and signs have already begun to emerge that Trump and his team have learned some important lessons. Flynn\u2019s likely replacement is a vice-admiral with a record for low-key professionalism. The pace of EOs out of the White House has come almost to a stop after the Chief of Staff Reince Priebus redefined the promulgation process to make sure they give no excuses for a judge to stop them.\n\nAt the same time, Trump has delivered on key campaign promises even through these controversies \u2013 an experience that many voters believe only a few get, and rarely at that. His lack of political nuance has resulted in taking on big issues, including an effort on significant deregulation and cutting back on bureaucratic red tape. It will take longer than just four weeks to see if Trump remains committed to those projects, but he didn\u2019t take long to at least get them started.\n\nThat\u2019s why voters are likely to keep giving Trump the benefit of the doubt. They want to believe in the businessman model of governance. If Trump delivers on his promises while learning his lessons on the best way to achieve them, he\u2019ll sail to another term in office. If not, it may be a long time before we hear anyone seriously suggest that government should be run like a business by someone outside of the system."}, {"date": "2017/02/15", "title": "Why Are Republicans Making It Harder to Fight Voter Fraud?", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/15/Why-Are-Republicans-Making-It-Harder-Fight-Voter-Fraud", "text": "In a particularly nasty bit of irony, a pair of news stories about the possibility that the security of U.S. elections may have been compromised have in large part overshadowed a story about an effort in Congress to defund the Election Assistance Commission, a move that experts warn would almost certainly leave the electoral system less secure.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his staff last week continued to insist that there is massive voter fraud in the United States, although the administration has presented no real evidence of the millions of illegal votes the president has claimed were cast.\n\nRelated: 4-Star General Warns of \u2018Unbelievable Turmoil\u2019 in Trump\u2019s White House\n\nAt the same time, news organizations are focused on alleged connections between aides and associates of Trump and Russian intelligence officials during the election.

That requirement \u2013 seen by Republicans as an kind of pyramid scheme and intrusion on personal liberty \u2013 has been enforced by the IRS, until now.\n\nSince the formal launching of the health care program in 2014, taxpayers have been given the option of checking a box on line 61 of their 1040 federal tax returns declaring whether or not they or members of their family have qualified health insurance -- and providing documentation to prove it. Even with this voluntary approach, the IRS collected individual mandate payments from 8.1 million tax returns in 2015 averaging $210 for a total of $1.7 billion, according to an analysis of IRS data by Investor\u2019s Business Daily.\n\nFor the coming 2016 tax season, the IRS planned for the first time to make it mandatory for taxpayers to check the box or face not having their tax returns processed and their tax returns withheld.

It was hammered home by Garner\u2019s statement in retirement -- that accepting the nomination had been \u201cthe worst damn fool mistake I ever made.\u201d\n\nBut for the past 16 years or more, the job of the vice president has been very different from the one Nance despised. Joe Biden in the Obama White House and Dick Cheney under George W. Bush were both deeply engaged in formulating administration policy and marshaling support in Congress. At critical times in both administrations, both Cheney and Biden were deputized to negotiate with lawmakers and to strike deals that both sides understood the president would honor.\n\nRelated: 4-Star General Warns of \u2018Unbelievable Turmoil\u2019 in Trump\u2019s White House\n\nGiven the current turmoil in the Trump White House, though, the office may be reverting back to \u201cwarm piss\u201d status.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear just what role Vice President Mike Pence is playing in the administration, how empowered he will be with regard to politics and policymaking, and, frankly, how much weight his word will carry on Capitol Hill. That\u2019s because this week it became clear that the vice president is not in President Trump\u2019s inner circle.\n\nIn January, with rumors swirling about his alleged contacts with Russian officials before Trump took office, now former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn told Pence that he had not discussed lifting economic sanctions imposed by the Obama administration. Pence then went on national television to repeat Flynn\u2019s claims.\n\nOn January 26, the Justice Department informed the White House that Flynn had apparently misled Pence and other members of the administration. According to multiple reports, wiretap intelligence indicated that he had discussed sanctions with the Russian Ambassador.\n\nRelated: With Flynn Out, Trump Faces Pressing Questions About National Security\n\nRemarkably, even though White House Counsel Don McGahn and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus informed the president immediately, Pence was kept in the dark until February 9. Worse, according to his spokesperson\u2019s comment to The Washington Post, he learned about it not from the president but from media reports.\n\nAt this point, absent some sort of public statement from Trump that affirmatively asserts that Pence has authority within the administration, it\u2019s hard to see how the vice president can claim to speak for the White House on matters of policy. Members of Congress, business leaders, interest groups and others sitting across the table from Pence could and will ask themselves whether what he\u2019s telling them really reflects the thinking of the president and his closest advisers.\n\nOf course, this was always a danger in a Trump presidency, as Pence knew, or should have known when he accepted the vice presidential nomination. When a man as mercurial as Trump has revealed himself to be is sitting in the Oval Office, there would always be the possibility that policies articulated in good faith by his surrogates would be subject to change without notice.\n\nHowever, when the evidence that Pence was treated with manifest disrespect during the Flynn affair was added to the mix, the vice president\u2019s ability to act as the voice of the administration has presumably been badly damaged.\n\nRelated: National Insecurity: Intel Officials Increasingly Worried About Trump\n\nIn truth, Trump and Pence were always an unlikely match. Pence, the former Indiana governor, describes himself as a \u201cborn-again evangelical Catholic\u201d and has long been a fixture in the conservative movement, especially with respect to culture war issues, including gay rights and abortion. These are areas in which Trump expressed little interest except when it became politically necessary for him to do so.\n\nTrump\u2019s selection of Pence was part of what made his deeply unconventional presidential campaign palatable to many conservatives. The assumption was that Pence would have a seat at the table, and would be able to steer the Trump administration toward more traditionally conservative positions.\n\nThe silver lining for the vice president is that, given the direction things are heading for the Trump administration, he might not even want to be close to the center of power at this point. By Wednesday morning, the reports of a Russian connection to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign had expanded well beyond Flynn, with both The New York Times and CNN reporting that aides and associates of the president were in frequent contact with Russian officials, including intelligence agents, during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nAs calls for Congressional investigations multiplied, Trump himself took to Twitter to spout two seemingly contradictory complaints. The stories about his campaign\u2019s connections to Russia, he said, are \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d driven by the media\u2019s \u201cblind hatred\u201d of the president. But in practically the same breath, Trump denounced the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, claiming that they were responsible for leaking classified information, seemingly a tacit admission that the reports are accurate.\n\nRelated: How Long Can Trump Go Without Firing Somebody?\n\n\u201cThe real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by \u2018intelligence\u2019 like candy. Very un-American!\u201d he wrote.\n\nWorries about the stability of the leadership structure in the executive branch have begun seeping into the military. On Tuesday, the four-star Army General in charge of Special Operations Command expressed concern about the \u201cunbelievable turmoil\u201d in the White House, adding \u201cI hope they sort it out soon because we\u2019re a nation at war.\u201d\n\nAmidst the uncertainty, talk of impeachment or Trump\u2019s eventual resignation has started to be taken very seriously by longtime observers of Washington. And as a result, how Pence handles himself in the coming weeks will be very closely watched.\n\n\u201cNo question, Pence has to be embarrassed by this turn of events,\u201d said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. \u201cBut his major mistake so far has been getting entirely too close to Trump and parroting some of the silly things Trump and his inner circle have been saying.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt is far from inconceivable that Pence will be president during the current term, and his ability to govern may well depend on whether enough people see him as somewhat independent. To use a historical parallel, Pence wants to be Gerald Ford to Trump's Richard Nixon. So having some distance could be a very good thing for a vice president who has seemed sycophantic so far.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/02/15", "title": "Big Oil Gets a Win as Trump Ends Transparency Rule", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/15/Big-Oil-Gets-Win-Trump-Ends-Transparency-Rule", "text": "President Trump\u2019s first legislative act was to sign into law a repeal of a transparency rule aimed at keeping public oil companies in check with regard to their international operations and limiting the scope for bribery and corruption.\n\nPart of the so-called Dodd-Frank Act, devised after the 2008 financial crisis to avoid a repeat of the events that led to it, the rule stipulated that U.S. public oil companies must declare all payments made to the U.S. and foreign governments and agencies in the form of royalties and taxes, starting from their financial year ending in or after September 2018.\n\nIt was an Act that Big Oil was very vocally against, saying the rule put it at a disadvantage to its foreign peers.

Jeff Sessions of Alabama to become to become attorney general. Her stock within the Democratic party soared after she was formally silenced by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) on the Senate floor last week for allegedly violating Senate rules by impugning a fellow senator\u2019s reputation.\n\nRelated: Democrats Will Regain Power If They Can Avoid Screwing Up\n\nAt age 67, Warren can hardly be considered a fresh face within her beleaguered party \u2013 one that is still struggling to make sense of its devastating losses to Trump and the Republicans. She and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, 75, are among a handful of aging progressive leaders who clearly better understood the mood of the electorate \u2013 and the importance of shifting left on economic and trade issues\u2014than Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton ever did.\n\nBut whether Warren is the new \u201cface\u201d of the party \u2013 or more likely just one facet of a blurry, emerging composite picture of the Democrats reconstituted party leadership \u2013 remains to be seen.\n\nEven before the rank and file Democrats began to grasp the enormity of their loss to Trump and the GOP, veteran Democrats in the House and Senate solidified their hold on the congressional party for at least another two years. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, 66, succeeded retiring Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada as Minority Leader, while House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California, 76, put down a minor rebellion to claim the leadership of her party for at least another two years.\n\nWhile Schumer and Pelosi are both highly accomplished veteran politicians \u2013 and now are showing some spunk in demanding an independent probe of the burgeoning national security scandal in the Trump White House -- both appeared to be caught flat-footed by last November\u2019s election when the Republicans swept to victory again in the House and Senate and took the White House.\n\nRelated: Will Democrats Stand Up to Trump? Here\u2019s Their First Test\n\nMoreover, Schumer was recently put on notice by progressive Democrats \u2013 who actually demonstrated outside of his apartment in Brooklyn -- that he would be making a big mistake if he supported any Trump nominees and that he should scrap his post-election pledge to seek common ground with the new president.\n\nMeanwhile, the race to chair the beleaguered Democratic National Committee after months of upheaval within that organization appears to be coming down to two candidates \u2013 neither of whom is a household name. Rep. Keith Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and the first Muslim to serve in Congress, has drawn strong support from Sanders, the AFL-CIO and other progressive groups seeking a shift in party policy much further to the left. Former Labor Secretary Tom Perez is considered more of a moderate and \u201cbig tent Democrat\u201d who has picked up an endorsement from former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nWhile the outcome of the DNC election later this month no doubt will have an important impact on the future direction of the party, the race has been relatively low key and obscure and certainly has done little to fire the imagination of Democrats throughout the country.\n\n\u201cEmpirically, Democrats are down,\u201d said Nathan Gonzales, a national political analyst. \u201cThey have the fewest number of governors in at least a generation \u2013 just 16 out of 50. They have the minority of the House, the minority of the Senate, there are just fewer Democrats in leadership positions.

Indeed, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the former Democratic White House chief of staff and Democratic congressional party organizer, recently advised the Democrats to take \u201ca chill pill\u201d and realize party rebuilding could take years to achieve. With Democrats facing uphill battles in the Senate and House in 2018, some experts had already all but ruled the chances of the Democrats winning back either of the chambers.\n\nUniversity of Virginia political scientists Larry J. Sabato notes that, in the wake of Trump\u2019s chaotic and highly controversial first three weeks in office, the Democrats \u201chave got more public support now than they had before the election, and you have to make hay while the sun shines.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut certainly, the line-up in the Senate for 2018 is horrible for Democrats,\u201d he added, as the Democrats will have to defend 25 seats, including many in states that Trump carried, to only eight Republican seats that will be on the line. The Republicans currently hold a 52 to 48 seat majority in the Senate. \u201cThe Democrats will be very lucky to lose, net, only a couple of Senate seats,\u201d Sabato said in an email.\n\nRelated: The Power of the Pink Hat: Here\u2019s How Democrats Can Win America Back\n\nBut when it comes to the next presidential contest, Democratic voters seemingly have much stronger views. Just as conservative Republicans and independents flocked to Trump in search of an outsider who would challenge the establishment and upend conventional wisdom, recent polling suggests that Democrats and independents want a completely fresh start in 2020.\n\n\u201cI think it will be somebody who is not even on the radar today,\u201d Ross Baker, a Rutgers University political scientist, said in an interview. Not unlike former President Barack Obama\u2019s rise from relative obscurity as a senator to the pinnacle of national power, Baker said, \u201cI think it will be somebody who is not a recognized, revered leader.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe quest for novelty is not unique to Republicans,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the Democrats are looking for something different as well.\u201d\n\nSome 66 percent of Democrats and independents picked \u201csomeone entirely new\u201d when given the choice of a list of potential 2020 presidential candidates, according to a USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll in late December. Only nine percent of those Democrats surveyed believe a newcomer should stay out of the race.\n\nRelated: Trump Might Adopt a Democratic Plan to Crack Down on Drug Prices\n\nThere was practically no interest in seeing Clinton run for a third time for president with 62 percent of the registered Democrats surveyed saying she should definitely not seek the nomination again. Sixty-one percent said they would love for former first lady Michelle Obama to run, although she has pretty much slammed the door on that possibility.\n\nAround 44 percent said they might be in favor of seeing Sanders or even Biden seek the nomination to challenge Trump, assuming he runs for a second term. But just 34 percent said they would like to see Warren run, while 27 percent hope she doesn\u2019t run \u2013 which hardly makes her the face of the Democratic party.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, there is no telling how the next two years will play out in Washington \u2013 and who among the Democrats in politics, business or some other endeavor may rise to the surface and lead the party.\n\nFor now, at least, here are six Democrats who offer a relatively fresh look who may emerge as important players in the coming years:\n\nSen. Christopher Murphy -- The first-term Connecticut senator arrived in Washington shortly after the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre in his state in December 2012, and he swiftly rose to become one of the most outspoken advocates for gun control \u2013 a highly important but invariably frustrating issue to pursue in the face of the powerful gun lobby. The 43-year-old former House member and state legislator is a champion of health care reform and was a strong advocate of a \u201csingle-payer\u201d national health care system similar to one sought by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)\n\nSen. Cory Booker \u2013 The 47-year-old former Newark, N.J., mayor and prominent black politician insists he\u2019s not interested in the presidency. And he finds ways to anger both liberals and conservatives, as Politico recently noted. But his high-profile speech at the 20016 Democratic National Convention and his sharp critique of President Trump and his cabinet picks suggest Booker will be very much in the national eye as the 2020 race begins to take shape.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar \u2013 The former Minnesota county prosecutor is a rising star among progressives and brings the much-admired qualities of mid-western common sense and practicality and a firm grasp of domestic and foreign policy issues. Klobuchar, the daughter of a legendary Minneapolis newspaper columnist and one-time legal adviser to former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, is a natural in dealing with the media. And speculation that Hillary Clinton had closely considered her as a running mate in 2016 will probably add to her luster as a potential presidential candidate in 2020.\n\nRep. Kyrsten Sinema \u2013 The 37-year old two-term House member from Arizona brings a distinctive perspective to Washington. The former state legislator and social worker grew up homeless for a time and is the first openly bisexual member of Congress. >She is one of the more dazzling Democrats from a red state. \u201cI was homeless when I was a kid,\u201d she said once at a Phoenix job fair. \u201cBut I got my shot at college, I got a job, and I stand before you today.\u201d\n\nMark Cuban \u2013 President Trump recently tweeted that Cuban is \u201cnot smart enough to run for president!\u201d But those who have dealt with the Dallas Mavericks owner and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star think he is plenty smart \u2013 and probably better equipped than Trump to do the kind of policy and economic analysis required of a president. Trump may have been reacting to a New York Post story mentioning Cuban as a possible challenger for Trump in 2020. Cuban, 58, responded by tweeting \u201cIsn\u2019t it better for all of us that he is tweeting rather than trying to govern?\u201d\n\nSen. Kamala Harris \u2013 The charismatic Democrat from California has a number of claims to fame: She was the first woman ever elected attorney general in California and the second black woman and the first Indian American elected to serve in the U.S. Senate. Harris, 52, once said that she sought a career in law enforcement because she wanted to be \u201cat the table where decisions are made.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/02/15", "title": "Don\u2019t Bet on Trump Getting Impeached Just Yet", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/15/Don-t-Bet-Trump-Getting-Impeached-Just-Yet", "text": "The classic Watergate question has resurfaced repeatedly this week now that National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has resigned, leaving unanswered questions about the ties between Russia and the Trump administration: What did the president know, and when did he know it?\n\nThe tumult in the White House less than a month into Trump\u2019s presidency has ignited chatter about impeachment. \u201cGambling houses all over the world are taking in action on whether Trump, inaugurated just last month, will resign or be impeached,\u201d Politico reported on Sunday, before Flynn resigned. \u201cAnd the odds aren\u2019t as long as you might think.\u201d Irish bookmaker Paddy Power now offers 2/1 odds that Trump will be impeached in his first term, and 4/1 odds that it will happen this year.\n\nThat still may be a bad bet.

Maybe that\u2019s just as well, given the turmoil that would cause for this nation. On the other hand, Trump hasn\u2019t released his tax returns, hasn\u2019t placed his businesses in the equivalent of a blind trust to be managed by another real estate company, and hasn\u2019t apologized to the millions of people he bullied, insulted and stepped on to be the 45th president of the United States."}, {"date": "2017/02/15", "title": "America\u2019s Nukes Are Getting Old \u2013 and Cost $40 Billion a Year to Maintain", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/15/America-s-Nukes-Are-Getting-Old-and-Cost-40-Billion-Year-Maintain", "text": "In order to maintain a stockpile of aging nuclear weapons and their delivery systems, the U.S. government will need to spend an average of $40 billion per year over the next decade, according to a report from the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe report, a biennial review last completed in 2015, finds that \u201cThe nation\u2019s current nuclear forces are reaching the end of their service life ...

Put it down to the terror attack in December when a Tunisian refugee drove a truck into a crowded Christmas market, killing 12 people and injuring nearly 50 others. The attacker, Anis Amri, had sought asylum and had been turned down; apparently, Tunisia was unwilling to take him back.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first such incident. In July last year, a Syrian who had been denied asylum and who had declared allegiance to ISIS set off a bomb outside a wine bar in Ansbach, killing himself and injuring more than a dozen.\n\nAs Merkel\u2019s political standing has been hit by growing concerns that her admission of one million refugees has created a security nightmare, she has gotten tough on deportations and on Muslim assimilation. In a recent speech in Cologne, she said, \"Anyone who does not have a right of residence must be returned to their home country.\"\n\nRelated: Factbox: What's in Trump's Order Halting Refugee Program\n\nShe particularly targeted Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia (majority Muslim countries), classifying them as \u201csafe countries of origin\u201d in order that their applications can be processed quickly, and those rejected can be returned home asap. To coax those governments into cooperating, Merkel\u2019s government hinted that development aid could be withheld.\n\nNot only does Merkel want to toss out those without legal status, but she also insists that those who do achieve legal residency must \u201cintegrate\u201d properly.\n\nMerkel, whom the Financial Times says \u201cleads Europe\u2019s fight for liberal values,\u201d also supported outlawing the Muslim veil, calling it \u201cinappropriate.\u201d Those comments came in late December after the arrests of two asylum seekers in connection with three sexual assaults, including the rape and murder of a medical student. Her Vice Chancellor doubled down, saying, \u201cSalafist mosques must be banned, the communities dissolved and the preachers should be expelled, as soon as possible.\" Yet Merkel criticizes Trump.\n\nWhile Germany wants to send refugees home, Australia and Kenya want to send them to the U.S.\n\nRelated: Australia Causing Refugees 'Severe and Lasting Harm': Human Rights Watch\n\nAustralia refuses to allow asylum seekers who arrive by boat to settle in the country. Instead, because of a law passed in 2013, the nation stockpiles refugees in Australia-run immigration detention camps in the poor Pacific island nations of Nauru and Papua New Guinea. Two refugees desperate to get to Australia recently set themselves on fire at the camp in Nauru.\n\nIt was some 1,300 of those mostly Muslim asylum-seekers that President Obama agreed to allow into the U.S. In addition, there were 370 who had been allowed into Australia temporarily for medical treatment. It appears that coincident with that offer (hatched at Obama\u2019s Summit on Refugees last September) Australia\u2019s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull agreed to take part in the U.S.-led program to resettle Central American refugees from a camp in Costa Rica \u2013 mostly people who had been trying to cross into the United States.\n\nSo in a politically expedient arrangement, the U.S. agreed to take refugees that Australia does not want from the Middle East, Africa and Asia and Turnbull bails out Obama by accepting Central Americans desperate to enter the U.S. who are holed up in Costa Rica. No wonder that in his first conversation with the Australian leader, President Trump described the deal as \u201cdumb\u201d even as his executive order carved out an exception so that the agreement would be honored.\n\nRelated: After Three Years of Extreme Vetting, I Nearly Gave Up on My American Dream\n\nDealing with refugees and the threat they pose is not just a problem for the developed world. Kenya\u2019s government is trying to shut down the world\u2019s largest refugee camp, home to hundreds of thousands of Somalis who have fled their violent country. The courts in Kenya halted the closure, saying it was an act of \u201cgroup persecution, illegal, discriminatory, and therefore unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nThe government claimed the camp had been linked to terror attacks carried out by Somalis, like the one at Westgate Mall, where 67 people were killed in September 2013. Rebutting human rights activists\u2019 claims that refugees were not responsible, a spokesperson for the government said, \"I will tell you for a fact, the people who carried out the terror attacks at Westgate, several of them were traced either through phone calls or through various contacts \u2014 intelligence \u2014 to refugee camps in Dadaab.\"\n\nSome 200 of those Somali refugees in Kenya were recently en route to the United States but then were blocked by President Trump\u2019s executive order calling for more robust vetting for asylum-seekers. Because of the court\u2019s intervention, those Somalis are now again heading for the United States.\n\nAs the refugees from Australia and from Kenya start to arrive in the United States, our country will be torn between our humanitarian instincts and the realization that other countries have suffered heavy penalties for opening their doors.

They appeared unfazed by the mounting concerns of consumers, insurers, health care executives and governors that the GOP may be headed down a treacherous path.\n\n\u201cI fully recognize and respect the strong feelings that people have about this issue,\u201d Ryan told reporters at the U.S. Capitol. \u201cWe should be passionate about this issue. It is about people\u2019s lives. This affects every person and every family in America.\u201d\n\nRelated: The GOP\u2019s Big Tax Dilemma: Repealing Obamacare Taxes\n\nRyan argued once again that Americans are trapped in a Democratic-concocted health care system with runaway premiums and co-payments and limited choices. \u201cThis law is in a collapse, and we have an obligation to rescue people from that collapse,\u201d he declared.\n\nBut if anything is collapsing at this point, it is the already shaky consensus among Republicans in the House and Senate over how \u2013 or even whether \u2013 to proceed in making good on their campaign pledge to dismantle and replace Obamacare. President Trump and congressional Republican leaders already have missed self-imposed deadlines repeal and replacement legislation and now appear to be taking a more piecemeal approach to cobbling together elements of a plan.\n\nMoreover, some moderate Republicans are pressing for alternative proposals that would \u201crepair\u201d rather than replace Obamacare or even allow states to choose whether to continue with the existing program or opt for a more conservative, market-driven system.\n\nFrom the beginning, it was always assumed that the Republicans would have a much tougher time pushing a budget resolution and related legislation through the Senate than the House. That\u2019s because of the GOP\u2019s seemingly unstoppable 247 to 188 seat majority in the lower chamber, in contrast to the Republicans\u2019 narrow 52 to 48 seat majority in the Senate. The defection of just three moderate Republicans in the Senate potentially could grind to a halt the GOP effort to repeal Obamacare.\n\nRelated: The Potential Cost of Obamacare Repeal: 32 Million Without Insurance\n\nBut 40 or so members of the House\u2019s far right Freedom Caucus blew up that political calculus Monday night after agreeing among themselves to refuse to support anything but the most extreme version of Obamacare legislation, comparable to the 2015 legislation passed by the Republican-controlled House and Senate and vetoed by Democratic President Barack Obama.\n\nThat bill was essentially a nuclear option for ridding the country of Obamacare. The legislation repealed the mandates for individuals to buy insurance and employers to provide insurance. The measure eliminated the law\u2019s premium subsidies for low-income Americans and wiped out the hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes imposed to finance the operation of the government-operated health care exchanges. And it rolled back expanded Medicaid coverage for millions of poor adults who previously had no coverage \u2013 a provision strongly backed by Republican and Democratic governors alike.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s less than the 2015 [legislation], we will oppose it,\u201d Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), the chair of the Freedom Party, told reporters Monday night. Meadows also said that he and his members might demand simultaneous action on repeal and replacement legislation \u2013 something virtually impossible to achieve. It is the worst kept secret in town that Trump and congressional leaders are nowhere near agreement on a plan to overhaul the health care law without stripping 20 million or more Americans of their current coverage under Obamacare.\n\nFor the time being, the GOP leaders\u2019 best hope is to push through a measure repealing most of Obamacare while hoping they can subsequently enlist Democratic support on replacement legislation that preserves many of Obamacare\u2019s most popular features, like the ban on insurers discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions and the provision allowing children to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance plans until age 26.\n\nBy staking out arguably the most extreme approach to ending Obamacare, Freedom Caucus members have left Ryan, McConnell and other Republican leaders with practically no wiggle room in negotiating with insurers and health care providers or placating more moderate members of the two chambers who are beginning to freak out about growing protests by voters in their districts and states.\n\nAnd if the Freedom Caucus members balk at negotiating a less extreme budget resolution that preserves some elements of the existing law, then Ryan will have a tough time mustering a minimum of 218 votes to repeal Obamacare.\n\nRelated: The GOP\u2019s \u2018Repeal and Replace\u2019 Obamacare Is Becoming \u2018Repair and Fix\u2019\n\nRyan, Ways and Means Committee Chair Kevin Brady of Texas and Greg Walden, chair of the House Energy & Commerce Committee, have adopted a more piecemeal approach, holding hearings on various elements of a replacement plan \u2013 such as health care savings accounts and new ways of differentiating the premium rates between younger and older applicants \u2013 and vowing to stitch them together eventually, in consultation with Trump\u2019s new secretary of health and human services, former Rep. Tom Price of Georgia.\n\n\u201cWe are taking a step by step approach, so people can see the changes that we are making and see how they will help,\u201d Ryan said today. \u201cAnd working with Secretary Price, we will have a stable transition where no one has the rug pulled out from under them while we work towards a better, more stable system. So this step by step approach will rescue people from Obamacare\u2019s collapse and give every American access to affordable, quality health care.\u201d\n\nYet by taking this more deliberative approach, the Republicans have begun to lose momentum \u2013 giving their opponents more opportunity to galvanize public opinion against the GOP approach. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s perilous for the Republicans, but certainly I would say that the speed is slipping,\u201d Michael Tanner, a health care policy expert with the libertarian Cato Institute, said in an interview.\n\nRelated: Why \u2018Repeal and Delay\u2019 of Obamacare Could Send Premiums Soaring Next Year\n\nOne of the Republicans\u2019 biggest fears is that while they dither over a strategy and plan to replace Obamacare, the existing subsidized private health care market will begin to collapse, with major insurance companies continuing to bail out of the program and millions of Americans threatened with the loss of coverage or even higher premiums next year.\n\nThe Trump administration has promised to provide some \u201cmarket stabilization\u201d to get the insurers and consumers what is certain to be a rocky transition period, but the insurance companies are beginning to make demands contrary to the views of the Freedom Caucus and other more conservative lawmakers.\n\nFor instance, Blue Cross Blue Shield Association lobbyists presented an industry-backed plan to officials of the White House and Department of Health and Human Services Feb. 6 that calls for preserving premium subsidies for low-income Americans and the mandate requiring everybody to buy insurance until Republicans can create state \u201chigh risk pools\u201d for providing coverage to older and sicker people. The industry proposal, first reported by Axios, would also permanently repeal Obamacare taxes on insurers and others.\n\nThe question of what to do about Obamacare taxes, which underwrite the cost of the health care plan and generate roughly $1.1 trillion over a decade, is a particularly thorny question. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) and other members of the Freedom Caucus favor totally eliminating the taxes as part of the Obamacare repeal, but that would leave the GOP with few resources to fund their alternative approach.\n\nRobert Laszewski, a health policy consultant and sharp critic of the Affordable Care Act, asserted today that for all of their challenges, Ryan and other GOP leaders were making headway on assembling a feasible replacement plan.\n\n\u201cObamacare was failing, it was unstable, and we just had an enrollment period that\u2019s going to do nothing to change that,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cAll of the ideological arguments aside, Obamacare has to be fixed.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/02/14", "title": "4-Star General Warns of \u2018Unbelievable Turmoil\u2019 in Trump\u2019s White House", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/14/4-Star-General-Warns-Unbelievable-Turmoil-Trump-s-White-House", "text": "As Republicans and Democrats alike press for an intensive investigation into ties between the Russian government and the nascent Trump administration, concern about the ability of the White House to manage a national security crisis has apparently spread into the highest ranks of the U.S. military.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, speaking a conference on special operations and low intensity conflict near Washington, a prominent four-star general suggested that the chaos in the White House, which saw the resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn late Monday night, could bleed into the military\u2019s readiness.\n\nRelated: With Flynn Out, Trump Faces Pressing Questions About National Security\n\nGeneral Raymond A.

Yates informed the White House in late January that an ongoing investigation into Flynn\u2019s ties to Russia had revealed that the Kremlin might have undue influence over the man charged with briefing the president on the most serious and sensitive issues of national security. Yates was fired by the president shortly thereafter, over her refusal to implement his executive order banning refugees and citizens of seven majority Muslim countries from entering the US.\n\nDespite the Justice Department\u2019s concerns, and in the face of other reports that the Army is investigating whether Flynn broke the law by accepting payment from the Kremlin-run RT television channel for an appearance in Moscow, Flynn retained access to the nation\u2019s most closely held secrets and, according to aides, to the president\u2019s trust.\n\n\u201cYes, Gen.

However, by all accounts, it was already there.\n\nCareer staff on the National Security Council were already frantic with concern about their status within a new administration in which young staffers with virtually no experience in national security affairs were allowed to chair their meetings, and political staff, from the president on down, treated some classified material in a strikingly cavalier fashion.\n\nThe White House reported Monday night that Flynn\u2019s position will be filled on a temporary basis by another retired general who supported Trump on the campaign trail, Keith Kellogg. Like Flynn a former Lieutenant General, Kellogg had been serving as his predecessor\u2019s deputy but is not widely expected to hold the job on a permanent basis.\n\nRelated: Another Strike Against National Security Adviser Michael Flynn\n\nOne of the many questions now facing the Trump administration is where the president will turn for Flynn\u2019s replacement.

In separate press conferences in recent days, he has accepted questions only from friendly news outlets, like the Daily Caller website and Sinclair Broadcasting, which could be counted on not to bring up Flynn.\n\nHowever, at this point, it\u2019s difficult to see how even the most obsequious reporter could fail to demand an explanation for the Flynn affair from the president and his representatives."}, {"date": "2017/02/14", "title": "Putting Wall Street First: GOP Attacks Plan to Help Millions Save for Retirement", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/02/14/Putting-Wall-Street-First-GOP-Attacks-Plan-Help-Millions-Save-Retirement", "text": "Republicans profess to believe in state\u2019s rights. In their view, states ought to use their laboratories of democracy to experiment on policy with limited federal interference. Except for national security and defense, Washington should get out of the way of Albany and Madison and Denver and Santa Fe.\n\nBut now that Republicans have taken over all levers of federal power, this principle of non-intervention in state affairs no longer applies when a state wants to do something GOP leaders don\u2019t like. In fact, congressional Republicans are moving to stop California from a potential solution to one of the biggest challenges of the century: the retirement crisis.\n\nRelated: The Government Is Holding Millions in Unclaimed Retirement Money\n\nGolden State lawmakers asked a simple question: How can we stop the epidemic of people entering retirement with no savings, forced to live off meager Social Security benefits? While Social Security was never intended to be the only leg of the retirement stool, that\u2019s become the reality for far too many. According to a 2015 Government Accountability Office report, nearly one-third of all Americans have no retirement savings or pension. And one reason for that is the lack of retirement savings choices on the job.\n\nAround 55 percent of California workers do not have access to a workplace retirement plan. Combine that with the median U.S. household holding an astonishingly low $2,500 saved for retirement, and it\u2019s a recipe for poverty in old age.\n\nSo the California state legislature passed a plan called Secure Choice. Anyone without a choice of a 401(k) or other workplace retirement plan, roughly 7.5 million Californians, would have 3 percent of their earnings automatically deposited in an account similar to an Individual Retirement Account. This could, over time, max out to 10 percent, though workers could dial down that percentage or even opt out entirely. A state board would manage the fund, placing the money first in safe investments like Treasury bonds, and later in a diversified portfolio.\n\nRelated: 8 Things You Need to Do to Get Ready for Retirement\n\nThe accounts would be portable to any job, have low costs (capped at 1 percent) and relatively low risk and give workers the chance to see savings grow over time. Eight states in all have passed laws to enact similar retirement plans, and nearly two dozen more are considering the idea. But the participation of the nation\u2019s largest state creates forward momentum to ensuring that everyone has access to a retirement savings plan.\n\nUnder the current timeline, large businesses would start implementing Secure Choice in 2018, with smaller businesses given more time. About 1.6 million Californians would become eligible in the first year. But Republicans could derail the effort.\n\nLast August, the Department of Labor issued a final rule clarifying how these state savings plans would interact with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA. Under current law, any retirement plan established by an employer with an auto-enrollment feature becomes an ERISA employee-benefit plan.\n\nRelated: Retirement Incomes Falling Short in All but 3 States\n\nERISA pre-empts all state laws related to employee benefit plans. That could make Secure Choice and other state initiatives subject to lawsuits from employers who don\u2019t want to administer them, or investment advisors who want to block competition. It would also increase disclosure and reporting requirements for employers who would just be conduits for the state plans, by deducting money from employee payroll.\n\nTo ameliorate this, the Labor Department clarified that auto-enrolled plans like California Secure Choice would not count under ERISA. But the rule didn\u2019t get finalized until August 2016, putting it within the window for Republicans to overturn it under a previously obscure law known as the Congressional Review Act. Between now and May, Congress can pass a resolution of disapproval rolling back any Obama-era rules finalized after June 2016. If President Trump signs the resolution, the rule gets rescinded, and no future rule that\u2019s \u201csubstantially similar\u201d could be passed without Congress\u2019 express consent.\n\nCrucially, these resolutions are not subject to the filibuster. So with a simple majority in the House and Senate, Republicans can blow out dozens of individual Obama-era rules. For the next several months, this will be the main deregulatory effort in Congress.\n\nRelated: States Face a $1 Trillion Pension Problem \u2014 Here Are the Worst 10\n\nLast week, two House Republicans introduced resolutions to rescind the Department of Labor rules for state and municipal retirement plans. That puts the future of Secure Choice and any similar program in jeopardy.\n\nWhy would Republicans care whether California wants to offer this for its workers? The programs are self-sustaining and put no taxpayer dollars at risk, merely expanding access to retirement plans. While Republicans claim that exempting state plans from ERISA means workers lose critical consumer protections, the spectacle of the same gang that wants to cripple the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau suddenly concerned about rip-offs makes no sense. And the Republican position also contradicts that principle of limited government and state\u2019s rights. So what\u2019s up?\n\nPart of it is pure ideology. \u201cOur nation faces difficult retirement challenges, but more government isn\u2019t the solution,\u201d said Rep. Tim Walberg (R-MI), who co-authored the new resolution. He\u2019d rather small businesses partner to offer retirement plans to employees, something that simply hasn\u2019t happened previously.\n\nRelated: A Big Reason Workers Aren\u2019t Saving More for Retirement\n\nBut Walberg lets his slip show. A state-run program offers superior portability, while employer-based programs cannot be moved from job to job. What typically happens is that an investment advisor comes in to roll over workplace plans from a former employer into IRAs. And the advisory industry doesn\u2019t want to lose that lucrative opportunity to rack up fees on savers. Indeed, the Investment Company Institute, an industry trade group, was the main opponent of California Secure Choice.\n\nAs journalist David Sirota points out, investment and insurance interests have given $515,000 to Walberg for his campaigns over the years, and a similar figure to co-author Francis Rooney (R-FL), himself a former investment company CEO.\n\nCalifornia Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Le\u00f3n, the architect of Secure Choice, is trying to figure out how to save the program, even if Republicans kill the Labor Department regulations. De Le\u00f3n could argue in court that the auto-enroll plans comply with the spirit of ERISA anyway. He may even use a statewide ballot measure to put Secure Choice on stronger legal footing.\n\nRegardless, Republicans acting on behalf of their donors want to inject significant uncertainty into the process, and stymie state initiatives that could help people save for retirement. It shows that state prerogatives when the federal government refuses to act matter less than ideological purity and investment company profits."}, {"date": "2017/02/13", "title": "Smear Campaign Against Labor Nominee Andy Pudzer Is Fake News", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/02/13/Smear-Campaign-Against-Labor-Nominee-Andy-Pudzer-Fake-News", "text": "Op-Ed: The torrent of lies about Andy Puzder, CEO of CKE Restaurants and President Trump\u2019s nominee for Labor Department Secretary, never seems to end.

Sirota suggests that Puzder is disqualified due to conflicts of interest.\n\nBut Puzder has no financial interest or investments in UBS.\n\nRelated: U.S. Senate Panel Receives Ethics Filings for Labor Nominee Puzder\n\nTake the \u201cmillions of dollars in loans,\u201d for instance. Puzder stated when he filed his forms that he has two mortgages from UBS and one home equity loan. However, since he filed the forms, he sold his home in California, leaving him with one mortgage of around $990,000, and a personal line of credit for which he owes about $125,000.\n\nA mortgage and a line of credit do not result in the borrower being under any obligation to the financial institution\u2014except to repay the loans according to their terms. If mortgage borrowers were obligated to their lenders, then all nominees to Senate-confirmed positions would either have to rent their homes or own them outright. The only concern that a loan raises is if the loan were obtained under favorable terms, such as the loans that Countrywide made to former Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) and other influential politicians in the mid-2000s.\n\nHow about Puzder\u2019s so-called investments in UBS? True, Puzder\u2019s ethics forms list an investment in UBS Dynamic Alpha Fund and 10 other UBS accounts. But these accounts are not investments in UBS, they are investments in funds or accounts managed by UBS.\n\nCharacterizing the Dynamic Alpha Fund as an investment in UBS is like saying that investors with retirement accounts in the Vanguard S&P 500 Index Fund are investing in Vanguard. In order to invest in UBS, you need to own stock in UBS. Puzder doesn\u2019t own stock in UBS, as can be seen from his public forms filed with the Office of Government Ethics.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Choice for Labor Is Under Fire From the Left \u2013 and the Right\n\nFurthermore, the Dynamic Alpha Fund, reported at between $100,000 and $250,000 in value, is classified as an \u201cexcepted investment fund\u201d under federal ethics rules. This means that the fund is (1) independently managed,\u201d (2) widely held, and (3) either publicly traded, available, or widely diversified. As a result, the Office of Government Ethics did not require Puzder to sell it.\n\nThe other 10 UBS accounts mentioned in the article are brokerage accounts whose assets Puzder has reported on the Office of Government Ethics forms. Assets in these accounts include investments in household names such as Abbott Laboratories, Coca-Cola, Cisco, and Intel. Stocks in Coca-Cola in a UBS brokerage account simply do not count as investments in UBS. Besides, all of the holdings in individual companies will have to be sold when Puzder is confirmed.\n\nThe focus on UBS arises because UBS has admitted violating currency trading practices and has been sanctioned by the Justice Department. The sanction includes a prohibition on managing pension funds. However, the Labor Department under Secretary Thomas Perez in December issued a one-year waiver so that UBS could continue to manage its $22 billion in pensions and Individual Retirement Accounts. Later this year the Labor Department will have to decide whether to extend the waiver.\n\nRelated: Mcdonald's CEO Sounds Positive Note on Trump's Labor Nominee\n\nBart Naylor of the Public Citizen is reported by Sirota as saying, \u201cHow can [Puzder] referee its critical waiver from pension fund management penalties? Why does he omit UBS from his ethics statement [when] his investments are many?\u201d\n\nNo matter that UBS was not omitted from the ethics statements, and that Puzder has no investments in UBS. Puzder has a general agreement with the Office of Government Ethics to recuse himself from any matter in which he has a financial interest. If indeed, he has a financial interest in UBS, he would not be involved in any rulings involving the bank.\n\nThe process for recusal is straightforward. If the Labor Department ethics officials judge that Puzder should recuse himself from decisions regarding UBS, then the UBS decision can be made by some other Labor Department official. It is not an infrequent occurrence.\n\nDavid Sirota is a known left-wing activist who agreed to be the CEO of True Blue Media, liberal activist David Brock\u2019s \u201cBreitbart of the Left,\u201d before he changed his plans this week. A business reporter would know the difference between investments in UBS and investments in funds or accounts managed by UBS; a political hack out to smear Andy Puzder might conveniently blur the distinction."}, {"date": "2017/02/13", "title": "The GOP\u2019s Big Tax Dilemma: Repealing Obamacare Taxes", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/13/GOP-s-Big-Tax-Dilemma-Repealing-Obamacare-Taxes", "text": "As if they aren\u2019t perplexed enough over how to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a plan that avoids stripping millions of Americans of their health insurance, congressional Republicans are sharply divided over whether to repeal hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 of Obamacare taxes.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: Any replacement program will cost a lot of money, maybe even more than Obamacare\u2019s $1.2 trillion price tag over ten years. So if the ACA and all of its mandates are repealed, the GOP will have to raise taxes.\n\nRelated: Republicans Are Having Second Thoughts About Scrapping Obamacare Taxes\n\nOn the far right, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), the former chair of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said last week that Congress and the administration must abandon any thoughts of \u201crepairing\u201d Obamacare and move ahead to fully repeal the program -- including the taxes that have been used to finance it the past four years. \u201cI would argue Obamacare is so bad, you got to get rid of every single bit of it,\u201d he told Fox News. \u201cEvery tax, every regulation, every mandate.\u201d\n\nBut more moderate or pragmatic Republicans dismiss Jordan\u2019s approach as foolhardy and reckless, and one that would deny their party sufficient resources to keep Obamacare operating throughout a lengthy transition period while bringing a new GOP health care system on-line. \u201cThese are sources of revenue you just can\u2019t discount,\u201d Rep. Patrick Meehan (R-PA), a member of the centrist House Tuesday Group, told the Associated Press. Meehan said that the money could help create \u201ca soft landing and coverage for those who currently rely on Obamacare.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX), has seconded that argument, noting that \u201cWhatever we do in replacement is going to cost some money,\u201d in the form of tax revenue or deep offsetting cuts in other areas of the budget.\n\nRelated: The Potential Cost of Obamacare Repeal: 32 Million Without Insurance\n\n\n\nFor years, Republicans have targeted the Democratic-imposed tax increases as a ripe target for demolition. The Obamacare taxes are a combination of Medicare tax increases and additional federal and state taxes aimed primarily at high-income earners. When the Democratic-controlled Congress passed the ACA in 2010, it required hospitals, the health insurance industry, medical device manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies to help finance the program because of the huge profits they would likely accrue from millions of new paying customers.\n\nRepublican critics of Obamacare have long denounced those additional taxes \u2013 especially the 2.3 percent medical devices tax, a 10 percent tax on indoor tanning services, and taxes on brand-name drugs and health insurance companies selling policies on and off the government exchanges as harmful to businesses. They have also sharply criticized two other Obamacare tax hikes on the earnings and investments of high-income earners making more than $250,000 a year.\n\nBut there is compelling evidence that if the Republicans choose to move ahead and scrap all the existing taxes hikes as part of an overall repeal of Obamacare, they will simply not have enough revenue to finance a replacement plan that comes anywhere close to insuring the 20 million Americans who currently benefit from Obamacare. Those insured include about 9 million through the exchanges, or about 2.8 percent of the population, and another 10 million through expanded Medicaid.\n\nRelated: The GOP\u2019s \u2018Repeal and Replace\u2019 Obamacare Is Becoming \u2018Repair and Fix\u2019\n\nAfter claiming at one time they could repeal and replace Obamacare this year almost overnight, President Trump and his Republican allies on Capitol Hill are currently on the defensive. They face searing complaints from insurers, the health care industry, consumer groups, Republican governors and Democratic protesters about the growing chaos in the health care markets and the GOP\u2019s inability to produce a credible alternative.\n\nThe New York Times reported Sunday that the Trump administration and congressional Republicans are urgently seeking ways to \u201cshore up\u201d the Obamacare insurance markets and prevent more insurers from pulling out amid the growing uncertainty and instability triggered by the GOP pledge to dismantle the system. One of those measures would provide billions of dollars more to the insurance companies to subsidize out-of-pocket costs and deductibles for millions of lower-income consumers.\n\nRegardless of what approach the Republicans ultimately take \u2013 whether a total repeal and replacement of Obamacare phased in over a lengthy transition period or some variation of Obamacare that preserves its most popular provisions while adding more conservative, market-based features \u2013 Republicans will need a lot of money to make that happen.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the existing Obamacare taxes would generate about $1.1 trillion in revenues between 2016 and 2025 without any changes. A Brookings Institution analysis released in late December estimates that only 40 percent of the $1.2 trillion cost of the ACA\u2019s expansion from 2019 to 2026 would be available to Congress and the White House if the taxes were repealed.\n\nRelated: Why \u2018Repeal and Delay\u2019 of Obamacare Could Send Premiums Soaring Next Year\n\nThe Republicans could generate as much as $850 billion of the total needed through a number of budgetary and tax maneuvers, including the use of \u201cdynamic\u201d budget scoring to claim $200 billion of new revenues through economic expansion. There has also been talk of capping the tax exclusion for employer-provided health insurance to pick up another $100 billion or so, although there isn\u2019t a lot of support for that.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, if Trump were to break a campaign pledge not to cut spending on Medicare as part of the GOP effort to replace Obamacare, he likely would trigger a massive backlash from the Democrats, the AARP and other seniors\u2019 advocates.\n\n\u201cObviously they are stuck in a dilemma,\u201d Paul Ginsburg, director of the Brookings Center for Health Policy, said in an email today. \u201cBasically, if you repeal all the ACA taxes, which Republicans have long wanted to do, then you are only left with 40 percent of the cost of the coverage expansion in order to pay for a replacement. Once you get rid of all of the taxes and all of the coverage provisions, you\u2019re left with only about $500 billion in your pocket.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/02/13", "title": "The Missile North Korea Just Tested Will be Difficult for the US to Stop", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/13/Missile-North-Korea-Just-Tested-Will-be-Difficult-US-Stop", "text": "On Sunday, North Korea launched a missile into the Sea of Japan for the first time since US President Donald Trump took office.\n\nSouth Korean officials told Reuters the missile, a land-based adaptation of the submarine-launched KN-11, doesn't have the range to strike the US but has another trait that's just as troubling, if not more \u2014 solid fuel.\n\nRelated: National Insecurity: Intel Officials Increasingly Worried About Trump\n\nNorth Korean missiles usually rely on liquid fuel and have to be gassed up like you'd fill up your car.\n\nNorth Korea, like many nuclear powers, mount their nuclear-capable missiles to trucks.\n\nRoad-mobile missile launchers can hide easier, launch from almost anywhere, and take an enemy by surprise \u2014 but liquid fuel complicates all that.\n\nTo launch a liquid-fueled missile, a giant convoy of military trucks must drive out to a location, fuel up the rocket with the multiple types of fuel for the different stages of launch, and then fire away. This requires dozens of trucks and associated military personnel. Such a large-scale deployment is much harder to conceal from a vigilant foe.\n\nRelated: Another Strike Against National Security Adviser Michael Flynn\n\n\"Liquid-fueled missiles are more vulnerable to tracking and preemptive strikes. Solid-fueled ballistic missiles are not fueled on site and therefore pose more of a threat because solid-fueled ballistic missiles require less support and can be deployed more quickly,\" Kelsey Davenport, the director of nonproliferation policy and a North Korea expert at the Arms Control Association, told Business Insider.\n\nUsing a missile like the one tested on Sunday, North Korea could simply park a truck and let a missile fly.\n\n\"Another striking feature of the test was the transport erector launcher that was used to launch the missile. Images indicate that it ran on treads rather than wheels,\" said Davenport. \"This allows North Korea to move its missiles through more difficult terrains.\"\n\nTo counter such a sneaky launcher, an adversary would have to spend extensively on surveillance and recon technology.\n\nSo while North Korea remains without an ICBM to directly threaten the US homeland, their successful launch of a solid-fueled missile means they have developed a very destabilizing technology that can strike US military bases, South Korea, or Japan in a moment's notice.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Business Insider.

Flynn has been accused, by sources in the Intelligence Community, of discussing the lifting of Obama administration sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador before Trump officially took office.\n\nFlynn later denied that he had done so, expressing his innocence directly to Vice President Mike Pence who then went on television to defend him. Later, further leaks from intelligence operatives with access to intercepts of the calls claimed that Flynn had misled both the vice president and the public.\n\nLying to the vice president would likely be a fireable offense in any other White House, and Flynn\u2019s status within Trump\u2019s remains unclear. Miller, in television appearances over the weekend, declined to offer even the standard claim that Flynn enjoys the president\u2019s \u201cfull confidence,\u201d which assertion, by itself, usually signals that someone is in trouble.\n\nRelated: This Is What Undiluted Trumpism Tastes Like\n\nThe result is a National Security Council operating in crisis mode, with career staff unsure not just of the new administration\u2019s priorities, but about whether or not they will have the same boss when they wake up each morning.\n\nFlynn, however, is far from the only high-visibility staffer who might be in trouble. From his first moments behind the podium in the White House briefing room, Press Secretary Sean Spicer has been the target of ridicule in the media and reported criticism from within the Oval Office.\n\nOver the weekend, Washingtonian magazine reported that former Navy SEAL and early Trump supporter Carl Higbie was being considered a replacement for Spicer, which Higbie appeared to confirm. Trump has reportedly been unhappy with some elements of Spicer\u2019s job performance and with mockery he has become, particularly on Saturday Night Live, where actress Melissa McCarthy has been lampooning him as a rage-driven fabulist.\n\nPossibly the most surprising person that Trump is said to be considering for replacement is White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. There wasn\u2019t much discussion about it until last weekend when Newsmax CEO and Trump friend Chris Ruddy had drinks with the president, then promptly went on CNN to rip into Priebus for \u201cweakness\u201d and poor communications.\n\nRelated: Trump the Populist Is Trying to Hobble a Champion of the Little Guy\n\nRuddy, in an interview with The Washington Post, repeated his criticism, saying, \u201c\u201cIt\u2019s my view that Reince is the problem. I think on paper Reince looked good as the chief of staff \u2014 and Donald trusted him \u2014 but it\u2019s pretty clear the guy is in way over his head. He\u2019s not knowledgeable of how federal agencies work, how the communications operations work. He botched this whole immigration rollout. This should\u2019ve been a win for Donald, not two or three weeks of negative publicity.\u201d\n\nHis statements earned Ruddy a couple of calls from the White House, as he reported on Twitter Sunday. \u201cReince just briefed me on new WH plans. Impressive! CNN today my personal view. Told him I have 'open mind' based on his results,\u201d he tweeted. Later, he noted that Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner had also reached out to him. \u201cJared Kushner tells me COS Reince is doing \u2018amazing job.\u2019\u201d\n\nNevertheless, his statements, and his relationship with Trump, naturally led to speculation that the former chair of the Republican National Committee might not be long for the chief of staff job. Mike Allen, of Axios, reported that there is speculation Trump might smooth Priebus\u2019s exit by offering him a cabinet position.\n\nRelated: Another Strike Against National Security Adviser Michael Flynn\n\nTrump has been publicly silent about the future of all three of the men, and at this point, it is unclear what constitutes a firing offense in his White House. Known to prize loyalty, Trump has received plenty of it from all three men who have taken plenty of slings and arrows on his behalf over the past year.\n\nBut loyalty to Trump is no golden ticket. Just ask Corey Lewandowski, the dedicated former Trump campaign manager who was ousted in the midst of the primary season and was not pulled into the administration after the election.\n\nTrump has demonstrated that he\u2019s happy to cut someone loose if he decides their liabilities outweigh their benefits.

Flynn, according to intelligence officials who spoke to the Washington Post, explicitly discussed the possibility of lifting sanctions imposed on Russia by the Obama administration, a grave breach of protocol and possibly a violation of federal law.\n\nRelated: Another Strike Against National Security Adviser Michael Flynn\n\nStephen Miller, the senior White House official dispatched to the Sunday talk shows, refused to discuss Flynn at all beyond praising his former service as an Army General. He left the impression that Flynn\u2019s position in the White House is tenuous at best.\n\nUncertainty at the top has career officials on the National Security Council in a state of constant worry, The New York Times reported on Sunday, and the overtly political behavior of some new Trump-appointed staff has further shaken the traditionally nonpartisan body. Flynn\u2019s deputy, former Fox News pundit K.T. McFarland, who once served as an NSC staffer, has reportedly used Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan in NSC meetings, and appointees are said to be carrying mugs with that logo into meetings with foreign officials.\n\nTrump himself continued to raise concerns about how seriously he takes national security issues over the weekend. On Saturday, North Korea took the provocative step of launching a ballistic missile into the Sea of Japan. The president, who was dining with the Japanese Prime Minister at his private club Mar-a-Lago when news of the launch broke, took a phone call from his national security staff in a crowded dining room while club members snapped cellphone pictures.\n\nIn an interview with Politico, Sen. Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, described the new administration as a \u201cwrecking ball\u201d that is \u201cdetermined to just destroy everything\u201d in its approach to foreign policy.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Tough Stance on Iran: Nothing to Gain, a Lot to Lose\n\nCorker revealed that when he was being interviewed by Trump and White House Strategist Steve Bannon as a potential Secretary of State nominee, he found himself disagreeing with the incoming administration on virtually everything: \u201cin almost every case but maybe one.\u201d\n\nMoving forward, he said, \u201cThe challenge is going to be\u2026 so you want to do deals, deals, deals. Or you want to disrupt this and this and this. You\u2019ve got to decide toward what end.\u201d\n\nThe most disturbing story to emerge over the weekend was also the least verifiable. In his column at the Observer, John Schindler, a former National Security Agency employee who now works as a consultant, claimed that high-ranking officials in the intelligence community have informed him that they are now withholding intelligence from the Trump administration out of concern that the administration cannot be trusted to safeguard it.\n\nA senior National Security Agency official explained that NSA was systematically holding back some of the \u201cgood stuff\u201d from the White House, in an unprecedented move. For decades, NSA has prepared special reports for the president\u2019s eyes only, containing enormously sensitive intelligence. In the last three weeks, however, NSA has ceased doing this, fearing Trump and his staff cannot keep their best SIGINT secrets.\n\nRelated: Looks Like Mexico Will Get a Much Bigger-than-Expected Bill for Trump\u2019s Wall\n\nAnother official, Schindler said, told him that the Intelligence Community now believes that Russia has penetrated the White House.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on was explained lucidly by a senior Pentagon intelligence official, who stated that \u201csince January 20, we\u2019ve assumed that the Kremlin has ears inside the SITROOM,\u201d meaning the White House Situation Room, the 5,500 square-foot conference room in the West Wing where the president and his top staffers get intelligence briefings. \u201cThere\u2019s not much the Russians don\u2019t know at this point,\u201d the official added in wry frustration.\n\nSchindler\u2019s sources are not named, and there is no evidence for the claim that sensitive information is being withheld from the White House beyond their anonymous statements to him.\n\nBut given the antagonistic relationship the president has created between himself and the Intelligence Community, Schindler\u2019s reporting is at least plausible, which by itself should be enough to scare anybody."}, {"date": "2017/02/13", "title": "Another Strike Against National Security Adviser Michael Flynn", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/13/Another-Strike-Against-National-Security-Adviser-Michael-Flynn", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn -- the former Army general, fake news aficionado and now apparently misleader of the vice president \u2013 is looking as gone as a wild goose in one of those winters we used to have before climate change came along.\n\nRelated: Out Like Flynn - Why Trump Must Dump the \u2018Fake News\u2019 General\n\nOn NBC\u2019s Meet the Press Sunday morning, uber-prepared Trump adviser and Steve Bannon lieutenant Stephen Miller (who has the look and feel of a young Roy Cohn) declined to speak for the president when moderator Chuck Todd asked about the boss\u2019s continued confidence in General Flynn.\n\n\u201cThat's the question that I think you should ask the president, the question you should ask Reince [Priebus], the chief of staff.

In fact, his performance in the war theaters of Iraq and Afghanistan as an analyst of military intelligence was by all accounts superior.\n\nAs a player in the national political theater, though, he has been appalling.\n\nFlynn\u2019s behavior during the campaign \u2013 leading chants of \u201clock her up\u201d and spreading bogus news stories -- was unseemly for a person of his intellect, but almost unimaginable for a former three-star general steeped in the unspoken rules of behavior attached to his rank.\n\nFlynn might want to revisit the military Code of Conduct. Yes, it applies to those in uniform, and Flynn has hung his in a closet. And yes, it is about what is expected of a soldier under arms, not of a civilian or a warrior who has put down his sword.\n\nBut the words of the code\u2019s Article VI should still have some resonance.

Governor Tarullo, who was appointed by President Obama in 2009, led the effort to plug the holes in financial regulation that allowed the housing bubble and financial panic to occur. So his resignation comes at an inopportune time for those of us worried about Trump\u2019s plans for wholesale deregulation of the financial sector and the vulnerability to another financial crisis that comes with it.\n\nTrump could also have a large impact on how the Fed conducts monetary policy. With Governor Tarullo\u2019s departure, three of the seven seats on the Board of Governors are open (two of Obama\u2019s nominees were never confirmed), and Janet Yellen\u2019s term as Fed Chair ends on February 3, 2018. Although she could stay on the Board until her term ends on January 31, 2024, traditionally when a new chair is appointed, the current Fed chair resigns (this opens up a position on the Board for the new chair, but with three open positions that tradition may not be honored).\n\nRelated: Trump Has a Chance to Remake the Federal Reserve\n\nBeyond that, Stanley Fischer\u2019s appointment as Vice-Chair ends in June of 2018 and his term ends in January of 2020. Like Yellen, he could stay on until his term ends but there is no guarantee that he will. And, of course, there could be other resignations as well. I fully expect Trump will be able to appoint at least five of the seven Fed Governors by the end of his first term.\n\nWith a Congress that seems ready to rubber stamp his choices for important government positions rather than fulfill its \u201cadvise and consent\u201d role, the conduct of monetary policy could change dramatically. If Trump politicizes the Fed, for example, by stacking the Board with people who will attempt to implement whatever policy he desires, the Fed could be permanently damaged.\n\nBoth Obama and Bush were able to appoint all of the members of the Board of Governors by the end of their second terms. The Board of Governors constitutes a majority of the twelve member committee that sets monetary policy, and the ability to stack the Board gives individual presidents far more influence over monetary policy than was intended when the Federal Reserve System was set up (if all Governors serve their full 14 year terms, a president can only appoint two of the seven Board members in a four year term, four of seven in two terms).\n\nThe fact that both Obama and Bush were able to stack the Board did not raise huge concerns since both nominated competent people and both respected the Fed\u2019s independence. That\u2019s not to say that there were no concerns at all. As noted above, for example, during both the Bush and Obama administrations some nominees were not confirmed (including a Nobel prize winner nominated by Obama whose qualifications were not in doubt).\n\nRelated: Top Federal Reserve Official Resigns as Bank Deregulation Looms\n\nBut despite the ideological differences over monetary and regulatory policy that led to these confirmation difficulties, Federal Reserve policy has been relatively consistent and effective from administration to administration over the last several decades. This is due in no small part to politicians respecting the Fed\u2019s independence.\n\nTrump has already shown he has no respect for traditional political boundaries, and that being qualified is not a necessary condition for being appointed to fulfill an important role in his administration. Loyalty is all that matters. If Trump wants to, he will be able to stack the Fed with people, qualified or not, who will implement the monetary and regulatory policies he desires. Given his evident lack of knowledge about monetary policy \u2013 for example, he has said \u201cBringing back the gold standard would be very hard to do, but, boy, would it be wonderful\u201d \u2013 that could be a disaster.\n\nCan he be stopped? The first line of defense, the advise and consent role of the Senate, has already been compromised, and Trump is in the process of doing his best to mute a second line of defense -- the influence of economists. So far economists are conspicuously missing from his administration. I don\u2019t expect the objections of economists to matter at all to Trump or to the Republicans in the Senate who must approve his nominations.\n\nRelated: Populist on the Trail, Trump Pivots Toward the Banking Industry\n\nThat leaves the media and the public. Objections from the \u201cmainstream\u201d media won\u2019t matter any more than the objections of economists and the media Trump depends upon will support him in any case. So there\u2019s not much hope there either. As for the public, the people Trump cares about have been so misled about the Fed and the important role it played during the financial crisis and Great Recession that they will likely cheer whatever he does.\n\nSo long as Janet Yellen is still at the helm of the Fed, the institution has some protection. She has the authority to control the agenda at monetary policy meetings and prevent bad proposals from seeing the light of day. But her term as chair is over in less than a year and I don\u2019t expect Trump to reappoint her. I hope I am wrong, but my fear is that her departure will be the end of the Fed as we know it, and the beginning of a Fed stamped with the Trump brand name in big \u201cgold standard\u201d letters with him as the CEO.

But the Department of Agriculture\u2019s latest 2017 farm income forecast released last week offers a much bleaker picture of things to come:\n\nRelated: Farmers Are Getting a Bumper Crop of Subsidies from the 2014 Farm Bill\n\nNet farm income is forecast to decline by 8.7 percent to $62.3 billion -- the lowest level in nearly 15 years when adjusted for inflation. Receipts from wheat sales are likely to plunge by $1.4 billion or 16.6 percent compared to 2016. What\u2019s more, the value of farm assets will dip by 1.1 percent, while farm debt is projected to surge by 5.2 percent.\n\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, the Wall Street Journal warned last week that another big agricultural financial bust may be on the way. \u201cAcross the heartland, a multiyear slump in prices for corn, wheat and other farm commodities brought on by the glut of grain worldwide is pushing many farmers further into debt,\u201d the Journal\u2019s Jesse Newman and Patrick McGroarty wrote.\n\nAmong the report\u2019s more salient findings: The U.S. share of the global market is less than half of what it was in the 1970s -- falling from 65 percent of the world\u2019s grain production to 30 percent today. A strong U.S. dollar is allowing overseas competitors to undercut U.S. prices. Some farmers are shutting down, raising the specter that the total number of U.S. farms may dip below two million for the first time.\n\nCraig Scott, a fifth-generation farmer in Ransom, Kansas, in the heart of farm country, lamented to the Journal reporters that \u201cYou keep pinching and pinching and pretty soon there\u2019s nothing left to pinch.\u201d\n\nRelated: 5 Things You Need to Know About the Farm Bill Deal\n\nFarming forever has been a high-stakes enterprise, with success or failure determined as much by the vagaries of weather, the relative value of the dollar and the shape of foreign markets as by a farmer\u2019s skill in managing his land and planting the right crops. Farming has changed considerably over the past half century, with larger, more efficient, corporate farms absorbing smaller farms, or driving them out of business.\n\nBut one thing that hasn\u2019t changed that much is the invisible hand of the federal government, which has heavily subsidized and propped up farmers over the years with hundreds of billions of dollars of assistance. The Farm Belt throughout the south, the Midwest, and the far West has long been a potent political force, and Congress has generally responded with generous assistance \u2013 even for some who don\u2019t really need it.\n\nThe 2014 farm bill was hailed as a major breakthrough in agriculture spending reform, with changes that got rid of some of the most blatant boondoggles. Even so, the legislation called for nearly $1 trillion of spending over five years on agricultural programs and food stamps, with a lot of that money earmarked for programs to take some of the risks out of farming.\n\n\u201cAgricultural businesses have a safety net that would be the envy of any industry,\u201d said Joshua Sewell, senior policy analyst with Taxpayers for Common Sense. Sewell argues that this sudden concern about declining farm incomes overlooks the fact that farmers were on an economic roll for several years and now must face up to a market correction.\n\n\u201cCrop prices and farm incomes have reverted to their long-term norm after experiencing record highs from 2009 to 2013,\u201d he said, hardly a cause for further government assistance.\n\nRelated: Food Stamp Use Is Falling, and the GOP Wants to Cut It Even More\n\nTaxpayers for Common Sense, a government watchdog group, has long made a cottage industry of closely monitoring federal agriculture programs that cover everything from subsidizing agriculture businesses to rural utilities to nutrition assistance. Some of these programs date back to the 1930s, during the Great Depression, and are hard to justify today. While the group applauded some of the reforms in the 2014 legislation, it denounced some of the changes as legislative sleight of hand.\n\nRepublican and Democratic negotiators agreed to cut roughly $19 billion in farm programs over five years. One of the biggest breakthroughs was the elimination of so-called direct payments. In the past, grain producers would receive payments each year totaling about $5 billion, regardless of the prevailing market prices or which crops, if any, they grew.\n\nWith the blessing of the Obama administration, Congress finally voted to get rid of the wasteful direct payments. Yet while taking away that subsidy, lawmakers quietly gave some of it back, as the Fiscal Times reported. Some of those savings from direct payments were added to a massive crop insurance program, in which the federal government covers losses from poor yields or declines in revenue.\n\nAccording to Sewell, the 2014 farm bill \u201cput taxpayers on the hook for keeping these good times rolling,\u201d by expanding federally subsidized crop insurance and creating two new subsidy programs \u2013 Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage.\n\nRelated: Rural State Republicans Challenge Trump\u2019s Infrastructure Spending Plan\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ve been hooked,\u201d Sewell said in an email late last week. \u201cThe most recent estimates put the price tag for ARC/PLC at $32 billion for the first five years of payments, $15 billion more than originally estimated, and crop insurance is still expected to cost an additional $8 billion a year.\u201d\n\nSewell terms the latest round of bad economic news for farmers a \u201cmarket correction\u201d following years of good times, and insists that the government shouldn\u2019t have to blunt the impact.\n\n\u201cThis market correction didn\u2019t sneak up on anyone,\u201d Sewell said. \u201cInstead of looking to taxpayers for additional financial bailouts, we need to reform our ag policy to allow farmers to plant for a 21st-century market rather than Washington.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/02/12", "title": "This Is What Undiluted Trumpism Tastes Like", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/12/What-Undiluted-Trumpism-Tastes", "text": "On Sunday morning, anybody who turned on the political talk shows for their weekly cocktail of angry pushback and dubious facts from representatives of the Trump administration was instead handed a shot glass full of barrel-proof Trumpism.

More than 90 lawmakers have previously opposed the bank, according to a list compiled by the group.\n\n\"The Export-Import Bank is little more than a corporate welfare agency,\" Heritage Action said in a statement Friday.\n\nSupporters of Ex-Im point out that such banks exist in one form or another among most developed nations, and U.S. companies would be at a disadvantage without the bank when they're bidding against rivals from Europe, China and elsewhere for overseas deals.\n\nTrump's position on the bank shifted over the course of his presidential campaign. Initially, he rejected the bank, calling it \"excess baggage\" in a 2015 interview with National Journal. But he later appeared to soften that stance and said last spring that he would make his position clear soon.\n\nRelated: Trump the Populist Is Trying to Hobble a Champion of the Little Guy\n\nOn Thursday, two Democratic senators said that Trump indicated he would support the bank following a lunch with lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

Fitch warned that as the rhetoric escalates, \"the list is unlikely to end there.\"\n\n\"One interpretation of current events is that, after an early flurry of disruptive change to establish a fundamental reorientation of policy direction and intent, the administration will settle in, embracing a consistent business- and trade-friendly framework that leverages these aspects of its economic program, with favourable international spill-overs,\" Fitch's analysts said.\n\nHowever, Fitch maintains that global credit and economic risks are to the downside, with a \"less benign\" scenario more likely to emerge, particularly when it comes to trade.\n\nRelated: Why Trump\u2019s Romance With Big Labor Is Headed for the Rocks\n\nFitch's warning, however, runs counter to most economic and investor surveys.\n\nThough consumer sentiment dipped in February , it remains high compared with historical norms. The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index, which measures data compared to expectations, is running near multiyear highs. The Atlanta Fed sees first-quarter GDP at 2.7 percent, which would be the best start to a year since 2013.\n\nAlso, the major stock market averages are setting new records, and equity mutual funds just broke a 47-week run of net outflows, the longest in history, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper.\n\n'A lot can change'\n\nThe administration thus far has pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has issued harsh rhetoric against companies seeking to relocate outside the U.S. Fitch said the ramifications of its moves won't be known for a while, but the early indications are for disruption around the world.\n\n\"In short, a lot can change, but the aggressive tone of some administration rhetoric does not portend an easy period of negotiation ahead, nor does it suggest there is much scope for compromise,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nThe warning comes a day after Fitch said the amount of countries carrying AAA-rated debt has fallen to its lowest level in 14 years. As a percentage of all nations with rated sovereign debt, that is the worst reading ever.\n\nThe U.S. maintains its pristine rating, even though Fitch noted that it is \"judged to have (relatively) weak public finances.\"\n\nOn the upside, Fitch said Trump's plans to cut taxes, slash business regulations and spend on infrastructure are pro-growth.\n\nHowever, restrictions on immigration are viewed negatively. Fitch pointed out that the U.S. and Mexico have the world's busiest immigration corridor. In addition to Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua all have high \"remittance flows,\" or payments that immigrants send back to their home countries.\n\nThe Fitch warning also includes countries that enjoy investment from U.S. companies and in turn ship goods back to the United States. That list is \"potentially long\" and includes Canada, the U.K., Netherlands, Mexico, Germany, China and Brazil.\n\nThis article originally appeared on CNBC.

Board members are appointed to 14-year terms, with only one expiration every two years, and only in even-numbered years. This typically means that a new administration may not have the opportunity to replace even a single member of the Fed board until the beginning of the second year of an administration.\n\nRelated: Trump the Populist Is Trying to Hobble a Champion of the Little Guy\n\nTrump, however, took office with two empty seats on the board, and the announcement of Tarullo leaves him a third to fill. And while none of the four remaining board members\u2019 terms will expire before 2020, he\u2019ll also have the chance to make another important pick next year.\n\nThat\u2019s because under the Fed\u2019s rules, the powerful role of Board Chair is awarded on a four-year basis. Current chair Janet Yellen\u2019s membership on the board doesn\u2019t expire until 2024, but her tenure as chair will end in 2018 if she is not reappointed. Should Trump elect to tap a different Fed chair, it is possible that Yellen would retire from the central bank altogether. In theory at least, by this time next year, a majority of the members of the Fed board could be Trump appointees who would have to be confirmed by the Senate.\n\nThis is important for multiple reasons. The role of the Fed most familiar to the public is related to monetary policy. The Fed\u2019s Open Market Committee meets several times a year to set the target for the Federal Funds Rate, which in turn affects the interest rates for everything from mortgages to credit card balances.\n\nThe members of the Board of Governors are permanent members of the FOMC, a panel that is fleshed out by a rotating cast of presidents from the twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks. The Governors, when all positions are filled, constitute a majority of the 12 voting members of the FOMC. The Fed Chair also chairs the FOMC and traditionally has considerable influence over the direction and pace of changes to interest rates.\n\nRelated: Americans Are Having Doubts About Trump\u2019s Agenda: Poll\n\nBut the Fed\u2019s role extends well beyond monetary policy into the regulation of the financial services industry. The central bank has oversight authority over most US banks -- and all major ones -- and is also charged with maintaining broader stability in the financial services marketplace.\n\nTrump, who regularly attacked the financial services ties of his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign, has nevertheless shown considerable deference to it in his appointment of cabinet members and close advisers.\n\nThe people he appoints to the Fed Board will have considerable influence over regulatory decisions, including how existing rules are enforced and how future rules are written.\n\nThis is particularly true with the departure of Tarullo. The Fed board has a position for a vice chair in charge of bank oversight, but it has gone unfilled for several years. Tarullo, who had a strong interest in regulation, became the central bank\u2019s de facto chief regulator in recent years, picking up many of the responsibilities that would have gone to the vice chair.\n\nRelated: Why Trump\u2019s Romance With Big Labor Is Headed for the Rocks\n\nIn fact, there is speculation that it was the prospect of having that portfolio effectively taken away from him by a new Trump appointee that led Tarullo to announce his departure.\n\nTrump, still struggling to get his cabinet nominees confirmed, likely won\u2019t make any moves with regard to Fed appointments in the immediate future.

The order has been widely interpreted as Trump\u2019s call to begin the demolition of Obamacare from within, before Congress finally gets around to passing legislation. Price reportedly will begin rolling out some policy changes shortly.\n\nThe other challenge is to take a leading role in designing or perfecting Obamacare replacement legislation. In recent weeks, a number of Republicans have begun promoting replacement plans of their own, including one by Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana that would essentially allow the states to decide whether to keep Obamacare or opt for some other health insurance system.\n\nRelated: GOP Cuts in Medicare May Be Next After Dismantling Obamacare\n\nSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky unveiled a more conservative system of tax credits and health savings accounts after privately conferring with Trump. And Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR), chair of the House Energy & Commerce Committee, Ways and Means Committee Chair Kevin Brady of Texas, and Ryan are all weighing in with proposals of their own.\n\nFor his part, Price has spent years working on replacement ideas, and most recently unveiled a 242-page bill detailing a new conservative approach. That legislation, called the Empowering Patients First Act, would use a handful of tax credits, savings incentives, state grants and other marketing incentives to spark greater competition within the insurance industry and provide consumers with more policy choices, ideally at a lower cost.\n\nBut Price\u2019s proposals for weaning more than 20 million Americans away from Obamacare are highly controversial among Republicans as well as Democrats. And critics have warned that any radical alternative like this would result in millions of Americans losing coverage.\n\nPrice, a wealthy orthopedic surgeon from suburban Atlanta who has spent much of his political career as a state legislator and House member railing against government intervention, is unmatched in his disdain for Obamacare and government regulations that he says intrude on the relationship between doctors and their patients.\n\nRelated: Congress Gives Trump a Chance to Recast the Federal Budget\n\nDuring his testimony before the Senate Finance Committee last month, Price declared that \u201cwe ought not go down the road\u201d with anything that \u201cgets in the way\u201d of the patient, their families and physicians \u201cmaking the decisions about what kind of health care they desire.\u201d\n\nThe Tea Party conservative has embraced a number positions well outside of the mainstream of basic health care policy, as The Washington Post noted Thursday. Democrats say that they are even more alarmed that Price for years has advocated transforming Medicare from an open-ended entitlement for seniors to a fixed government contribution for beneficiaries to use to either purchase private insurance or continue with traditional Medicare.\n\nAlthough Trump pledged during the campaign to leave Medicare and Social Security alone, liberal groups and advocates for seniors now worry that Medicare could become a bargaining chip later this year, as Republicans look for ways to finance their health care initiatives and help pay for a massive tax cut.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York charged that Price had \u201cdedicated his life to destroying Medicare as we know it\u201d and that Price\u2019s premium support approach would result in millions of seniors losing their health care coverage.\n\nMcConnell vigorously defended Price and his views, saying at one point that Price \u201cknows more about health care policy than just about anyone.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/02/10", "title": "Trump the Populist Is Trying to Hobble a Champion of the Little Guy", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/02/10/Trump-Populist-Trying-Hobble-Champion-Little-Guy", "text": "After being bested by Hillary Clinton in a primary contest that saw the deck stacked against him by the Clinton Machine, Bernie is back in the Senate doing what he has always done for the past 30-odd years \u2013 fighting a system rigged against blue-collar and middle-class America.\n\nRelated: It\u2019s About to Get a Lot Easier to Sue Your Credit Card Company\n\nMeantime, the Improbable President has larded his Cabinet and cadre of counselors with bespoke denizens of the financial community \u2013 the very people he railed against \u2013 and is working to undermine protections put in place to give the voters who elected him a means to fight back against the banks and credit-card companies that gnaw at their paychecks.\n\nAs the Senate prepares to confirm the Treasury Secretary nomination of Steve Mnuchin\u2014an ex-Goldman Sachs banker and financier who foreclosed on thousands of families, including active-duty troops, during the housing bust\u2014Republicans are working to dismantle or neuter the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nConservative knives are out for the CFPB, created after the financial crisis as an agency to rein in the excesses of the financial industry.

For the record, Barack Obama had 34 former employees from Goldman Sachs in his administration, including Rahm Emanuel, his chief of staff; Stephen Friedman, Chair of Obama\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board; Timothy Geithner, Secretary of the Treasury; and Larry Summers, chief economic advisor.\n\nRelated: Yellen Sends a Message to Trump: Hands Off Dodd-Frank\n\nAs The New York Times reported yesterday, House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling has a plan that would make it easier to replace the leadership of the CFPB and at the same time \u201climit the bureau\u2019s enforcement authority, reduce its ability to make rules and repeal its consumer complaint system.\u201d\n\nIn addition, The Times said that the plan contained in a leaked memo from Hensarling, once said to be under consideration for Treasury Secretary, called for legislation that \u201cwould also greatly shrink the enforcement tools at the consumer watchdog\u2019s disposal, blocking it from being able to go after businesses engaged in deceptive practices and restricting its oversight of big publicly traded companies that are already regulated by agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission.\u201d\n\nIn an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, Hensarling called the CFPB \u201cthe most destructive and dangerous of the new regulatory bureaucracies\u201d created by the Obama Administration.\n\nOne of the dangerous and destructive acts of the CFPB was to join with the Los Angeles City Attorney\u2019s Office and Office of the Controller of the Currency in going after Wells Fargo for a scheme in which some 2 million bogus bank and credit-card accounts were opened without customers\u2019 knowledge. (The regulators acted after a 2013 investigation by The Los Angeles Times.)\n\nWells Fargo paid $185 million in fines, including $100 million to the CFPB. Its CEO, John Stumpf was forced to resign.

The changes in the law made treatment more available and less expensive. Also, young people who needed help could stay on their parent\u2019s health plans up to age 26.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the new laws recognized that mental health and substance abuse treatments are just as important as physical conditions, and that it would be a mistake to impose more restrictions on the number of treatment sessions for these mental health disorders than for more typical visits to doctors and health care facilities.\n\nRepublican and Democratic governors alike have raised concern about losing expanded Medicaid coverage for their constituents if the Affordable Care Act is finally repealed \u2013 or if Congress converts the Medicaid program to federal block grants to the states.

When that didn\u2019t stick, Samantha Power, Obama\u2019s U.N. ambassador, asserted that the tests breach an earlier Security Council resolution.\n\nThey do not in either case. The Trump White House is down to claiming the tests \u201cviolate the spirit\u201d of the pact, but they don\u2019t do that, either.

The P5 + 1 group is not even remotely considering a renegotiation.\n\nSpeaking in Tehran after the test last week, French foreign minister Jean\u2013Marc Ayrault expressed \u201cconcern\u201d about it, which is just above a shrug in diplomacy-speak. He then said, \u201cWe harbor real concerns about the U.S. administration\u2019s attitude toward this agreement.\u201d\n\nTrump and Flynn need a reality check before they go any further. Their running theme, \u201cIran should be grateful for the nuclear agreement,\u201d is myopic and needlessly provocative.

This means they\u2019re headed for the same kind of trouble Obama found and some new trouble of their own making.\n\nThe sanctions just implemented were drafted while Obama was still in office. As to the nuclear accord, Obama\u2019s Treasury began to undermine it as soon as it was signed. If an administration wanted to reap as little benefit as it could from a deal it worked hard to strike, Barack Obama and John Kerry, his secretary of state, showed how to do it.\n\nTrump and his national security adviser should avoid making a variant of the same mistake.\n\nNo diplomatic settlement is ever perfect, but the Iran accord has plenty in it to Washington\u2019s advantage. Iran accepted a significant infringement on its sovereign rights including inspections of unprecedented intrusion.

Purcell said the government had not demonstrated how they could practically implement such a solution.\n\nTrump and his supporters have pressed the case that the short-term stoppage on refugees and immigrants from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen is necessary for national security reasons.

According to the Marine Times, Davis said that out of 1,065 aircraft, 439 \u2013 or less than 50 percent -- were operational as of Dec. 31, 2016.\n\nFrom fiscal 2018 through 2021, the Marines are scheduled to get 20 F-35Bs a year. Davis wants to jack that number up to about 37 Joint Strike Fighters a year.\n\nThe F-35B is the short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) version of the Joint Strike Fighter, designed specifically for the Marines. According to the new $8.5 billion contract between the Pentagon and Lockheed Martin, the Marine version of the F-35 costs $122.8 million apiece, though that figure is expected to drop as manufacturing efficiencies kick in. An additional 17 jets per year would cost a bit more than $2 billion at the current rate.\n\nOn Monday at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, President Trump claimed credit for helping to bring down the cost of the F-35, saying the U.S. saved more than $600 million after he got involved in negotiations with Lockheed Martin. However, those savings may have been in the works before he took office.\n\nRelated: Air Force General Challenges Trump Over the F-35\n\nThe Marines are also looking to increase their numbers overall. In written testimony to Congress on Tuesday, Assistant Commandant Gen. Glenn Walters said the service needs to raise its fighting force to 194,000, the Marine Times said. The fiscal 2017 budget pushes up the troop level to 185,000 from 182,000, though that increase has not yet been funded.\n\nOne big plus the Marines may have in its favor as it seeks to gain strength: The Defense Department is now in the hands of a former four-star Marine general, James Mattis."}, {"date": "2017/02/09", "title": "Rural State Republicans Challenge Trump\u2019s Infrastructure Spending Plan", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/09/Rural-State-Republicans-Challenge-Trump-s-Infrastructure-Spending-Plan", "text": "President Donald Trump swept to victory last November with overwhelming support from rural white voters across the country who eagerly responded to the billionaire businessman\u2019s pledge to repair and modernize their roads, bridges, and airports and bring back jobs to their remote and sparsely populated communities.\n\nTrump promised to pump at least $1 trillion into new infrastructure projects in the coming years, or twice as much as his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, had promised to spend.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s $1Trillion Infrastructure Plan Raises a Red Flag for Dems\n\nBut the outlines of his plan that first surfaced late in the campaign are proving highly controversial. And Republican lawmakers, policymakers, and state transportation officials from predominantly rural states and communities are bridling over a proposed financing mechanism that could largely freeze them out of most of the benefit.\n\nAlthough neither Trump nor his new Transportation Secretary, Elaine Cho, has formally embraced the approach, the plan is gaining widespread attention. As initially drafted, it calls for the use of new generous tax credits to attract private investors into public-private partnerships, instead of more traditional direct federal and state government spending on infrastructure.\n\nTrump boasted that under his approach, the federal government could avoid having to raise gas taxes or increase the deficit to pay for the new projects. However, a major caveat was that this new strategy could only succeed with projects that generate substantial revenue flows \u2013 such as toll bridges and toll roads or airport parking garages. While nearly 30 states collect tolls on roads, bridges and in tunnels, the majority of states that don\u2019t are located in the West, including Wyoming, Montana, Arizona, Oregon and New Mexico.\n\nDuring a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing on Wednesday, Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming \u2013 the powerful Republican chairman and a member of the Senate GOP leadership -- complained that raising private investment for toll roads and bridges would do little to help his sprawling, sparsely populated state.\n\nRelated: Trump Proposes $1 Trillion for Infrastructure Without Raising Taxes\n\nHe noted that members of his committee represent both urban and rural areas \u2013 from New York City and Newport, Rhode Island to Nebraska City, Nebraska, and Wheatland, Wyoming. \u201cThe diversity of these cities and towns make it clear: solutions to address and pay for fixing our nation\u2019s crumbling roads, bridges and dams cannot be one-size-fits-all,\u201d Barrasso said in his opening statement. \u201cWhat works for Baltimore, Maryland, might not work for Baggs, Wyoming.\u201d\n\n\u201cFunding solutions that involve public-private partnerships, as have been discussed by administration officials, may be innovative solutions for crumbling inner cities, but do not work for rural areas,\u201d he added.\n\nWilliam Panos, director of the Wyoming Department of Transportation, told the committee that public-private partnership ventures to repair or replace highways, roads, and bridges that depend on a steady revenue stream are not an adequate solution for rural America\u2019s needs.\n\n\u201cThe traffic volumes on projects in rural states are low, and it\u2019s almost never feasible from revenue generation,\u201d he said in his remarks.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why It Will Be So Hard for Trump or Clinton to Rebuild America\n\nIn opposing the Trump approach, Panos spoke on behalf of transportation officials from Republican strongholds in Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming. He stressed the importance of maintaining robust transportation investments in rural communities that are essential to accommodating coast-to-coast truck transportation of agriculture and energy products, as well as providing public access to Yellowstone National Park, Mount Rushmore and other scenic areas.\n\n\u201cOur states face significant transportation funding challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t provide all these benefits to the nation and ensure a sufficiently connected national system without federal investment. We are geographically large; often include vast tracks of federal and tribal lands; have extensive highway networks; and have low population densities.\u201d\n\nHe insisted that any Trump administration infrastructure initiative must continue to provide federal assistance to the states on a formula basis, which would assure them of a steady flow of government support, at least for surface transportation projects.\n\nStates and the federal government have struggled to meet the essential highway and bridge construction needs for years using an 18.4 cent-per-gallon federal gas tax that has not be raised since 1993. Congress for years has taken a patchwork approach to funding highway and mass transit projects through the federal Highway Trust Fund.\n\nRelated: As Roads Crumble, Infrastructure Spending Hits a 30-Year Low\n\nCongress enacted a $305 billion, five-year highway and mass transit bill in December 2015, financed by the gas tax and $70 billion of offsets from other areas of the federal budget. The legislation, signed by former President Barack Obama, marked the passage of the first long-term national transportation spending package in a decade.\n\nHowever, federal funding for infrastructure projects is woefully behind the need. The American Society of Civil Engineers, for example, says that the U.S. needs to invest $1.4 trillion in infrastructure between now and 2025 and $5.2 trillion by 2040.\n\nTrump and Clinton made new infrastructure construction \u2013 and the jobs it would generate \u2013 a major issue throughout the 2015 campaign. Trump bested Clinton by pledging new spending and doubled the $500 billion she originally proposed.\n\nThe outlines of Trump\u2019s plan began to emerge late in the campaign, in the form of a ten-page white paper drafted by wealthy businessman Wilbur Ross, Trump\u2019s nominee to be the next Commerce Secretary and conservative economics professor Peter Navarro, who has been tapped to head the National Trade Council.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Economic Plan: Spend Like a Democrat, Regulate Like a Republican\n\nThe plan essentially gives investors an 82 percent tax credit to plow money into new state and local government projects \u2013 so-called public-private partnerships -- that would obviate the need for the federal government to raise the gasoline tax, increase overall government spending and add to the deficit.\n\nRoss and Navarro portrayed the tax scheme as a win-win for the country. They argued that as little as $137 billion in new tax credits could be leveraged into $1 trillion of new infrastructure investments over ten years. And whatever tax dollars the Treasury would lose by granting the credits would be recaptured by federal income and business taxes on construction workers and contractors involved in the new projects.\n\nThe fly in the ointment, according to Barrasso and others, is that projects selected for this special tax treatment must be able to generate a revenue stream to help retire the bonded indebtedness. Tax credits may eventually become part of the overall infrastructure mix, depending on what the Republican-controlled Congress does later this year on tax reform. But many Democrats, economists and transportation experts warn that Trump\u2019s approach could end up rewarding investors in projects that likely would have been built even without the credits."}, {"date": "2017/02/09", "title": "Trump Finds a New Use for His Bully Pulpit: Protecting the Family Business", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/09/Trump-Finds-New-Use-His-Bully-Pulpit-Protecting-His-Family-Business", "text": "With each passing day since president Trump\u2019s inauguration, whatever theoretical line may have existed between the new administration and the Trump family has become increasingly blurry.

The company said that the decision was based on the fact that the brand was not selling well.\n\nShe replied, \u201cGo buy Ivanka\u2019s stuff, is what I would say.

The Code of Federal Regulations notes that federal employees, \u201cshall not use or permit the use of his Government position or title or any authority associated with his public office to endorse any product, service or enterprise.\u201d\n\nBut it has become clear that President Trump and his closest advisers no longer seem to care much about the niceties of federal conflict of interest laws.

He won. He's leading this country.

On Wednesday, Trump had continued his attacks on other federal judges currently hearing the case against his ban on refugees and residents of seven majority Muslim countries from entering the United States.\n\nIn a conversation with Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Gorsuch said that he found Trump\u2019s comments \u201cdisheartening\u201d and \u201cdemoralizing.\u201d After Blumenthal made the comments public, a Republican member of the team shepherding Gorsuch through the confirmation process confirmed them to The Washington Post.\n\nThere is little reason to expect similar hesitation from Sessions, at least when it comes to implementing Trump\u2019s priorities with regard to the strict enforcement of immigration law, the toughening of criminal justice system, and the extension of support to state and local law enforcement agencies.\n\nRelated: Trump Plays the Fear Card as He Badgers Judges for Their Vote\n\nTo be clear, this is not because Sessions is a puppet of the new president. It is because he agrees with him.\n\nSessions jumped on the Trump train very early and even saw his top policy adviser, Stephen Miller, shift over to a key role with the Trump campaign. Miller was Sessions\u2019 communications director, but the title underplays the importance of his role in helping Sessions and other conservative members of Congress develop policy positions on immigration and what Miller would call \u201cnation-state populism.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Politico last summer, Miller described the role Sessions and his staff played in immigration debates on Capitol Hill, saying, \u201cWhen I was in Sessions\u2019 office, this movement for nation-state populism, the intellectual framework for that was being formed. ...We saw ourselves as a kind of think tank for immigration issues and linking that to the larger questions of globalism and populism.\u201d\n\nUnlike the majority of Trump\u2019s cabinet picks, who have little or no experience in the federal government, Sessions will arrive at the Justice Department with a wealth of it. He is a former United States Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama and has spent 20 years in the United States Senate. While other nominees, like Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, are coming to grips with the realities of working for the federal government and trying to find the light switches, Sessions will be ready to move on day one.\n\nRelated: Trump May Try to Weed Out Immigrants Who Cost Taxpayers $279 Billion Annually\n\nWhat that means is that the marching orders for US Attorneys across the country will be coming from an Attorney General who largely shares President Trump\u2019s concern that immigrants, particularly undocumented immigrants, are a major threat to the physical safety and economic well-being of American citizens. It is a safe bet that prosecutorial resources will continue to be shifted sharply toward immigration-related enforcement.\n\nIt also means that state and local law enforcement can expect a sharp increase in support from the federal government. That will take the form of both closer cooperation and increased financial aid. The Attorney General has authority over a wide array of grant-making programs that support state and local police.\n\nHe also oversees the federal asset forfeiture program, which allows police to seize the assets of criminals and, in many cases, even of people who have not been convicted of a crime. The federal program allows the seizing agency to retain some or all of the property taken, a program that Trump has promised to support.\n\nIn sum, it seems likely that for the next four years, at least on President Trump\u2019s signature law enforcement issues, there will be little daylight between the White House and the agency implementing them."}, {"date": "2017/02/09", "title": "How Obamacare Repeal Could Change Your Retirement Plans", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/09/How-Obamacare-Repeal-Could-Change-Your-Retirement-Plans", "text": "President Donald Trump said in an interview before the Super Bowl that replacing the Affordable Care Act could take the Republican-controlled Congress and his administration until next year.

(See chart below.)\n\n\"The ACA reduced drug costs for seniors on Part D with relatively high drug bills, which could be due to one really high-priced drug for a condition like hepatitis C or because they take multiple brand-name drugs,\" Neuman said.\n\nRelated: The Potential Cost of Obamacare Repeal: 32 Million Without Insurance\n\nRoughly 9 million of the 38.7 million people, about 25 percent, enrolled in Part D have drug spending high enough to reach the coverage gap, according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission.\n\nIf the law is left unchanged, the Affordable Care Act will close the donut hole by 2020.\n\nA repeal of Obamacare also could increase the cost of preventive services. Under the law, Medicare enrollees receive precautionary care, such as breast cancer screenings, colorectal cancer screenings and flu shots, free of charge to them.\n\nAmong the six Republican plans analyzed by the Kaiser Family Foundation that seek to end Obamacare, two would stop the closing of the donut hole and require Medicare enrollees to share in the cost of preventive services.

While 56 percent of Democrat voters want their party to pursue obstruction, majorities of most other major demographics want Democrats to cooperate with the new president and Republican-controlled Congress, including women, independent voters, all income and almost all age demos, urban voters, and even government employees.\n\nThat is precisely the kind of data that a proper autopsy would cover \u2013 if the party itself admitted its defeat wasn\u2019t a fluke, but the culmination of years of disconnecting from voters across the country. Republicans managed to admit that much to themselves after their defeat in the 2012 presidential election, which allowed them to create a forward-looking plan for eventual victory. Trump\u2019s triumph didn\u2019t exactly fit that prescription, and the party still has a lot of work to do to fulfill the vision of the \u201cGrowth Opportunity Plan.\u201d They learned enough to realize that they had lost touch with voters in the Rust Belt and key swing states, however, and put their resources into that outreach and organization.\n\nAn honest autopsy by Democrats would tell them much the same about their descent into the political wilderness. Rather than connect with voters, Democrats adopted the kind of top-down messaging and reliance on academic models that sunk Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign. Instead of orienting their agenda to the real concerns of voters in much of America, Democrats have instead adopted an increasingly progressive agenda that prioritizes identity politics and uses that philosophy to lecture and condescend to voters.\n\nRelated: Democrats Will Regain Power If They Can Avoid Screwing Up\n\nThey continually woo celebrities to scold voters about latent bigotry (and take bizarre shots at the NFL and Mixed Martial Arts contests) rather than find messengers who can help Democrats craft an agenda that speaks to everyone equally. The map of Congressional districts in the US shows just how far that approach has marginalized them over the past eight years, now that the personal popularity of Barack Obama no longer masks the disconnect.\n\nWhy does this matter? If Democrats can\u2019t accept reality, should we care? Yes, and we are seeing why now. For months, Democrats have remained stuck in the denial phase of the five stages of grief identified by Dr. Elizabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross. That denial generates powerful emotional connections to claims of injustice, a bedrock belief over the last three months that has driven protests, obstructionism, and downright lunacy in regard to all things Trump.\n\nDenial is driving Senate Democrats to quixotic lengths in attempting to block confirmation of Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominations and creating overnight sessions that only highlight their inability to have any impact on the process at all other than temporarily stringing it out. In the meantime, Democrats have held up the process longer than for any other first-term president, delaying the inevitable \u2013 but also delaying the process of transition and creating confusion along the way.\n\nThe denial of Democrats threatens to derail the credibility of self-governance, ironically fulfilling a warning Democrats repeatedly made when they assumed Republicans would end up on the losing end of the election. Only after Democrats admit that the patient is actually dead can an autopsy help. The election is over \u2013 and it\u2019s time for everyone to get back to work."}, {"date": "2017/02/08", "title": "Americans Are Having Doubts About Trump\u2019s Agenda: Poll", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/08/Americans-Are-Having-Doubts-About-Trump-s-Agenda-Poll", "text": "President Trump and his aides frequently invoke the will of the voters in advancing his hard-edged conservative agenda, from dismantling the Affordable Care Act and stripping away onerous government regulations to retreating on climate change and banning immigrants from seven terrorism prone countries.\n\nBut a new Quinnipiac University poll released on Wednesday tells a different story. Just a few tumultuous weeks into the Trump presidency, a majority of Americans sharply disagree with him on many key elements of policy.\n\nRelated: Trump Plays the Fear Card as He Badgers Judges for Their Vote\n\n\u201cA litany of calls to \u2018hold your horses, Mr. President,\u2019\u201d Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said in a statement summing up the findings. \u201cAmericans want President Donald Trump to keep the regulatory reins on business, and voters call for a full stop to laying new pipelines full of oil. They are against taking the knife to Obamacare and opposed to lifting environmental regulations.\u201d\n\nAccording to the poll, a majority of voters surveyed nationwide (49 percent to 39 percent) are opposed to Trump\u2019s promise to gut Dodd-Frank and other regulations governing Wall Street and businesses. And they say the new president should not decimate regulations and agreements designed to combat climate change, by a two to one margin.\n\nIndeed, 72 percent of the voters surveyed said they were \u201cvery concerned\u201d or \u201csomewhat concerned\u201d about the problem of global warming, which Trump once dismissed as a hoax perpetrated by China. Just 17 percent of voters believe the U.S. is doing enough to address the problem, while 59 percent say that \u201cmore needs to be done.\u201d\n\nMoreover, 50 percent of Americans don\u2019t want Trump and his GOP allies to repeal and replace Obamacare, which has provided health insurance coverage to more than 20 million people. Not surprisingly, the issue sharply divides the two parties. Eighty-six percent of Democrats are opposed to repealing President Barack Obama\u2019s signature program, while just 10 percent of Republicans want to see Obamacare survive.\n\nAmericans also generally oppose Trump\u2019s plan to build a wall along the southern border, particularly if U.S. taxpayers get stuck with the bill: 63 percent oppose an American taxpayer-funded wall, compared to 35 percent who support it.\n\nRelated: Defying the Best Legacy of the Free World, Trump Instills Fear Itself\n\nTo be sure, the results aren\u2019t all negative: By a margin of 60 percent to 31 percent, the public supports Trump\u2019s plan to renegotiate NAFTA and other international trade agreements. They overwhelmingly support the president\u2019s idea for investing $1 trillion in roads, bridges and other infrastructure. And they heartily approve of his choice of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to fill a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nBut voters are wary of Trump\u2019s emerging global posture, including his complaints that not all European allies are spending their fair share on defense. Americans maintain, 79 percent to 13 percent, that Trump and U.S. forces should defend all of this country\u2019s NATO allies.\n\nMany Americans appear dismayed by Trump\u2019s insistence that he won the November election over Democrat Hillary Clinton despite widespread voter fraud. By 61 percent to 28 percent, voters say they don\u2019t believe Trump\u2019s assertion that three million to five million non-citizens voted in the 2016 election.\n\nThe poll didn\u2019t question voters about their stand on Trump\u2019s controversial executive order temporarily banning immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries. That order triggered days of chaos and confusions in airports throughout the world and has been put on hold pending ruling by a three-judge panel of the San Francisco based Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. A separate poll by Morning Consult and Politico shows public support for the president \u2013 55 percent to 38 percent, although support appears to be slipping.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Trump May Be Sending More Jobs to Mexico than He Saves\n\nThe Quinnipiac poll was conducted from Feb. 2 to 6 and involved interviews with 1,155 voters nationwide; it has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points."}, {"date": "2017/02/08", "title": "Sanders Charges That Big Pharma \u2018Owns the United States Congress\u2019", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/08/Sanders-Charges-Big-PhRMA-Owns-United-States-Congress", "text": "The White House and key Democrats and Republicans turned up the heat again on Big PhRMA on Tuesday, lashing out at soaring prescription prices and vowing to press for measures to lower Medicare\u2019s staggering drug costs and encourage greater competition among drug manufacturers.\n\nAfter weeks of uncertainty over President Donald Trump\u2019s commitment to lifting a legislative ban on Medicare negotiating lower drug prices with major pharmaceutical companies -- as does Medicaid, the Veterans Administration, and other government health care agencies -- White House spokesman Sean Spicer said yesterday, \u201cHe\u2019s for it, yes.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump Jolts the Pharmaceutical Industry with Vow to \u2018Bring Down Drug Prices\u2019\n\n\u201cThe easier way to look at this is to look at what other countries have done: Negotiating costs to keep those down,\u201d Spicer said during a White House press briefing. He said the mounting costs of health care and prescription drugs are a \u201chuge burden\u201d on seniors in the Medicare program and must be addressed.\n\nTrump has sent mixed signals on whether he would support direct government intervention to lower health care costs, even as he has repeatedly complained about \u201castronomical\u201d and unjustifiable surges in drug prices. Spicer\u2019s comments temporarily drove down biotech stock prices and rekindled industry speculation over whether the new administration would come down hard on drug manufacturers.\n\nYesterday evening, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), one of the most liberal members of Congress, and arch-conservative Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, seemingly joined forces during the town hall meeting to denounce the drug industry\u2019s pricing practices and agreed to support two major initiatives: to lift the prohibition on Medicare bargaining for lower prices and to authorize consumers and drug distributors to acquire cheaper drugs from Canada and other countries.\n\nSanders, who promoted these and other ideas for reining in drug prices during his unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, delivered a scathing critique of the highly profitable drug industry and its top executives. He also took to task Senate and House members who over the years did nothing to address the drug price crisis.\n\nRelated: How Big Pharma Lobbyists Keep Medicare Drug Prices High\n\n\u201cJust as the case with healthcare, we pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on is that the pharmaceutical industry owns the United States Congress. I would admit it\u2019s not just Republicans. They have a huge influence over the Democratic party as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo right now, the reality is that uniquely in the whole world, you can walk in tomorrow to your pharmacy, and the cost that you pay is double or triple [what it is elsewhere], and there is nothing that anybody can do about it,\u201d he said.\n\nPharmaceutical companies have been among the biggest political spenders for years. They've traditionally supported Republican candidates, as they have received 64 percent of industry contributions on average since the 1990 election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a watchdog research organization. Until now, drug lobbyists led by PhRMA have succeeded in blocking measures that threatened to cost them billions of dollars of annual profits.\n\nCruz, who differs sharply with Sanders over GOP efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, said the two are in agreement on measures for increasing price competition and opening the borders to the importation of less expensive drugs. However, he voiced strong support that the Food and Drug Administration speed up the agency\u2019s review of new drug applications \u2013 especially drugs for the treatment of seriously ill adults and children.\n\nRelated: Two Big Reasons Prescription Drug Prices Are So Much Higher in the US\n\n\u201cI would love for us to work together going after big PhRMA, and in particular taking on the FDA,\u201d Cruz told Sanders. \u201cRight now it takes $2 billion to approve a new drug. . . There is story after story after story of life-saving drugs that are available, that are approved, they are used in Europe, they are used in Canada, and the FDA won\u2019t allow it.\u201d\n\nPrescription drug prices have risen at a double-digit rate in recent years and are projected to continue to rise at that clip this year. In some cases, pharmaceutical companies have jacked up their prices by as much as 1,000 percent to 5,000 percent for some life-saving drugs. Medicare, which covers 55 million Americans, spends $1 of every $6 on prescription drugs, or an estimated $95.1 billion in 2016, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nLess than two weeks into his administration, Trump on Jan. 21 summoned the heads of a half-dozen top drug manufacturers to the White House for the first round of talks after complaining that the pharmaceutical industry was \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d by gouging consumers and the government.\n\n\u201cWe have to get the prices way down,\u201d Trump told the CEOs of Merck, Amgen, Eli Lilly, Novartis and Johnson & Johnson, as well as the head of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the top trade group. \"We have to get prices down for a lot of reasons. We have no choice, for Medicare and Medicaid, we have to get prices way down.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Feds Finally Make a Move on Soaring Drug Prices\n\nTrump had offered a number of measures for containing drug prices, including the importation of cheaper drugs and allowing Medicare to begin negotiating drug prices. At the behest of drug manufacturers, Congress included the Medicare non-negotiation ban in the 2003 Medicare Part D drug legislation. That prohibition provided major pharmaceutical companies with billions of dollars in windfall profits.\n\nPhRMA and its long-time allies on Capitol Hill have fought for years to preserve that ban on negotiating drug prices for the national health care program for seniors and opening the borders to cheaper drugs from abroad. They are digging in again to block efforts to repeal the restrictions.\n\n\u201cBroadly, both of these proposals are concerning given the consequences for patients, both Medicare beneficiaries and consumers generally, said Allyson Funk, a spokesperson for PhRMA.\n\nFunk insisted in an email that \u201cIt is a common myth that there is no negotiation in Medicare Part D,\u201d the prescription drug program for seniors. She said that \u201clarge, powerful purchasers\u201d like Express Scripts have negotiated deep discounts and rebates directly with drug manufacturers, bypassing the Department of Health and Human Services and \u201csaving money for both beneficiaries and taxpayers.\n\nShe also said that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has said on multiple occasions that the secretary of health and human services would not be able to negotiate lower prices than exist now \u201cwithout restricting access to medicine for beneficiaries.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump pushes drugmakers for lower prices, more U.S. production\n\nAs for the drive to allow the importation of less expensive drugs from Canada and other countries, Funk said the importation of unapproved and potentially counterfeit medicine, \u201cjeopardizes the secure medicine system in the United States and presents a serious risk to public health.\u201d\n\nPhRMA did not directly respond to Sanders\u2019 claim that the powerful lobbying group with deep pockets has effectively co-opted congressional Republicans and Democrats in the past to block unwanted legislation. But experts on campaign spending and lobbying say there is no question PhRMA wields a big stick.\n\n\u201cThe pharmaceutical industry is indisputably one of the most powerful lobbies in Washington,\u201d said Sheila Krumholz, the executive director of the center. \u201cIt spent tens of millions on campaign donations and hundreds of millions on lobbying last cycle, which helped open doors on Capitol Hill for their army of 1,400 lobbyists. All that money is a pittance compared with the industry profits it helped produce, but means consumers shoulder higher costs than they would otherwise.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/02/08", "title": "The F-35 Is Blowing Away the Competition", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/08/F-35-Blowing-Away-Competition", "text": "Early results came in from the US Air Force's realistic, challenging Red Flag air combat exercise \u2014 and it looks like the F-35 slaughtered the competition.\n\nAviation Week reports that the Joint Strike Fighter killed 15 aggressors for each F-35 downed.

He called the arguments against his executive order \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and continued to suggest that if the courts do not rule in his favor, they should be seen as placing the country in danger.\n\nTrump showed up at the event with about 15 minutes\u2019 worth of prepared remarks, but spoke for more than 25 minutes because the first part of his appearance was dedicated to a free-associative riff on the case.\n\nTrump brought a copy of the section of the U.S. Code that, he believes, gives him the authority claimed in the executive order, and he read part of it out loud.

Ben Sasseof Nebraska and Mike Leeof Utah wrote in a recent letter to the White House.\n\nThe debate is centered on the agency's director, Richard Cordray, who is serving a five-year term that ends in 2018.The CFPB is an independent government agency that is funded through the Federal Reserve. Though Cordray is a presidential appointee, the White House has limited power to remove him. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the law that established the agency, the head of the CFPB can be dismissed only for \"inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.\"\n\nCordray's protected status is now being challenged by PHH, a New Jersey mortgage servicer that the CFPB had fined $109 million. In November, a panel of judges in the D.C. Circuit Court ruled that the agency lacked critical checks on the director's power. But any changes to the CFPB's structure are on hold while the court decides whether a broader set of judges should weigh in.\n\nIndustry experts say the answer could arrive any day. If the court denies the CFPB's request, Trump could dismiss Cordray almost immediately \u2014 and the agency would have little recourse to appeal to the Supreme Court under a Republican administration.\n\n\"I'm just focused on doing my job, which is protecting consumers,\" Cordray told CNBC on Wednesday on his way to Capitol Hill. \"The rest of it is above my pay grade.\"\n\nWhite House already lining up a new boss\n\nEven if the court grants a broader review and the case remains in limbo, opponents of the CFPB have begun building the case for removing Cordray anyway. The White House has already begun meeting with potential replacements, such as former Rep. Randy Neugebauer, R-Texas, who had proposed legislation that would gut the agency.\n\nRelated: Trump's Trillion Dollar Infrastructure Plan Could Be DOA\n\n\"Dodd-Frank was a piece of massive government overreach,\" a senior administration official said. \"Some of the rules may have even been unconstitutional in creating new agencies that don't actually protect consumers. They might have just created more additional work. We're looking to deal with those.\"\n\nCritics point to a laundry list of CFPB actions that they say could warrant removal under existing Dodd-Frank standards: Republicans have excoriated the agency for the cost of renovating its building, for example, and for an alleged lack of diversity among its employees.\n\nThey also argue the agency overstepped its authority in issuing rules intended to address discrimination in auto lending that also affect car dealers \u2014 an industry that was specifically carved out from the CFPB's purview.\n\n\"I think the president has at least a credible claim for removal,\" said Brian Knight, as senior fellow at the libertarian Mercatus Center at George Mason University. \"They've been extremely aggressive, and the courts have been pushing back on them pretty consistently.\"\n\nStill, dismissing Cordray would be virtually unprecedented, even for a White House that prides itself on jettisoning tradition. No one has been fired by a president since the Supreme Court in 1935 set those standards of inefficiency, negligence or malfeasance for removal, according to an analysis by the left-leaning Americans for Financial Reform.\n\n\"The slipshod rationalizations thinly disguising an underlying desire to remove a strong enforcer surely do not justify making him the first official ever to be removed by a president for cause,\" wrote Brian Simmonds Marshall and Veronica Meffe.\n\nRelated: Populist on the Trail, Trump Pivots Toward the Banking Industry\n\nMeanwhile, House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, is about to introduce a new version of his bill to undo Dodd-Frank that is also expected to take aim at the CFPB. In an interview on CNBC on Tuesday, he said he planned to work closely with the White House on that effort.\n\n\"Dodd-Frank broke all its promises,\" he said. \"I certainly hope to do my part on Capitol Hill to return us to a healthy economy and unclog the arteries of lending.\"\n\nTaking on the CFPB could prove politically precarious, however. Trump's campaign was fueled by populist anger against Wall Street \u2014 the same anger that helped lead to the creation of the agency in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The CFPB is the brainchild of Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, an outspoken critic of the banking industry who enjoys a 61 percent approval rating in her home state, according to Morning Consult.\n\n'Consumers deserve to have him serve'\n\nConsumer advocacy groups have also vowed to fight any attempts in the courts or on Capitol Hill to dismantle the agency.\n\n\"Director Richard Cordray has proven to be a tireless and effective leader, and consumers deserve to have him serve out the rest of his term working on their behalf,\" said Debbie Goldstein, executive vice president at the Center for Responsible Lending.\n\nIt remains unclear how quickly and aggressively the White House may move. Oliver Ireland, a partner at the law firm Morrison Foerster, said the Trump administration may wait until after the court weighs in on whether to review the PHH case again. In addition, Trump's nominee to lead the Treasury Department, Steven Mnuchin, has yet to be confirmed, and several other key Cabinet posts remain unfilled.\n\nThose positions could take precedence, Ireland said. But he said it was likely that the president's attention would eventually land on the consumer watchdog.\n\n\"It seems to me there are a lot of moving parts here,\" Ireland said. \"I think it's very hard to handicap that from a distance.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on CNBC.

Should the U.S. General Services Administration be negotiating the terms of a decades-long multi-million dollar building lease with the president\u2019s son?\n\nThe refusal of President Trump to divest his ownership of the Trump Organization and the larger Trump family\u2019s extensive efforts to turn their own personal \u201cbrands\u201d into money-making opportunities continues to create extraordinary conflicts of interest.\n\nOn Wednesday, The New York Times reported that the Defense Department is now actively considering whether or not it should rent office space in Trump Tower in Manhattan. President Trump\u2019s wife Melania and young son Barron still live there, and the president has indicated that he would like to spend some time there as well as in the White House.\n\nWith the Secret Service already occupying space in the building (and the city of New York spending hundreds of thousands of dollars every day to protect it), the U.S. military is now trying to decide if it, too, needs to rent offices from Trump\u2019s personal business.\n\nRelated: Pentagon Hands Trump a $30 Billion Wartime Arms Wish List\n\n\u201cIn order to meet official mission requirements, the Department of Defense is working through appropriate channels and in accordance with all applicable legal requirements in order to acquire a limited amount of leased space in Trump Tower,\u201d a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement to The Times.\n\nThat news comes just a day after lawyers representing Mrs. Trump in a libel lawsuit against the British Daily Mail newspaper outlined what appear to be plans to cash in on her position as first lady in a court filing. The lawsuit alleges that Mrs. Trump has been harmed by a false claim that she once worked as an escort, a claim since retracted by the newspaper.\n\n\u201cPlaintiff had the unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity as an extremely famous and well-known person, as well as a former professional model and brand spokesperson and successful businesswoman, to launch a broad-based commercial brand in multiple product categories, each of which could have garnered multi-million dollar business relationships for a multi-year term during which Plaintiff is one of the most photographed women in the world. These product categories would have included, among other things, apparel, accessories, shoes, jewelry, cosmetics, hair care, skincare, and fragrance.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for Mrs. Trump immediately claimed, despite the plain language of her lawyers\u2019 court filing, that the first lady has no plans to profit from her position, claiming \u201cAny statements to the contrary are being misinterpreted.\u201d Defenders of Mrs. Trump argued that in order to press her case successfully, she needs to demonstrate that the false allegations caused her actual harm, and that the language in the lawsuit is designed to do that.\n\nRelated: Why British Parliament Is Threatening to Slam the Door on Trump\n\nAs all this was going on, President Trump signed over management responsibility for the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington to his oldest son, Donald Trump Jr. The building is owned by the federal government and is currently leased to the Trump Organization in an arrangement with the General Services Administration.\n\nThe lease contains very specific language stating that no person who holds a position of authority in the federal government may also benefit from the hotel\u2019s operating agreement with the government. Last week, ProPublica uncovered a document showing that Trump had placed his ownership stake in the hotel into a trust operated by his son. Crucially, Trump still owns his interest in the hotel and stands to profit from it, but will not actively engage in management.\n\nThis puts the GSA, whose managers literally work for Trump, in the position of negotiating with the president\u2019s eldest son about the future of a lease that directly benefits the president himself.\n\nThe situation is giving government ethics experts fits. Former Obama administration ethics lawyer Norm Eisen publicly insisted that Trump, from the moment he took the oath of office, has been in violation of the emoluments clause of the Constitution. But Trump and his family seem unconcerned.\n\nRelated: 12 Facts We Now Know About President Trump\n\nIndeed, the lack of concern about appearances and conflicts is evident in the White House itself, where Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka is now attending high-level meetings of economic policymakers despite the fact that she has extensive business interests of her own, and has yet to demonstrate that she has, as promised, removed herself from the management of Trump Organization.\n\nAt this point, the enrichment of the Trump family by and in conjunction with multiple agencies of the federal government isn\u2019t something that can be avoided. It is already happening, and there seems to be nothing that will stop it. Certainly, the Republicans running the House and Senate, who have oversight authority over those agencies, have signaled that they have no interest in doing anything about it.\n\nBut it\u2019s still important to keep pointing out that while top political leaders and their families in many countries around world routinely cash in on their positions, this is not acceptable in the United States."}, {"date": "2017/02/08", "title": "Overhauling Dodd-Frank May Not Succeed, but Also May Not Matter", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/02/08/Overhauling-Dodd-Frank-May-Not-Succeed-Also-May-Not-Matter", "text": "Nancy Pelosi says President Trump\u2019s call to reshape Dodd-Frank is a \u201cmassive con\u201d and that he is putting #WallStreetFirst. Sadly, she has set the tone for Congressional Democrats, siding with Elizabeth Warren progressives who hate Wall Street bankers and absolutely loathe Donald Trump.\n\nGiven the toxic political climate, Congress is unlikely to produce a much-needed overhaul of Dodd-Frank. Not only would it be a heavy and politically difficult lift for Republicans, but they also have other priorities, including reforming the collapsing Obamacare healthcare program and our dysfunctional tax system.\n\nRelated: The Republican War on Obama\u2019s Regulations Is About to Begin\n\nBut here\u2019s a hard truth for the Pelosi-Warren camp: it may not require rewriting Dodd-Frank to soften bank regulation. Having pushed through a bill long on pages (now above 20,000) and short on specifics, financial overseers have had considerable discretion in enforcing vague rules.\n\nMany in the banking industry complain that the law\u2019s interpreters have been too tough, driven by a political agenda that has hurt the economy. Depending on his picks to head up key posts, Trump can quickly turn that tide. As former Congressman Barney Frank said last November on CNBC, the \u201cmain thing [Trump] can do to downplay regulation is appoint regulators who won\u2019t regulate.\u201d\n\nThat may already be happening. According to some in the financial industry, bankers have detected in recent weeks a more reasonable tone in dealing with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The relief is welcome, and more is to come.\n\nWhy should we care? Because the financial industry greases the economic skids. Many blame the past several years\u2019 sub-par growth partly on a lack of risk-taking and lending in the banking sector.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Golden Opportunity: Slashing 179,000 Pages of Federal Regulations\n\nWhat do bankers want? They want more control over how they manage their businesses and fewer quixotic compliance mandates. They complain that they are spending too much time and money trying to meet arbitrary and changeable rules set down by regulators instead of growing their businesses. They say, for instance, the determination of what constitutes a \u201csystemically important financial institution\u201d is capricious, much like the $10 billion asset threshold for intensive oversight.\n\nBanks are spending hundreds of millions of dollars each year on \u201cstress-testing\u201d and preparing complex \u201cliving wills\u201d that most consider a useless academic exercise. They say that the regulators\u2019 inconsistent determination of how banks can meet heightened capital requirements has led many to harbor resources instead of making loans which might spur growth.\n\nThe six biggest banks, for example, have accumulated more than $100 billion in excess capital, money beyond that required to meet regulators\u2019 demands; they want the freedom to pay dividends or buy back shares, activities governed by the Fed.\n\nPam Perdue writes in The Hill, \u201c\u2026since January 2013, banks and credit unions alone have dealt with 1,207 new rules spanning 53,486 pages in the Federal Register.\u201d Those figures come from the Banking Compliance Index, which measures the \u201cincremental cost burden on financial institutions.\u201d In the last quarter alone, according to this measure, banks faced new 6,057 pages outlining 115 new rules, requiring 809 hours of compliance per institution, at a cost of more than $53,000 per bank.\n\nRelated: An Economic Agenda for Disruptor Trump\n\nThat might not sound dire, except that a study by the Minneapolis Fed showed that adding just two compliance personnel would make one-third of all small banks unprofitable. Since half of all small business loans come from banks with under $10 billion in assets, the sector is vital to an expanding economy. Between 2010 and 2015 the number of community banks (those with less than $10 billion in assets) shrank by 14 percent; many blame regulatory excess.\n\nIn President Trump\u2019s February 3rd executive order he asked for a review of financial regulation and laid down core principles for banking rules. He did not, for the record, command the \u201cdismantling\u201d of Dodd-Frank, as the liberal media has reported. He kept key tenets of the bill, such as banning the use of taxpayer money to bail out failed banks. His appointees to various agencies will be charged with implementing his guidelines, which stress, for instance, fostering \u201ceconomic growth and vibrant financial markets\u201d and enabling \u201cAmerican companies to be competitive with foreign firms.\u201d\n\nImportantly, Trump has the opportunity to immediately nominate a vice chairman of supervision at the Fed, a post that was created through Dodd-Frank but never filled by President Obama. Former Treasury official and GE executive David Nason is a leading candidate for the position, a choice that bankers would welcome. Nason runs GE\u2019s Energy Financial Services division and would bring a desirable level of real-world experience to the Fed office. Currently, nearly every person in the supervisory office is an economist, many of whom appear to have been hired straight out of graduate school.\n\nRelated: U.S. Banks Gear Up to Fight Dodd-Frank Act's Volcker Rule\n\nTrump can also fill two vacant Fed chairs right away with candidates not hostile to the financial sector. Also, most expect the resignation of Fed Board member Daniel Tarullo who has acted as a banking supervisor and is known for his harsh take on regulation and capital requirements.\n\nJanet Yellen\u2019s term on the Fed runs until 2024, but she is expected to step down when her chairmanship ends early next year. Likewise, Vice Chair Stanley Fisher will likely leave in of July 2018. Consequently, Trump may well be in a position to fill five of seven fed seats over the next year and a half.\n\nBoth the head of the OCC and the FDIC are expected to vacate their posts this year. The remaining key regulator is Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Chief Richard Cordray. His tenure will be determined by the courts which will decide whether the crafting of his position was unconstitutional, as a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has claimed.\n\nIn short, over the next several months Trump can replace many key officials that have overseen the banking sector in recent years and appoint more business-friendly individuals who agree with his call for rolling back excessive regulation.

Last year alone, the program cost $110 billion.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), arguably one of the most ardent proponents of toppling Obamacare, told reporters Tuesday morning that he still intends to pass legislation to supplant Obamacare this year. While Ryan has become highly cautious about contradicting the bellicose president, he said that Trump\u2019s weekend comments have done nothing to alter his ambitious timeline.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be done legislating with respect to health care and Obamacare this year,\u201d Ryan said.

Kellyanne Conway, senior adviser to President Trump, recently told NBC News that the change would shift spending decisions away from Washington to state officials \u201cwho are closest to those in needs\u201d and best equipped to root out fraud and waste.\n\nRelated: 8 Big Changes Under Tom Price\u2019s Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nHealth care policy experts have repeatedly cautioned that the Republicans\u2019 Medicaid overhaul proposals would end up being a much better deal for the federal government than for the states. And a new study by Avalere Health, the health care consulting group, convincingly documents the extent of that disparity.\n\nThe analysis released Monday shows that the federal government would save an estimated $150 billion over the coming five years under a new block-grant approach, or $110 billion under an alternative scheme in which the federal government provides payments on a per capita basis.\n\nWhile state officials would have far more latitude to run the new Medicaid program and set policy with block grants, practically every state and the District of Columbia would suffer funding losses. Those losses would range from as little as 4 percent in Wisconsin to 62 percent in Arizona.\n\nIf Congress opted for a Medicaid per capita model, 24 states would receive an increase in federal funds, while the remaining 26 state and D.C. would suffer losses of up to 30 percent.\n\nRelated: Tom Price\u2019s Big Claim: People Won\u2019t Get Shafted on Health Care\n\nA block grant as conceived by House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and other GOP leaders would essentially cap federal Medicaid funding as a way of achieving major savings in the coming decade.\n\nCurrently, the federal government picks up a fixed percentage of states\u2019 Medicaid costs \u2014 on average 57 percent \u2014 and the states cover the rest. Under a block grant approach, states would receive a fixed amount based on a formula, with the states responsible for picking up any additional costs above the cap.\n\nCapping federal funding is popular among Republicans on Capitol Hill, and the Republicans would let states choose whether they wanted to receive a block grant or a per-capita allotment.\n\nUnder a Medicaid per capita approach, the federal government would set a limit on how much to reimburse states per enrollee, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis. While block grants provide a set amount of federal spending regardless of enrollment, per capita payments to states would reflect changes in enrollment.\n\nA per capita approach would not take into account changes in the costs for each enrollee beyond an established cost growth limit. In order to save money, the federal government would set per capita growth amounts below the projected rates of growth under existing law. That would put a squeeze on the states and force them to find savings, reduce their rolls, or limit their services.\n\nThe Republicans have promoted these ideas as part of their larger effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The proposals face staunch opposition from Democrats, liberal advocacy organization and seniors\u2019 groups including the AARP, which wrote a letter to lawmakers last week opposing both block grants and per capita caps.\n\nRelated: Trump Says His Plan Would Provide \u2018Insurance for Everybody\u2019\n\n\u201cThe Medicaid block grant model is more limiting to states because it constrains both spending growth and enrollment growth,\u201d Caroline Pearson, senior vice president at Avalere, said in a statement accompanying the new study. \u201cThe per capita cap model allows for greater flexibility and better absorbs marketplace fluctuations like financial downturns; however, it can still result in an overall loss of federal funding for state Medicaid programs.\u201d\n\nThe 1965 Medicaid law today covers about 81 million people, including poor children and pregnant women, the disabled and poor older people. Republicans have long complained about runaway spending, fraud and waste, and GOP efforts to convert Medicaid from a federal entitlement covering all eligible people to block grants to the states dates back to the Reagan administration.\n\nUnder either scenario of block grants or per capita limits, states likely would respond by cutting enrollment, limiting benefits or reducing payment rates to providers and plans, according to Pearson.\n\nLast November the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities released an analysis showing that a block grant proposal included in a House GOP budget plan for fiscal 2017 would cut federal Medicaid funding by $1 trillion \u2014 or nearly 25 percent \u2014 over ten years, relative to current law.\n\nRelated: How Block Grants Cap Federal Costs -- and Make States the Bad Guys\n\nBy then, federal funding for Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) would be roughly $169 billion, or about a third less than what it would be under existing law. Another analysis by the Urban Institute of a previous block grant proposal promoted by Ryan in 2012 projected that between 14 million and 21 million people would eventually lose their Medicaid coverage.\n\nAvalere said it used Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) projections from the 2016 Medicaid Actuarial Report and the National Health Expenditure Accounts by state of residence in conducting its research, and the group\u2019s models assumed a Medicaid growth rate tied to inflation.\n\nThe report\u2019s historical simulations start in 2001, with a base year of 2000 for determining initial federal funding levels. The researchers cut off the state level simulations in 2008, to avoid measuring the effects of a major economic stimulus program and the Affordable Care Act, which authorized an expansion of Medicaid. Presumably, the extent of the federal government\u2019s savings and the states\u2019 losses under a block grant approach would be considerably higher if you factored in Medicaid expansion."}, {"date": "2017/02/07", "title": "Here\u2019s Why Trump May Be Sending More Jobs to Mexico than He Saves", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/07/Here-s-Why-Trump-May-Be-Sending-More-Jobs-Mexico-He-Saves", "text": "A central theme running through Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric, both before and after he won the White House, has been the idea that Mexico is stealing American jobs and that the policies of a Trump administration will be just the thing to bring them back.

And the day after Trump won the election, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California declared that she and other Democrats would be willing to work with the new president and GOP leaders on a major package of infrastructure and transportation project.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s $1Trillion Infrastructure Plan Raises a Red Flag for Dems\n\nTrump and the Democrats, for the most part, remain in sync on the need for massive new spending to spruce up the nation\u2019s infrastructure and create tens of thousands of new jobs. But profound differences between the Democrats and Republican congressional leaders on the size and makeup of the package \u2013 and precisely how to pay for it -- threaten to sidetrack the proposal this year.\n\nThe nation\u2019s massive shortfall in critically needed infrastructure spending has been long documented by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), government watchdog groups and the American Society of Civil Engineers, which repeatedly has graded the U.S. a D-plus in keeping maintaining the nation\u2019s infrastructure compared with the country\u2019s overseas trading rivals.\n\nBy one important measure of the inadequacy of federal, state and local policies, annual public investment in infrastructure has declined from 1.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product in 1980 to just 0.6 percent of the overall economy in 2015, as the Brookings Institution\u2019s Hamilton Project notes in a new report. Indeed, the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2013 estimated that $3.6 trillion would be required just to bring U.S. infrastructure into a state of good repair, not counting any expansion to the existing infrastructure.\n\nRelated: Trump Proposes $1 Trillion for Infrastructure Without Raising Taxes\n\nThe Democrats recently sought to match Trump when Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and a half-dozen other senators unveiled their $1 trillion \u201cBlueprint to Rebuild America\u2019s Infrastructure\u201d \u2013 a document aimed at generating more than 15 million jobs by fixing crumbling infrastructure and creating a \u201c21st century network\u201d of transportation systems, water projects, schools, electric grids and other projects.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump and his economic advisers outlined a proposal to offer $137 billion in tax breaks and incentives to private investors with deep pockets willing to invest in toll roads and bridges and other projects that would leverage revenue streams to help retire $1 trillion in debt on these projects. Trump\u2019s transition team also explored whether to establish a national infrastructure bank for other development \u2013 an approach long favored by Democrats but opposed by GOP leaders.\n\nSome Democratic critics denounced Trump\u2019s approach as another tax giveaway for the rich that would have a relatively little positive impact on the economy. Ron Klain, a former Obama administration official, warned that the plan would subsidize investors, not infrastructure projects. By contrast, Schumer and the other Democrats proposed to finance their projects through direct government spending \u2013 either by raising revenues such as higher corporate taxes or simply adding to the deficit to help stimulate the economy.\n\nSchumer has challenged Trump \u201cto negotiate with us\u201d to come up with a way of dealing with the funding \u201cthat we can all agree on,\u201d Schumer said.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why It Will Be So Hard for Trump or Clinton to Rebuild America\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re insisting it has to be direct spending,\u201d a Senate Democratic aide explained on Monday. \u201cReal spending and not tax credits that go to the private industry. It has to be real direct spending that\u2019s going into these projects.\u201d\n\nBut this approach to stimulus spending immediately became a stumbling block for the GOP \u2013 not as much for Trump as for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) who are insisting that new infrastructure spending must be paid for.\n\nMcConnell, in particular, is opposed to any fiscal or budgetary program that even hints of the Obama administration\u2019s highly controversial 2009 stimulus package that cost the government an estimated $862 billion. Obama promised that the large package of construction projects would boost the economy and create thousands of permanent jobs, but the initiative fell well short of its goals.\n\nMcConnell said late last year, \u201cIt will be interesting to see how this is put together,\u201d and he added, \u201cI hope we avoid a trillion-dollar stimulus.\u201d\n\nAnother difference between the Democrats\u2019 and Trump\u2019s approach is that the Democrats favor spending the lion\u2019s share of funds on upgrading or repairing existing roads, bridges and other infrastructure, with lesser amounts paying for shiny new projects that Trump is most interested in.\n\nTo that end, the Senate Democratic plan would spend $210 billion of the total \u201cto repair crumbling roads and bridges,\u201d $180 billion to replace and expand existing rail and bus lines, $110 billion to modernize water and sewer systems and $65 billion to modernize American ports and airports.\n\nThe Hamilton Project\u2019s new \u201cGuide to the Economics of Infrastructure Investment,\u201d released today, \u201cWhat is less clear is whether \u2026 the return from an additional dollar of spending on new infrastructure is still larger than the cost. \u2026Repair and maintenance often have higher returns than new construction. About one-third of the nation\u2019s major urban roads were rated in substandard or poor condition in 2016, generating large costs for motorists.\u201d\n\nThe report endorses a \u201cFix it First\u201d approach in which more money is allocated for upgrading and repairing existing infrastructure rather than undertaking brand new ventures. \u201cConducting early and regular maintenance yields large cost savings relative to fixing or replacing roads only after they have become badly damaged,\u201d the report states.\n\nWhether Trump and the Democrats can finally reach an accommodation \u2013 and then bring the GOP leaders on board \u2013 remains to be seen. But some Democrats are highly skeptical.\n\n\"If the president wants to do a trillion-dollar infrastructure package like ours, I\u2019m sure we can find common ground,\u201d Sen.

In short, the Muslim ban is working to achieve Trump\u2019s goals, order or no order.\n\nRelated: 12 Facts We Now Know About President Trump\n\nWhen immigrants flee violence or seek better economic opportunity, they must choose where to find refuge. America has historically been a key destination, with not only positive consequences for individuals, but for our economy. Fresh influxes of working-age adults usually expand wages and employment, contrary to claims that immigrants take Americans\u2019 jobs. More workers and consumers create new opportunities for business expansion and output, as we\u2019ve seen in America for centuries.\n\nCreating a hospitable environment for immigrant families is central to making this all work. That\u2019s what the Trump order overturned, even if it accomplishes nothing else. Rolling up the welcome mat could be enough for foreigners to effectively ban themselves from America.\n\nThis Los Angeles Times profile of a naturalization ceremony focuses on Muslim immigrants beginning to wonder whether they want to become U.S. citizens after all. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel as welcoming right now,\u201d one said. For those who go through the already arduous process to become naturalized citizens, turning back because of one executive order is impractical. But for the student who wants to matriculate at a U.S. research university, or the tourist who wants to see the Grand Canyon, or the young Mexican seeking a better life for their family or the refugee who needs to find sanctuary to relieve their hazardous plight, the decision to avoid America is easier. That was the entire point.\n\nRelated: Why British Parliament Is Threatening to Slam the Door on Trump\n\nSteve Bannon, the white nationalist who masterminded the executive order, appears to simply want fewer non-white people to come into this country. Whether he hits that goal by prohibiting entry or simply by making America more undesirable for people of color is immaterial. Setting the tone can do the work that the Constitution might disallow.\n\nThis won\u2019t necessarily change minds overnight. America still has plenty to offer the foreign traveler. But throughout the next four years, I would gather that visits to the United States from predominantly Muslim countries, and perhaps all countries, will drop, regardless of the fate of the executive order. Eventually, people get the message that they\u2019re not wanted.\n\nSo what does that mean for the country? Let\u2019s start with research, where one out of every six scientists working in the U.S. is an immigrant. Will they continue to flow in, or choose other developed countries in Europe or Asia to ply their trade? And what does that mean for basic research in America? None of the answers to those questions are good for innovative enterprises or the future of scientific breakthroughs, which rely on close collaboration and networking.\n\nRelated: Will Trump Restore 4% Growth or Crash the Economy?\n\nThe impact on research science closely mirrors the fallout for higher education. Practically every academic site in America has spoken out against the travel ban, because they know it will reduce the level of talent on their campuses. Students with scholarships to American universities are now considering Canadian alternatives, and applications to top schools to the north like McGill and Brock University have surged.\n\nIn an interview during the presidential campaign, Bannon steered Trump away from believing that foreign students who benefit from our educational resources should be allowed to stay here to work or start businesses. The best way to prevent that is to stop the pipeline at the source. And that simply denies the country productive capacity from individuals who want to work here.\n\nThere\u2019s some early evidence that the travel ban has already had an impact on the tourism industry, which supports over 1 million domestic jobs. Various international booking agents are showing fewer searches for U.S. flights. The red tape that international airlines experienced with the rocky rollout of the ban could make them less likely to add or maintain their flight schedule.\n\nRelated: Is Trump\u2019s Travel Ban Already Hurting US Tourism?\n\nIn other words, the travel ban \u2014 and more importantly, the belligerent posture toward immigrants from official sources at the height of the government \u2014 is a self-inflicted wound. Those in power just wanted to make it hard, humiliating and treacherous to enter the United States as a foreign national. They\u2019ve done it \u2014 to the harm of not just our image abroad, but to tangible segments of our economy and society.\n\nThe flip side of this is that, as much as the tone of unfriendliness locks people out, it also locks people in. Dual citizens who travel back and forth to their home countries probably won\u2019t go as much. Severing those ties keeps them stateside, where millions of immigrants from abroad, both legal and undocumented, already live and work and play. In America, a retreat into white supremacy is impossible at this juncture. As of 2010, four states, including my home in California, are majority-minority. The country is headed in that direction by 2044, according to a recent Brookings Institution report. There are more Latinos in the Golden State than Caucasians.\n\nEven if walls were erected and foreigners kept away, America is browning in ways that are inescapable. Ultimately, that will crumble the effort to use anger as a weapon to stall an inevitable future. To the immigrant, America shows an unwelcoming face in the Trump era.

Prescription drugs for the treatment of diabetes and inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis ranked as the costliest therapy class. Indeed, one out of every five dollars spent on pharmaceuticals was for those medicines, according to the report, followed closely by spending on medications for the treatment of cancer.\n\nThe drug industry has argued for years that the high costs of developing and testing the new class of drugs called biologics, which targets the disease by targeting the gene that causes the problem, are a big part of the problem. Abbvie\u2019s (ABBV) Humira is a perfect example. A report in Forbes shows that even if it cost what the industry claims is $2.5 billion to develop a biologic drug, Humira earned it back and then some long ago. The drug generated $14 billion in sales in 2015 alone. Forbes says a biologic can cost $50,000 or more a year per patient, which is a killer for consumers, insurers and taxpayers.\n\nSoaring drug prices surfaced as a major issue during last year\u2019s presidential and congressional campaigns and is already getting attention from the new administration and Congress. Last week, President Donald Trump summoned the heads of many top drug manufacturers to the White House in a first step towards fulfilling his campaign pledge to crack down on soaring drug prices that have dramatically driven up the costs of Medicare, Medicaid, and employee health programs.\n\nTrump also pledged to speed up Food and Drug Administration approval of generic drugs to boost competition with more expensive brand names as part of an effort to reduce what he termed \u201castronomical\u201d drug prices. He also favors accelerated FDA approval of cutting-edge drugs for treating cancer and other life-threatening diseases. \u201cWe have to do better at accelerating cures,\u201d he declared.\n\nRelated: Trump Jolts the Pharmaceutical Industry with Vow to \u2018Bring Down Drug Prices\u2019\n\nPrescription drug prices have risen at a double-digit rate in recent years and are projected to continue to rise at that pace this year. Over the past two years, the country has been buffeted by high-profile cases of price gouging by drug companies by as much as 1,000 percent to 5,000 percent for some life-saving drugs that have been on the market for years.\n\nHowever, the Express Scripts findings on rising brand drug prices tells only part of the story. That\u2019s because the drug industry offers substantial rebates and discounts to preferred buyers and consumers that often substantially reduce the base price, according to industry experts. For instance, Express Scripts, one of the three largest pharmacy benefit managers in the country, is responsible for negotiating rebates based on the list prices of prescription drugs.\n\nThe company boasted today that spending on prescription drugs by its clients was up by just 3.8 percent in 2016, far below the nearly 11 percent national average. Moreover, prices for the most commonly used generic medications declined by 8.7 percent in 2016, according to the Express Scripts analysis.\n\nTrump and some of his Republican allies on Capitol Hill believe that steps to encourage and speed up the development of generic drugs may be the key to revving up competition \u2013 and bringing down prices. The House Energy and Commerce Committee is scheduled to begin consideration this week of a bill that would require the FDA to review applications for generic versions of drugs for which there is little if any competition within 180 days, according to Modern Healthcare.\n\nRelated: How Big Pharma Lobbyists Keep Medicare Drug Prices High\n\nThe measure, sponsored by Chairman Greg Walden (R-OR), would also offer pharmaceutical companies that submit such applications a voucher that promises a quicker review of another generic product. \u201cWe all remember recent situations where bad actors jacked up the price of older, off-patent drugs because there was no competition,\u201d Walden said in a statement. \u201cWe want to make sure that doesn't happen again.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut the bill's proposed six-month review period is only slightly shorter than the eight-month review and action target established by FDA officials last year, according to Modern Healthcare. And it is longer than the four-month goal proposed for certain priority drug applications.\n\nWhile the bill is in line with some of Trump\u2019s stated aspirations for reining in drug costs, it is on the face of it a relatively weak start to addressing a massive problem that is costing consumers and government agencies billions of dollars annually. There will likely be efforts to beef up the legislation with other tougher provisions. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Elijah E.

We have no choice, for Medicare and Medicaid, we have to get prices way down.\u201d\n\nAt the top of his meeting with pharmaceutical company CEOs, Trump outlined a number of steps for preventing future surges in drug prices, although he didn\u2019t mention two of the more controversial ideas that he and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton advanced during the campaign: One would allow the importation of cheaper drugs from Canada to enhance competition. And the other would permit Medicare officials to negotiate down prices with major drug companies by eliminating a non-negotiation ban contained in the 2003 Medicare Part D drug legislation.\n\nThe drug companies have strongly lobbied against both of those proposals in the past, warning against intrusive government action that would discourage research and development and prevent job-creating expansion. Trump had nothing more to say about his drug importation and Medicare price negotiation proposals following his meeting with the drug company CEOs.\n\nInstead, he issued a statement supportive of the drug industry and vowing to \u201coppose anything that makes it harder for smaller, younger companies to take the risk of bringing their product to a vibrantly competitive market,\u201d as The Washington Post reported."}, {"date": "2017/02/06", "title": "Why British Parliament Is Threatening to Slam the Door on Trump", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/06/Why-British-Parliament-Threatening-Slam-Door-Trump", "text": "Two weeks into his brief presidency, most of the headlines about Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy efforts have been negative. They\u2019ve addressed angry phone calls with allies and other world leaders, and a further poisoning of Washington\u2019s relationship with Mexico over Trump\u2019s border wall.\n\nUntil now, most of the damage appears to have emanated from Trump himself. That changed on Monday, when a senior British lawmaker revealed that the so-called \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the United States and the United Kingdom apparently doesn\u2019t extend to welcoming President Trump to speak before the Houses of Parliament.\n\nRelated: Defying the Legacy of the Free World, Trump Instills Fear Itself\n\nJohn Bercow, who has served as Speaker of the House of Commons since 2009, said on Monday that he would block any effort to give trump the opportunity to address the Commons and the House of Lords during a widely-expected state visit later this year, a promise he has the authority to follow-through on.\n\nThe talk of a Trump visit to the UK intensified last week after British Prime Minister Theresa May came to the White House and extended an invitation to the new president to meet Queen Elizabeth. The offer incensed many in the British public. A petition demanding that the invitation be rescinded was submitted to Parliament, and with 1.8 million signatures to date, easily satisfied a trigger requiring lawmakers to debate the proposition.\n\n\u201cWe value our relationship with the United States,\u201d Bercow said in the Commons on Monday, according to the BBC. He also pointed out that it is not really within his power to thwart the Queen if she wishes to extend an invitation, saying, \u201cIf a state visit takes place, that is way beyond and above the pay grade of the Speaker.\u201d\n\nHowever, Bercow said that Trump\u2019s accumulated attacks on migrants and refugees, his history of sexist behavior and his disdain for the role of the judiciary in a democratic society show that the U.S. president has not \u201cearned\u201d the right to address Parliament. He said those feelings only intensified after Trump announced an executive order banning refugees from entering the country.\n\nRelated: Is Trump\u2019s Travel Ban Already Hurting US Tourism?\n\n\u201cBefore the imposition of the migrant ban, I would myself have been strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster Hall,\u201d Bercow said. \u201cAfter the imposition of the migrant ban I am even more strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster Hall.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAs far as this place is concerned, I feel very strongly that our opposition to racism and sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary are hugely important considerations in the House of Commons.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump and Prime Minister May made a public display of graciousness and restated their two countries\u2019 promises of mutual support, Bercow\u2019s statement pulls back the curtain on what may have become a much more complicated relationship between the two countries.\n\nAs part of the \u201cfive eyes\u201d intelligence-sharing network, the U.S. and UK, together with Australia, New Zealand and Canada, work closely together to monitor terrorism and other threats.

Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania said last month. \u201cThis will have a devastating impact for many Pennsylvanians.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) offered states the ability for the first time to provide Medicaid coverage to adults without children, with the federal government paying most of the bill. That change, and the law\u2019s mandate that all insurers cover addiction treatment at the same level as medical and surgical procedures, has allowed states to ensure that low-income people can get the care they need, said Linda Rosenberg, CEO of the National Council for Behavioral Health, which represents nonprofit addiction treatment organizations.\n\nSince 2014, an estimated 1.6 million uninsured people with addictions have gained Medicaid coverage in the 31 states plus the District of Columbia that opted to expand the federal-state health care program under the ACA. Not all of the newly insured have sought help for their addictions, but treatment providers are reporting a surge in new patients since the law took effect.\n\nIn addition, the ACA has provided financial incentives for states to test new models for treatment that streamline care and improve outcomes.\n\nAlthough a plan for replacing the federal health law has yet to be announced, House Republicans and Trump have proposed shifting Medicaid to a block grant, in which a capped amount of money would be allocated to each state to provide low-income health care services. By putting more of the cost burden on states, the shift is projected to save the federal government $1 trillion over 10 years.\n\nRelated: Why Republicans Are Hitting the Brakes on Obamacare Repeal\n\nBut most states would be unable to come up with the extra money and would have to scale back efforts to get more people into treatment, said Lisa Clemans-Cope, a researcher with the Urban Institute, which analyzes health care policy.\n\nBecause addiction is a chronic, lifelong disease, a cut in Medicaid funding would stymie states\u2019 efforts to reduce the number of people who are addicted to heroin and other opioids and at risk for drug overdoses. Not only would low-income adults already in treatment be in jeopardy of losing coverage for their continuing care, but budget-strapped states likely would be unable to help others get out of homeless shelters and jails and into treatment.\n\nEscalating Epidemic\n\nMore than 33,000 people died from opioid overdoses in 2015, a nearly 16 percent increase over 2014. Since 1999, the number of fatal overdoses of prescription drugs such as OxyContin, Vicodin and Percocet, as well as heroin and other illicit drugs, has more than quadrupled.\n\nAnd the crisis is still raging. Every day 91 people die from an opioid overdose, 3,900 begin abusing prescription painkillers, and 580 people start using heroin.\n\nThe ACA and the expansion of Medicaid was a game changer for addiction treatment, Rosenberg said, because it enabled states to reach thousands of new addicts and provide better treatment for them.\n\nTaking it away would be a major setback that could cause the opioid epidemic to worsen, Rosenberg said. \u201cWe already have a shortage of trained addiction professionals. Who will want to enter the field if funding is cut?\u201d\n\nUnder the ACA, states could expand their Medicaid programs to adults with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line ($16,394 for an individual). The federal government paid all of the costs to cover newly eligible adults in the first two years. Starting this year, the federal share dips to 95 percent of the roughly $53 billion annual price tag for the states that have expanded. If left unchanged, the federal share would decline to 90 percent in 2020.\n\nIn 19 states, Republican governors and legislatures have chosen not to expand Medicaid. And many Republican-led states that have expanded Medicaid have customized their programs to reflect conservative values by adding small monthly premiums and copayments to encourage personal responsibility for health care.\n\nRelated: Repealing Obamacare Taxes Gives the Super Wealthy $7 Million More a Year\n\nIn states that have not expanded Medicaid, support for addiction treatment is limited to state and local funds, and federal block grants from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\n\nBetter Treatment\n\nNational data on the number of people who have received addiction treatment under the Medicaid expansion are not available. But treatment providers in some states that expanded Medicaid report a substantial surge in patients, with most receiving a combination of medications and counseling, an approach that has proven at least twice as effective as treatment that does not include medications.\n\nIn Arizona, for example, where Medicaid was expanded in 2014 by then-Republican Gov. Jan Brewer, Kurt Sheppard, CEO of Valle del Sol community health centers, said he\u2019s seen a 35 percent increase in the number of patients receiving medication-assisted treatment and counseling for opioid addictions.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved three opioid addiction medications \u2014 methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone. Most state Medicaid programs pay for all three medications, according to the American Society of Addiction Medicine, and rarely pay for extended residential treatment. In contrast, commercial providers may not be required by the ACA to pay for all three available addiction medications and often limit access to the drugs. They also are the largest payer of costly residential services.\n\nBy providing more effective therapies, Medicaid \u2014 the single largest payer of addiction treatment, footing the bill for more than 20 percent of all costs \u2014 has been responsible for improving the overall cost-effectiveness of treatment, Rosenberg said.\n\nThe ACA also has rewarded states for developing innovative models for treatment that have resulted in even more effective and cost-efficient outcomes, the Urban Institute\u2019s Clemans-Cope said.\n\nMaryland, Rhode Island and Vermont, for example, have taken advantage of federal money to create what are known as health homes for people with drug addiction, in which their treatment is combined with medical care for related diseases such as hepatitis C, as well as mental health and social services.\n\nOverall, the proportion of hospitalizations for substance abuse and mental illness that were uninsured fell from 20 to 6 percent between 2013 and the end of 2014 in states that expanded Medicaid.\n\nMore Treatment\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich, one of 11 Republican governors who decided to expand Medicaid, recently justified his decision in part as a means to help a spiraling number of Ohio residents with drug addictions.\n\nRelated: How Obamacare Repeal Could Hurt Retirees on Medicare\n\n\u201cThank God we expanded Medicaid because that Medicaid money is helping to rehab people,\u201d Kasich said earlier this month as he signed a bill expanding access to the overdose rescue drug naloxone.\n\nOhio added 700,000 new Medicaid recipients under its expanded program. Roughly a third were diagnosed with a substance abuse disorder, according to a recent analysis by the Ohio Department of Medicaid.\n\nIn West Virginia, which has the highest opioid overdose death rate in the nation, Medicaid expansion added 173,000 adults to the Medicaid program, bringing total enrollment to 573,000 people, about a third of the state\u2019s population.\n\nIn 2015, the first year of West Virginia\u2019s expansion, the number of people in treatment for substance abuse shot from 16,000 to 27,000, according to Mark Drennan, director of the West Virginia Behavioral Healthcare Providers Association. He said the biggest beneficiaries were adult men who previously had no coverage.\n\nNationwide, states have used expanded Medicaid eligibility to cover previously incarcerated men, allowing them to seek treatment for the addictions that landed them in prison, Rosenberg said. In many places, the coverage has been credited with reducing recidivism rates for people incarcerated for drug-related crimes, she said.\n\nBipartisan Support\n\nBecause the opioid epidemic has spread to every corner of the country, most federal and state politicians know someone who has struggled with addiction or have a family member who has experienced a loss to drug overdose. That helps explain the unusual bipartisan support for treatment funding and other efforts to combat the opioid epidemic, experts say.\n\nLast year, Congress passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 and the 21st Century Cures Act, which provide limited federal funding for prevention and treatment of opioid addiction.\n\nIn addition, states have been enacting laws to restrict the prescribing of opioid painkillers, make treatment more available, and increase the use of the overdose rescue drug naloxone.\n\nRepealing Medicaid expansion has been suggested by some Republicans as partial replacement for the ACA. They also have suggested shifting federal payment for all of Medicaid to block grants to the states. Both proposals aim to substantially reduce the federal government\u2019s cost.\n\nBut treatment advocates argue that skimping on federal dollars to fight the opioid epidemic could cost the country more. According to a 2016 report on drugs, alcohol and health by the U.S. Surgeon General, every dollar spent on addiction treatment saves $4 in health care costs and $7 in criminal justice costs.\n\nAnd advocates for keeping the ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion argue it would not only save lives but ultimately reduce overall health care costs, a clear priority of the Trump administration.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Stateline.

After his performance this weekend he might want to consider moving it back. At a minimum, he should have the courtesy to turn the British Bulldog\u2019s face to the wall.\n\nThe new president has shattered so many norms and traditions that it is difficult to keep track of them, but one of the most egregious -- more damaging than a refusal to divest his assets or his insistence on bringing family members into the White House -- is his constant effort to sow fear among the American people.\n\nRelated: Pence Does Damage Control After Trump\u2019s Embarrassing Judicial Setbacks\n\nTrump stoked worry about immigrants and terrorism throughout his campaign but over the weekend his campaign to convince the American people that they really ought to feel terrorized reached new depths, and demonstrated just how distant his style of leadership is from the kind the country has historically respected.\n\nThe veneration of Churchill by American presidents has its roots in the former PM\u2019s leadership of a traumatized nation during the worst years of the Second World War. At the darkest moment of the battle, when British and allied troops were reeling from the disaster at Dunkirk, he spoke to the nation and urged fortitude and resolve. \u201cWe shall not flag or fail,\u201d he promised. The British people would fight the Nazi menace on the beaches and in the streets. \u201cWe will never surrender,\u201d he vowed.\n\nWeeks later he urged members of Parliament to prepare for a great struggle. \u201cLet us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves, that if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, \u2018This was their finest hour.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe pantheon of American presidents has its own examples of leaders who urged the people toward courage in grim times. In Lincoln\u2019s second inaugural, he pressed a war-weary nation to soldier on to the end of a long and terrible Civil War.\n\nRelated: Judge Grants Nationwide Temporary Restraining Order on Trump Travel Ban\n\nFondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said \u201cthe judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.\u201d\n\nIn the depths of the Great Depression, Franklin D. Roosevelt famously rallied a nation battered by economic devastation and uncertainty.\n\nThis great Nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself\u2014nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. In every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory.\n\nChurchill, Lincoln, and Roosevelt were all addressing nations faced with literal existential threats. They responded with calls for unity, strength of purpose, and resolve.\n\nCompare that to what President Trump offered the United States over the weekend. His effort to enact a ban of refugees entering the country and to bar the residents of seven majority Muslim nations from entering the United States had been overturned by a federal judge, and an appeal to have it reinstated was rejected.\n\nRelated: Is Trump\u2019s Travel Ban Already Hurting US Tourism?\n\nAs a result, the country had returned to the system of immigration control that has served it reasonably well for a long time. Refugees still face a years-long vetting process. Travelers from nations with a history of terrorism are still subject to extra scrutiny when they apply for visas.\n\nBut the reaction from the president bordered on pants-wetting hysteria. Blocking his new rules, he warned on Twitter, would lead to \u201cdeath and destruction.\u201d He said, \u201cBecause the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision.\u201d\n\nThe tirade of fearful tweets continued all weekend: \u201cThe judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy!\u201d\n\n\u201cJust cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump May Be the First Test Case for His Own Supreme Court Nominee\n\nOf course, Trump\u2019s claims were false. People are not \u201cpouring in,\u201d as a result of the ruling that struck down his travel ban. The country\u2019s immigration system has simply returned to its status quo ante. But at this point, falsehood emanating from the Oval Office has become as predictable as the tides.\n\nWhat\u2019s more troubling at this point is the president\u2019s evident desire to make Americans feel frightened and unsafe. This is not what good leaders do. Good leaders -- the ones who have their busts displayed in places of honor by their allies -- rally people to overcome fear in the knowledge that \u201cunjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, there are leaders whose specialty has been trafficking in fear. History offers many examples of men who have risen to power by convincing the population that they are facing an imminent threat from some shadowy enemy. They have historically held onto power by convincing the people that they and they alone are capable of offering them safety and protection, even when the costs are civil liberty at home and respect abroad.\n\nBut those leaders aren\u2019t typically memorialized with honorary busts. They\u2019ve tended more toward erecting statues of themselves -- statues that are eventually, inevitably, torn down by an ashamed nation."}, {"date": "2017/02/06", "title": "Party on K Street?

Trump's litany of executive orders could bring the fat times back for the army of former government officials, lawyers, and operatives who represent corporate America, Wall Street, Big Pharma, agriculture interests and any other group with an agenda.\n\nRelated: How Big Pharma Lobbyists Keep Medicare Drug Prices High\n\nBruce Mehlman, a Republican lobbyist at Mehlman Castagnetti Rosen & Thomas, told The Hill that \u201ccompanies and associations are gearing up for significant reform opportunities occasioned by an energetic new administration taking office with a supportive Congress.\u201d\n\nThere was a significant drop last year in the amount of money spent on lobbying -- $3.1 billion, the smallest number since 2007 -- and the number of registered lobbyists decreased 3.2 percent from 2015, according to the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP).\n\nThe Hill reported that 9 out of 11 lobbying firms that had revenue of more than $15 million in 2016 saw an election-year decrease over 2015. Even Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, a K Street powerhouse, earned $36 million last year, compared with $39 million in 2015.\n\nBut the Trump Administration is expected to usher in more prosperous days. One reason is that the rules of engagement have changed.\n\nRelated: Trump Puts Five-Year Lobbying Ban on his Political Appointees\n\nAmong the chief differences between the Obama and Trump rules is that while officials the new President appoints cannot lobby the agency for which they worked for five years after leaving office, they can lobby other agencies. And lobbyists can join the Administration if they avoid working on policies they previously sought to influence.\n\nIn a statement after Trump laid out his lobbying rules last week, the bipartisan Center for Responsibility and Ethics (CREW) in Washington said that despite some positive features, his Executive Order was a step backward from reforms Obama had put in place.\n\nThe statement issued by CREW Chair Norman Eisen, an ethics adviser to Obama, and Vice-Chair Richard Painter, an ethics adviser to George W. Bush, said in part: \u201c[The Trump EO] removes the ban on lobbyists going to work in the agencies that they lobbied. \u2026It\u2019s as if their former employers have embedded agents of influence in the government.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s order allows lobbyists to work in his Administration as long as they are not involved in issues about which they lobbied in the two previous years. The Obama rules flatly barred anyone from joining his Administration if they had been registered lobbyists during the preceding year.\n\nObama administration officials were also restricted from contacting their former agencies for two years after leaving office. Under Trump\u2019s EO, that is down to one year except for Cabinet-level officials.\n\nIn an interview with Politico, Eisen said: \"The single biggest insulation that we had, in retrospect, against scandal in the Obama administration was the two-year exit ban. People will pay you to put you on ice for one year and then after that year is up to ply your contacts. But no one wants to pay you to put you in cold storage for two years.\"\n\nThe CREW statement also said that Trump \u201cremoves Obama\u2019s additional revolving door restrictions on non-lobbyists when they leave the government. This is another important problem in the tilted special interest playing field: shadow lobbying by those who are not registered and attempt to influence the system. Instead of continuing the Obama restrictions, or even making them tougher, Trump has eliminated them.\u201d\n\nIn the last three months of 2016, \u201cthe number of registered lobbyists dipped to 9,050 \u2014 the smallest number since 2008, when quarterly filing began,\u201d according to Ashley Balcerzak, writing for the CRP\u2019s OpenSecretsblog.\n\nRelated: Loopholes in U.S. Lobbying Laws Undercut Reforms, Two Watchdog Groups Argue\n\nBut both Balcerzak and Politico suggest that there has been a rise in shadow lobbying \u2013 exerting influence while skirting the Lobbyists Disclosure Act. Trump promised to close loopholes in the act, but that would require legislation. However, his EO did broaden the definition of lobbying to includes \u201cpreparing and strategizing for contacts that other people make, so it goes further than only restricting registered lobbyists,\u201d Politico said.\n\nOne factor that could loom large as industries and various other groups with an agenda consider how much money to devote to lobbying is the uncertainty about what lies ahead in a Trump Administration. As Thomas Susman, director of governmental affairs at the American Bar Association, told OpenSecrets, \u201cThat [uncertainty] leads to interests wanting to get their perspective out there.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/02/06", "title": "Will Trump Restore 4% Growth or Crash the Economy?", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/02/06/Will-Trump-Restore-4-Growth-or-Crash-Economy", "text": "The Trump administration predicts that its policies will return America to 4 percent annual economic growth, last seen in the 1980s and 1990s. As the new president correctly points out, growth during the Obama years was dismal. Instead of surging out of downturns, as we did in the past, our economy basically flatlined in the aftermath of the Great Recession.\n\nThe contrast with previous decades is stark: After a deep recession in the early 1980s, we experienced 7.3 percent growth in 1984 followed by yearly increases of between 3.5 percent and 4.2 percent for the rest of the decade. By contrast, annual growth in the aftermath of the Great Recession has ranged from 1.6 percent to 2.5 percent. The last year in which we experienced 4 percent growth was 2000.\n\nTrump and Republican policy analysts attribute the economy\u2019s poor performance to excessive taxation, overregulation and inadequate infrastructure investment. Undoubtedly, these factors all restrain growth, but their impacts are hard to quantify. Even if Trump is right about what ails the economy, his pronouncements and actions thus far could produce a near-term surge in GDP growth \u2014 but it may not be sustainable. Instead, we could see a bubble, followed by a financial crash and a new recession.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s the Big Threat to Americans That Trump Is Ignoring\n\nLow growth can also be blamed on trends that Trump can\u2019t or won\u2019t address. Since 2012, U.S. exports have remained stagnant largely due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. This contrasts to the situation in the mid to late 1980s, when exports surged on the back of a plunging greenback. The dollar\u2019s current strength may be reinforced in the coming months as the Federal Reserve \u2014 politically independent from the administration \u2014 raises interest rates. Worse, Trump\u2019s hardball tactics with U.S. trading partners could result in higher foreign tariffs, further hindering the ability of U.S. companies to sell their goods and services abroad.\n\nDemographic Challenges\n\nFrom a macro standpoint, GDP growth depends on changes in the size of the potentially employable population, labor force participation, unemployment and productivity. In the 1980s, the first of these factors provided the economy with a significant tailwind.\n\nEach month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates the size of the \u201cCivilian Non-Institutional Population\u201d \u2014 basically everyone over the age of 16 who is not in the military, prison or a long-term care facility, i.e., anyone who could possibly be in the civilian labor force. This population has been growing at about the same rate as it did in the 1980s, but the story changes when you take out people aged 65 and over, who are mostly retired.\n\nRelated: Obama Left Us Much 'Better Off Now Than 8 Years Ago.' Can Trump Top That?\n\nThe accompanying table looks at two roughly comparable post recessionary periods, December 1982 to 1989 and December 2009 to 2016. In the earlier period, the civilian non-institutional population below age 65 increased roughly 1 percent annually, but the more recent period saw growth of only half a percent. That slower rate of increase, which is due to demographic factors, can only be made up in the near term by allowing in more working-age immigrants. But the Trump administration is headed in the opposite direction: It appears that we can expect fewer immigrants and thus a relatively stagnant working-age population going forward.\n\nDecember December 1982 1989 Annual Change 2009 2016 Annual Change Total US Population: Civilian non-institutional population 173,199 187,165 1.10% 236,924 254,742 1.00% Labor Force Size 111,083 124,497 1.60% 153,111 159,640 0.60% Labor Force Participation Rate 64.10% 66.50% 64.60% 62.70% Age 65+ Civilian non-institutional population 25,619 29,462 2.00% 38,362 48,837 3.50% Labor Force Size 2,994 3,445 2.00% 6,672 9,185 4.70% Labor Force Participation Rate 11.70% 11.70% 17.40% 18.80% Below Age 65 Civilian non-institutional population 147,580 157,703 1.00% 198,562 205,905 0.50% Labor Force Size Below Age 65 108,089 121,052 1.60% 146,439 150,455 0.40% Labor Force Participation Rate 73.20% 76.80% 73.70% 73.10% Selected Labor Force Statistics, Amounts in Thousands\n\nSource: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Authors Calculations\n\nThe figures also show some opportunities to increase growth. Labor force participation among older adults, while still low, has been rising. If this trend were to accelerate, more growth would be possible. Among adults below age 65, the labor force participation rate was almost 4 percent lower at the end of 2016 than it was at the end of 1989. If more good jobs become available, many adults not now in the workforce could be enticed to enter. Given Trump\u2019s focus on job creation and the slack in the labor force, he has an excellent chance to boost economic growth at least on a one-time basis.\n\nTrump Inherits a Solid Job Market. Can He Really Make It Better?\n\nLower taxes, less regulation and infrastructure investment would not only create attractive jobs, but they could also boost productivity. With respect to infrastructure, however, the productivity benefit will depend upon which projects are funded. Improvements to our transportation system will reduce time-wasting delays, allowing employees who travel by car or plane during the workday to get more done. On the other hand, a large investment in a 2000-mile border wall won\u2019t provide ongoing economic benefits. Building the wall will create jobs, but once the structure is built, it will not generate new economic activity.\n\nThe Benefits of Deregulation\n\nTrump\u2019s steps toward energy deregulation are especially positive for economic growth. Producing more energy domestically is not only good for oil, gas and coal producers, but it will also hold down energy costs and protect us from price spikes (admittedly, I\u2019m leaving aside the environmental impacts of more fossil fuel production here). While it is common knowledge that the OPEC oil embargo led to a severe recession in the 1970s, analysts often fail to recognize the role of energy prices in the Great Recession. Gasoline prices surged from $2.30 per gallon in early 2007 to $4.10 per gallon in the summer of 2008, before falling back later in the year. As a result, new auto sales collapsed, with higher-priced, gas-guzzling SUVs taking the biggest hit.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s How Trump Could Drive the Economy Into a Ditch\n\nAlthough energy deregulation should promote economic growth, Trump\u2019s plans to cut financial regulations may backfire. On Friday, the president ordered a review of federal financial regulations with the intention of rolling back the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act. This executive order may be followed by an outright repeal of portions of the law later in the year, if Senate Republicans can craft language that will survive an almost certain filibuster.\n\nCriticisms of Dodd-Frank often focus on the law\u2019s impact on smaller community banks and the resultant decline in small business lending. However, web-based lending platforms such as OnDeck, LendingClub and Funding Circle now offer loans to small companies, thereby taking up the slack caused by the closings and mergers among community banks. Indeed, the small brick-and-mortar bank immortalized by the movie It\u2019s a Wonderful Life may simply be a thing of the past: Just as streaming video killed off video rental stores, more technologically advanced, lower-cost alternatives may be replacing local banks.\n\nDodd-Frank\u2019s main intention was to avoid a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis by more aggressively regulating large, systematically important institutions. Dodd-Frank reforms such as the Volcker Rule, which restricts banks from making certain kinds of speculative investments, have made big financial firms less profitable, less dynamic and less exciting places to work.\n\nRelated: Wall Street's Honeymoon With Trump Is Over\n\nWall Street deregulation might draw the best and brightest away from Silicon Valley and back into banking \u2014 and in the process trigger a new wave of financial innovation that again ends badly. Some of the preconditions for a bubble are already in place: Stock prices are at record highs, more than triple their March 2009 levels. Meanwhile, the monetary base has more than doubled, providing plenty of raw material for a new generation of financial engineers.\n\nRepealing Dodd-Frank would lower compliance burdens, making banks more efficient and thus better equipped to provide consumers with a wider range of services. But the law must be replaced with other measures to prevent Wall Street from gambling with FDIC-insured deposits and the implicit guarantee of future taxpayer bailouts. Otherwise the crashes of 1929, 2000 and 2008 may not just be distant memories, they may serve as precedents for the Trump era."}, {"date": "2017/02/05", "title": "Pence Does Damage Control After Trump\u2019s Embarrassing Judicial Setbacks ", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/05/Pence-Does-Damage-Control-After-Trump-s-Embarrassing-Judicial-Setbacks", "text": "The administration on Sunday attempted to put a positive face on a weekend of embarrassing judicial setbacks that at least temporarily put President Donald Trump\u2019s controversial immigration ban on hold after a week of global protests of Trump\u2019s hard hitting and disruptive executive orders.\n\nVice President Mike Pence -- the administration\u2019s chief tactician for damage control \u2013 appeared on four major talk shows today arguing that a federal court judge\u2019s ruling on Friday night against Trump\u2019s hastily implemented actions against tens of thousands of foreign travelers would soon be reversed.\n\nRelated: Trump May Be the First Test Case for His Own Supreme Court Nominee\n\nPence insisted that a majority of Americans overwhelmingly approve Trump\u2019s tough action to root out potential terrorists \u2013 despite criticism that the order has created chaos and uncertainty at airports throughout the world and is a blot on the country\u2019s tradition of welcoming immigrants of all religions, including Muslims.\n\n\u201cWe believe the judge made the wrong decision,\u201d Pence said on Fox News Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to use all legal means at our disposal to sustain that order and move forward and take the steps necessary to protect our country.\u201d\n\nNoting that there is no unanimity among lower court judges on the constitutionality of Trump immigration order, Pence added, \u201cWe don\u2019t appoint judges to our district courts to conduct foreign policy or to make decisions about our national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the very outset of his campaign for president and the outset of his administration, President Trump has made clear he\u2019s going to put the security of the American people first,\u201d Pence added. \u201cIt is quite clear that the President has the ability to determine who has access to this country when it comes to national security.\n\nTrump fumed and lashed out this weekend after a federal judge in Seattle late Friday ordered a nationwide halt to enforcement of Trump\u2019s week-old order temporarily barring citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries \u2013 including Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen \u2013 pending an extensive review of U.S. immigration policies.\n\nRelated: Judge Grants Nationwide Temporary Restraining Order on Trump Travel Ban\n\nThe bellicose chief executive derisively referred to the judge as a \u201cso-called judge\u201d in a tweet and denounced his ruling as \u201cridiculous\u201d and contrary to the nation\u2019s best interest. His tweets were reminiscent of Trump\u2019s attacks last year on Gonzalo Curiel, a federal district judge in California of Mexican descent who was hearing a fraud case brought against the now-defunct Trump University.\n\nBut despite the latest presidential histrionics, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco early Sunday rejected the Justice Department\u2019s request that it immediately overturn the ruling of the federal judge, James Robart, who was appointed by former Republican President George W. Bush.\n\nRobart\u2019s ruling is contrary to another federal court decision in Boston earlier last Friday that upheld Trump\u2019s executive order. Robart\u2019s decision was much broader than the Boston ruling, and it forced the State Department to reverse its cancellation of as many as 60,000 visas.\n\nIt also prompted the Department of Homeland Security and immigration and customs officials to once again permit travelers from the targeted Muslim countries to enter this country, and many started trickling in over the weekend.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit appellate court has asked the attorney general of Washington State, who brought the complaint, and the Justice Department to file additional briefs by Monday. Regardless of how the appeals court finally rules, the question of whether Trump\u2019s executive order was a valid exercise of presidential power or blatant religious discrimination against Muslims is certain to be resolved by the Supreme Court.\n\nRelated: Is Trump\u2019s Travel Ban Already Hurting US Tourism?\n\nThousands of protesters marched on London Saturday for the second time in a week, to oppose Trump\u2019s ban on travelers from mainly Muslim nation entering the U.S. Meanwhile, an estimated 1,000 people marched in West Palm Beach, Fla., yesterday, near Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate, to protest his policies. Some carried a flag-draped coffin that symbolized the death of democracy, according to the Washington Post.\n\nDemocrats have charged that Trump has recklessly exaggerated the impact of Robart\u2019s temporary order by warning that \u201cmany very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country\u201d because of the judge\u2019s ruling. They also complained that Trump is attempting to intimidate the independence of the judiciary, at the same time he seeks to convince Senate Democrats that his nominee to the Supreme Court, Neil M. Gorsuch, would be a staunchly independent conservative voice on the High Court.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) said today that she is alarmed that Trump has issued \u201ca blizzard of executive orders and memoranda\u201d since he took office Jan. 20, including some like the immigration order that was hastily drafted and \u201cmost probably unlawful.\u201d\n\n\n\nFeinstein said that notwithstanding Trump\u2019s complaints about Robart\u2019s temporary ruling, the federal court \u201chas a right to make a judgment whether a law or order is lawful and constitutional \u2013 and that process has begun. The president is not a dictator,\u201d she said during an appearance on Fox News Sunday. \u201cHe is the chief executive of our country.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) seemed to be criticizing Trump for attempting to belittle the Seattle judge for ruling against his executive order.

Just stabilizing the debt at its current level of 77 percent relative to the overall economy would require $3.3 trillion of deficit reduction over ten years, according to the CRFB report.\n\n\u201cOf course, keeping debt at this post-World War II-era record high level is itself a problem because it may not leave much room to deal with future crises,\u201d the analysis states. \u201cGradually reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio to 70 percent by 2027 would require more than $5 trillion of savings, and reducing it to 60 percent would require $8 trillion.\u201d\n\nAmid the flurry of Trump\u2019s early spending policy pronouncements, especially his demands for a military buildup in the face of threats from North Korea and now Iran, budget-busting may become the order of the day.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration seems to be spending more of its time talking about where it would increase spending \u2013 particularly in defense\u2014than where it would cut it,\u201d said Richard Kogan, a federal budget senior fellow with the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no indication that they have scaled back their ambitions for deep, expensive, regressive tax cuts.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Best and Worst States for Taxes in 2017\n\n\u201cIf this all were to come about, then the debt ratio would rise faster than CBO says, and therefore would be even more undesirable than the current trend,\u201d Kogan said in an interview late last week.\n\nTrump late last month ordered Defense Secretary James Mattis to come up with a comprehensive plan within two months to improve overall readiness in the armed services by fiscal 2019, including updating the nuclear arsenal and strengthening defenses against a possible nuclear attack by North Korea or Iran. He has put Congress on notice that he expects lawmakers this spring to lift the legal cap on defense spending to accommodate his military ambitions \u2013 a move that would add $500 billion in the coming decade.\n\nAnd Trump has signed a number of executive orders making it clear that Congress must spend $15 billion or more building a wall along nearly 2,000 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border. He also wants to hire thousands of new border security agents and immigration officials to beef up security and prepare for mass deportations.

President Obama famously used a State of the Union address, with Supreme Court Justices arrayed in front of him, to blast their decision in the Citizens United campaign finance case.\n\nRelated: Is Trump\u2019s Travel Ban Already Hurting US Tourism?\n\nBut criticizing a decision and questioning the legitimacy of the court are not the same thing. Writing for the Washington Post\u2019s Volokh Conspiracy blog -- hardly a bastion of liberal bias -- Will Baude, an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School, seemed fairly stunned, calling the distinction \u201cdeadly serious.\u201d\n\nIf the court has authority, then the parties are legally required to follow its judgment: even if it is wrong; even if it is very wrong; even if the President does not like it. But if the court does not have authority, then perhaps it can be defied. So the charge of a lack of authority is a much more serious one. It is the possible set-up to a decision to defy the courts \u2014 a decision that is unconstitutional if the court does indeed have authority to decide the case.\n\nOn Twitter, Baude\u2019s University of Chicago colleague, law professor Eric Posner, wrote, \u201cNeil Gorsuch must condemn Trump for \u2018so-called judge\u2019 remark; his friends in the legal community must withhold their support until he does.\u201d When someone responded that Trump might revoke the nomination at such an affront, Posner said simply, \u201cThat\u2019s the price of integrity.\u201d\n\nIntegrity becomes an issue here because, while federal judges are appointed by presidents, they are not supposed to be beholden to them. And Trump\u2019s attack on Robarts, as Posner effectively makes clear, is going to require a response from Gorsuch. That response may come Sunday, or it may have to wait until his confirmation hearings, but at some point in the near future, Gorsuch is going to be asked to condemn the man who appointed him to the highest court -- and to do it in the most public of forums.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first example of Trump attacking the legitimacy of a federal judge. Famously, during his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, he spent weeks attacking Gonzalo Curiel, the District Court judge in California who heard a class-action suit against the now-defunct Trump University. Trump frequently claimed that Curiel, who was born in Indiana, could not be objective about the case because his parents came to the US from Mexico.\n\nRelated: Trump Inherits a Solid Job Market.

That call went to Judge Merrick Garland, the eminently qualified candidate nominated by President Obama last year who was denied a hearing or a vote in an utterly unprecedented power grab by the Republican-led Senate.\n\nGorsuch himself had previously spoken out against unseemly partisan delays in the process of confirming judicial appointments, and his decision to call Garland, made \u201cout of respect\u201d according to the White House, looked to many like the act of a man at least troubled by the circumstances in which he finds himself.\n\nTrump, furious at his first collision with the checks and balances built into the Constitution, did his first Supreme Court nominee no favors on Saturday."}, {"date": "2017/02/03", "title": "Judge Grants Nationwide Temporary Restraining Order on Trump Travel Ban", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/03/Judge-Grants-Nationwide-Temporary-Restraining-Order-Trump-Travel-Ban", "text": "A U.S. federal judge in Seattle on Friday granted a nationwide temporary restraining order on President Donald Trump's executive order made last week that temporarily barred entry to the United States to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries.\n\nThe ruling is the broadest to date against Trump's directive.\n\nThis is a breaking news update.

The judge ultimately denied the request.\n\n\"Where does it say Muslim countries?\" Gorton asked Matthew Segal, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, or ACLU. Segal responded, \"If your honor's question is, 'Does the word 'Muslim' make a profound presence in this executive order?' my answer is that it doesn't.

The policies of a president\u2019s predecessor may have lingering effects that last well into or even throughout their term in office. Trump supporters can and will argue that enthusiasm about his impending presidency sparked growth in the months following his elections.\n\nRelated: Populist on the Trail, Trump Pivots Toward the Banking Industry\n\nAdditionally, global events -- war, natural disaster, foreign economic crises -- can all affect the U.S. economy in ways a president has little control over. And the level of cooperation a president gets from lawmakers is a tremendous factor in determining the degree to which White House policies are able to affect the economy.\n\nBut for Trump -- who declared that he would be \u201cthe greatest jobs president God ever created\u201d during his campaign and has repeatedly said that employment growth will be his singular focus while in office -- there will be no escaping the job market comparisons. Even more than other presidents, he will be called to account for job-related failures and feted for job-related successes over the next four years.\n\nSo, it\u2019s worth treating the Bureau of Labor Statistics \u201cEmployment Situation Summary\u201d for January as a marker for the transition from the Obama economy to the Trump economy.\n\nBy most but not all measures, the economy Trump inherits is healthy and robust.\n\nRelated: Good News, Bad News for Trump as the Economy Picks Up Steam\n\nU.S. businesses created 227,000 non-farm jobs in January, making it the 76th consecutive month of positive job growth, the longest streak ever recorded. It was also well above the average 187,000 jobs the economy created every month in 2016. Because of Trump\u2019s emphatic promises to bring back manufacturing jobs to the United States, it\u2019s worth noting that even in a strong month of growth, the economy added just 5,000 jobs in that sector.\n\nThe official unemployment rate, which measures the percentage of people who were actively seeking work in the month of January but were unable to find it, sits at 4.8 percent, or about 7.6 million people. That is at or near the level most economists consider the \u201cnatural\u201d rate in a healthy economy.\n\nHowever, there were another 5.8 million people considered \u201cemployed\u201d in the survey who reported that they were actually only working part time, even though they would prefer full-time employment. That\u2019s fewer than a year ago, but is still high by historic standards.\n\nAbout 1.9 million of the unemployed are considered long-term jobless, meaning they have been out of work for six months or more. That figure has been declining slowly but steadily for several years now.\n\nStepping back, another 1.8 million were considered \u201cmarginally attached\u201d to the workforce, meaning they did not look for a job in January, but would like to work and have sought employment in the past 12 months. Among those, 532,000 were \u201cdiscouraged\u201d workers, who said that although they would like to work, they have given up looking entirely.\n\nRelated: The GOP\u2019s \u2018Repeal and Replace\u2019 Obamacare Is Becoming \u2018Repair and Fix\u2019\n\nThe labor force participation rate, a number Trump focused on in his campaign, continued to improve, rising 0.2 percent to 62.9 percent. After a years-long decline, the percentage of Americans in the workforce appears to have stabilized at around 63 percent. That is still low by historic standards, but much of the decline is attributable to an aging population.\n\nWage growth was positive but slow, rising $0.03 to $26 per hour, a 2.5 percent year-over-year increase.\n\nWhen pundits and voters -- and potential challengers -- start taking stock of Trump\u2019s performance in advance of the 2020 elections, these are the numbers that they will use as the baseline. Just as it was normally noted that President Obama took office at a time when the country was shedding 800,000 jobs every month, people will point out that Trump took office with steady growth and most indicators moving in the right direction, if slowly.\n\nIn a sense, he may have a harder task ahead of him than Obama did. By the time he ran for reelection in 2012, the economy wasn\u2019t roaring, but at least the president had a story to tell. He was able to point to two straight years of solid job growth and a declining unemployment rate. He could plausibly tell Americans that the once fearful prospect of a full-on depression was no longer a worry and that the country was indisputably on the mend.\n\nRelated: Trump May Try to Weed Out Immigrants Who Cost Taxpayers $279 Billion Annually\n\nHowever much he wants it, Trump probably isn\u2019t going to be able to tell a credible \u2018turnaround\u2019 story like that four years from now.\n\nUnless you believe his promises to drive U.S. economic growth rates above 4 percent, which most economists do not, Trump will likely be telling a tale of incremental progress at best. If he can maintain employment and wage growth at current rates, chipping away at the number of underemployed Americans and drawing others back into the workforce, the narrative will be positive, just not terribly dramatic.\n\nUnfortunately for Trump, he\u2019ll have to do it while butting up against a lower bound in the unemployment rate, and in the face of a Federal Reserve that is likely to spend the next several years gradually increasing interest rates from their current rock-bottom levels.\n\nIt\u2019s a tough task, but hopefully nothing the \u201cbest jobs president God ever created\u201d can\u2019t handle."}, {"date": "2017/02/03", "title": "Trump\u2019s Rollback on Clean Air and Water Rules Could Raise Health Care Costs", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/03/Trump-s-Rollback-Clean-Air-and-Water-Rules-Could-Raise-Health-Care-Costs", "text": "President Donald Trump and his GOP allies on Capitol Hill just moved ahead with their promised rollback on Obama administration environmental rules, making it clear that concerns about climate change, clean water, and public health must take a back seat to job creation and economic expansion.\n\nIn a flurry of congressional activity, the Senate took final action early Friday morning to reverse the Stream Protection Rule, which was designed to protect 6,000 miles of streams and 52,000 acres of forests from rocks and debris generated by coal industry surface mining and so-called mountaintop removal. The House previously approved the measure, and it now goes to the White House for Trump\u2019s signature.\n\nRelated: Environmentalists\u2019 Worst Fears About Trump Are Coming True\n\nThat rule was deemed critical by environmentalists and public health advocacy groups in Appalachian coal communities to protect the nation\u2019s waterways and prevent the contamination of drinking water and other public health threats.\n\nBut the Trump administration and mining industry complained that the rule could endanger up to 590 coal mining jobs and that the estimated $52 million in annual compliance costs was too steep a price to pay. Scientists say that surface mining \u2013 especially mountaintop removal \u2013 cause serious local air and water pollution and contributes to higher rates than normal of cancer, heart and lung disease, and even birth defects.\n\nSome analyses show that economic costs of health problems in Appalachian coal mining areas are more than five times greater than the economic benefits from mining. Beyond contributing to climate change, outdoor methane leaks contribute to smog, which aggravates asthma and other respiratory conditions.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican and major foe of Obama administration policies, said the stream buffer rule \u201cis a harmful regulation that unfairly targets coal jobs.\u201d The House, meanwhile, passed a resolution today to reverse a rule from the federal Bureau of Land Management mandating companies to control their hydrocarbon emissions on public lands took effect in mid-January requiring oil and natural gas companies drilling on public lands to control methane gas emissions that directly contribute to global warming.\n\nRelated: Trump v. Truth: How Will the New Administration Make Policy?\n\nHouse Republicans and the oil industry insisted that the rule would put a major crimp in energy production on federal lands by restricting drilling, reducing the number of jobs and cutting into tax and royalty payments to state and local governments.\n\n\u201cIt is a costly rule and totally unnecessary rule,\u201d said Rep. Rob Bishop (R-UT), chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, according to The Hill. \u201cThis rule\u2019s repeal is a vote for people, and making sure that their lives are better, not worse.\u201d\n\nTaken together, the two actions constitute a stern warning from the Trump administration that scores of environmental regulations will be put on the chopping block. Trump, a global warming skeptic who once dismissed climate change as a \u201choax,\u201d has nominated an arch foe of the Obama administration\u2019s anti-coal, clean power policies to head the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nSenate Republicans on Thursday used their majority to suspend committee rules and push through Trump\u2019s choice, Scott Pruitt, bypassing Democrats who had refused to show up for a vote on his nomination. Pruitt, Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general, has been a leading advocate against what he calls \u201cEPA\u2019s activist agenda\u201d and filed briefs in 14 lawsuits against EPA policies, including President Obama\u2019s signature clean power initiative to reduce industrial carbon emissions.\n\nRelated: The Republican War on Obama\u2019s Regulations Is About to Begin\n\nIn both congressional actions to roll back the Stream Protection Rule and the oil and gas drilling rules, Congress invoked an obscure law, the Congressional Review Act. That law allows lawmakers to rescind executive actions taken during the previous 60 legislative work days if the rule threatens to impose excessive costs or exceeds presidential authority.\n\nUntil now, the 1996 Congressional Review Act was invoked only once by Congress, during the Clinton administration, and was conceived of as a rifle shot to be held in abeyance except in cases of extreme presidential overreach. But as part of the planned, all-out warfare against Obama environmental protections, House and Senate Republican leaders intend to use the CRA to go after a wide array of provisions.\n\nTrump championed the fast declining coal industry during the campaign and blamed the overly zealous environmental policies of the Obama administration as a principal cause of economic despair in coal country. He has promised mining communities in West Virginia, Kentucky and other Appalachian areas that he would help bring back jobs \u2013 in part by getting rid of onerous regulations like the Stream Protection Rule.\n\nThat rule would have virtually eliminated exceptions to a requirement for a 100-foot buffer between surface coal mining and streams. The rule would also have forced coal companies to restore streams, and adjoining forests and land to conditions similar to those before mining took place.\n\nRelated: No, Trump Did Not Just Roll Back Sanctions on Russia\n\nWhile highly efficient in maximizing coal production, mountaintop removal is not only a brutal disfigurement of a natural resource; it is notorious for deforestation, destruction of headwater streams, and the contamination of downstream surface waters. Those mining practices over the years have killed fish and wildlife and posed public health problems for residents in the area.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, imposing the regulation is not a job killer. Fewer miners are needed to operate massive bulldozers and cranes used in blasting away the sides and tops of mountains. A recent Congressional Research report outlining the pros and cons of the rule noted that even without the measure, the coal industry would decline by more than 15,000 workers, from a total of 90,000 in 2012."}, {"date": "2017/02/03", "title": "Populist on the Trail, Trump Pivots Toward the Banking Industry", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/03/Populist-Trail-Trump-Pivots-Toward-Banking-Industry", "text": "After a campaign spent railing against his opponent\u2019s connections to Wall Street banks and promising to stand up for ordinary Americans against the moneyed interests holding them back, President Trump is preparing to take major regulatory action in the financial services field. But it may come as a surprise to his voters exactly where his focus will be.\n\nOn Friday, Trump is expected to sign an executive order launching an effort to roll back regulations associated with the Dodd-Frank Act, a post-financial crisis law that created mechanisms to prevent the sort of out-of-control risk-taking and predatory lending practices that contributed to the housing bubble and the Great Recession.\n\nOver the years, Dodd-Frank, with its more than 22,000 pages of regulations, has helped accelerate the consolidation of the banking industry. The New York Times reports that the number of community banks in the US shrank 14 percent between 2010 and 2014.\n\nRelated: No, Trump Did Not Just Roll Back Sanctions on Russia\n\nBut the assault on Dodd-Frank isn\u2019t the only thing the new administration is planning. Trump will also order the Labor Department to halt the implementation of the so-called \u201cFiduciary Rule,\u201d a new regulation that requires retirement plan advisers to recommend the products that best suit the needs of their clients.\n\nUnder current rules, which the industry is fighting hard to retain, retirement planners are free to steer clients toward investments that carry higher commissions, even though they are aware of other products that would provide better value for their clients.\n\nFurther still, a Republican-led Congress, cheered by the prospect of having one of their own in the White House prepared to sign off on their legislation, seems poised to start asserting itself in the oversight of the nation\u2019s financial regulators.\n\nOn Thursday, the Financial Times newspaper published a January 31 letter that Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC), the vice chairman of the House Financial Services Committee had sent to Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen.\n\nRelated: Trump May Try to Weed Out Immigrants Who Cost Taxpayers $279 Billion Annually\n\nIn it, McHenry said that it is \u201cunacceptable\u201d that the US central bank, which has wide supervisory authority over the financial services industry, \u201ccontinues to participate in international forums on financial regulation.\u201d\n\nThe Fed, along with the central banks of most developed countries in the world, has long negotiated with international groups including the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Financial Stability Board, and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors. Bank regulators see these groups as necessary to assure that the global financial system works smoothly and that the industry\u2019s major players operate according to a general set of guidelines that regulators understand.\n\nMcHenry said that the requirements imposed on American businesses by these international bodies are overly burdensome and their negotiations too opaque.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Reserve must cease all attempts to negotiate binding standards burdening American business until President Trump has an opportunity to nominate and appoint officials that prioritize America\u2019s best interests.\u201d\n\nRelated: Mark Cuban -- Trump's Immigration Ban Is Bad for Business\n\nAt least with respect to some elements of banking regulation, McHenry seems to be confused. US regulators are, by and large, far more strict than their foreign counterparts. McHenry identified bank capital requirements in particular -- rules dictating how much cash and liquid assets banks must hold against unexpected losses -- as something that foreign regulators have forced on US banks. In fact, it has for many years been US regulators who demanded higher capital requirements, often frustrating their European counterparts in particular.\n\nThe administration is also expected to join Congressional Republicans in their efforts to defang the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and to roll back authority given to federal regulators meant to facilitate the \u201corderly liquidation\u201d of banks and other financial services firms that fail.\n\nThat Trump, who sold himself to voters as the champion of the little guy, should be granting big banks so many of the things on their wish list just two weeks into his term might seem surprising, but there has been no shortage of clues about where the administration was headed.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s SCOTUS Nomination: One Way or the Other, This Ends Badly\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s favorite targets on the campaign trail was Hillary Clinton\u2019s connections to the investment bank Goldman Sachs, but he has since populated his administration with Goldman alumni and other Wall Street veterans. The architect of the regulatory rollback is White House National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, the former president of Goldman.\n\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Cohn signaled that there are good times ahead for financial services firms chafing under increased regulation since the financial crisis.

In a special section of the Trust Barometer survey focusing on the U.S., the pollster documented the profound chasm separating attitudes and the mindset of Trump supporters and those who voted for Democrat Hilary Clinton.\n\nOn the most fundamental question of whether people accept Trump\u2019s presidency as legitimate (after revelations of Russian interference and FBI Director James Comey\u2019s startling last-minute public statements on the status of Clinton\u2019s email investigation era), 96 percent of Trump supporters said the election outcome was a \u201cfair and accurate\u201d reflection of the will of the people, while only 34 percent of Clinton supporters agreed with that statement.\n\nMoreover, 77 percent of Trump voters said they trust the new administration to do what is right, while a mere eight percent of Clinton supporters feel the same way. At the same time, there appears to be widespread remorse among many who didn\u2019t bother to vote. Twenty-eight percent of all those surveyed said they regretted having stayed home that day.\n\nClinton lost in part because she couldn\u2019t attract younger voters to her side, many of whom preferred Sen.

A third of Trump and Clinton voters have annual incomes of $100,000 a year or more, and little more than half of the two groups are college educated. Still, Trump voters were more likely to be white, male and over 50 years of age than Clinton\u2019s supporters.\n\nAnd while the two sides were in agreement on policy priorities more often than not, there were still some important differences in their attitudes.\n\nThere is strong support among Trump and Clinton partisans alike for holding corporate executives accountable for business scandals and financial meltdowns (roughly 80 percent of both sides agree) and allowing the government to regulate the pharmaceutical industry and pass legislation to address climate change (roughly 63 percent of Trump and Clinton voters agree).\n\nHowever, Trump backers are far more protectionist on trade issues than the Democrats are, and they favor the new president tearing up long-standing trade agreements like NAFTA. Trump supports are also far more fearful of immigration and globalization than Clinton backers.\n\nFinally, the survey makes it clear that Trump supporters heartily share the new president\u2019s contempt for the media and are far more inclined than Clinton voters to find a way to regulate or rein in news organizations."}, {"date": "2017/02/03", "title": "Good News, Bad News for Trump as the Economy Picks Up Steam", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/03/Good-News-Bad-News-Trump-Economy-Picks-Steam", "text": "While it\u2019s impossible to know for sure what the political and economic landscape will look like years from now, a new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office should give some confidence to Republicans about the conditions they\u2019ll be facing when mid-term elections come around in 2018. But the same can\u2019t be said for President Trump and lawmakers facing reelection in 2020.\n\nThe new report on labor market projections suggests that when voters go to the polls in 2018, unemployment rates will be so low that economists will consider the country to be \u201cabove\u201d full employment. What\u2019s more, it suggests that by that time, hourly labor compensation will have been on a sharp upward trend for nearly two years.\n\nRelated: Trump May Try to Weed Out Immigrants Who Cost Taxpayers $279 Billion Annually\n\nThe declining unemployment rate, the report finds, \u201creflects a projected increase in demand for labor that would reduce the number of unemployed people.

Instantly, the Trump White House is faced with one of the tough foreign policy questions that proved quite beyond Barack Obama\u2019s capacities. By most accounts, Ukraine wasn\u2019t a major topic during the Trump\u2013Putin exchange, but Trump has a major policy judgment on his hands now.\n\nRelated: No, Trump Did Not Just Roll Back Sanctions on Russia\n\nWhile Trump was always clear about defrosting ties with Russia during last year\u2019s campaigns, it was among the many ideas that came with a question. Will he or won\u2019t he remove the sanctions, given formidable opposition to any such idea in the Pentagon, the national security agencies, and NATO?\n\nNow we know. This isn\u2019t a hotel deal or a Miss Universe pageant or some kind of mutual admiration club. D\u00e9tente is the White House policy as of last Saturday. The two leaders did not discuss the Western sanctions against Russia now in place, and there was no talk that Russia meddled in the elections to put Trump in the White House.\n\nIn a 50\u2013minute exchange, they spoke of making common cause against international terrorism and improving economic ties; they determined to hold a summit\u2014the shake-hands kind\u2014later this year. Trump did sign a memorandum, the same day ordering security agencies to devise a new anti-terror blueprint. Among its instructions was \u201cidentification of new coalition partners in the fight against ISIS.\u201d\n\nSounds like the beginning of a d\u00e9tente story, although John Kerry and the Obama administration tried for months to cut a deal on \u201cthe possibility of Russian-American cooperation in the fight against terrorist groups in Syria.\" Clearly, cooperation does not always signal d\u00e9tente. For Donald Trump, terrorism is an obvious call as a shared concern between Moscow and Washington.

It\u2019s hard to think why Putin would follow a successful first encounter with battlefield aggression.\n\nThe Washington Post postulates that Russia\u2019s intent was to sabotage a meeting this week between Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Does this make sense? Merkel force-marched Poroshenko into the ceasefire known as Minsk II\u2014signed two years ago this month\u2014and has consistently favored a settlement very close to Putin\u2019s idea of a Ukrainian federation. More likely, a report from Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty direct from Ukraine last Monday is on point:\n\n\u201cFrustrated by the stalemate in this 33\u2013month war of attrition, concerned that Western support is waning, and sensing that U.S. President Donald Trump could cut Kyiv [Kiev] out of any peace negotiations as he tries to improve fraught relations with Moscow, Ukrainian forces anxious to show their newfound strength have gone on what many here are calling a \u2018creeping offensive.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump is in a spot either way. The news from Ukraine strengthens the hand of those opposed to his d\u00e9tente project. He could drop it, but that\u2019s unlikely since his commitment to better ties appears serious and durable. Is the Trump White House smart enough to huddle with Merkel and resuscitate the barely breathing Minsk II, which the U.S. was not asked to negotiate? Let\u2019s hope so: It remains the most promising proposition on the table.\n\nIn the bargain, the president could improve his approval ratings among the Europeans who are fed up with the standoff over Ukraine.

One of those moves was the addition of the FSB to the list of entities that U.S. persons, businesses and particularly financial institutions are barred from doing business with.\n\nThe problem for U.S. software and technology firms is that in order to sell products containing encryption software in Russia, it is necessary to buy a license.

I think your military is scared.

As a result, three officials said, the attacking SEAL team found itself dropping onto a reinforced al Qaeda base defended by landmines, snipers, and a larger than expected contingent of heavily armed Islamist extremists.\u201d\n\nThese claims raise a number of troubling questions, chief among them being why military officials would even ask permission to undertake an operation that they saw as ill-conceived in the first place. It suggests that either the Trump administration was pressuring the Pentagon into taking actions it wasn\u2019t prepared for, or that military officials are throwing the White House under the bus for a botched operation they don\u2019t want to take the blame for. Neither is a particularly encouraging scenario.\n\nAll this came after a day in which Trump\u2019s controversial National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, made an unannounced appearance in the White House briefing room Wednesday afternoon to tell reporters that the administration was \u201cofficially putting Iran on notice\u201d over what he described as violations of a United Nations resolution affirming a deal to shut down its nuclear program and attacks by Houthi rebels in Yemen who receive backing from Tehran.\n\nHowever, Flynn abruptly left the podium before elaborating on what it meant to put Iran \u201cofficially on notice\u201d leaving it to Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who said only that the US would not \u201csit by and not act on those actions.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the day, there had still been no clarification of what, if any, steps the administration is considering.\n\nNevertheless, the administration sent out its surrogates to insist that the move had been a success.\n\nSebastian Gorka, an assistant to the president, appeared on Fox News channel\u2019s Sean Hannity program to claim that the vague threat was actually \u201cdeadly clear.\u201d\n\nRelated: The US Navy\u2019s $13 Billion Answer to China and Russia\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a national security team made up of 28-year-old grad school students who have degrees in fictional writing. We have a very serious national security team,\u201d Gorka said, apparently in reference to one of former president Obama\u2019s close advisers. \u201cWe sent a very clear message. We recognize that Iran is not just another country. It's not Belgium, it's not Trinidad and Tobago. It is a state sponsor of terrorism that is destabilizing the region. We have to send a message, and I think the message was sent.\u201d\n\nTrump himself addressed the issue early Thursday morning in a pair of tweets, writing, \u201cIran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE for firing a ballistic missile. Should have been thankful for the terrible deal the U.S. made with them! Iran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the U.S. came along and gave it a lifeline in the form of the Iran Deal: $150 billion.\u201d\n\nBut he also offered no clear indication of what actions the White House is planning to take."}, {"date": "2017/02/02", "title": "Trump May Try to Weed Out Immigrants Who Cost Taxpayers $279 Billion Annually", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/02/Trump-May-Try-Weed-Out-Immigrants-Who-Cost-Taxpayers-279-Billion-Annually", "text": "Last fall, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine published a massive report that attempted to answer questions that have bedeviled the debate over immigration policy for years: Are immigrants living and working in the U.S. both legally and illegally a net plus or minus for the economy? And do they pose a serious drain on government services and welfare?\n\nOn the first question, the report found that illegal immigrants have had \u201can overall positive impact\u201d on long-term economic growth, with little evidence that they have significantly depressed the wages of native-born workers with a high-school education or less. Overall, the economy benefitted from an expanding population and more jobs, and businesses frequently took advantage of a flood of cheap labor into the market.\n\nRelated: Mark Cuban: Trump's Immigration Ban Is Bad for Business\n\nBut on the second question, the researchers found that the United States is saddled with a $279 billion annual \u201cfiscal burden,\u201d or the difference between tax revenues collected from first-generation immigrants and their families and the value of the social services they used. The average per capita government outlay was $15,908, according to the report, compared with per capita tax receipts of only $10,887.\n\nThe report by 20 prominent social scientists and economists left little doubt that that the nation\u2019s 55.5 million immigrants \u2013 both legal and illegal \u2013 weren\u2019t paying nearly enough in taxes to cover their use of public services.\n\nWhile millions of undocumented immigrants have paid billions of dollars in taxes into federal, state and local coffers -- as immigration advocacy groups frequently point out -- anti-immigrant forces on Capitol Hill and now in the White House have dismissed these immigrants as freeloaders who are excessively utilizing public schools, health care and food stamps while taking away jobs from native Americans. Although jobs may not be affected nearly as much as some may think, the federal budget does take a big hit.\n\nThese and other findings are important grist in an immigration debate that has gone viral in the past week and a half, as newly ensconced President Donald Trump has delayed entry for refugees and travelers from seven mostly Muslim countries and is setting in motion a crackdown on illegal immigrants in this country that will likely lead to more deportations in the coming months.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Immigration and Obamacare Policies Could Trigger a GOP Backlash\n\nTrump\u2019s surprise executive order last week that touched off chaos and confusion in airports around the country and overseas apparently was just the first installment in a series of actions designed to make good on his campaign pledge to rid the U.S. of as many as 11 million illegal immigrants.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, the administration is also considering a plan to \u201cweed out would-be immigrants who are likely to require public assistance,\u201d as well as targeting illegal immigrants who are already living in the U.S. and making use of taxpayer-funded social and health care programs for deportation.\n\nMany of those immigrants have little if any formal education and lack skills to obtain better-paying jobs, according to the National Academies of Science report. As a result, many of their children are on welfare and school lunch programs, placing a burden on state and local social services. Not surprisingly, the fiscal drain is felt most heavily by states with large populations of illegal immigrants.\n\nCalifornia, for example, struggles with an $18.9 billion annual fiscal drain. Texas ranks second nationally with a $7.8 billion fiscal deficit because of excessive demands by immigrants on social services, medical facilities and schools.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Action Gives Illegal Immigrants Billions in Tax Credits\n\nThe report indicated that over time, the fiscal burden will shrink to as little as $43.4 billion a year, as the second-generation immigrants who are better educated and trained than their parents pay more into the tax system to defray the cost of social services. But those projections are contingent on varying assumptions about the future education level of immigrants, government-spending levels and tax rates.\n\nThe Washington Post and VOX have both reported obtaining drafts of a second executive order that would target immigrants attempting to enter the country or are living here legally on the basis of their prospects for getting and holding a job and making minimal use of social services.\n\n\u201cOur country\u2019s immigration laws are designed to protect American taxpayers and promote immigrant self-sufficiency,\u201d stated the draft of the order obtained by The Post. \u201cYet households headed by aliens are much more likely than those headed by citizens to use Federal means-tested public benefits.\u201d\n\nA second order in draft stage calls for the elimination of the \u201cjobs magnet\u201d that is motivating illegal immigrants to come to the U.S., according to the newspaper. The proposed order would rescind any work visa provisions for foreign nationals that are found not to be in \u201cthe national interest\u201d or deemed to be in violation of U.S. immigration law.\n\nRelated: Outraged Over $23 Billion in Wrongful Tax Credits? Blame Congress\n\nThe White House declined to comment on the proposed draft orders. For now, at least, there is no clear evidence the administration intends to move ahead with them. However, as The Post noted, longstanding federal law already makes it more difficult for non-citizens to obtain most forms of public assistance.\n\nStill, a September 2015 analysis by the Center for Immigration Studies showed that 51 percent of immigrant-headed households used at least one federal welfare program \u2014 cash, food, housing, or medical care \u2014 compared to 30 percent of native households. A follow-up report showed that the average immigrant household \u201cconsumes 33 percent more cash welfare, 57 percent more food assistance and 44 percent more Medicaid dollars\u201d than the average native household.\n\nBut economists and policy experts differ on the degree of immigrant dependence on government social and health care programs. And even some supporters of Trump\u2019s get-tough policies against illegal immigrants question whether the draft executive orders circulating in Washington would be practical or in keeping with American values.\n\nSteven A. Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates limits on immigration, said that the Trump administration appears to be addressing \u201can important principle\u201d of immigrants\u2019 excessive dependence on social services. However, he argued that there is no way that the government could accurately gauge the likelihood of immigrants allowed into the country being financially independent.\n\nRelated: Could Trump\u2019s Attack on Sanctuary Cities Trigger a Tax Revolt?\n\n\u201cThe problem here is, imagine a person comes to the United States and gets hurt,\u201d he said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cAre we not going to take care of them? We might deny them Medicaid, but are we going to keep them out of the hospitals or emergency rooms or long-term care?\u201d\n\n\u201cOr somebody comes to the United States and they lose their job,\u201d Camarota added. \u201cThey have a kid. We\u2019re not going to give them food stamps? We\u2019re just going to let the kid starve? We\u2019re not going to give the kid a free lunch? Really?\u201d\n\nWhile there may be better ways to screen low-income applicants for visas to enter the country, Camarota said, he doesn\u2019t favor cutting off welfare to immigrants in need. And targeting for deportation immigrants legally residing in the United States for using too many government services doesn\u2019t appear to be doable \u2013 or legal.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that if you allow in a lot of poor people, you\u2019re going to get a lot of welfare use,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just very hard to imagine our society [cutting benefits] after the fact.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/02/02", "title": "Republicans Exhale With Trump\u2019s Supreme Court Choice of Gorsuch", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/02/02/Republicans-Exhale-Trump-s-Supreme-Court-Choice-Gorsuch", "text": "\u201cThink of the Supreme Court,\u201d the Republican Party repeatedly urged skeptics of Donald Trump during the general election in 2016. Conservatives who found themselves lost at sea in a cycle dominated by grassroots populism and the tenacious popularity of the billionaire candidate riding its wave fretted whether they would find themselves locked out, regardless of which candidate won the election. Republican leaders and the Trump campaign insisted that conservatives had only one chance left to save the Supreme Court from a progressive takeover, and eventually conservatives cast their bets on Trump.\n\nThis week, that bet paid off \u2013 and perhaps more robustly than conservatives might have hoped. Trump had long pledged to name his first Supreme Court pick from a list of 21 names, consisting of well-regarded judicial conservatives that had been recommended from sources like the Heritage Foundation and activists with whom the campaign consulted. Still, having been burned in the past on nominees from better-established politicians \u2013 such as George H. W. Bush\u2019s appointment of David Souter or George W. Bush\u2019s initial selection of Harriet Miers \u2013 many conservatives had low expectations that Trump would stick to his list once the political realities of Washington DC emerged.\n\nRelated: The GOP May Get a Taste of Its Own Medicine on Supreme Court Nominations\n\nInstead, Trump fulfilled his campaign promise, even while doing so in a nod to his reality-show past. The president invited his two finalists to Washington but introduced Judge Neil Gorsuch as his nominee. Gorsuch represents precisely what conservatives most want in a Supreme Court justice: conservative, dedicated to an originalist interpretation of the Constitution, and scholarly enough to have a track record of writings that allow supporters to believe that he will remain in the mold of the late Antonin Scalia rather than \u201cgrow\u201d in his office \u2013 to the Left.\n\nFurthermore, Gorsuch offers the promise of a very long tenure on the bench at his present age of 49. Despite his youth, Gorsuch has spent a decade on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals after having been appointed by the younger Bush, which gives him an unassailable resum\u00e9 for the job. In fact, Gorsuch was already such an impressive figure at the time of his 2006 nomination to the appellate bench that Senate Democrats waived a roll-call vote and allowed Gorsuch to be confirmed by universal acclamation\n\nFor that reason, Trump\u2019s choice is a stroke of genius that will make it much more difficult to obstruct the confirmation. The Senate still allows for filibusters on Supreme Court confirmations, but Democrats must have 41 of their caucus to sustain one in the event of a floor vote. Despite anger over the blocking of Merrick Garland last year, when Senate Republicans refused to take up Barack Obama\u2019s choice for Scalia\u2019s replacement, Senate Democrats don\u2019t appear to have the numbers to block Gorsuch. A press release from the conservative activist group America Squared on Wednesday notes that eight Democrats have already gone on record supporting a floor vote, which would give Republicans the 60 votes they need to proceed to confirmation by a simple majority.\n\nRelated: Potentially Nasty Fight Looms Over Trump U.S. Supreme Court Pick\n\nNor is this the only victory that conservatives have seen in the first two weeks of the Trump era, or perhaps more accurately, since the election. Having been freed up from the need to overcome filibusters on his Cabinet appointments, Trump nominated serious conservatives in policy posts \u2013 Tom Price to Health and Human Services, Betsy DeVos to Education, Scott Pruitt to the Environmental Protection Agency, and Rick Perry to Energy, among others.\n\nHis very first executive order on Inauguration Day started the rollback of Obamacare; others soon followed that froze federal hiring, reduced red tape on regulatory burdens on manufacturing, and restarted the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipeline projects favored by conservatives and unions alike.\n\nMany on the right wondered just how deep Trump\u2019s commitment to the pro-life movement would run. On his first full business day in office, Trump reinstated the \u201cMexico City\u201d policy that bars federal funds to organizations that promote or provide abortions abroad, and sent Vice President Mike Pence to the March for Life \u2013 the first time a sitting vice president has spoken at the 44-year annual protest march against Roe v. Wade.\n\nRelated: Trump Would Favor Senate Rule Change If Supreme Court Choice Blocked\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump would often claim that America would start winning so much that we would get \u201csick of winning.\u201d Before the first fortnight of his presidency has passed, conservatives \u2013 even those who opposed Trump or viewed his potential with significant skepticism \u2013 have to acknowledge that they\u2019ve been on a solid winning streak so far, as early #NeverTrump commentator Erick Erickson did. \u201cIf you\u2019re a Trump critic from the right and can\u2019t bring yourself to even thank him for Gorsuch,\u201d Erickson tweeted after the Supreme Court nomination announcement, \u201cat this point, you\u2019re just an ill-mannered ass.\u201d\n\nThat streak won\u2019t last forever, of course. Trump has plans for infrastructure spending that will generate opposition from fiscal conservatives and deficit hawks, and the pressing need for comprehensive entitlement reform will get back-burnered for at least a few more years. However, Trump has at least established his credibility on honoring commitments to voters, especially with conservatives who only reluctantly rallied to his banner.\n\nThat alone will earn Trump maneuvering room on these other issues, and could unite the Republican base more strongly than since the passage of Obamacare seven years ago. And that should have Democrats facing a potential disaster in 2018 worried that their own losing streak will just get longer and longer."}, {"date": "2017/02/01", "title": "Gen.

If we stop doing so, it will fray and, eventually, collapse.\"\n\nThe retired four-star general, who commanded forces in Iraq and later headed the CIA before resigning because of a scandal in which he was found to have shared classified information with his biographer and former mistress, was one of President Donald Trump's picks for secretary of state.\n\nDuring his testimony to the House committee, he warned against isolationism and protectionism, which the new administration's policies support, instead advocating the kind of promotion of democracy around the world that the US has engaged in since World War II.\n\n\"To keep the peace, we led an effort to establish a system of global alliances and security commitments underwritten by US military power and the deployment of our forces to bases in Europe and Asia,\" Petraeus said.\n\n\"To create a foundation for prosperity, we put in place an open, free, and rules-based economic order intended to safeguard against the spiral of protectionism that produced the impoverishment and radicalization of the 1930s.

The order applies to citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, countries that the White House cited the Obama administration as having once flagged as \"countries of particular concern.\"\n\nRelated: Extreme Muslim Immigration Ban Suggests Bannon Is Running the White House\n\nTerrorism experts have argued that this will feed into the narratives of terrorist groups that claim the US is against Islam while doing little to prevent terrorist attacks inside the country.\n\n\"Islamic extremists want to portray this fight as a clash of civilizations, with America at war against Islam,\" he said. \"We must not let them do that \u2014 indeed, we must be very sensitive to actions that might give them ammunition to use in such an effort.\"\n\nPetraeus urged the US to align itself with the Muslim community rather than against it.\n\n\"The most important ally in this war is the overwhelming majority of Muslims who reject Al Qaeda, Daesh, and their fanatical, barbaric worldview,\" he said, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State terrorist group. \"Indeed, it is millions of Muslims who are fighting and dying in the greatest numbers on the frontlines of this war.\"\n\nHe noted Arab and Kurdish soldiers who are fighting ISIS, Gulf Arab fighters who are pushing back Al Qaeda in Yemen, Afghans who are fighting a resurgent Taliban in their country, and Somali forces who are fighting terrorist elements there.\n\nPetraeus' warnings matched those given by other experts, former government officials, and world leaders.\n\nLast month, Vice President Joe Biden lashed out at the policies Trump had proposed, saying the EU had been an \"indispensable partner of the United States.\"\n\n\"Defending the liberal international order requires that we resist the forces of European disintegration and maintain our longstanding insistence on a Europe whole, free, and at peace,\" he said.\n\nEuropean leaders have also expressed concerns about Trump's views on NATO and the EU.\n\nAnd earlier this week, the president of the European Council of the EU warned that Trump could pose a threat to the stability of the bloc.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Business Insider.

So far, however, only three of Trump\u2019s 15 nominees have won confirmation by the Senate: Defense Secretary James Mattis, Homeland Security secretary John Kelly and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.\n\nThat leaves some of Trump\u2019s most controversial nominees for clearance, including restaurant businessman Andy Puzder for labor secretary, billionaire Republican operative Betsy DeVos to head the Department of Education, Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-SC) to head the Office of Management and Budget, and Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama to be the next Attorney General.\n\nBy this time eight years ago, former President Barack Obama had won Senate confirmation of practically all 15 of his cabinet picks.\n\nSenate Republicans\u2019 decision to play hardball in forcing through Trump\u2019s nominees comes at a time when partisan rancor on Capitol Hill is reaching a boiling point. Hatch, the Finance Committee chair, on Tuesday went after Democrats on the committee in unusually angry language on the first day of their boycott.\n\nRelated: Trump Moves Quickly on Pledge to Contain Drug Prices \u2013 but Can He Do It?\n\n\u201cWell, they are idiots,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cIt\u2019s just complete breach of decorum, a complete breach of committee rules, a complete breach of just getting along around here.\u201d\n\nIn an extraordinary showdown in the Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, Minnesota Sen. Al Franken accused Sessions of misrepresenting his record on civil rights. He also accused fellow Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas of abetting the deception.\n\nThis led to an intensely angry exchange between Franken and Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the Majority Whip, that came right before a final 11 to 9 party-line vote that sent Sessions\u2019 nomination for attorney general to the full Senate. The hearing was also disrupted by protesters decrying Sessions\u2019 civil rights record.\n\nThe intrusion of protesters into the hearing gives a clue as Democrats\u2019 motives for ramping up opposition to Trump\u2019s picks, from cabinet nominees to an expected filibuster of Gorsuch, the Federal Appeals Court judge who the president nominated to the Supreme Court on Tuesday night: Their voter base is furious.\n\nAlready mad about an election in which Trump won the presidency despite a decisive popular vote loss, Democrats\u2019 anger only surged as Trump rolled out cabinet picks that, at times, seemed intended to provoke them. He wants to place a climate change denier at the helm of the Environmental Protection Agency, and an advocate of abolishing the minimum wage at the Labor Department. His nominee to run the Department of Education has no background in public education aside from longstanding support of plans to privatize it.\n\nHundreds of thousands of marchers advocating women\u2019s rights descended on the capital just 24 hours after Trump was sworn in. Seven days later, when the administration announced an executive order banning refugees from entering the country and restricting travel from seven majority-Muslim nations, mass protests erupted in the streets of major American cities.\n\nProminent activists began delivering the message to Democrats in no uncertain terms: the only acceptable response to the Trump presidency is resistance.\n\nBen Wikler, Washington director of the liberal group Moveon.org, told Real Clear Politics that Democrats who don\u2019t fight back against Trump will face a \u201cfirestorm\u201d of criticism. \u201cThe anti-Trump resistance is going to make the Tea Party seem like a tempest in a teapot,\u201d he added.\n\nThere were plenty of high profile vows to mount primary challenges against any Democrats who offer support or cover to Trump on nominees like Sessions or Gorsuch.\n\nSenate Dems, let's be very clear: You will filibuster & block this SC nom or we will find a true progressive and primary u in next election. \u2014 Michael Moore (@MMFlint) February 1, 2017\n\nAnd the partisan warfare seems only likely to escalate.

Like any good drama, it will be packed with soaring soliloquies and moments of low humor.\n\nBut whether Gorsuch is ultimately confirmed or not, the story will end with one of the two major parties claiming that they have been grossly mistreated, insisting that permanent damage has been done to the structure of American democracy.\n\nRelated: Why Trump\u2019s Treasury Pick Wants to Increase the Power of the IRS\n\nGorsuch, a widely respected jurist who sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Denver, is pro-life and pro-religious liberty. He is seen at least as conservative as the late Justice Antonin Scalia, whose seat he will fill. His confirmation will bring the court back to the same right-of-center balance that existed prior to Scalia\u2019s death.\n\nBut Democrats have long signaled that they view the seat as \u201cstolen\u201d because of the extraordinary refusal of Senate Republicans to even consider former president Barack Obama\u2019s nominee for the court, Judge Merrick Garland, a moderate who was viewed by partisans on both sides of the aisle as an exceptionally well-qualified candidate.\n\nFor almost a year, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other senior Republicans in the chamber refused to move forward on Garland\u2019s nomination, claiming that because the primary campaigns had already started, the next president should choose the next chief justice. But now they are calling on Democrats to quickly approve Gorsuch who had been approved unanimously by the Senate when he was appointed to the 10th Circuit.\n\nMcConnell, who tortured precedent and fact to construct an argument that Obama was not entitled to name a Supreme Court justice in his final year in office, is now arguing that because Trump is in his first term, he deserves more deference than Republicans offered Obama in his last.\n\n\u201cI hope members of the Senate will again show him fair consideration and respect the result of the recent election with an up-or-down vote on his nomination, just like the Senate treated the four first-term nominees of Presidents Clinton and Obama,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Immigration and Obamacare Policies Could Trigger a GOP Backlash\n\nBut senior Senate Democrats are not in a forgiving mood, a fact they signaled by refusing Trump\u2019s invitation to attend the announcement of Gorsuch\u2019s nomination at the White House last night. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York promised \u201cexhaustive\u201d inquiries into his record of legal decisions.\n\n\u201cNow more than ever, we need a Supreme Court Justice who is independent, eschews ideology, who will preserve our democracy, protect fundamental rights, and will stand up to a President who has already shown a willingness to bend the Constitution,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nHe added, \u201cGiven his record, I have very serious doubts about Judge Gorsuch\u2019s ability to meet this standard. Judge Gorsuch has repeatedly sided with corporations over working people, demonstrated hostility toward women\u2019s rights, and most troubling, hewed to an ideological approach to jurisprudence that makes me skeptical that he can be a strong, independent Justice on the Court.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats and liberal advocacy groups aren\u2019t even waiting for hearings. In fact, they didn\u2019t wait for a name before demanding that the party goes to war over the nomination and block Gorsuch with a filibuster.\n\nRelated: Trump Moves Quickly on Pledge to Contain Drug Prices \u2013 but Can He Do It?\n\nOn the right, from Trump on down, Republicans are calling on McConnell to use the \u201cnuclear option\u201d -- changing the Senate\u2019s rules to allow debate on a Supreme Court nominee to be shut down by a simple majority rather than the 60-vote threshold. His predecessor, Democrat Harry Reid, used the nuclear option to confirm Obama judicial nominees obstructed by Republicans, but would not go so far as eliminating the filibuster for Supreme Court picks.\n\nBoth parties in the Senate face some tricky decisions.\n\nTo successfully filibuster Gorsuch, the Democrats would need 41 of the 48 members of their caucus to agree to block a vote on him. However, some are going to be hesitant or outright unwilling to go along. Between actual Democrats and the two Independents who caucus with them, the minority will have a combined 25 seats to defend in the 2018 election, representing more than half of their strength in the Senate. Many of those seats are in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, and Indiana, which Trump carried in the 2016 election.\n\nWest Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, whose state also went for Trump, has already signaled that he will not support a filibuster.\n\nRelated: The Top Threat to the US Economy? A Trump Trade War\n\nIf faced with Democratic obstruction, Republicans will feel pressure to do away with the filibuster for Supreme Court judges entirely. That will be its own kind of struggle because the party was unanimous in its cries of rage and betrayal when Reid nuked it over lower court judges in 2013.\n\nMcConnell, in need of a 51-vote majority (and with Vice President Mike Pence able to weigh in and break a tie in the Republicans\u2019 favor), cannot afford to lose more than two members of his caucus if he opts to try to force through a rule change. It\u2019s possible, though by no means certain, that some members of the body with long memories of being in the minority, will be unwilling to strip Democrats of one of the few levers of power they control, knowing that the pendulum always swings back eventually.\n\nEither way, this will end badly.\n\nIf Gorsuch is strong-armed onto the court, a very large segment of the Democratic base will view him as illegitimate -- the occupant of a \u201cstolen\u201d chair -- and will question any conservative rulings from the court that relied on his vote.\n\nIf Gorsuch has his nomination blocked, Republicans will howl about Democrats\u2019 intransigence, and many will seek ways to further limit the power of the minority in the future, increasing pressure on any holdouts to take the more extreme position on the nuclear option in the future.\n\nIt\u2019s very hard to see an ending to this play in which both sides emerge satisfied that their rights have been respected."}, {"date": "2017/02/01", "title": "Could Trump\u2019s Attack on Sanctuary Cities Trigger a Tax Revolt?", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/02/01/Could-Trump-s-Attack-Sanctuary-Cities-Trigger-Tax-Revolt", "text": "California is leading scores of cities and states fighting back against the Trump Administration\u2019s executive order seeking to punish them financially for providing safe havens for illegal immigrants threatened with deportation.\n\nJust yesterday, the city of San Francisco filed suit in U.S. District Court in Northern California challenging the legality of last week\u2019s executive order.\n\nRelated: Trump Cracks Down on Sanctuary Cities \u2013 and It Could Cost Them Billions\n\nTrump has directed the federal government to withhold federal grants and assistance to \u201csanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement agents in identifying and detaining illegal immigrants in their custody.\"\n\nThe lawsuit represents the first legal action brought against the Trump administration by a city being targeted for the potential loss of billions of dollars in federal assistance because of their benign, protective treatment of millions of illegal immigrants living throughout the country.\n\nCities, including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco that offer strong protection to illegal immigrants have the most at stake. San Francisco, for example, receives more than $1.2 billion annually in federal funding, most of which goes to health care, nutrition, and other safety net programs, according to USA Today.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s executive order is not only unconstitutional, it\u2019s un-American,\u201d San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said in a statement. \u201cThat is why we must stand up and oppose it.

We must be the \u2018guardians of our democracy\u2019 that President Obama urged us all to be in his farewell address.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump Era Begins with Moves Against Regulations, Obamacare\n\nTrump is seeking to increase pressure on illegal immigrants and the cities and states protecting them as part of a larger strategy for tightening border security, building a 2,000-mile wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and rounding up undocumented workers with criminal records for deportation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to strip federal grant money from the sanctuary states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants,\u201d White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters last week. \u201cThe American people are no longer going to have to be forced to subsidize this disregard for our laws.\u201d\n\nBut California, with roughly 2.5 million illegal immigrants out of a total population of 39 million, is fighting back to defend the immigration population and protect the estimated $40 billion to $50 billion it receives annually in federal grants and aid. While the administration hasn\u2019t specified where the cuts will be made, community law enforcement, crime victims assistance and first-responder grants from the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security are likely targets.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Jerry Brown and the state\u2019s Democratic-controlled General Assembly are mounting a sophisticated legal battle aimed at tying up Trump\u2019s Justice Department in a \u201cmyriad\u201d of unending and draining court cases, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nRelated: Some Sanctuary City Officials Will Stonewall Trump Over Criminal Deportations\n\nState officials believe they have legal precedent on their side. And the General Assembly recently retained Eric Holder, the former attorney general in the Obama administration to advise the state on legal tactics. Officials believe that Trump and his advisers would be on \u201cshaky legal ground\u201d attempting to cut off any federal funds allocated for anything other than law enforcement, and even then it would be politically risky to strip away funds from local police and crime victims, according to the newspaper.\n\nOthers who are up in arms over Trump\u2019s assault on sanctuary cities are calling for retaliatory action against the new Republican administration that would hit the government in its pocketbook.\n\nTake for example former state Assembly speaker Willie L. Brown Jr., who recently called for a tax rebellion of sorts against the federal government to protest Trump\u2019s executive order.\n\nKPIX 5 TV in San Francisco reported that officials are looking for funds that flow from California to Washington that could be used to effectively offset the potential loss of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of federal funds.\n\n\u201cCalifornia could very well become an organized non-payer,\u201d Brown said in an interview with the station aired last Sunday. \u201cThey could recommend non-compliance with the federal tax code.\u201d\n\nRelated: Is this How Trump Will Get Mexico to \u2018Pay\u2019 for His Wall?\n\nBrown didn\u2019t provide specifics for what he has in mind, and state and federal tax experts say they are scratching their heads to figure out what that retaliatory action might entail.\n\nAbout $205 billion flows annually from California to the federal government, but that represents individual and business federal taxes paid to the U.S. Treasury. And billions more go for federal excise and gasoline taxes, but those too aren\u2019t under the control of the state government. So except for a few miscellaneous payments that may go from Sacramento to DC, the state has little leverage over the federal government, experts say.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see much in the way of what the state government could stop in terms of going to Washington, D.C.,\u201d Joe Henchman, vice president for state projects at the Tax Foundation,\u201d said in an interview. \u201cCertainly the biggest leverage California has is that they pay $205 billion a year in federal taxes. But the state government is not involved in that. That\u2019s money paid directly by Californians to the federal government.\u201d\n\nHenchman and others see just one other alternative \u2013- a popular uprising by California residents who stage a major protest by withholding their federal tax payments. It would be a sagebrush revolution of sorts, akin to previous tax protests over the years to object to excess government spending or U.S. warfare in Vietnam and the Middle East. But that would be a risky venture that would run afoul of the U.S. tax code and the Internal Revenue Service \u2013 and would almost certainly invite steep penalties and potential criminal action.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure citizens would risk jail sentences for that,\u201d said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto. \u201cSo you would be asking Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg not to pay their federal income taxes.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/02/01", "title": "After Three Years of Extreme Vetting, I Nearly Gave Up on My American Dream", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/02/01/After-Three-Years-Extreme-Vetting-I-Nearly-Gave-My-American-Dream", "text": "I am an Iraqi Muslim who is about to become an American citizen. In July 2011, I boarded a flight to New York City, seated next to an old Iraqi couple. When we landed at JFK, the scene was quite different from what it is today.\n\nAs soon I got off the plane, an Asian-American employee at the International Organization for Migration asked me to wait with the same Iraqi couple I traveled with from Amman, Jordan. Several minutes passed, and then she took me inside the terminal avoiding the long entry lines where hundreds of Americans and foreigners were waiting to be processed by customs.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Nixonian Loyalty Test With Travel Ban: Another Display of Incompetence\n\n\u201cRefugee!\u201d she screamed at anyone who tried to stop us. Finally, after passing through several side doors without question, I was handled by one official for a few minutes and then admitted to the United States without even being searched or having my bag searched.\n\nThe whole thing took 20 minutes or maybe a bit more. Nevertheless, these 20 minutes ended a lengthy and thorough three-year vetting process during which I nearly lost hope in the American dream.\n\nI applied for resettlement in the U.S. as part of the so-called Kennedy bill. In 2007, after many Iraqi and Afghan nationals who worked with the American military in Iraq and Afghanistan as interpreters were killed, the late Senator Edward Kennedy stepped in to help. He sponsored a bill that assigned a section in the defense budget to resettle in the U.S. those of us who worked for U.S. entities in Iraq and Afghanistan for a year or more, along with our families, to protect us from retaliation and to show gratitude.\n\nBy the end of December 2016, the Mideast interpreters who were resettled in the U.S. numbered 155,000 Iraqis and 38,000 Afghans. Every one of us passed through multiple screening processes that included at least two personal interviews, a medical check, and a thorough security background check. The process takes no less than a year and could stretch to several years.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Immigration and Obamacare Policies Could Trigger a GOP Backlash\n\nI applied for resettlement after working as a journalist for The New York Times in Iraq. My focus as a journalist was corruption, and for that, I was sued, threatened and harassed by the Iraqi government and its insurgent affiliates. I also lost my father when he was killed by al-Qaeda in Iraq (now ISIS) in western Baghdad as part of the terror group\u2019s effort to wipe out members of the Shiite majority in Iraq. My family and I were also displaced from our home.\n\nNevertheless, my vetting process took three years, and it only ended after my former colleague, the late journalist Anthony Shadid, who twice won the Pulitzer Prize for covering Iraq, and the late senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, personally intervened on my behalf. Also, several press protection non-profits like the Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters without Borders and the International Press Institute vouched for me. My family members had waited another four years before they were admitted in late 2015.\n\nOnce in the U.S., I worked like many other refugees in several subsistence jobs in New York. Once, I worked at Dish Network answering phones as a customer service agent. It was a horrible job where I was constantly yelled at. But I made some friends, and I paid my bills. The friends I made there eased the loneliness that I felt in the America. After more than a year in that job, I quit and started writing again. Then, I eventually found my way to journalism again. I married an American woman, and we had a son. I lived in New York and in Kansas, and I was able to know both the lifestyles of the East coast and of the Midwest and the political preferences associated with each.\n\nThe very liberal environment in New York, where minorities -- including devout Muslims -- are welcomed and encouraged to participate in all forms of social life is in contrast to Kansas where minorities are just a small portion of the white Christian-dominated population. I was shocked to see how popular Halal food is in New York City. I had to explain many times to Americans that Halal food is not a cuisine, but a religious imprimatur like kosher. I was also surprised to see those religious South Asian Muslims who dress like Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban walking freely in New York\u2019s streets after attending services in local mosques.\n\nRelated: Extreme Muslim Immigration Ban Suggests Bannon Is Running the White House\n\nLater on, I knew that while most of these Muslims were never harassed by law enforcement authorities or the FBI, the New York police department spied on some of them and the FBI engaged in \u201csting operations\u201d luring them to join al-Qaeda or ISIS in response to recruitment calls by agents posing as terrorists.\n\nWhat I experienced when I entered the land of the free has changed now with the election of President Donald Trump. Even before the new administration took office, the flood of millions of refugees from the Middle East to Europe, followed by a series of ISIS orchestrated attacks in Paris, and other European cities have somehow branded all refugees as potential terrorists in the eyes of some Americans. Then came the attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando, which were inspired by ISIS. The stage was set for a new era of Islamophobia, similar to the one following 9/11. Trump seized the moment.\n\nMany Americans conflated the European migration crisis and the terror attacks which took place afterward in Europe with refugees admitted to the U.S. The refugees who went to Europe were mainly people without papers who illegally landed on Europe\u2019s shores by boats. There was no vetting process in Europe. That is not the case with the refugees admitted to the U.S. who have already passed the most extreme vetting process.\n\nWhat happened in Europe also revealed incompetence within the ranks of the French and Belgium security and intelligence services that allowed ISIS operatives to travel back and forth, conspire and conduct the attacks without detection. This is not the case in the U.S. where the FBI is much more alert to terror plots. Lastly, there is a demographic factor involved. In Europe, Muslims are the second largest religion in several countries. In France for instance, Muslims make up to 10 percent of the population.\n\nRelated: Trump Pratfalls Onto the World Stage Targeting Muslims, Mexico, and Iraq\u2019s Oil\n\nWhile it is the right and indeed the duty of every government to defend its people, the temporary travel ban imposed by Trump on citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries will most likely be ineffective and counterproductive. Take Iraq, for example. Few Iraqis who were admitted to the U.S. have been involved in acts of terrorism because all had to go through the same intensive security background check that I went through.\n\nIn fact, all refugees admitted to the U.S. go through these procedures. The other important point is that almost all the Iraqi refugees are actually people who risked their lives while helping the United States in Iraq. Many of them lost relatives in acts of revenge against them by anti-American insurgent groups. Arresting them in the airports after their tragic and lengthy journey to the safety of the U.S. is a blow to American patriotism and will send the wrong message to the world that the U.S. punishes its friends instead of helping them.\n\nPerhaps more important, at least 80 percent of Iraqis are actually natural enemies of ISIS and al-Qaeda because they are either Shiites who are considered heretics by ISIS, Kurds who admire and appreciate the U.S. policy in the Middle East, or minorities like Christians and Yazidis.\n\nAmong those Iraqis who can\u2019t enter the U.S. now are a group of Iraqi Air Force pilots who should be trained on flying the F-16, the U.S. trained chief of the counter-terrorism service in Iraq whose soldiers defeated ISIS in every battle since 2014, and my good friend Lukman Faily, the former Iraqi ambassador to the U.S.\n\nWhile the U.S. has an obligation to admit the Iraqis and Afghans who helped the country during two conflicts, the Syrian case is different. Nevertheless, the U.S. has a moral responsibility to aid the Syrian refugees because of the horror and suffering they have experienced. America also has a legal responsibility because the U.S. is a signatory of the 1951 convention that states, \u201cA refugee should not be returned to a country where they face serious threats to their life or freedom.\u201d\n\nThese so-called extreme vetting delays may not last long because of the legal battles they have generated. Nevertheless, they may have damaged America\u2019s national security for years to come. After I received advice from some American friends asking me not to use any airport or airplane until further notice, I suddenly started to identify with what Jews felt in the early days of Nazi Germany.\n\nNote: Riyadh Mohammed is in Wichita, Kansas today for his final American citizenship interview.

We have no choice, for Medicare and Medicaid, we have to get prices way down.\u201d\n\nWhile providing few specifics with reporters and cameras in the room, Trump outlined what is likely to be the heart of his strategy for overhauling U.S. prescription drug industry practices: Jawboning companies to moderate future hikes in drug costs under the threat of government sanction; encouraging competition through government deregulation and tax breaks; pressuring multinational drug companies to bring jobs back to the U.S., and cutting the time it takes the FDA to approve new drugs by months or even years.\n\n\"We\u2019re going to be cutting regulation at a level nobody's ever seen before,\" Trump said in the meeting with executives. \"You can\u2019t get approval for the plant and then you can\u2019t get approval to make the drug, other than that you\u2019re doing fantastic,\" he said.\n\nRelated: How Big Pharma Lobbyists Keep Medicare Drug Prices High\n\nReforming the FDA \u201cto put greater focus on the need of patients for new and innovative medical products\u201d was a key provision of Trump\u2019s campaign health plan. Trump said today that too often, the FDA has been overly cautious in approving new drugs desperately needed by sick patients \u2013 sometimes resulting in unnecessary deaths.\n\nCongress last November approved the so-called 21st Century Cures legislation that earmarks $6.3 billion of biomedical research, opioid abuse prevention and support for the FDA in overseeing the safety of drugs. The new law also contains a handful of provisions to ease the requirements for drug manufacturers seeking government approval to sell their products. Trump says he wants to go much further.\n\n\"You're going to get your prices either approved or not approved,\" Trump told the executives. \"But it's going to be a quick process. It's not going to take 15 years.\" (It's not clear what Trump meant by prices being approved since the government does not negotiate drug prices.)\n\nWhether it all turns out to be political window dressing or a serious reform effort remains to be seen. Much of what Trump said was more rhetorical flourishes than specifics. And little can be done to flesh out his proposals until Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), Trump\u2019s choice to head the Department of Health and Human Services, and a new head of the Food and Drug Administration are in place.\n\nHowever, as Trump demonstrated with his initial flurry of executive orders on Obamacare, immigration and building a wall along the southern border, he is determined to quickly turn campaign promises into concrete policy.\n\nSome of the drug company CEOs expressed interest in working with the new White House on drug pricing issues as the meeting was beginning. And the National Coalition of Health Care, a group of dozens of medical groups, insurers and consumer advocates, hailed the meeting as an important first step in addressing the drug pricing issue.\n\n\u201cWe applaud President Trump for making the out-of-control prices of prescription drugs a priority in his Administration,\u201d John Rother, the president and CEO of the coalition, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIncreased competition in the prescription drug market, real transparency into the drivers of drug prices, and ensuring that prices are linked to the value they provide are what will deliver lower prices for hardworking American families,\u201d he added. \u201cWe look forward to working with Congress and the Administration to ensure that all patients are able to obtain lifesaving medications at prices they can afford.\u201d\n\nRelated: Two Big Reasons Prescription Drug Prices Are So Much Higher in the US\n\nPrescription drug prices have risen at a double-digit rate in recent years and are projected to continue to rise at that clip this year. Over the past two years, the country has been wracked by outrageous cases of price gouging by pharmaceutical companies by as much as 1,000 percent to 5,000 percent for some life-saving drugs.\n\nSome of the worst offenders include Mylan Pharmaceutical, maker of the EpiPen drug dispenser for allergic children; Gilead Sciences, a manufacturer of two biometric wonder drugs for treating the Hepatitis-C virus, and Turing Pharmaceutical, formerly headed by Martin Shkreli, the notorious hedge fund manager. None of those companies were invited to the White House session.\n\nTrump first highlighted his concerns about skyrocketing drug prices in September 2015 when he lashed out at Shkreli for raising the price of a 62-year old drug from $13.50 to $750 per pill. \"He looks like a spoiled brat to me,\" Trump told reporters at a press conference in South Carolina.\n\nPerhaps as a shrewd bargaining tactic going into his meeting with drug company CEOs today, the former billionaire real estate businessman held back on his toughest ideas that were aired during the campaign. That may have been a bargaining tactic to use as leverage in extracting future concessions.\n\nRelated: The Feds Finally Make a Move on Soaring Drug Prices\n\nOne idea would be to allow the importation of cheaper drugs from Canada to enhance competition. Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton both advocated that change, despite strong opposition from the drug industry.\n\nAnother would permit Medicare officials to negotiate down prices with major drug companies by eliminating a non-negotiation ban contained in the 2003 Medicare Part D drug legislation. That prohibition provided major pharmaceutical companies with billions of dollars in windfall profits.\n\nSome analysts say Medicare, the premier health program for the elderly, could save more than a half trillion dollars over the coming decade by tough negotiations with drug companies.\n\nPhRMA and its long-time GOP allies on Capitol Hill have fought for years to preserve that ban on negotiating drug prices for the national health care program for seniors and are digging in again to block efforts to repeal the restriction.\n\nRelated: Trump Might Adopt a Democratic Plan to Crack Down on Drug Prices\n\nHowever, Trump says he is determined to shake up the status quo \u2013 even at the expense of his Republican allies on Capitol Hill.

The hallmark of this was a reorientation of the distribution of national income: Corporate profits (and thus, stock prices) surged to record highs while wages stagnated and the cost of living rose.\n\nRelated: The Top Threat to the US Economy? A Trump Trade War\n\nIf Trump continues with his unique mix of nationalist populism, this trend should reverse. Stocks could suffer along with profits; but wages, driven by a reduction in labor supply (fewer immigrants, both illegal and visa workers) and an increase in demand for American-made products (driven by trade barriers and \"Twitter shaming\" of CEOs to invest in U.S. factories).\n\nTrump is also using various tools, from executive orders to tweets, to pressure individual companies to lower their prices. He has taken on Lockheed Martin (LMT) and its F-35 program. General Dynamics (GD) has been put on notice that the U.S. Navy needs new submarines at a lower cost. Automakers have been scrambling to tout their plans for investment and hiring in the United States. And drug makers have been warned they are getting away with \"murder\" and that the U.S. government could start bidding on medicine, driving down drug prices.\n\nAdding to the change in investor sentiment are reports that Trump's tax reform plans \u2014 Wall Street had focused most on the chances of a corporate tax cut and a possible repatriation holiday \u2014 could be delayed until 2018.\n\nRelated: Trump Says Costs Be Damned as He Moves on Major Defense Buildup\n\nThe sudden realization that Trump may not be as beneficial to the big business establishment and thus Wall Street is coming at a time of unique vulnerability for stocks, which are coming off of one of the quietest four-year runs in market history and the lowest volatility December since 1900.\n\nYears of aggressive monetary policy stimulus have kept stock prices inflated.

Higher labor costs resulting from Trump policies will pinch corporate profitability at a time when revenue growth has stalled (look at the likes of Apple (AAPL) and IBM (IBM)).

It eclipses the 44 percent who were worried about global economic weakness early in 2016 \u2014 concerns that sent markets into a nosedive.\n\n\"Investors can get behind pro-growth policies and can't and won't support protectionist policies,\" Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities, said in response to the survey. \"Trade wars, like all wars, end negatively for all.\"\n\nThe contrast between respondents' views on trade and other economic policies of Trump is stark. Seventy-five to 95 percent of participants, who include economists, fund managers and strategists, have positive views of Trump's plans to cut individual and business taxes and deregulate the economy. But 83 percent have negative views of his trade agenda.\n\n\"Trashing the Mexican economy with tariffs and other bad policies is like throwing rocks through your neighbors' windows, thereby reducing the value of YOUR home,\" wrote Robert Fry, chief economist at Robert Fry Economics.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s What the US Imports From Mexico \u2013 and Who Would Pay Trump\u2019s 20% Tax\n\nIndeed, 58 percent say Trump's relations with Mexico will lead to less growth for both countries and 53 percent say the same about China. And respondents believe overwhelmingly that China, Mexico, Canada and Japan will retaliate if the U.S. imposes import tariffs on those countries.\n\nRobert Brusca, chief economist at Fact and Opinion Economics, was one of the few to see any upside in Trump's trade policies. He said they were a \"danger but an investment in the future.\" Brusca sees the global trade system as unfair to the U.S. \"We have not had the benefits of free trade, and we have less to lose from this Trump gambit than most people think,\" he said. \"I suspect Trump wants leverage more than tariffs.\"\n\nRespondents say the possibility of protectionism is confusing forecasts for both growth and monetary policy. \"It will be very difficult for the FOMC to gauge the impact of any rate increases with the possibility of simultaneous protectionist trade policies and large deficit spending,'' said John Donaldson, director of fixed income at Haverford Trust.\n\nThat may be one reason why growth forecasts are far from the 4 percent Trump suggested his policies could ignite. Respondents on average see growth rising 2.5 percent in 2017 and 2.75 percent in 2018. Both estimates are higher than before the election but only about 25 basis points for this year and 40 basis points for next year.\n\nRelated: What a Trade War With China Could Do to the Economy\n\n\"The president is very hard to handicap, and I don't really know how much he can get done when Congress must be dealt with to make the kind of sweeping changes he proposes,\" said Kevin Giddis, head of fixed income capital markets at Raymond James Financial. \"While the trend for interest rates is up, I wouldn't be surprised if something happens or doesn't happen that could turn the cart on its head.\"\n\nBut most do not see a recession. The probability of the U.S. entering a recession remains at a low level of 18.5 percent.\n\nWhen it comes to Fed rate hikes in 2017, three looks to be the charm.\n\nThe CNBC Fed Survey shows respondents expecting three rate hikes this year, up from two before the elections, and the same number as the average Federal Reserve official. That's a rare agreement; survey respondents for the past several years have been more dovish than the outlook from Fed officials and they've been right.\n\nRelated: It Looks Like Trump Is Serious About Starting a Trade War With China\n\nRespondents, however, seem out of sync with financial markets, which appeared to be priced for just two hikes this year. A 43 percent plurality see the next rate hike coming in June, but some 53 percent say it could happen in either March, April or May.\n\nThe Fed Funds rate is forecast to rise to 1.3 percent this year and 2.2 percent in 2018. But James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, thinks the Fed could do more this year because he sees more inflation. \"I believe a potential wild card for 2017 is not only how many times will the Fed raise the target funds rate but the possibility that they may opt for a 50 basis point single move,\" Paulsen said.\n\nCompared to the December survey, more respondents look for an earlier wind down to the Fed's balance sheet. Nearly 40 percent say the Fed could begin to reduce its $4 trillion balance sheet this year, up from 27 percent in December. And just 13 percent now say the Fed will never reduce the balance sheet, down from 31 percent.\n\nAbout three-quarters say Trump is unlikely to reappoint Janet Yellen as Fed chair, with Stanford economics professor John Taylor seen as the leading candidate for her replacement.\n\nConcern about trade also seems to be muting the outlook for stocks. The S&P is seen closing the year around 3 percent higher, but the 10-year Treasury yield is seen rising to nearly 3 percent by the end of the year. The policies of the new administration are seen to be mostly responsible for the market rally, but 56 percent say the market is too optimistic about the outlook for policies from the new administration.\n\nThis article originally appeared in on CNBC.

On Monday, she released a memo to federal prosecutors informing them that in her judgment, the executive order banning refugees from entering the country and restricting travel from seven Muslim-majority countries was not constitutional. She instructed them not to defend it in court.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Who Wins With Trump\u2019s Order to Slash Regulations\n\nThe memo outlined her responsibility to assure that the Department\u2019s actions are legal and \u201cconsistent with this institution\u2019s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cAt present, I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful.\u201d As long as she remained acting AG, she said, DOJ \u201cwill not present arguments in defense of the Executive Order.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, she did not remain acting AG for very long.

They are now learning that the process of governing isn\u2019t nearly as forgiving as the process of campaigning.\n\nRelated: Extreme Muslim Immigration Ban Suggests Bannon Is Running the White House\n\nThe immigration order was written with little or no input from the agencies that would be required to enforce it, and it was signed with no advance warning. Even a cursory attempt to take the temperature of the agencies on the front lines of immigration enforcement might have enabled the Trump administration to avoid significant embarrassment, but even that most basic step wasn\u2019t taken.\n\nThat\u2019s why, instead of quietly replacing Yates with Boente on, say, Friday -- something that administration had every ability to do -- they were forced to take emergency action on Monday.\n\nThe same lack of preparation is reflected in a stinging draft of a memo dissenting to the executive order that was signed by more than 100 career foreign service officers and made public on Monday morning. Again, early steps that might have tempered that reaction were not taken, and White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer was reduced to demanding that they \u201ceither get with the program or they can go.\u201d\n\nSetting aside the merits of the executive order as a legal or even moral matter, what we\u2019re seeing here with regard to its rollout and implementation looks less like Nixonian malevolence and more like the basic incompetence of a new administration learning the hard way that it cannot govern the way it campaigned."}, {"date": "2017/01/31", "title": "Trump\u2019s Immigration and Obamacare Policies Could Trigger a GOP Backlash ", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/31/Trump-s-Immigration-and-Obamacare-Policies-Could-Trigger-GOP-Backlash", "text": "The \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement began to fade after Donald Trump became the GOP presidential nominee, and it shriveled up when Donald Trump claimed victory over Democratic Hillary Clinton and \u2018establishment\u2019 Republican naysayers climbed aboard the Trump train.\n\nWith the Republicans in control of the White House and both chambers of Commerce for the first time in a decade, the GOP\u2019s agenda of repealing and replacing Obamacare, ramming through major tax relief, curtailing regulations and construction of a security wall along the 2,000-mile southern border all seemed like a slam dunk.\n\nRelated: Extreme Muslim Immigration Ban Suggests Bannon Is Running the White House\n\nLittle more than ten days into the new tumultuous Trump administration, small fissures are beginning to develop within the party that could threaten important parts of the GOP agenda in the coming months.

Collins, for example, said that \"religious tests serve no useful purpose in the immigration process and run contrary to our American values.\"\n\nFifteen other Republican senators, including McConnell, the majority leader, and Foreign Relations Committee Chair Bob Corker of Tennessee, expressed concern or reservations about the way it was handled, according to The Hill.

However, the Republicans hold an overwhelming 247 to 188 vote majority in the House, and Ryan should have relatively little trouble holding his conservative caucus together to advance the Trump agenda and fend off Democratic assaults.\n\nBut it is a far different picture in the Senate, where McConnell and the Republicans hold a narrow 52 to 48 majority over the Democrats and can ill afford to suffer any defections. Much has been made about the GOP\u2019s plan to utilize special budget reconciliation rules to push through a repeal of major provisions of Obamacare with a simple majority.\n\nRelated: Did Trump Really Just Slash the Cost of the F-35?\n\nUsually, it takes a 60-vote supermajority to cut off a filibuster and pass a major bill. Under reconciliation, however, the party in power needs just 51 votes to pass a budgets measure that eviscerates key subsidies, tax provisions and mandates on individuals and businesses. However, if just three Republicans voted against the budget, that would stop the Obamacare repeal effort in its tracks.\n\nGOP party unity will also be critical in adopting Obamacare replacement legislation. That\u2019s because any plan advanced by the GOP would not be afforded special treatment under reconciliation rules and would need a super-majority of 60 votes to get anything done. That means McConnell and his lieutenants will somehow have to keep their party members n line while rounding up at least eight Democratic votes.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York has said Democrats will not help the Republicans pass a replacement plan if they forge ahead and repeal Obamacare without an acceptable replacement in hand. What\u2019s more, Republicans will need Democratic help down the road on a broad array of spending measures -\u2013 including Trump\u2019s proposed defense buildup \u2013- and meeting an April 28 deadline for averting another government shutdown.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 most immediate concern is fighting Trump\u2019s immigration executive order and they spent the weekend rallying opposition and resources to help refugees and migrants caught up in the crisis. Schumer fought back tears in announcing plans to introduce a bill Monday evening to stop the order.\n\nRelated: The 10 Most Expensive Weapons in the Pentagon\u2019s Arsenal\n\nMcConnell and other Republicans blocked the Democrats effort to bring the bill to the floor, but Democrats say the fight over it served to put Republicans on the spot. Last night, a large crowd of Democrats turned out for a protest in front of the Supreme Court.\n\nWhit Ayres, a veteran Republican pollster and political adviser, said that while Trump and the Republicans may have gotten off to a rocky start, the looming battle between the Republicans and Democrats over Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee will soon dominate the news. Trump is scheduled to announce his choice to succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia on Tuesday evening.\n\n\u201cThere will always be things that a President will do that will cause some disagreement [within the party], but it\u2019s much too early to be talking about any split. The real question is whether the Democrats will split over a Supreme Court nominee. There clearly are as many divisions in the Democratic party as the Republican party right now.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/01/31", "title": "In the Trump Administration, Credibility May be a Problem", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/01/31/Trump-Administration-Credibility-May-be-Problem", "text": "As a department chair at a university, you learn that a promise from the Dean or anyone else in the administration is good for about five years. That\u2019s approximately how long Deans last, on average, and when a new Dean arrives past commitments are not necessarily honored. Promises from administrators are not credible no matter how much assurance is given that a commitment is permanent.\n\nPoliticians are subject to the same type of credibility problem that plagues academic administrators. To what extent can Obamacare, or anything else, be regarded as a permanent change in government policy? A new president or a new Congress can potentially undo any legislation, administrative rule, or anything else enacted in the past.\n\nRelated: Trump Pratfalls Onto the World Stage Targeting Muslims, Mexico, and Iraq\u2019s Oil\n\nBut politicians have an additional credibility problem over and above their inability to make long-run commitments. Little of what politicians say can be trusted even during the years they are in office. And with Trump saying whatever comes to his mind, or whatever a particular audience wants to hear, his erratic behavior, and his tendency to contradict himself, who knows what to believe? Nothing is credible until it happens, and even then it might be reversed.\n\nCredibility is essential in both monetary and fiscal policy. It is easily lost, and once it is gone it takes a long time to rebuild. Monetary policy provides a good example. During the inflation problems that plagued the 1970s, the Fed promised again and again that it would get the situation under control. Then the next year inflation would be even higher than it was before.\n\nPeople quickly learned that the Fed\u2019s promises about inflation, and by association anything else, were meaningless. It\u2019s like a spouse who promises to be home at a particularly time, and then consistently shows up hours late. After awhile, those promises mean nothing. Even if the behavior does change it will take a long time for trust \u2013 credibility \u2013 to be restored and a lingering doubt may always be there.\n\nRelated: Extreme Muslim Immigration Ban Suggests Bannon Is Running the White House\n\nThe Fed finally began rebuilding its credibility when Volcker took control in 1979. The Fed tightened monetary policy under Volcker and that led to the 1982 recession. The Fed was heavily criticized, but its political independence allowed it to endure and the policy turned out to be a success. After that, during what is known as the Great Moderation from the early 1980s through 2007, inflation continued to fall and it eventually leveled off around the Fed\u2019s inflation target.\n\nThe Fed had finally gained credibility about its inflation promises, but it took decades. Even now many people \u2013- especially those who remember the 1970s \u2013 do not fully trust the Fed to keep inflation under wraps. All of the fears about out of control inflation hyped during the Great Recession testify to that (though in many cases the criticism leveled at the Fed was politically motivated).\n\nWhy should we care about the credibility of monetary and fiscal policymakers? For fiscal policy, economic theory tells us that temporary changes in government spending will have a larger impact on the economy than permanent changes. But if Congress announces that an increase in spending is a temporary measure that will be reversed when the recession ends (we promise!), will people believe it?\n\nIf not, if most people believe that once government spending is put into place it never goes away (which is a myth), then fiscal stimulus will not be as effective as it could be. Conversely, if the government announces a permanent reduction in the size of government, will anyone believe that whatever cuts are made are truly permanent? If not, if people believe that cuts to spending will likely be restored at some point, perhaps when the other party takes back control of government then the cuts will have a more severe impact on the economy than they would otherwise.\n\nRelated: How the GOP Could Wipe Out Federal Regulations in One Easy Step\n\nCredibility is just as important, if not more so, for the Fed. When the Fed has credibility, its ability to keep inflation on target is enhanced. And if inflation does go up, credibility allows the Fed to bring it back down without creating a deep recession. I expect, but can\u2019t be sure, that when the time comes Trump will replace Janet Yellen with someone who is at least competent, though I will likely disagree strongly with his or her views on policy. But what will happen with the other six members of the Board of Governors?\n\nThere are currently two openings (Republicans refused to confirm Obama\u2019s nominees for these positions), and if recent history is any guide Trump, like Obama and Bush, will appoint most if not all of the Board by the time his term ends. Will he appoint people who are at least competent, or, like so many of Trump\u2019s other appointments to important government positions, will they be cronies with little or no experience who are being rewarded for their loyalty?\n\nWill they be politically independent or beholden to whatever monetary policy changes Trump wants? If they are both lacking in experience and unwilling to go against Trump\u2019s wishes, which seems to me a very real possibility, will anyone have confidence in the Fed? Will it be able to keep the credibility it worked so hard to establish and protect?\n\nRelated: Trump Just Blew His Chance to Renegotiate NAFTA\n\nI don\u2019t have much faith in Congress when it comes to fiscal policy (or anything else). The little faith I once had that Congress would at least set aside politics and do what\u2019s best for the economy during a severe economic crisis was shattered by Republican obstructionism during the Great Recession. But at least we\u2019ve always had a relatively politically independent Fed that kept its eye on what\u2019s best for the country rather than on winning the next election.\n\nThe Fed has made mistakes -- nobody and no institution is perfect -- but for the most part it\u2019s done an admirable job over the last few decades of managing monetary policy (its handling of regulatory policy is another matter). If Trump compromises the independence and competency of the Fed, we will lose the only effective policymaking body we have left, and the next recession will be more severe than it needs to be. We know who will be hurt the most if that happens, and it won\u2019t be the people still smiling about the huuuge tax cuts they got from Trump."}, {"date": "2017/01/30", "title": "Here\u2019s Who Wins With Trump\u2019s Order to Slash Regulations", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/30/Here-s-Who-Wins-Trump-s-Order-Slash-Regulations", "text": "President Trump on Monday morning signed an executive order, \u201cReducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs.\u201d The order appears to be a gift to the business community, which constantly complains of the burden of compliance with federal requirements.

But it promises no immediate disruption.\n\nRelated: Trump Says Costs Be Damned as He Moves on Major Defense Buildup\n\nThe headline elements of the new order are that federal agencies need to target two rules for elimination for every new rule they issue, and that the executive branch will move toward establishing a \u201cregulatory budget\u201d for federal agencies.\n\nWhile both of those steps might feel foreign to Washington, they\u2019d be pretty familiar in a number of other advanced Western democracies.\n\nThe executive order stipulates that, \u201cUnless prohibited by law, whenever an executive department or agency publicly proposes for notice and comment or otherwise promulgates a new regulation, it shall identify at least two existing regulations to be repealed.\u201d\n\nThe idea of a one-in, two-out rule for regulations is not a creation of the Trump administration, but is borrowed from other countries that use a similar method to assure that outdated or redundant requirements that impose a burden on people or businesses are actively sought out and eliminated. The United Kingdom, for example, instituted a similar requirement in 2013.\n\nRelated: Team Trump on Immigration Disruption: \u2018It\u2019s a Small Price to Pay\u2019\n\nThe executive order also contains the building blocks of a regulatory budget. It requires that for the remainder of 2017, the net incremental cost of the regulations federal agencies issue \u201cshall be no greater than zero, unless otherwise required by law or consistent with advice provided in writing by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.\u201d In other words, the cost of the new regulations must be less than the costs of those being eliminated.\n\nIn the following years, the OMB director will, on an annual basis \u201cidentify to agencies a total amount of incremental costs that will be allowed for each agency in issuing new regulations and repealing regulations for the next fiscal year. No regulations exceeding the agency's total incremental cost allowance will be permitted in that fiscal year, unless required by law or approved in writing by the Director.\u201d The order adds the warning that the annual budget could effectively be negative, requiring a net reduction in regulatory costs.\n\nAgain, this is not uncommon elsewhere. Canada, for example, has had regulatory budgeting in some provincial governments since 2001, and began moving toward it on the federal level with the election of Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper in 2006.\n\nThe big question now is how the executive order will be implemented, say experts.\n\nRelated: Trump Targets Muslims, Mexico and Iraq\u2019s Oil\n\n\u201cI really think that the devil is in the details on this kind of scheme,\u201d said Philip Wallach, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe bigger challenge of the two main elements of the order will be the regulatory budget, he said. And that will be up to Trump\u2019s OMB director, who is expected to be Rep. Mick Mulvaney.\n\n\u201cHow is cost assessed? What, exactly, counts as a regulation for these purposes? This order doesn\u2019t define any of that stuff. It leaves it all for the director of the Office of Management and Budget to figure out.\u201d\n\nTo know what the real effect of the order will be, Wallach said, it will be necessary to see how OMB defines many of the key terms in it and how the White House decides to handle exceptions.\n\nRelated: Why \u2018Repeal and Delay\u2019 of Obamacare Could Send Premiums Soaring Next Year\n\n\u201cThere could be a whole lot of gaping exceptions that make it so this really doesn\u2019t do a whole lot \u2026 but that\u2019s just one possibility,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat the order does do, though, is at least open the door to greater White House control of the regulatory process.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s possible that the OMB could use it as a way of trying to exert a lot of control over the various regulatory agencies.

The company\u2019s second major computer outage in six months froze domestic departures for hours on Sunday, forcing the cancellation of about 170 flights overnight and another 110 on Monday. It was the second major airline power outage in a week, following a United failure. Donald Trump even blamed the Delta disaster for problems at the airports, to deflect from the chaos of his immigration ban.\n\nDelta and its fellow airline giants aren\u2019t Trump\u2019s excuse to employ but his problem to solve.

Outages among the four airlines that manage 85 percent of all domestic routes cause outsized delays, cancellations and missed connections. Judging by their actions, the airlines clearly don\u2019t care. Delta may have lost $100 million in sales after the August crash, but with a record-breaking $6.6 billion in profits last year, it had little incentive to invest in improvements. After all, consumers have nowhere else to go.\n\nThis concept of judging corporations by actions carries over to the other major transportation snafu of the weekend. When New York City taxi drivers called for a one-hour wildcat strike, refusing pickups at JFK airport to protest the immigration ban, Uber used the opportunity to suspend surge pricing, making its service more attractive and available.\n\nUber\u2019s knee-jerk reaction to undermine the strike overshadowed its vows of sympathy with those suffering. CEO Travis Kalanick promised to support the \u201cdozen or so\u201d drivers affected with pro bono compensation while they await return to the U.S., although the other vague gestures in the statement (\u201ctakes virtually no position aside from that America is great\u201d) underwhelmed. But in a moment of decision, Uber saw an expression of solidarity with refugee families and thought immediately about how to make money off it. And people recognized this, as the hashtag \u201c#deleteUber\u201d went viral on social media.\n\nRelated: Silicon Valley Puts Money and Muscle into Fighting Trump Immigrant Curbs\n\nThe calculating responses by other tech companies in an attempt to avoid Uber\u2019s pitfall didn\u2019t end up looking much better. Lyft, Uber\u2019s main nationwide competitor, announced it would give $1 million to the ACLU \u2014 only the fine print said that the donation would stretch over four years. Lyft\u2019s investors include Trump advisor Peter Thiel. The same is true of Facebook and startup incubator Y Combinator, whose milquetoast statements of opposition to the ban also did not address this fact.\n\nAirbnb pledged free housing to those stranded in a country other than their own because of the immigration ban. But because the company doesn\u2019t own any physical properties, it\u2019s really only begging its members to volunteer their own properties for free.

The White House\u2019s imminent executive order limiting work-visa programs that Silicon Valley relies on for its employee base will cause far greater concern, because of the threat to the bottom line. While these programs have their place, they have also been employed to drive down worker wages.\n\nThis is why enabling massive corporate concentration that reduces the power of workers and innovators means so much more than what can be seen on the balance sheet. Multinationals seeking a foothold in every market will inevitably take no stand that might disrupt their ability to make a buck, and work with anyone, no matter how odious. Non-union behemoths with no history or understanding of solidarity will put their profits ahead of any other value. A sense of social responsibility is important, though it never appears in an economic analysis of a merger or statistic about union density. Your local monopolist is not interested in how you feel or who you support, only that you have no other choice but to purchase their wares.\n\nUnfortunately for Uber, they let the mask slip before cornering the market in ride-hailing. Anyone can build an app, even the taxi companies, without impoverishing their employees so much they have to sleep in their cars. Uber\u2019s strategy of burning through venture capital money to attract market share, only to turn the tables and jack up prices amid no competition, ran up against a fundamental issue \u2013 losing the trust of the customer base, which finally realized that what they buy is a political act.\n\nRelated: US No Longer a \u2018Full Democracy,\u2019 but It\u2019s Not Trump\u2019s Fault: Report\n\nDelta is where Uber wants to be: comfortably ensconced as the nation\u2019s second-largest airline, insulated from public opinion, regardless of quality control or greed.

Forty years of deregulation brought us to that point of ripping away airline passenger control. In other words, Uber\u2019s biggest error lay in not securing their monopoly yet.\n\nIf Trump wants to truly make America safe, he could use the century-old laws on the books to break up monopolies that prey upon all citizens.

But there is a case to be made that they should, even that they must be viewed as two sides of the same coin.\n\nThe ban, announced Friday night, bars all refugees from entering the country for 120 days, and singles out refugees from Syria, the victims of a horrific humanitarian disaster, for an indefinite ban. It also bars people from seven majority Muslim countries, including Syria, and those holding valid visas, from coming to the United States for at least 90 days. The ban was initially applied to legal permanent residents, but after multiple federal judges issued stays against enforcement, the Trump administration seems to be backtracking slightly.\n\nRelated: Trump Says Costs Be Damned as He Moves on Major Defense Buildup\n\nAs many warned, the decision to implement what amounts to a ban on millions of Muslims coming to the United States, combined with Trump\u2019s spoken assurance that he will give preferential treatment to Christians, was greeted with glee by supporters of terrorist organizations. They predicted that it would reinforce the idea that the United States is at war not with terrorism but with Islam as a whole.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where Steve Bannon comes in. Trump\u2019s senior counselor and chief strategist does not want to prevent a war between the US-led West and Islam. He believes an apocalyptic \u201cwar of immense proportions\u201d has already started and that the real problem is that the West isn\u2019t taking it seriously enough.\n\nThat view is largely shared by Michael Flynn, the retired Army General who serves as Trump\u2019s National Security Advisor and chairs meetings of the NSC.\n\nThat\u2019s why Friday\u2019s other executive order needs to be seen as a companion piece to the travel ban. The second EO demoted the Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- key leaders of the Intelligence and Defense communities, respectively -- from the Principals Committee of the National Security Council. Both will be limited to attending meetings that address issues specifically in their areas of expertise, though many struggled, particularly with regard to the DNI, to think of a national security related subject that would not be in their portfolios.\n\nRelated: Team Trump on Immigration Disruption: \u2018It\u2019s a Small Price to Pay\u2019\n\nIn their places, it put Bannon, the former publisher of the alt-right Breitbart News, an individual with no relevant national security experience.\n\nThe reason the refugee ban and Bannon\u2019s elevation to the NSC need to be viewed as connected is that it is Bannon\u2019s worldview that plainly informs Trump\u2019s decision-making on issues like terrorism and relations with the Muslim world.\n\nIn 2014, in a lengthy video-conference presentation to the Human Dignity Institute at the Vatican, Bannon laid out his vision on the need for a \u201cChurch Militant\u201d to fight an ongoing war between the Judeo-Christian west and Islam. It is not a struggle for land or influence, in Bannon\u2019s view, but a truly existential fight between Islam and the West.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the very beginning stages of a very brutal and bloody conflict,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the people in this room, the people in the church, do not bind together and really form what I feel is an aspect of the Church Militant, to really be able to not just stand with our beliefs, but to fight for our beliefs against this new barbarity that\u2019s starting, that will completely eradicate everything that we\u2019ve been bequeathed over the last 2,000, 2,500 years.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump Pratfalls Onto the World Stage Targeting Muslims, Mexico, and Iraq\u2019s Oil\n\nBannon continued, in increasingly apocalyptic terms, to describe \u201ca major war brewing, a war that\u2019s already global. It\u2019s going global in scale, and today\u2019s technology, today\u2019s media, today\u2019s access to weapons of mass destruction, it\u2019s going to lead to a global conflict that I believe has to be confronted today. Every day that we refuse to look at this as what it is, and the scale of it, and really the viciousness of it, will be a day where you will rue that we didn\u2019t act.\u201d\n\nGiven Bannon\u2019s perspective, the travel ban is not a massive and counterproductive overreaction to a real but limited threat. It\u2019s an early step in the belated prosecution of a war that -- it can\u2019t be stated clearly enough -- he believes has already begun.\n\n\u201cAsk yourself, 500 years from today, what are they going to say about me?\u201d he urged the Vatican audience. What are they going to say about what I did at the beginning stages of this crisis?\u201d\n\nHe closed with this: \u201cSee what\u2019s happening, and you will see we\u2019re in a war of immense proportions. It\u2019s very easy to play to our baser instincts, and we can\u2019t do that. But our forefathers didn\u2019t do it either. And they were able to stave this off, and they were able to defeat it, and they were able to bequeath to us a church and a civilization that really is the flower of mankind, so I think it\u2019s incumbent on all of us to do what I call a gut check, to really think about what our role is in this battle that\u2019s before us.\u201d\n\nWith that view in mind, it feels safe to say that if Trump\u2019s immigration ban exacerbates existing divisions between Islam and the West, Bannon will view that as a feature of the new program, not a bug."}, {"date": "2017/01/30", "title": "Trump Says Costs Be Damned as He Moves on Major Defense Buildup", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/30/Trump-Says-Costs-Be-Damned-He-Moves-Major-Defense-Buildup", "text": "President Trump declared last week that in seeking an historic buildup in the U.S. military and missile defense, money is no object to him. \u201cI want a balanced budget eventually,\u201d he told Sean Hannity of Fox News. \u201cBut I want to have a strong military. To me, that\u2019s much more important than anything.\u201d\n\nTrump took a first major step towards making good on his campaign pledge to boost defense spending with the issuance last Friday of an executive order. In it, the Republican commander-in-chief instructed newly installed Defense Secretary James Mattis to conduct a 30-day \u201creadiness review\u201d to examine needs in the ongoing war against ISIS in Syria and Iraq as well as training, equipment maintenance, modernization, and infrastructure, as The Washington Post reported.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Nuclear Defense Plan: Another \u2018Star Wars\u2019 Budget Buster?\n\nMore broadly, Trump has asked Mattis for a comprehensive plan within two months to improve overall readiness in the armed services by fiscal 2019, including updating the nuclear arsenal and strengthening defenses against the possibility of a nuclear missile attack by North Korea, Iran or some other adversaries.\n\nTrump complained during the 2016 presidential campaign that former President Barack Obama had dangerously depleted the armed services \u2013 especially the Navy \u2013 as he gradually disengaged the U.S. from combat in Afghanistan and Iraq. Last week Trump promised a \u201cgreat rebuilding\u201d of the armed forces \u2013 in some cases returning to levels not seen since the Reagan administration of the 1980s -- to ensure that the sacrifices of the military \u201care supported by the actions of our government.\u201d\n\nLast September, Trump\u2019s campaign outlined a highly ambitious military buildup plan that he is now attempting to push through Congress. It includes raising the number of active Army troops from 475,000 to 540,000, boosting the number of Marine battalions from 24 to 36, expanding the naval fleet from a planned 280 to 350 and increasing the number of Air Force fighter aircraft by 100 to at least 1,200.\n\nThe president also called for modernizing the nation\u2019s missile defense system and cybersecurity, in the wake of North Korea\u2019s aggressive efforts to develop a long-range nuclear-tipped missile that could reach the West Coast of the United States and beyond.\n\nTrump at the time promised to find some savings in other parts of the budget to help pay for his proposed military buildup, but it is far more likely that much of the new spending will simply be added to the debt. In order to do that, however, Congress will have to lift the discretionary spending caps on defense that was imposed under the Budget Control Act of 2011.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Nuke Talk Could Break the Budget or Much, Much Worse\n\nThe BCA caps on defense and non-defense spending will last until 2021 unless Congress and the new president decide to change them. Currently, they call for a $609.9 billion limit on defense spending and a $533.4 billion limit on non-defense programs in fiscal 2017. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has cautioned that lifting the defense spending caps alone would add $450 billion to the federal debt over the coming decade.\n\nThe issue will come to a head in late April, when stop-gap spending authority to keep the government running expires and Congress must approve a final spending bill for defense and domestic programs through the remainder of fiscal 2017, which runs through September 30.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), a strong supporter of Trump\u2019s military buildup, said last week that lifting the spending caps on defense will be a top priority of Congress this spring. And Senate Armed Services Committee Chair John McCain (R-AZ) declared over the weekend that Trump\u2019s drive for a military buildup is an important step in reasserting U.S. military dominance and discouraging further military aggression and meddling in U.S. political affairs by Russian leader Vladimir Putin.\n\nRelated: The Pentagon Must Now Reveal the True Cost of War to All Americans\n\n\u201cI believe that peace through strength is an answer, and I\u2019m glad President Trump has committed to rebuilding our military,\u201d McCain said during an appearance Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d program. \u201cThat\u2019s one of our first priorities if we\u2019re going to deal on an equal basis with Vladimir Putin.\u201d\n\nRep. Mick Mulvaney (R-SC), Trump\u2019s choice to head the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), testified last week before the Senate Budget Committee that he supports Trump's call for increased defense spending, even if it adds to the deficit.\n\nMulvaney, a Tea Party Republican who has long fought to reduce defense spending, at one time was thought to be a fly in the ointment in Trump\u2019s call for lifting the caps. But he said during his confirmation hearing that he would focus instead on reforming Pentagon personnel policies to try to hold down costs."}, {"date": "2017/01/30", "title": "Democrats Will Regain Power If They Can Avoid Screwing Up", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/01/30/Democrats-Will-Regain-Power-If-They-Can-Avoid-Screwing", "text": "As the shock of November\u2019s defeat and the reality of being in opposition finally sink in, Democrats are moving beyond denial and starting to think about how to win in 2018 and 2020.

Although I am not a Democrat, I thought my friends on the left could benefit from an outsider\u2019s viewpoint. And, please don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t tell you to start acting like Republicans.\n\nClinton received 2.9 million more popular votes than Trump but lost the electoral college because her voters were concentrated in a few coastal states. Further, she would have won an electoral college majority had she been able to overcome an aggregate Trump margin of just 78,000 popular votes in three states. Trump\u2019s razor thin victories in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania could have been reversed if more Democratic-leaning voters had turned out, if fewer voters had selected a third party candidate or if fewer voters chose no Presidential candidate, voting only in down ballot races.\n\nRelated: Will Democrats Stand Up to Trump? Here\u2019s Their First Test\n\nThis last phenomenon \u2013 large number of voters declining to choose a Presidential candidate - was so unusual that it triggered demands for a recount. In Michigan, for example, 75,000 ballots did not include a Presidential preference, compared to a margin of just 11,000 votes separating the two major candidates. As far as we can tell, these blank votes weren\u2019t caused by errors or fraud: they were the result of voters who disliked both candidates so much that they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for the lesser of two evils.\n\nThis is testimony to Clinton\u2019s unattractiveness as a candidate. Hundreds of thousands of voters across the country repelled by Trump and unwilling to vote third party still could not convince themselves to vote for Clinton, despite her depth of experience and centrist platform. These voters, along with others who didn\u2019t show up or voted for Jill Stein, could not accept Clinton\u2019s cozy relationship with corporate interests, the whiff of corruption surrounding her family\u2019s Foundation and her email controversies.\n\nPost-election, Democratic insiders have blamed the Russians and FBI Director James Comey for Clinton\u2019s defeat. And I find that hard to argue: news arising from leaked DNC email messages could have easily cost Clinton 78,000 votes in three states, as could the last-minute reopening (and reclosing) of the FBI investigation.\n\nBut blaming external forces is not a solution for winning: all candidates risk running up against such headwinds, including Trump who managed to overcome a hot mic off-air recording that NBC should not have leaked. Between the 1930s and the 1980s, the Soviets intervened in US politics by supporting the Communist Party USA and beaming propaganda to us over short wave radio, so Putin\u2019s actions in 2016 are nothing new \u2013 rather just a higher tech version of the same old thing. Comey had been painted into a corner: he had sworn during Congressional testimony to promptly notify Committee members if new evidence turned up, and the cache of Clinton emails found on Anthony Weiner\u2019s computer counted as such evidence.\n\nRelated: The Power of the Pink Hat: Here\u2019s How Democrats Can Win America Back\n\nRather than blaming these circumstances, Democrats should have chosen a candidate not vulnerable to the contents of a disgraced former Congressman\u2019s hard drive. And the DNC and Clinton Campaign should not have written email messages that could later be used against them. Remember that the Democratic National Convention last August was initially rocked by revelations that DNC staff were trying to figure out how to stop Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe DNC and Democratic leadership seemed bent on protecting Clinton from serious primary opposition. This turned out to be a gross misjudgment. While the Republican process consisting of 17 candidates hurling mud at one another seemed ugly, it ultimately served a purpose. Jeb Bush, a weak candidate with strong establishment support, was winnowed out as were others that seemed to check all the boxes but weren\u2019t ready for prime time. Trump emerged from this messy process by demonstrating that he had the will to win and the ability to motivate a large base of support.\n\nBy contrast, Hillary\u2019s support was a mile wide and an inch deep. And the warning signs of her potential downfall were with us from the beginning of her primary campaign. News of her email server and her clumsy, shifting explanations for it date back to mid-2015. The $225,000 Goldman Sachs speeches were also in the news long before the Iowa Caucus.\n\nBut instead of providing an opening for a stronger candidate to replace Clinton, Democratic Party leadership closed the doors to effective opposition. Compared to the Republicans, Democrats held fewer Presidential debates, sometimes scheduling them at low-viewership times. Donna Brazille even abused her post at CNN by feeding town hall questions to the Clinton campaign.\n\nRelated: Trump Might Adopt a Democratic Plan to Crack Down on Drug Prices\n\nThe fact that Bernie Sanders, who came from outside the party with a far left agenda was able to mount a major challenge to Clinton was another sign of her weakness as a candidate. But now that we have entered the post mortem period, Democrats are in danger of learning the wrong lessons from Sanders\u2019 success. On the unproven assumption that Sanders would have defeated Trump last November, they conclude that Democrats need more progressive candidates going forward to excite the base.\n\nBut for every base voter they motivate, hard left candidates may turn off more than one middle of the road voter. The Democrats last experience with a far left candidate \u2013 George McGovern in 1972\u2013 did not end well: he lost 49 states. The British Labour Party offers its own cautionary tales. The Tories remained in power from 1979 to 1997 largely because Labour did not move toward the middle. Only when Tony Blair proclaimed New Labour and ended the party\u2019s support for nationalizing the means of production, was the party able to defeat the Conservatives, Labour is now repeating this mistake under its far left leader Jeremy Corbyn, failing to capitalize on Tory disorder in the wake of the Brexit vote and David Cameron\u2019s resignation.\n\nI do not believe Sanders would have defeated Trump, but I am pretty sure that Obama or Biden could have. Indeed, Martin O\u2019Malley may have beaten Trump as well. The takeaway is that a center left candidate, advocating an approach similar to Clinton\u2019s, but with a cleaner record and better able to connect with voters would have won in 2016 and will be best positioned to defeat Trump in 2020.\n\nThis column was mistakenly posted under Mark Thoma's byline originally.

Trump\u2019s newly-confirmed United Nations ambassador, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, announced her arrival at the international body with all the subtlety of a hand grenade.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see a change in the way we do business,\u201d she said in brief remarks to the media. \u201cOur goal with the administration is to show value at the U.N., and the way we\u2019ll show value is to show our strength, show our voice, have the backs of our allies and make sure our allies have our back as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor those who don\u2019t have our back,\u201d she added ominously, \u201cwe\u2019re taking names; we will make points to respond to that accordingly.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump Just Blew His Chance to Renegotiate NAFTA\n\nHaley's warning followed the new president\u2019s decision to start a Twitter fight with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto over the border wall that Trump insists he will build and force Mexico to pay for. Trump goaded Pena Nieto into canceling a meeting this week between the two men by claiming Mexico would pay for the wall.\n\nThen Trump hit again. He sent his press secretary out to tell reporters he was planning to institute a 20 percent tariff on all goods imported from Mexico, sending the value of the country\u2019s currency plunging.\n\nIn addition to threatening a trade war with the United States\u2019 third-largest trading partner, Trump repeatedly insisted that he plans to reconsider US participation in a vast array of trade pacts, claiming it would be in the best interests of the US to negotiate bilaterally with every country in the world. His words left both markets and foreign leaders nervous about the future of global commerce.\n\nTrump also hosted his first meeting with the leader of a major US ally when British Prime Minister Theresa May visited the White House. The Trump team misspelled May\u2019s first name, conflating it with that of a British pornographic actress. During the joint press conference after they met, Trump again repeated his insistence that torture, which is outlawed by the US government and has been deemed ineffective by Trump\u2019s newly confirmed Defense Secretary, General James Mattis, is an effective and legitimate means of extracting information from captured enemies.\n\nRelated: Mass Departures at the State Department as Trump Era Begins\n\nBy Saturday, it was almost possible to forget that earlier in the week Trump had suggested that the United States might get \u201canother chance\u201d to invade Iraq and take the country\u2019s oil, and his claim that people who point out that this would be a war crime are \u201cfools.\u201d\n\nThe great danger here is that while Americans, faced with a blizzard of Trump coverage, may lose track of all the countries the new president has threatened, insulted, and bullied, those countries and their leaders surely won\u2019t.

Not only could ineligible immigrants be approved, he discovered, but immigration officials often didn\u2019t know if they had a criminal record or ties to terrorism.\n\nIn a stunning breach of security, ELIS had erroneously issued nearly 20,000 green cards, granting legal status to live and work in the U.S. to people who had not been properly vetted, according to the inspector general.\n\nRoth said he had received assurances from USCIS that it would continue to mothball the pricey computer system in favor of more traditional, manual paper shuffling until the multitude of problems had been ironed out. But late last week, he sounded an alarm after learning that Leon Rodriguez, Director of USCIS, intended to resume operation of ELIS before all the kinks were worked out.\n\nRelated: Are Mass Deportations Coming in the US?

India has a large Muslim minority, and the country has suffered many terror attacks within its borders that New Delhi claims are supported by Muslim-majority Pakistan. Modi's political party, called the Bharatiya Janata Party, has its roots in Hindu nationalism.\n\nThe White House also said on Tuesday that the two leaders of the largest democracies in the world discussed \"security in the region of South and Central Asia.\"\n\nIndia rarely gets involved in conflicts that do not directly involve the country, especially given India's perpetual border disputes with Pakistan.

Analysts say the U.S. president could be setting the table for a stronger relationship between Washington and New Delhi in the coming years and could ultimately elevate India's global profile, which has been a key objective for Modi.

He also favors allowing Medicare officials to negotiate prices with the major drug companies by eliminating the non-negotiating ban.\n\nRelated: How Big Pharma Lobbyists Keep Medicare Drug Prices High\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to bring down drug prices,\u201d Trump said in an interview with Time magazine that rattled the pharmaceutical industry. \u201cI don\u2019t like what\u2019s happened with drug prices.\u201d\n\nPerhaps even more worrisome for PhRMA and its long-time GOP allies on Capitol Hill is that Trump has begun conferring with a prominent senior House Democrat who has waged war with the drug companies for years and co-sponsored one of the toughest price control bills in Congress.\n\nRep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, teamed up with Sen. Bernie Sanders (IT) last year to highlight the most outrageous examples of price gouging and to fuel an election-year drive for congressional intervention. They called for harsher penalties and sanctions for price fixing, greater transparency in companies\u2019 marketing strategies, and opening the borders to cheaper drugs from overseas.\n\nTrump told Cummings at the inaugural luncheon at the Capitol last Friday that the two needed to meet to discuss the high cost of prescription drugs, according to media reports confirmed by the congressman\u2019s spokesman. Then Trump called Cummings on Wednesday morning to briefly confer about runaway drug prices and what could be done to rein them in.\n\nThe 20 Most Expensive Prescription Drugs in America\n\nThe Pharmaceutical Research & Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the drug industry\u2019s main trade group, recently told the Fiscal Times that \u201cGovernment mandates and interventions are not the solutions for patients.\u201d\n\nYet the fact that Trump spoke directly with Cummings twice in less than a week about drug prices suggests that the new president is getting ready to jettison traditional GOP opposition to direct government action, as The Hill noted this week.\n\nPrescription drug prices have risen at a double-digit rate in recent years and are projected to continue to rise at that clip this year. The overall cost of all drugs prescribed for employees under age 65 is expected to grow by 11.6 percent in 2017, according to HR Consultancy Segal. Specialty drugs for treating cancer, the Hepatitis-C virus and other life-threatening diseases are projected to increase 18.7 percent.\n\nThe country has been treated to a rogue\u2019s gallery of price gouging pharmaceutical companies over the past two years. Those include Mylan Pharmaceutical, maker of the EpiPen drug dispenser for allergic children; Gilead Sciences, a manufacturer of two biometric wonder drugs for treating the Hepatitis-C virus, and Turing Pharmaceutical, formerly headed by Martin Shkreli, the notorious hedge fund manager.\n\nRelated: Trump Jolts the Pharmaceutical Industry with Vow to \u2018Bring Down Drug Prices\u2019\n\nCummings could not be reached for comment on Thursday about his conversations with Trump. However, if Trump is interested in pursuing the Democrats\u2019 ideas for bringing down costs, Cummings and Sanders have provided a road map that in some ways overlaps with Trump\u2019s own ideas.\n\nTheir Prescription Drug Affordability Act introduced in late 2015 has four main components:\n\nIt would authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies to bring down costs for Medicare drug benefits and lift that prohibition from 2003 Medicare Part D law.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat prohibition provided major pharmaceutical companies with billions of dollars in windfall profits that Cummings and Sanders want to end. Some analysts say Medicare could save more than a half trillion dollars over the coming decade by tough negotiations with drug companies. Trump would clearly be in favor of such a move.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would provide for much tougher penalties for drug companies that commit fraud in pricing their products. In recent years, many major pharmaceutical companies have been convicted of civil or criminal fraud but treated their fines and settlements as the cost of doing business. The bill would significantly increase fines and other penalties for wrongdoing. Trump hasn\u2019t spoken out on this yet.\n\nRelated: Two Big Reasons Prescription Drug Prices Are So Much Higher in the US\n\nIt would prohibit the practice of brand-name drug makers paying competitors to keep lower-priced generic substitutes off the market to avoid competition and enable them to freely raise prices. The Federal Trade Commission has estimated that this so called \u201cpay-for-delay\u201d practice is costing consumers and taxpayers about $3.5 billion a year in higher drug prices.\n\nUnder the Cummings-Sanders approach, a drug company convicted of such fraudulent activities would lose its market exclusivity on the drugs they sell. Presumably, the government would pave the way for the introduction of a generic brand alternative. This, too, is not part of Trump\u2019s approach so far.\n\nRelated: The Feds Finally Make a Move on Soaring Drug Prices\n\nFinally, the bill would allow individuals, pharmacists and wholesalers to import prescription drugs from licensed Canadian pharmacies where drug prices are 40 percent lower per person than they are in the U.S. Trump frequently mentioned this approach throughout the campaign.\n\nJoseph Antos, a health care expert with the conservative leaning American Enterprise Institute, said on Thursday, \u201cClearly the traditional Republican stance on government price controls is negative,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cAnything that the White House might want to do with regards to price controls would almost certainly run through legislation.\u201d\n\nRelated: Extreme Rise in Some Drug Prices Reaches a Tipping Point\n\nIn early February, Cummings lectured Shkreli, the former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, over his decision to boost the price of Daraprim, a drug that had been on the market for years to treat a rare parasitic disease, by over 5000 percent. \"Drug company executives are lining their pockets at the expense of some of the most vulnerable families in our nation,\" Cummings said, while Shkreli smirked. \"It's not funny, Mr. Shkreli. People are dying, and they're getting sicker and sicker.\"\n\nCummings, 66, a highly regarded veteran House member, told Business Insider, \u201cI have absolutely no problem with companies making a reasonable profit.

(Add in services, and the U.S. ran a surplus.) At this point Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is ducking for cover; he has already indicated that he\u2019s willing to supersede NAFTA with a bilateral accord if that\u2019s what things come to.\n\nMexico\u2019s the pebble in Trump\u2019s shoe, as he has long made plain. They run an annual merchandise surplus with the U.S. of almost $60 billion; when an American plant pulls up stakes in the Midwest, it\u2019s almost always to set up south of the border.\n\nTrump\u2019s not wrong to complain that NAFTA has led to American job losses. The Economic Policy Institute puts the figure at 700,000; the Council on Foreign Relations cites 600,000.\n\nRelated: Is This How Trump Will Get Mexico to \u2018Pay\u2019 for His Wall?\n\nMore saliently, in my view, NAFTA has put Americans in unfair competition with workers in a completely different economic context. Having thus disarmed Americans at the bargaining table, NAFTA is effectively complicit in the wage stagnation and worsening income inequality evident over the last couple of decades.\n\nBut Trump betrays two potentially fatal problems, both symptoms of his profound lack of sophistication in diplomacy and international economics.\n\nOne, by signing an executive order Wednesday to begin his border wall, just as President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto was about to begin a state visit, Trump just repeated the same mistake he recently made with the Chinese. The wall is to U.S.\u2013Mexican ties as Taiwan or the South China Sea are to Sino\u2013U.S. ties.\n\nMixing touchy politics, sovereignty, and national pride with economic and commercial problems is a mistake almost by definition. As a result, Pe\u00f1a Nieto, under intense political pressure at home, canceled his visit Thursday morning and is talking a much tougher game on NAFTA, immigration, and other such issues.\n\nTwo, and again as with China, Trump entertains a grossly simplistic notion of NAFTA\u2019s mechanics, its plusses and minuses, and the prospect of reshaping it to better U.S. advantage.\n\nRelated: Who Will Really Pay for the Wall? GOP Struggles Over $12 Billion Price Tag\n\nTrump has said little about what he wants to emerge from a renegotiated NAFTA, but his proposed 20 percent tariff on imports from Mexico will be met with countervailing duties on imports from the U.S.\n\nThat\u2019s called a trade war.\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t seem to understand even the rudiments of supply-chain manufacturing structures and related production practices. Products \u201cmade\u201d in Mexico may have components made in U.S. factories and shipped across the border. And vice-versa. What will happen if supply chains are disrupted? In all likelihood, U.S. companies will resort to another low-wage producer with whom the White House isn\u2019t picking a fight.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s not taking the lesson he should have when Carrier consented not to shift some factory production to Mexico after Trump\u2019s election victory. Increasing U.S. manufacturing production does not equal increases in American jobs\u2014not any longer. Many jobs that Carrier won\u2019t send to Mexico will be automated in Indiana. Trump may revive U.S. manufacturing to one or another degree\u2014or oversee the trend, anyway\u2014but the big winners will be production-floor robots.\n\nAlthough trade among the NAFTA signatories has tripled, the agreement has had a surprisingly modest impact on GDP growth. On balance, there is too little in it to protect workers, towns, and cities from the negative fallout that was perfectly predictable.\n\nBut 23 years later, it\u2019s hard to see how Trump can do much more than ameliorate a few of the negative consequences unless he wants to risk a trade war or some other unimaginable mess."}, {"date": "2017/01/26", "title": "Here\u2019s What the US Imports From Mexico \u2013 and Who Would Pay Trump\u2019s 20% Tax", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/26/Here-s-What-US-Imports-Mexico-and-Who-Would-Pay-Trump-s-20-Tax", "text": "White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters travelling with the president on Thursday that President Donald Trump has decided to pay for his proposed border wall with Mexico by levying a 20 percent tax on all imports from that country.\n\nHowever, there is considerable confusion over what exactly the White House is proposing.

And the Republicans in the House of Representatives are considering a proposal that would create a border-adjusted tax of 20 percent on imports. But the House proposal would apply to all imports, while Spicer appeared to be talking only about Mexican goods.\n\nRelated: Before the Wall -- 18 Photos of the US-Mexico Border\n\nTrade policy isn\u2019t normally announced in the press gaggle on Air Force One, so the details of what\u2019s really going on are difficult to determine at the moment. What\u2019s clear though, is that slapping a 20 percent tariff on Mexican imports would raise prices on an awful lot of things that U.S. consumers buy every day.\n\nAccording to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, Mexico is the United States\u2019 third-largest trading partner, with $587 billion in goods and services crossing the border in 2015. That breaks down to $267 billion in American goods and services exported to Mexico and $316 billion flowing the other way.\n\nIf the sellers of those $316 billion worth of products purchased by Americans are hit with a 20 percent increase in costs, they are going to do their best to pass that increased expense on to American consumers. And it will hit American checkbooks in multiple ways.\n\nRelated: Trump Cracks Down on Sanctuary Cities \u2013 and It Could Cost Them Billions\n\nAccording to Commerce Department data, the U.S. imports from Mexico in 2015 were:\n\n* $74 billion in vehicles,\n\n* $63 billion in electrical machinery,\n\n* $49 billion in other machinery,\n\n* $14 billion in fuel and\n\n* $12 billion in medical instruments.\n\nMexico is also one of the largest exporters of agricultural products to the U.S., sending $21 billion worth of fruits, vegetables, beer, snack food and more across the border in 2015. Like your strawberries in February? Get ready to pay more for them.\n\nAnd there is every reason to expect that Mexico would hit back if Trump imposed an across-the-board tax on Mexican imports. U.S. exports to Mexico support an estimated 1.1 million jobs in this country, and American exporters would likely find their goods were suddenly less affordable for their Mexican customers.\n\nMexico is the second largest importer of U.S.-manufactured goods, and according to the Commerce Department, the same kinds of things that cross the border going north also cross it going south. According to the U.S. Trade Representative, \u201cThe top export categories ... in 2015 were: machinery ($42 billion), electrical machinery ($41 billion), vehicles ($22 billion), mineral fuels ($19 billion), and plastics ($17 billion).\u201d\n\nRelated: Did Trump Just Say That Only Fools Honor the Geneva Conventions?\n\nMexico is the third-largest buyer of U.S. agricultural products as well, with $18 billion in produce and meat shipped south in 2015.\n\nAgain, it is not completely clear how serious the administration is about applying an import tax specifically to Mexico. But a couple of things are clear.\n\nIf Trump intends to effectively tax Mexican goods in order to raise money for the wall, it won\u2019t be Mexico paying for it, as he long promised, it will be American consumers.\n\nAnd if Mexico retaliates against U.S. exporters, costing them sales and perhaps jobs, the American people will have paid for it twice."}, {"date": "2017/01/26", "title": "Before the Wall: 18 Photos of the US-Mexico Border", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Media/Slideshow/2017/01/26/Wall-18-Photos-US-Mexico-Border", "text": "U.S. border patrol agents on horseback patrol along the U.S. Mexico border fence near San Diego, California, U.S November 10, 2016."}, {"date": "2017/01/26", "title": "The Fight Against Fake Facts Has a New Army of Unlikely Warriors  ", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/26/Fight-Against-Fake-Facts-Has-New-Army-Unlikely-Warriors", "text": "At a time when \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201calternative facts\u201d are a dominant theme in American political discourse, a group of academic economists has come together in what they are describing as an effort to make sure voters and policymakers have access to verifiably true information about the state of the U.S. economy.\n\nThe EconoFact Network, as the group calls themselves, is the brainchild of economist Michael W.

Klein demurred, but when the program aired, he was horrified to see that for a discussion about an issue that most economists considered settled, the producers had given equal weight to the positions of a lone contrarian and an economist speaking on behalf of the vast majority of the field.\n\nIn less than a week of operation, the Econofact Network has produced several of its policy memos, and paging through the site, a common theme arises: Most of the memos address claims made by President Trump or policy proposals that he and Republicans in Congress have put forward. They include the effect of a border wall with Mexico, the feasibility of the US economy growing at an annual rate of 4 percent, and whether or not China is a currency manipulator.\n\nIn many cases, the issues are ones on which Trump has repeatedly made claims that economists believe are false or dangerous. Klein insists that this doesn\u2019t represent an effort to go after the incoming administration specifically, but is simply a product of the reality that Trump and congressional Republicans now effectively control all federal policymaking machinery.\n\nRelated: Is This How Trump Will Get Mexico to \u2018Pay\u2019 for His Wall?\n\n\u201cIf the Democrats were coming out with a lot of policy proposals, we\u2019d look at those as well,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd if most of the analyses seem aimed at debunking and questioning, rather than supporting policy proposals? \u201cThe fact that it seems tilted one way could just be reflecting that these policies that are coming out don\u2019t really line up with the way economists think the world works,\u201d Klein said. \u201cWe\u2019re not afraid of making our voices known.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s one example, already on the site:\n\nBy David Deming, Harvard Kennedy School and Harvard Graduate School of Education\n\nThe Issue: President Trump has promised to bring back manufacturing jobs.\n\nThe Facts:\n\nThe U.S. lost more than 5 million manufacturing jobs in the 2000s. But job losses in manufacturing began more than 30 years ago and are happening worldwide in advanced countries like Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom.\n\nU.S. manufacturing is booming with production at an all-time high, even as the number of manufacturing jobs has shrunk. This is because of automation. Factories in the United States and other advanced countries are making more with fewer workers.\n\nAutomation is happening in all sectors of the economy, but much more in manufacturing than in services.\n\nIn the short-term, infrastructure spending and public sector \"make work\" projects could help workers displaced by automation.\n\nWhat this Means: Convincing manufacturing companies to keep \u2014 or bring back \u2014 jobs, one company at a time, is not going to restore the millions of jobs that have been lost due to technological change.

The hard-charging new president promised to use the White House bully pulpit to help line up the needed votes in both chambers and quash opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), who faces a much tougher challenge than Ryan in driving a replacement plan through the Senate, reportedly is less sanguine.\n\nFor all the optimism emanating from the GOP\u2019s policy retreat in Philly, it should be emphasized that congressional and presidential timelines have been known to frequently slip rather dramatically.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s the Problem With Trump\u2019s Plan to Sell Health Insurance Across State Lines\n\nTrump, of course, boasted to The Washington Post ten days ago that he and his advisers were on the verge of completing an Obamacare replacement plan providing \u201cinsurance for everybody.\u201d He promised he would soon unveil it with Ryan and McConnell at his side.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much formulated down to the final strokes,\u201d Trump told the newspaper. But we are still waiting to see that plan.\n\nA half-dozen more moderate Republicans in the Senate, including Bob Corker of Tennessee and Susan Collins of Maine, cautioned earlier this month that the process of replacing the Affordable Care Act could be long and perilous and they urged caution.\n\nSenator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the Republican chair of the health committee, indicated that the process of voting to just replace Obamacare likely would take until the summer to complete. After that, he said, \u201cit\u2019ll probably take two or three years to implement [a replacement] over time.\"\n\nRelated: Tom Price Is Open to a Major Change in How Medicaid Works\n\nBut after Trump cracked the whip and said voters won\u2019t tolerate anything but a rapid, near simultaneous repeal and replace action, Alexander and the others fell into line. Just about every Republican on Capitol Hill is now talking about a fast-track approach to wrap things up this year so that consumers and insurers aren\u2019t left in the lurch.\n\nBut whether anyone has a real handle on how this health care saga will play out remains to be seen.\n\nWhat seems crystal clear at this point -- after more than six years of seeking the demise of the Affordable Care Act \u2013 is the Republicans are nowhere near a consensus on replacement legislation. The new Trump White House and congressional leaders appear to have plenty of random ideas for creating a more market-oriented, consumer friendly, less costly health insurance system.\n\nThere is plenty of talk about encouraging the interstate sale of insurance to encourage competition, more tax-exempt health savings accounts, refundable tax credits to help the rich and poor alike cover their premiums, \u201crisk pools\u201d for older and sicker insurance applicants and block granting Medicaid to cut costs and empower state officials.\n\nYet neither Trump nor Ryan nor McConnell can honestly point to an approach that would win the support of the health care, drug and insurance industries -- which must have buy-in -- as well as rank and file Republicans and their constituents throughout the country.\n\nAnd the heat is on from Republican governors, hospital administrators and insurers who fear that Trump and the GOP are leading the country into a health care abyss. Practically every day now, someone is stepping forward with a possible solution that promptly gets shot down.\n\nOn Wednesday, for instance, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul introduced the Obamacare Replacement Act, which he declared would create more affordable insurance plans, eliminate the gap between private and employer-sponsored care, and allow consumers to save unlimited amounts of money in health savings accounts, according to Morning Consult.\n\nEarlier in the week, Collins and GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana unveiled a plan they hoped would bridge the vast political divide on Capitol Hill by allowing blue states that are happy with Obamacare to keep coverage as it is, while allowing other red states that want to repeal the law and its mandates to create an alternative program with 95 percent federal funding.\n\nCritics on the right and the left both howled at the plan as being grossly inadequate, and Collins and Cassidy quickly retreated.\n\nA spokesman for Collins insists that Collins and Cassidy were not in retreat, and noted that Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) signed onto their proposal on Wednesday. \u201cOur plan represents a growing coalescence of Republican ideas on health care while returning power to states and fulfilling President Trump\u2019s pledge to bring health care coverage for all,\u201d Cassidy said in a statement.\n\n(This story was updated at 12:10 p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 26.)"}, {"date": "2017/01/26", "title": "For the GOP, Failure to Act on Obamacare Is Not an Option", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/01/26/GOP-Failure-Act-Obamacare-Not-Option", "text": "What\u2019s more daunting than creating a massive federal entitlement program? Unwinding it with the least amount of damage to people and providers, as Republicans are learning about the Affordable Care Act. After seven years of opposing the ACA, forever known as Obamacare, the GOP finds itself in a position to finally fulfill their promises to repeal it entirely and replace it with market-based reforms.\n\nOver the past few weeks, since running the table in the 2016 election, Republicans on Capitol Hill began backing away from a firm commitment to \u201crepeal and replace,\u201d their mantra since the disastrous October 2013 rollout of the ACA exchanges. Murmurs of \u201crepeal and delay\u201d began swirling in Washington, even as now-president Donald Trump chose chief Obamacare opponent Tom Price to run Health and Human Services. Democrats began crowing \u201cI told you so,\u201d and started demanding that Republicans work with them to \u201cfix\u2019 the problems in the ACA.\n\nRelated: Could a Hybrid Obamacare Plan Bring the GOP and Dems Together?\n\nThe daunting scope of the challenge, both practically and politically, has my good friend Matt Lewis wondering whether the effort is worth trying. Writing at The Daily Beast, Matt suggests that Republicans should retreat from the \u201cthankless task of fixing America\u2019s health care system.\u201d The problem, Matt argues, is that the central argument of Obamacare has already been adopted by both sides \u2013 that the responsibility for universal health insurance coverage falls on the federal government.\n\n\u201cEven President Donald Trump agrees with this promise of universal coverage,\u201d Matt notes from Trump\u2019s interview with The Washington Post. The ship has sailed on sending the issue back to the states or reforming the entire system on free-market grounds. The proliferation of alternatives makes the task a \u201cRubik\u2019s Cube,\u201d and \u201ca fool\u2019s errand that is almost guaranteed to backfire. Sometimes,\u201d Matt concludes, \u201cyou have to punt.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, Republicans don\u2019t have that as a realistic option \u2013 either politically or practically. They have fought Obamacare in four successive national elections, winning three of four and sweeping the field in 2016 to return to single-party governance in Washington DC. Trump and almost every Republican who ran for the House and Senate explicitly cited Obamacare repeal as a top priority. Punting on repeal in favor of a few incremental changes would only deepen the hostility and suspicion that the populist-minded grassroots on the Right already have for Republican leadership. The potential backlash could cost the GOP a chance to gain a large Senate majority in 2018, or possibly even control of the House.\n\nRelated: There\u2019s Less to Trump\u2019s Obamacare Executive Order Than Some Suggest\n\nPractically speaking, a punt won\u2019t work because of the increasing instability in Obamacare exchanges. Democrats insisted that the ACA would deliver near-universal health insurance coverage and that 23 million Americans would get insurance through the exchanges by 2017. Instead, a new projection from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that only 10 million will pay premiums for coverage this year, and that number will only go up to 13 million after another decade. On top of that, the number of uninsured Americans will \u201cremain around 27 million or 28 million\u201d each year under the current system.\n\nThat makes it rather difficult to pin a failure to achieve universal coverage on a repeal of Obamacare and calls into question whether it\u2019s a worthwhile goal. The Affordable Care Act has not just missed the mark on universal coverage, and the attempts to achieve it have made insurance coverage more unaffordable than ever thanks to massive premium increases (averaging 25 percent this year alone) and skyrocketing deductibles that make accessing insurance benefits all but impossible anyway.\n\nThus, the crisis has reached a pitch to where a choice to avoid governance no longer exists. Add in the flight of insurers from the exchanges and the collapse of the government-backed co-ops, and the acute need for action becomes undeniable, regardless of the difficulty. Failure to act is simply not an option any longer.\n\nFortunately, Republicans have already begun the process of working out an eventual replacement plan by introducing a few options this week. Senator Rand Paul offered his more libertarian approach on Wednesday, featuring a reliance on free-market innovation in coverage rather than mandates, interstate sales of policies, and broaden access to HSAs. His colleagues Bill Cassidy and Susan Collins offered a significantly different approach \u2013 giving each state the option to set up its own version of Obamacare, or choose a \u201cfree-market alternative.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Sneaky Democratic Politics Behind the Scary New Obamacare Numbers\n\nThat approach still keeps in place some of the community-rating mandates while eliminating some of the other mandates on coverage, which makes it look like a bad system that has only been transferred to another level of government. Paul Ryan still has his \u201cA Better Way\u201d in the House, while Price will continue to work off his repeatedly offered legislation that closely resembles Ryan\u2019s plan.\n\nSome may see this multitude of options as evidence of chaos and division. Instead, it\u2019s part of the necessary process of working through all the options to get to a consensus solution, one that may well include various parts of all these approaches. Until Republicans gained control of Congress and the White House and replacement became a real possibility, few were willing to do this work and risk the potential political backlash. Now, with not just the possibility but necessity of replacing a collapsing and failing experiment in a command economy, this work can begin in earnest.\n\nAnd after this week, Republicans simply have no other choice. Trump\u2019s executive order on Obamacare on Monday acted in the same manner as Hernando Cortes burning his boats at Veracruz, ensuring that the status quo would be untenable. Punting is no longer an option \u2013 and in truth, it never was."}, {"date": "2017/01/25", "title": "Trump Cracks Down on Sanctuary Cities \u2013 and It Could Cost Them Billions", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/25/Trump-Cracks-Down-Sanctuary-Cities-and-It-Could-Cost-Them-Billions", "text": "President Donald Trump took his first big steps on Wednesday towards strengthening the border and increasing the pressure on millions of illegal immigrants in the country.\n\nDuring an afternoon appearance at the Department of Homeland Security, Trump issued executive orders to authorize construction of a much ballyhooed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, hire 5,000 more border patrol agents, and restore a \u201csecure communities\u201d program that grants the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency wider latitude in targeting illegal immigrants for detainment and deportation.\n\nRelated: Trump Era Begins with Moves Against Regulations, Obamacare\n\nAnd in a retaliatory move against scores of cities across the country that have refused to cooperate with federal immigration authorities in detaining illegal immigrants, Trump ordered cuts in potentially billions of dollars\u2019 worth of Department of Justice, Homeland Security and other federal grants to those communities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to strip federal grant money from the sanctuary states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants,\u201d White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters. \u201cThe American people are no longer going to have to be forced to subsidize this disregard for our laws.\u201d\n\nThe order, titled \u201cEnhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,\u201d declares that cities that fail to comply with federal immigration enforcement agents \u201care not eligible to receive Federal grants, except as deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes by the Attorney General or the Secretary.\u201d\n\nThe document also says that the director of the Office of Management and Budget will be responsible for obtaining \u201crelevant and responsive information\u201d on all federal grant money that currently flows to any sanctuary jurisdiction.\n\nWith an assist from the GOP-controlled Congress, Trump can punish as many as 300 \u201csanctuary cities\u201d that are protecting illegal immigrant by cutting off grants of more than $1 billion a year from the Justice Department and $1 billion from the Department of Homeland Security, according to policy experts.\n\nRelated: Some Sanctuary City Officials Will Stonewall Trump Over Criminal Deportations\n\nThose grants range from funding for enhanced community policy services, criminal prosecution, sheltering battered women and compensating crime victims to urban area security initiatives, funding for first responders and even local and state efforts at border security, according to a summary compiled by USA Today.\n\nDemocratic mayors and police chiefs of New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco, among others, have long resisted federal demands for cooperation in tracking and detaining illegal immigrants. Now, as Trump begins to ramp up his promised crackdown on illegal immigrants and tightening of security, these ity officials are vowing not to cooperate with Trump\u2019s plans to arrest and deport nearly a quarter of the 11 million illegal immigrants who have criminal records or are deemed dangerous to society.\n\nWithin days of Trump\u2019s election last November, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio strongly signaled they would stand by their illegal immigrant populations. Emanuel created a task force to help undocumented immigrants and pledged $1 million for a legal defense fund. \u201cChicago will always be a sanctuary city,\u201d Emanuel declared.\n\nSanctuary cities have been around since the 1980s, and they previously have come under fire from Republicans and even the Obama administration for refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, or for adopting policies to assure that illegal immigrants and their families are provided with social services. Those cities came under fire again last year after a 32-year-old San Francisco woman, Kathryn Steinle, was shot and killed by an undocumented immigrant with a felony record who had been deported five times.\n\nRelated: Is this How Trump Will Get Mexico to \u2018Pay\u2019 for His Wall?\n\nSen.

Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) argued that the punishment should be broadened to include community and economic development funds.\n\nToomey introduced a bill in 2015 that would have denied sanctuary cities their share of roughly $3 billion a year in community development block grants and $238 million of economic development administration grants. The new administration might dust off that proposal.\n\nRelated: Trump Will Deport Millions of Illegal Immigrants with Criminal Records\n\nTrump complained this afternoon that many Americans have been victimized or killed by illegal immigrants, while millions of undocumented residents are \u201crewarded\u201d with legal protection and social programs. \u201cFor years the media has largely ignored the stories of Americans and lawful residents victimized by open borders,\u201d Trump said. \u201cTo all of those hurting out there, I repeat to you these words: We hear you, we see you and you will never, ever be ignored again.\u201d\n\nLazaro Zamora, a senior policy adviser and immigration expert with the Bipartisan Policy Center, describes the threat of a loss of funds a \u201cmeat-axe\u201d approach to addressing a long-standing feud between federal and local officials that won\u2019t be resolved through bitter fighting.\n\nTrump and his advisers are trying to enforce their immigration policies \u201cby kind of bashing the states over the head with counter-productive measures that may just make everything worse and put state and local police officers in a more defensive position,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThere is a long history here and there\u2019s a lot of ego and territorial attitude in law enforcement, and part of that has been dealing with this issue of where is the line between federal immigration enforcement and police officers.\u201d\n\nThere is little question Trump can punish sanctuary cities financially, and he appears determined to following through on his executive order. But in so doing, he may be punishing the very same local police and law enforcement officials he has vowed to champion as a \u201claw and order\u201d commander in chief.\n\nRelated: 5 States That Would Get Hit Hardest in a Trump Trade War\n\n\u201cThe devil is in the detail here,\u201d said Laurie Robinson, a former Justice Department official who now teaches at George Mason University. \u201cAt a time when our law enforcement officers need support, it\u2019s slightly counter-productive to cut the resources to police.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, she said, slashing Justice Department and Homeland Security grants to sanctuary cities and communities would have a serious, adverse impact on vocal and important constituencies, especially victims of crime who qualify for compensation.\n\n\u201cThat would be very, very sensitive because this is directly assisting crime victims, and that\u2019s an extraordinarily strong constituency, a very vocal constituency, and one that has had strong support in the conservative community,\u201d Robinson said, noting that the Justice Department crime victims assistance office was originally created by President Ronald Reagan."}, {"date": "2017/01/25", "title": "Why the Keystone XL Pipeline May Never Happen, Even With Trump's Approval", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/25/Why-Keystone-XL-Pipeline-May-Never-Happen-Even-Trumps-Approval", "text": "President Donald Trump moved to fulfill one of his campaign promises on Tuesday, signing an executive order to revive the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipelines. The former had been rejected outright by the Obama administration while the latter had been given an indefinite delay.\n\nThe industry hailed the executive order, but just because President Trump wants to see the pipeline built does not mean TransCanada will move to break ground anytime soon. There are a number of uncertainties that could prevent construction from progressing.\n\nRelated: Environmentalists\u2019 Worst Fears About Trump Are Coming True\n\nFirst, the President said that he would \u201crenegotiate\u201d the terms of the Keystone XL pipeline, presumably to get a \u201cbetter deal\u201d as he promised during the campaign. The specifics of \u201crenegotiating\u201d the pipeline are unclear \u2013 he also signed an executive order to expedite the environmental review process for major infrastructure projects, so it is not as if he has a problem with the pipeline\u2019s route or environmental impact. \u201cThe regulatory process in this country has become a tangled mess,\u201d President Trump said.\n\nBased on his comments during the presidential campaign, it would appear that he wants to ensure some of the oil flowing through the Keystone XL Pipeline would be consumed in the U.S. rather than be shipped to the Gulf of Mexico for export. Again, it is unclear what kind of requirements he wants to place on the project and how that might complicate the calculations for TransCanada.\n\nAnother complicating factor for the project is that President Trump signed a separate order calling for all pipelines to be constructed with American-made steel. If that order is binding on TransCanada, it is uncertain how that will affect the ultimate cost of the project.\n\nMeanwhile, environmental groups argue that the executive order does not resolve all legal questions surrounding both pipelines and have promised to resume the fight against the project. \u201cPresident Trump appears to be ignoring the law, public sentiment and ethical considerations with this executive order aimed at resurrecting the long-rejected Keystone XL pipeline,\u201d Trip Van Noppen, President of environmental group Earthjustice wrote in a statement. \u201cHe should brace himself to contend with the laws he is flouting, and the millions of Americans who are opposed to these dangerous and destructive projects. We will see his administration in court.\u201d\n\nRelated: Quick action Trump could take on energy, environment, climate\n\nOn top of that, President Trump is proposing a border-adjustment tax as part of his larger tax reform push for this year. The idea is that products exported from the U.S. will be exempted from tax while at the same time companies will no longer be able to deduct the expenses of imports from their tax bill. The proposal is highly controversial and it would have huge ramifications for the oil industry.\n\nThe effects of such a tax would be complex, but would boil down to prioritizing U.S.-produced oil and gas, making oil from Canada less competitive. Oil from the U.S. shale patch would be priced at a premium to oil from abroad because of the tax. If such a tax were passed it would damage the prospects of oil exported through the Keystone XL Pipeline. President Trump would be pursuing one of his priorities at the expense of another.\n\nFinally, Canada has moved on since the Obama administration rejected the pipeline back in 2015. Just a few weeks ago the Canadian government gave the greenlight to Kinder Morgan\u2019s Trans Mountain Expansion, which would nearly triple the volume of the pipeline\u2019s existing line from 300,000 to 890,000 bpd, taking Alberta oil to the Pacific coast for export. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also approved Enbridge\u2019s Line 3, a more than $7 billion overhaul of a pipeline that runs from Alberta to Wisconsin in the U.S., taking Canadian oil to Midwestern refineries. Enbridge\u2019s project has received considerably less attention from environmental activists, but it would double the pipeline\u2019s capacity to 760,000 bpd. The two pipelines together would add more capacity than Keystone XL would. The midstream market is different than it was back when Keystone XL was the only game in town. It is not at all clear that Keystone XL makes sense anymore with two major competing pipelines now moving forward.\n\nIn short, President Trump, with the stroke of a pen, has put Keystone XL back on the map. But it will take more than that for the pipeline to move forward.\n\nThis article originally appeared on OilPrice.com: Read more from OilPrice.com\n\nAramco Pulls Out Of Joint Venture Talks With Petronas\n\nIs Libya A Bigger Threat To Oil Prices Than U.S. Shale?\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s Rhetoric: U.S. Needs OPEC Oil"}, {"date": "2017/01/25", "title": "Is This How Trump Will Get Mexico to \u2018Pay\u2019 for His Wall?", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/25/How-Trump-Will-Get-Mexico-Pay-His-Wall", "text": "Since the earliest moments of his campaign for the White House, President Donald Trump has promised that he will build a wall on the Mexican border and that he will force the Mexican government to pay for it.\n\nThe promise to wring funds out of Mexico for a barrier meant to block its own people from entering the U.S. always seemed a bit far-fetched, and only became more so when the Mexican government angrily announced that it would never pay for Trump\u2019s pet project. But Trump never stopped insisting that the funds for the wall would come from Mexico, even if he eventually began tweaking his explanation of how it would happen.\n\nRelated: Before the Wall, 18 Photos of the US-Mexico Border\n\nThe payment might not be a direct exchange of funds, he began suggesting over the past year, but might involve the U.S. extracting money from the Mexican government by other means. Later, he moved from the \u201cwill pay for\u201d the wall to a \u201cwill reimburse us for the wall\u201d argument. That change, he said, was so that construction could start right away.\n\nIn an interview with ABC News Monday, Trump said that he expects construction on the wall to begin within months and gave an even more convoluted explanation of how Mexico will \u201c100 percent\u201d be made to finance it.\n\n\u201cAll it is, is we'll be reimbursed at a later date from whatever transaction we make from Mexico,\u201d he told reporter David Muir. \u201cI\u2019m just telling you there will be a payment. It will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form. What I\u2019m doing is good for the United States. It\u2019s also going to be good for Mexico. We want to have a very stable, very solid Mexico.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, though, when he signed what the White House described as an executive order that would launch construction of the wall as well as significantly toughen border enforcement, Trump may also have dropped a more substantive hint about how he might be able to claim that Mexico \u201cpaid\u201d for the project.\n\nRelated: Homeland Security Just Gave Trump an Alarming Reason to Tighten the Border\n\nBuried in the order is this direction to federal agencies:\n\n\u201cThe head of each executive department and agency shall identify and quantify all sources of direct and indirect Federal aid or assistance to the Government of Mexico on an annual basis over the past five years, including all bilateral and multilateral development aid, economic assistance, humanitarian aid, and military aid.\u201d\n\nIt goes on to submit that list to the secretary of state within 30 days. The order then gives the State Department another 60 days to \u201csubmit to the President a consolidated report reflecting the levels of such aid and assistance that has been provided annually, over each of the past five years.\u201d\n\nMexico is one of the larger but by no means the largest recipients of foreign aid from the United States. The Mexican government and military received nearly $420 million in assistance in 2013, with most of the money going to economic development.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear from the text of the order what the purpose of the data collection is, but it is at least plausible that Trump is considering one of two possible courses of action. First, he could present the figures to Mexico and use the threat of withdrawal of the aid as leverage to compel some sort of payment for the wall.\n\nRelated: Are Mass Deportations Coming in the US?\n\nAlternatively, he could cut out the middleman and just try to withhold aid payments until he feels he can make a credible case that Mexico has actually \u201cpaid\u201d for the wall.\n\nWhatever the eventual plan, the move on Tuesday is certain to anger the United States\u2019 southern neighbor. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is supposed to meet with Trump next week, but reports from the Mexican capital early Tuesday suggested that if Trump went forward with the executive order, he might cancel his trip to Washington."}, {"date": "2017/01/25", "title": "Here's Who Could Be the Most Powerful Player on Trump's Team", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/25/Heres-Who-Could-Be-Most-Powerful-Player-Trumps-Team", "text": "It is probably too early and too strong to say that parallel governments are emerging in Washington \u2013 one disturbing, the other reassuring \u2013 but in its first week, the Trump administration is showing two faces.\n\nRelated: US No Longer a \u2018Full Democracy,\u2019 but It\u2019s Not Trump\u2019s Fault: Report\n\nOn one side of the Potomac, there is the never-ending carnival that took the crazy train from Trump Tower to the White House: Kellyanne Conway spouts \u201calternative facts\u201d and Sean Spicer plays the calliope as the stream-of-consciousness barker goes on about mounting an investigation into how the \u201cillegals\" cost him the election, about crowd size at the inauguration, about going back into Iraq to snatch the oil, about \u201cTheWall\u201d and about whatever else pops into his presidential head.\n\nOn the other side, newly installed Defense Secretary James Mattis, the former Marine general whom some conservatives once talked about as a candidate to challenge Donald Trump, has hit the ground running like a gung-ho recruit on Parris Island.\n\nIn contrast to a White House said to be beset by back-biting and turf wars, Mattis appears to be thoughtfully assembling a team and making smart strategic moves. That may help offset the show on Pennsylvania Avenue that the wide-eyed world is watching -- sometimes appalled and trembling, sometimes pointing and giggling.\n\nAs the Military Times reported on Monday, Mattis has made three key appointments. Deputy Defense Secretary Bob Work, another former Marine officer and a Pentagon professional who served in the Obama administration, has been asked to stay on to smooth the transition and manage the bureaucracy, at least for the short term.\n\nRear Admiral Craig Faller will be the chief uniformed adviser to Mattis. A combat veteran with deep experience in the Middle East and Asia, Faller once worked for the late Senator Ted Kennedy and has dealt with lawmakers on Capitol Hill as the Navy\u2019s chief of legislative affairs.\n\nAs his chief of staff, Mattis has appointed retired Rear Admiral Kevin Sweeney, who the Military Times said is seen as a manager familiar with the inner workings of the Pentagon.\n\nRelated: How an Important NATO Ally Is Dealing With Putin -- and Trump\n\nMore important, the Military Times quoted a Pentagon spokesman as saying Mattis had reached out to NATO allies, including the NATO secretary general and the British and Canadian defense ministers. CNN said he reassured them of America\u2019s \u201cunshakeable commitment\u201d to the alliance.\n\nThat was no doubt intended to counter-balance Trump, who rattled NATO with talk during the campaign about alliance partners not paying their fair share and has repeatedly offered warm words for Russian President Vladimir Putin, NATO\u2019s chief antagonist.\n\nWhen asked about Mattis\u2019 outreach, Press Secretary Spicer said on Tuesday: \"I think that Secretary Mattis and others have some ideas about how to reform and make organizations like NATO more effective and benefit the amount of money that the United States is putting [in] whether it's NATO or the UN or other organizations like that. But I think [Trump] is not pleased in terms of what he sees in terms of the U.S. contribution and the output it's getting.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Trump announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership as he promised during the campaign, but as numerous news stories and commentaries have pointed out, one of the goals of TPP was to counter the influence of China. By pulling back from the 12-nation trade deal, the new President gives an opening to Beijing, whom he also repeatedly railed against on his way to the Oval Office.\n\nAlmost on cue, it was announced that Mattis will visit Japan and South Korea next month in his first official visit outside the U.S. as Defense Secretary. The purpose, according to The Financial Times, is to reassure America\u2019s Asian allies.\n\nIn his first memo to the Defense Department, issued on Inauguration Day, Mattis also signaled that he would work closely with the Intelligence Community, which took a beating from Trump both as a candidate and as the president-elect. Even a conciliatory visit by the president to the CIA wound up hitting an off note, with Trump standing in front of a wall commemorating fallen and largely unsung officers to complain about the media distorting attendance figures for the inauguration.\n\nWith former Republican congressman Mike Pompeo, a West Point graduate, now confirmed as CIA director and the nomination of former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to be secretary of state moving forward, Mattis may soon have other grown-ups governing, too.

In September 2015, Politico Magazine asked Michelle Dresbold, who analyzes handwriting for the U.S. Secret Service, to evaluate the signatures the presidential candidates. Here\u2019s what she said about then candidate Donald Trump:\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s signature has absolutely no curves, only angles. Curves in handwriting show softness, nurturing and a maternal nature. Angles show a writer who is feeling angry, determined, fearful, competitive or challenged. When a script is completely devoid of curves, the writer lacks empathy and craves power, prestige and admiration. Besides the bigheadedness that shows in this script, there is something else that is rather over-sized\u2014the \u201cp\u201d in \u201cTrump.\u201d This large phallic symbol shouts, \u201cMe \u2026 big hunk of man.\u201d\n\nIf Dresbold\u2019s analysis is even mildly correct, Trump has made a huge leap toward power since the election. Note, in particular, that the \u2018p\u2019 is now the largest element in the signature. The dramatic difference between the two signatures over the last 16 months is the difference between an uncertain candidate and a triumphant sitting president.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther analysts have examined the signature. Tracey Trussell of the British Institute of Graphologists explains in the The Independent that the large writing, upright slant and long tall letters indicate a whole host of characteristics about Mr. Trump. Ms. Trussell says: \u201cHis signature transmits wild ambition, dynamism, bravery and fearlessness ... He's hungry for power and has both determination and stubbornness in spades.\u201d She claims that Mr. Trump's style indicates that, despite his forceful nature, he is protective too, especially when it comes to his family.\n\nCNN quotes graphologist Kathi McKnight on Trump\u2019s signature: \"Needle-sharp points and wedges throughout reveal acute analytical and lightning speed quick thinking. No softness is found anywhere in his handwriting.\u201d\n\nAt Quartz, handwriting expert Marc J. Seifer, who observed the ceremonial signing, noted how deliberate Trump\u2019s penmanship was. He sees Trump\u2019s strokes as a mirror of his leadership style. \u201cI also noticed that the last letter \u2018d\u2019 is made by moving to the left instead of the right, which reflects his nature, which goes against the grain,\u201d he notes. \u201cThe use of all angles relates to his aggressive nature and tendency to see things black or white, one way or the other, with little room for compromise.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/01/25", "title": "Meet the Man Who Will Explain Trump to the World\u2019s Great Economic Powers", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/25/Meet-Man-Who-Will-Explain-Trump-World-s-Great-Economic-Powers", "text": "President Trump, who has promised to utterly reshape the United States\u2019 economic relationship with the rest of the world, has named the man who will be the public face of that change for many of the country\u2019s top partners and allies.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported early Tuesday that Kenneth I. Juster, a managing partner with the private equity firm Warburg Pincus, has been named deputy assistant to the president for international economic affairs. He will fill a policymaking position with responsibilities that extend across multiple federal departments and agencies, including the departments of State, Treasury and Commerce, and the Office of the United States Trade Representative.\n\nRelated: It Looks Like Trump Is Serious About Starting a Trade War With China\n\nJuster will also be in charge of managing the White House\u2019s relationship with key international bodies, including the Group of Seven, made up of the largest industrialized economies, and the G20, made up of the 20 largest economies in the world. That by itself will be a challenging role given Trump\u2019s intention to radically rewrite trade policy.\n\nFurther, Juster will have to navigate a Trump administration in which some traditional roles have been scrambled, particularly when it comes to issues of international trade.\n\nJuster brings considerable experience to the role. A Harvard-trained lawyer, he has served multiple stints in the federal government, including several years as deputy and senior adviser to Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger in the final years of the George H. W. Bush administration. He returned to government service in 2001, serving in the first term of the George W. Bush administration as an undersecretary of Commerce in charge of the Bureau of Industry and Security, which overseas export control and trade-related treaty compliance, among other things.\n\nAfter leaving the government, he worked as a senior executive at the software firm Salesforce until joining Warburg Pincus in 2010.\n\nRelated: Democrats Block Trump at Their Peril as Labor Climbs Aboard Trump Train\n\nJuster will enter a White House that from an international trade perspective looks different from those he may have been familiar with in the past. President Trump has promised to tear up multilateral trade deals, both long-standing agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement and others that have not even been ratified, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which he effectively killed shortly after taking office.\n\nThe administration has said that the president believes the U.S. ought to negotiate trade deals country by country, because he believes that maximizes the leverage the White House has to extract the best possible terms for the country.\n\nIn addition, Trump has set up a structure in the White House in which the traditional duties of the USTR have been thinned out somewhat. For example, incoming Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is expected to play a larger-than-normal role in setting trade policy.\n\nTrump has also created an entirely new entity in the West Wing, the National Trade Council, and has named University of California-Irvine economist Peter Navarro to run it. When the creation of the council was announced, transition team members suggested it would occupy status similar to the National Security Council in Trump\u2019s hierarchy of advisors.\n\nRelated: Trump v.

Trump. Nevertheless, I'm going to stick my neck out: Within four years, President Trump will tank the economy.\n\nFirst off, a few things that I don't think will matter, since a lot of other commentators obsess over them: Trump's erratic behavior isn't going to panic the stock market, and his changes to global trade arrangements will be modest, perhaps even positive.\n\nRelated: 5 States That Would Get Hit Hardest in a Trump Trade War\n\nWorries to the contrary all make a similar mistake: They assume the wealthy and their willingness to invest is the central driver of economic action. Instead what matters is the activity of ordinary people: their trades, their purchases, their daily work, their small risks, their ongoing efforts to make life for their families a bit better. Without all that, there are no financial assets for investors to park their money in.\n\nThis brings us to Trump and the Congressional GOP.\n\nIt's unlikely their policies will create a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. They could if they dismantled Dodd-Frank's financial regulations, but the Republicans' majority in the Senate isn't anywhere near big enough to break a filibuster. To paraphrase Tolstoy, all happy economies are the same; all unhappy ones are unhappy in their own way.\n\nInstead, Trump and the Republicans will gut the U.S. budget, and thus the economy, via reconciliation, a Senate procedural move that allows lawmakers to pass bills with simple majorities if they're solely concerned with budgetary questions. They'll use this tool to suck hundreds of billions of dollars out of ordinary economic activity every year, depriving Americans of spending money, shrinking business revenue, lowering investment, and cutting tens of thousands of government jobs. This will lead to even less macro-economic spending, thus sending the economy into a tailspin.\n\nRelated: As the US Turns Inward, China Picks Up the Mantle of Free Trade\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan has his budget ready to go, which would take an axe to Medicaid, food stamps, housing assistance, and the rest of the safety net. Then there's another budget-slashing proposal from the arch-conservative Heritage Foundation, which is apparently serving as a basis for Trump's plans as well. As The Hill just reported, these cuts would extend far beyond the safety net, and decimate most of the government's investments in civil society.\n\nA quick sampling: Programs at the Department of Justice that deal with civil rights and violence against women will be reduced or eliminated; energy programs to promote nuclear physics, green energy, efficiency, and more will be cut; the Corporation for Public Broadcasting would be privatized; the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities would be wiped out entirely. Tens of billions will be cut from energy subsidies, transit, water conservation, and more.\n\nEvery safety net program is extra money in people's pockets to spend in their communities, sustaining business and the jobs they create. Every government project invested in, every staff position created, is one more person with a paycheck, who can then go out and spend, producing ripples through the private sector, and leading to more investment and more hiring. Trumps' cuts will bleed hundreds of billions of dollars out of those virtuous cycles every year.\n\nTo get a sense of the sheer scale of the change, the total reductions in the Heritage blueprint come to $10.5 trillion over the next decade. That's roughly one quarter of all federal spending. That's truly gargantuan.\n\nNow, some of the cuts in Heritage's budget are to Medicare and Social Security, which Trump is staying away from so far. Ultimately, the GOP may even balk at repealing ObamaCare's subsidies. All of which would bring that $10.5 trillion down to $7.5 trillion or $6.5 trillion. Which is still a gargantuan sum.\n\nOn top of that, Trump's appointments to the Federal Reserve will probably slow the economy further. During his campaign, the president was all over the place on monetary policy. But he eventually settled on the standard GOP line: Tight money and higher interest rates. This would be like tying weights to the economy's back after Trump's budgets have already bled it by a thousand cuts.\n\nRelated: Trump vs. the Dollar: Why Investors Are Right to Be Nervous\n\nOne could argue that Trump's tax cuts will offset all this. They could add up to $6 trillion themselves to the debt over 10 years, though right now no one really knows what Trump is planning. But the vast bulk of those cuts would not put money back in the pockets of ordinary workers and consumers. They would put money back in the pockets of wealthy investors. Even Trump's much-ballyhooed infrastructure plan is reportedly going to be graft for big business via corporate tax cuts. All in all, spending reductions will probably far outweigh tax cuts, at least in terms of the economic activity that drives most economic growth.\n\nTo get a sense of the sheer scale of the change, the total reductions in the Heritage blueprint come to $10.5 trillion over the next decade.

Trump could defy his party and resist more than just the cuts to Social Security and Medicare. Or he could switch back to his old love for low interest rates. Or the Republicans themselves could just wimp out in the face of popular backlash. All of that seems unlikely, though.\n\nMy analysis might even be too optimistic. Trump is a consummate salesman but an empty vessel when it comes to policy.

Them\u2019 Playbook\n\nHowever, the respected 70-year-old research and analysis division of the same company that publishes The Economist newspaper says that Trump\u2019s election is a symptom of broader failings of American democracy, not its cause.\n\n\u201cPopular trust in government, elected representatives and political parties have fallen to extremely low levels in the US,\u201d the report says. \u201cThis has been a long-term trend and one that preceded the election of Mr. Trump as US president in November 2016. By tapping a deep strain of political disaffection with the functioning of democracy, Mr. Trump became a beneficiary of the low esteem in which US voters hold their government, elected representatives, and political parties, but he was not responsible for a problem that has had a long gestation.\u201d\n\nThe US, it adds, had been \u201cteetering on the brink\u201d of falling out of the ranks of full democracies, and would have done so in this year\u2019s report even if there had been no presidential election at all.\n\nThe EIU democracy rankings are based on a ten-point scale, with a score based on combined rating of Electoral process and pluralism, the functioning of government, political participation, political culture, and civil liberties.\n\nRelated: Trump Outlines an \u2018America First\u2019 Agenda in a Dark Inaugural Address\n\nA cumulative score below 8.0 drops a country out of the \u201cfull democracy\u201d ranks and into those of \u201cflawed democracies,\u201d where the US now keeps company with countries that include Italy, Botswana, Sri Lanka, and Mexico.\n\nDragging the country\u2019s score down was its rating in the \u201cfunctioning of government\u201d (7.14) and \u201cpolitical participation\u201d (7.22) categories.\n\nThe EIU cites multiple \u201clong-standing reasons\u201d for the decline in the country\u2019s government function ranking, including \u201cideological entrenchment of congressional representatives\u201d leading to \u201cbitter partisanship.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe upshot is a stronger emphasis on ideological purity and less appetite for compromise, which reinforces a lack of confidence in Congress among voters. Nevertheless, respect for the constitution and democratic values are deeply entrenched as a result of centuries of democratic practice. For urgent and crucial decisions majorities can normally be obtained, but solutions to long-term problems often fall victim to deadlock.\u201d\n\nRelated: No, Trump Didn\u2019t Just Make the Day He Took Office a National Holiday\n\nThe EIU report, being descriptive rather than prescriptive, doesn\u2019t offer the country a roadmap back to full democracy status. However, it offers some hope that economic growth could help ameliorate some of the country\u2019s problems.\n\n\u201cIf income inequality has exacerbated American trust in government and public institutions, continued economic progress should start to reverse this trend in the coming years. The unemployment rate has fallen below 5 percent, average hourly wage growth is at its highest level since the financial crisis, and income inequality should gradually narrow if the economic recovery continues. If these trends are maintained, the US could improve in our 2017 rankings.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/01/25", "title": "Homeland Security Just Gave Trump a New Reason to Build the Wall", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/25/Homeland-Security-Just-Gave-Trump-Alarming-Reason-Tighten-Border", "text": "In November 2016, the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security unveiled a bombshell: After spending 11 years and $3.1 billion, the automated immigration processing system designed to prevent terrorists from entering the United States simply didn\u2019t work.\n\nThe U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\u2019 new Electronic Immigration System, ELIS, was supposed to speed up the cumbersome, complex system for processing immigrants seeking legal status. Instead, it did the opposite because of a spate of technical problems and poorly conceived specifications. Operational deficiencies ranging from frequent power outages to the inability of ELIS to access or add information to existing digital platforms added hours of human labor. Naturalization cases frequently got stuck in the ELIS workflow and applicant interviews were often mistakenly canceled.\n\nRelated: Are Mass Deportations Coming in the US? Paul Ryan Says No\n\nWorst of all: ELIS is so highly flawed that it could grant citizenship to people who \u201cpose national security threats.\u201d Not only could ineligible immigrants be approved, you might not know if they had a criminal record or ties to terrorism because of the glitches in the system. And here\u2019s the kicker: ELIS had erroneously issued nearly 20,000 green cards, granting legal status to live and work in the US to people who were almost certainly improperly vetted.\n\n\u201cSince its deployment on April 13, 2016, ELIS has impaired the ability of USCIS Immigration Services Officers and field personnel to conduct naturalization processing,\u201d said John Roth, the inspector general. Roth thought he had received assurances from USCIS that it would mothball the pricey computer system until the multitude of problems had been ironed out.\n\nBut late last week, Roth was forced to issue a cease and desist order to Leon Rodriquez, Director of USCIS, after learning that the agency intended to resume operation of ELIS before all the kinks were worked out.\n\nRelated: Trump Stands Alone Calling for Mass Deportation of Illegal Immigrants\n\nThe Homeland Security Inspector was no doubt spitting bullets by this time, since he had issued multiple warnings over many months to Rodriguez who had not only ignored Roth\u2019s recommendation but also denied the problem, according to a report in NextGov.\n\nRoth said that during an ongoing follow-up investigation by his staff in the USCIS headquarters and field operations he had discovered \u201calarming security concerns regarding inadequate applicant background checks, as well as significant problems in using ELIS to process naturalization benefits for immigrants.\u201d\n\nHomeland Security is not the only federal agency to spend taxpayer money freely with little to show for it. In 2015, the Brookings Institution assessed government investment in IT projects and concluded, \u201cU.S. government spent 75.6 billion dollars on IT projects in 2014. That is enough to save the world and still have 600 million dollars to spare.\u201d A study by the Standish Group revealed that only 6.4 percent of federal IT projects costing $10 million or more were successful.\n\nAt a time when the debate over immigration and terrorism has reached a fevered pitch, the debacle over a vital new computer system for vetting immigrants seeking to enter the country is remarkable.\n\nRelated: Trump Will Deport Millions of Illegal Immigrants with Criminal Records\n\nPresident Donald Trump won the election on a pledge to crack down on illegal immigrants and deny entry to the U.S. by Muslims or people from countries experiencing rampant terrorist violence. Today, Trump signed an executive order to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border, and he has promised to beef up border patrols and immigration services. Like President Obama before him, Trump also plans to deport millions of illegal immigrants with criminal records. But Trump is going further by proposing that immigrants from countries that are experiencing terrorism be barred from the U.S.\n\nTrump might want to look as well at a failing immigration computer system that the Homeland Security inspector general says poses a threat to national security. The USCIS press office declined to comment for this story.\n\nELIS dates back nearly a decade as a system originally designed and budgeted to cost $536 million. Those numbers went out the window long ago as costs are now projected to be 480 percent higher. Promises of state of the art vetting and administrative efficiencies never materialized, while the long-delayed website won\u2019t be fully operational for another two years or more, if ever.\n\n(This article was updated on January 26, 2017)"}, {"date": "2017/01/25", "title": "Environmentalists\u2019 Worst Fears About Trump Are Coming True", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/25/Environmentalists-Worst-Fears-About-Trump-Are-Coming-True", "text": "President Donald Trump on Tuesday morning declared himself an \u201cenvironmentalist\u201d in public remarks before meeting with automobile manufacturers, but as the day wore on, he and his new administration seemed intent on realizing the worst fears of the broader conservation movement.\n\nIn the same breath in which he characterized himself as an environmentalist, Trump said that he believes that the movement is \u201cout of control\u201d and promised a \u201cvery big push\u201d to have more cars built in the United States. He also promised for the second day in a row to roll back regulations that he said are stifling the productivity of U.S. businesses. On Monday, he told a different group of business leaders that he believes he could do away with 75 percent of federal regulations or more.\n\nRelated: Trump v. Truth: How Will the New Administration Make Policy?\n\nJust a few hours after the meeting with automakers, Trump signed executive orders that, according to the White House, direct federal agencies to clear the way for construction of two controversial oil pipelines, Keystone XL and the Dakota Access Pipeline. Both are adamantly opposed by environmental groups that say they promote the use of highly-polluting fuels and pose the danger of leaks and explosions.\n\nThe Obama administration had essentially killed the Keystone project, and Trump\u2019s plan invites Trans Canada, its builder, to re-submit its application. The Dakota Access Pipeline, subject of intense protests this fall and winter, was indefinitely delayed by the Obama administration before Trump was sworn in last Friday.\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t enough to send environmental activists to the barricades, multiple federal agencies dealing with the environment, agriculture and public health received instructions from Trump administration officials to cease all communications with the public -- and in some cases even with members of Congress.\n\nSpeaking from the podium at the White House on Tuesday afternoon, Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that what many began referring to as a \u201cgag order\u201d was simply an effort by the Trump administration to assure that the messages coming out of various government agencies were in line with the new president\u2019s policies.\n\nRelated: How the Senate Could Stop Trump's Drive to Slash Federal Spending\n\nHowever, the fact that scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency, parts of the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Health and Human Services were instructed to cease all public communication on Tuesday -- a move that appeared to include the publication of new data to the agencies\u2019 websites -- played right into existing fears among many in the scientific community.\n\nOf particular concern is what the new administration\u2019s policies will be with regard to climate science. Trump\u2019s decision to appoint Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to head the EPA made it seem clear to many that those policies will not track with the preferences of environmental groups. Pruitt spent much of his time as attorney general filing lawsuits against the EPA, claiming that the agency\u2019s regulations on the oil and gas industry are unconstitutional.\n\nIn the months between Trump\u2019s unexpected election victory and his swearing in last Friday, environmental groups and scientific organizations had begun an unofficial effort to gather and safeguard research data and other government information related to the subject of global warming and climate change. The fear among many was that the Trump administration would reduce the focus on climate science within the federal government and that it might also make federally collected data that outside academics and researchers rely on unavailable.\n\nToday\u2019s announcements came just as news outlets began widely reporting on a National Institutes of Health conference on the public health threats posed by global warming that was cancelled, apparently out of concern that the new administration would not approve of it."}, {"date": "2017/01/25", "title": "Democrats Block Trump at Their Peril as Labor Climbs Aboard Trump Train", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/01/25/Democrats-Block-Trump-Their-Peril-Labor-Climbs-Aboard-Trump-Train", "text": "House Speaker Paul Ryan has invited President Trump to address a joint session of Congress on February 28. This is a genius move. If Democrats boycott the gathering, as some surely will, they will commit political suicide.\n\nMore positively, maybe Trump can convince members of both parties to do what is right for the country: enact tax reforms that benefit small and large businesses, reduce the regulations that inhibit investment, and push healthcare reform that will actually give middle-class families access to medical care.\n\nRelated: The Smart Money Is Betting Against Full Obamacare Repeal\n\nRyan announced the invitation in his weekly press conference, explaining, \u201cThis will be an opportunity for the people and their representatives to hear directly from our new president about his vision and our shared agenda.\u201d In other words, unfiltered through the mainstream media. A Ryan spokesman earlier said, \u201cThe Speaker and President Trump are eager to continue moving forward on their shared agenda to jumpstart the economy and get the country back on track.\u201d\n\nWill Democrats play ball? Maybe not. Democrats have so far opposed every single proposal from Trump, demeaned and criticized nearly every cabinet nominee, sat out the inauguration in large numbers and generally conducted themselves as sore losers. If they persist, they will further alienate the group that elected Donald Trump \u2013 middle-class Americans who have traditionally supported Democrats -- and relinquish any hope of rebuilding their decimated party.\n\nThe Trump agenda is beginning to roll forward, picking up followers like a snowball picks up snow. In particular, labor unions and American workers are cheering some of the very first measures signed by the president \u2013 walking away from the TPP and green-lighting the Keystone Pipeline. On Monday, shortly after announcing the official termination of the multi-nation trade agreement, the president met with labor leaders who applauded his move. Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa said in a written statement, \u201cWith this decision, the president has taken the first step toward fixing 30 years of bad trade policies that have cost working Americans millions of good-paying jobs.\u201d\n\nRelated: How Donald Trump Is Winning His War on Hollywood\n\nSean McGarvey, president of the North America\u2019s Building Trades Unions, said after the confab (most of which was private), \u201cHe intends to do the work on the issues he discussed on the campaign trail\u2026It was by far the best meeting I\u2019ve had in Washington.\u201d\n\nThis new-found harmony between the GOP and Big Labor should have Democrats shivering in their Gucci\u2019s. The party is in the midst of the sort of intensive self-analysis that accompanies a colossal defeat. They continue to pin Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss on Vladimir Putin and James Comey, ignoring the real reason for their defeat: the defection of their core constituency, blue collar workers.\n\nMoreover, anxious Democrats are looking in the wrong places for salvation. There are some who see in last Saturday\u2019s large and news-grabbing women\u2019s march the seeds of renewal. They liken the outpouring of millions of exuberant demonstrators to the stirrings of the Tea Party in the early days of the Obama administration. They are wrong. The activists who railed against rising deficits and debts, kicked into action by Rick Santelli\u2019s famous on-air rant and call for a \u201cTea Party,\u201d did indeed rouse Republicans from the depths of despair and help put the party back on the map. But the call to action was a national call, appealing to all Americans who worried about the country\u2019s soaring debts and unsustainable spending.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s How Inflation Could Suck the Wind Out of Trump\u2019s Economy\n\nBy contrast, the marchers in Washington and other cities around the world had no unifying theme. It was not pro-women; after all, pro-life women\u2019s groups were excluded. It was a crew of often vulgar anti-Trump sloganeers who were championing the kind of identity politics that Democrats have embraced to their peril for the past eight years. This was the weekend of a presidential inauguration; for most Americans a time of national pride. There was no such sentiment offered up by the women in the streets.\n\nColumnist David Brooks points out that the marchers \u201ccould have offered a red, white and blue alternative patriotism, a modern, forward-looking patriotism based on pluralism, dynamism, growth, racial and gender equality and global engagement. Instead, the protests offered the pink hats, an anti-Trump movement built, oddly, around Planned Parenthood, and lots of signs with the word \u201cpussy\u201d in them.\u201d\n\nNot quite the cohesive message that will start a political movement, which is the only kind that matters.\n\nThe same issues arise as Democrats consider who will lead their party out of the darkness. There are now three African-Americans, two whites and one Hispanic vying for the position. At a recent candidates\u2019 forum, Sally Boynton Brown, who is white, garnered attention by saying that if successful, her job will be to \u201cshut other white people down\u201d; she lambasted fellow Democrats for not talking enough about Black Lives Matter and said if selected, she would make sure that \u201c[white people] get that they have privilege.\u201d Is that really the burning issue for Democrats today? Or for the country?\n\nRelated: Why Trump Can\u2019t Turn Back the Clock on Clean Energy Transition\n\nPresident Obama left office with high approval ratings even though he arguably never put the country\u2019s overriding concern \u2013 job creation \u2013 at the top of his agenda. Instead, Obama catered largely to environmental and minority issues, leaving behind a nation more divided that when he took office. Hillary Clinton lost in part because she mistook Obama\u2019s personal popularity for approval of his policies.\n\nIn 2018, there are 10 Democratic senators up for reelection in states that Trump won; five in states that Trump won decisively. Some, like West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin, have already started to back Trump\u2019s policies. Others may follow suit, undermining the current brick wall of Democrat opposition to Donald Trump. If they don\u2019t climb aboard the Trump train, the GOP could well enter 2019 with a filibuster-proof majority.\n\nDemocrats have a chance to work with President Trump to boost the economy and raise incomes. So far, newly elected Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has promised no cooperation and pledged no backing down. He could play the part of Bill Clinton\u2019s Newt Gingrich or Ronald Reagan\u2019s Tip O\u2019Neil, the loyal opposition helping to pass popular legislation and at the same time build up his party.

The reason that you know about these things is because we have made that information available in real time as required by the House Ethics Committee.\u201d\n\nWhile the questions about his stock trades have caused some discomfort for Price, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much wavering about his nomination in the ranks of Senate Republicans, who would be able to confirm him with a simple majority vote.\n\nRelated: The Potential Cost of Obamacare Repeal: 32 Million Without Insurance\n\nWyden also asked Price to address the executive order issued by President Trump on the day of his inauguration that directed all government agencies to \u201cexercise all authority and discretion available to them to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications.\u201d\n\nThe order left many wondering if the new president\u2019s plan was to begin disassembling the Affordable Care Act even before Congress passed a repeal bill.\n\nWyden, saying that rolling back the law without a replacement would \u201cdestroy the market on which millions of working families buy health coverage,\u201d asked Price if he would commit to not acting on the order until a replacement for the ACA had been put in place.\n\nPrice declined to do so, saying that what he would commit to \u201cis to keep patients at the center of health care. And what that means to me is making sure every single American has access to affordable health coverage that provides the highest quality health care that the world can provide.\u201d\n\nRelated: Could a Hybrid Obamacare Plan Bring the GOP and Dems Together?\n\nPrice also dodged Wyden\u2019s attempt to get him to promise that nobody would be \u201cworse off\u201d under whatever replacement plan the administration puts forward. However, in later questioning, he went on to say that no one will lose coverage as a result and to agree to the promise that no one would be \u201cworse off.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to note, when Price refers to \u201caffordable health coverage,\u201d that the definition of \u201cinsurance coverage\u201d is all important in this discussion. The Congressional Budget Office has warned that some of the more bare-bones plans that opponents of Obamacare would like to see as offered as legitimate options after repeal would have such scant benefits that the agency would not consider them health insurance coverage at all.\n\nIn an exchange with New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez, Price appeared to be at least open to ending the status of Medicaid as an entitlement. Under the current structure of the program, anybody who meets the qualifications for the program is entitled -- has a right -- to receive care under it.\n\nThe Trump administration, however, has signaled its intention to turn the program into a block grant, under which each state would be given a fixed sum for the program, creating the possibility that coverage might not be available to all qualified applicants.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Will Test the Definition of \u2018Insurance\u2019\n\nPrice said he agreed with Menendez that under a block grant, there would not necessarily be a right to coverage under Medicaid. \u201cI think it would be determined by how it was set up, if that was in fact what Congress did.

Mick Mulvaney (R-SC) foreshadowed the Trump administration\u2019s drive to eliminate waste, fraud, and duplication of effort in government and scale back the size of the federal workforce.

In dollar terms, publicly held debt will increase from $14.8 trillion at the end of this year to $24.9 trillion by 2027, according to CBO\u2019s baseline analysis.\n\nRelated: CBO Says Deficit on the Rise for the First Time Since 2009\n\nPublicly held debt is the sum total of the government\u2019s borrowing to meet its obligations in a timely fashion, while the gross national debt \u2013 now closing in on $20 trillion \u2013 includes both the publicly held debt and internal government borrowing by agencies and trust funds like Social Security and Medicare.\n\n\u201cOur gross national debt has increased to almost $20 trillion,\u201d Mulvaney said today. \u201cThat number is so large as to defy description.\u201d\n\nWhile the national debt draws most of the attention and is viewed as the ultimate symbol of government waste and spending excesses, the CBO warns that the steadily mounting publicly held debt poses long-term threats to the economy and the government\u2019s ability to react to crises or unexpected expenses.\n\nAnnual deficits or revenue shortfalls are largely driven by mounting defense and domestic spending programs and entitlements for the elderly and low-income Americans. According to CBO\u2019s latest projections, budget deficits will remain below three percent of GDP through 2019, but then begin to climb dramatically \u2013 driven by spending on Social Security, Medicare for seniors and net interest costs on the debt.\n\nRelated: Big Deficits Loom as Candidates Pile on Spending and Tax Cuts\n\nBy 2027, the deficit will reach five percent of GDP, or $1.4 trillion, absent any change in government policies to address the long-term deficit.\n\nMaya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group, issued a statement describing the latest CBO report as a \u201cdangerous debt picture for the United States.\u201d\n\nMacGuineas and other deficit hawks have warned that Trump\u2019s agenda of major spending hikes combined with hefty tax cuts for individuals and corporations will greatly add to the country\u2019s long-term debt woes.

Her group did not score Trump\u2019s impact \u201cdynamically,\u201d meaning Trump\u2019s plans to reduce government spending are not accounted for in this estimate.\n\nTrump and his economic team, including Mulvaney, argue that the administration\u2019s spending and fiscal policies, including the tax cut, will turbocharge the economy and more than offset any revenue shortfalls in the long term. \u201cFixing the economy doesn\u2019t mean just taking a green eyeshade approach to the Budget,\u201d Mulvaney said today. \u201cOur government isn\u2019t just about numbers. A strong, healthy economy allows us to protect our most vulnerable.\u201d\n\nBut MacGuineas said, \u201cPolicymakers should not go into debt denial with hopes that unrealistic growth and rosy projections will save the day.

The S&P 500 healthcare sector has gained 2 percent since Election Day, compared with a 6.3 percent rise in the S&P 500 over the same time.\n\nBut hospital stocks such as HCA Holdings Inc have outperformed since the start of January on signs that Republicans plan to replace the Affordable Care Act at the same time they repeal it. Shares of HCA are up 7.9 percent since the start of the year, compared with a 1.2 percent gain in the S&P 500, and are trading slightly higher than they were on Election Day.\n\nAlthough repealing the law requires only a majority in the Senate, replacing it would require at least 60 votes in the Senate, meaning that Republicans would have to win some Democratic support. As a result, fund managers said they expect only incremental changes.\n\nA repeal without a replacement could put pressure on hospitals by rescinding the Medicaid expansion and individual subsidies, prompting more individuals to go without insurance and be unable to pay their hospital bills.\n\nRepresentative Tom Price, Trump's nominee for health secretary, said in a hearing Wednesday that the administration will initially focus on individual health plans sold on exchanges and is not interested in \"pulling the rug out on anybody,\" though he said it would also focus on Medicaid.\n\nRelated: Why Republicans Are Hitting the Brakes on Obamacare Repeal\n\nSome Republicans in Congress have been pushing for an outright repeal in order to give states more control of their healthcare programs. The House and Senate passed resolutions to have draft legislation that would repeal the law ready by Jan. 27. Other Republican senators have proposed that states have the option remain in the Obamacare insurance program.\n\nNOT \"A WHOLE LOT OF DISRUPTION\"\n\nEddie Yoon, portfolio manager of the $6.1 billion Fidelity Select Heath Care fund in Boston, has not changed his holdings since the election because he does not see large changes coming.\n\nHe said he remains bullish on the medical device and biotech industries because both do not look like they would be significantly affected by any of the Republican healthcare proposals. He expects the moratorium on a tax on medical device sales, due to expire at the end of 2017, will be extended, and that controls on drug prices floated by Trump are unlikely to be enacted.\n\n\"I don't think the new administration wants to get bogged down in healthcare and they want to move on to immigration and tax reform and bigger policy items,\" said Yoon. \"I don't anticipate that there will be a whole lot of disruption.\"\n\nBiotech may also benefit if Congress passes legislation that cuts the taxes companies pay on profits earned overseas, leaving pharmaceutical companies flush and ushering in a wave of mergers and acquisitions, he said.\n\nThe Nasdaq Biotechnlogy Index is up 3.8 percent since the beginning of the year after falling more than 20 percent last year.\n\nConnor Browne, a portfolio manager with the $889 million Thornburg Value fund in Santa Fe, New Mexico, said he added a position in biotech company Seattle Genetics Inc in late December. He also has been adding to his position in medical device makers in anticipation that little will be done to change the law, meaning that millions of Americans will still have insurance that will help pay for devices.\n\n\"While it hasn't so far paid to underestimate Donald Trump, it sure seems like we might be seeing indications that he doesn't understand how hard it will be to get legislation done,\" Browne said."}, {"date": "2017/01/24", "title": "How an Important NATO Ally Is Dealing With Putin -- and Trump", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/24/How-Important-NATO-Ally-Dealing-Putin-and-Trump", "text": "When the ready-room alarm went off\u2014high-low, high-low\u2014two Norwegian Air Force pilots pulled on cold-water survival gear, grabbed their flight bags, and sprinted through swirling snow to their hangars. Their decades-old F-16 fighter jets roared to life, and as the airport snowplow halted to let them pass, the jets taxied to the runway and lit the afterburners. The training run took less than ten minutes.\n\nNorway has long kept two jets on round-the-clock alert at this Arctic base, allowing NATO to put eyes on the Russian warplanes that round the North Cape and head southwest. And while Moscow\u2019s new assertiveness has Oslo preparing additional military units to react more quickly, defense officials here are also looking with concern toward Washington, where the incoming Trump administration has yet to articulate an unambiguous transatlantic security policy.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Blunders on NATO and Russia Make Our European Allies Cringe\n\n\u201cConcerned\u201d is a word we heard a lot last week, traveling with defense officials from Norway\u2019s Ministry of Defense in Oslo to this coastal base 50 miles above the Arctic Circle, and beyond. Defense One was part of a group of Americans\u2014analysts, former diplomats, and national-security officials\u2014brought here on a trip organized by the Atlantic Council, a NATO-oriented think tank in Washington, and sponsored by the Norwegian government.\n\nNorwegian defense officials spoke carefully about their changing situation. \u201cThe Baltic countries feel threatened; we don\u2019t feel threatened, but we see the potential,\u201d one said.\n\nBut they are concerned. The Russian ships, submarines, and aircraft that sortie westward from Murmansk and nearby airbases have been coming more frequently. It\u2019s been happening for a while; the first big jump came in 2007, when the number of Russian warplanes intercepted off Norway\u2019s coast increased fivefold. The operations are also growing more sophisticated; in October, Russian bombers took off from Arctic runways, threaded their way through international airspace near Gibraltar, and struck targets in Syria.\n\nIt was 2014\u2019s Crimean invasion that really woke people up, and not just in Norway. Several officials said that NATO had essentially stopped planning for the defense of Europe in the late 1990s, at least at a nuts-and-bolts level. That\u2019s being fixed, but now there is a new concern: a U.S. president who appears to care more about Russia than America\u2019s allies.\n\nRelated: Germany says NATO concerned about Trump 'obsolete' remark\n\nIn December, Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg visited Donald Trump, then the president-elect, who has alternately called the North Atlantic alliance \u201cobsolete,\u201d suggested that the U.S. might ignore its treaty obligations, and mused that perhaps NATO could change its central focus to counterterrorism. Solberg urged Trump to reconsider the alliance\u2019s importance, or at least to set a European policy and stick to it.\n\nDefense officials in Norway explained why. European unity is fragile: while northern and eastern Europe see Russia as the biggest looming problem, southern Europeans are stressed by migration flows from Syria and elsewhere. The populist sentiments that drove Brexit exist elsewhere in NATO. Even in Norway, where a 2011 terrorist attack damaged the prime minister\u2019s office in Oslo, there is little appetite for turning NATO into a primarily counterterror organization.\n\nEurope may roll with the punches, officials said, even if the United States decreases its support. But if the Trump administration cannot describe and commit to a stable position, they said, the extra uncertainty could make it impossible for European leaders to find consensus answers to key questions: What threats they should prioritize? And how much should each nation contribute to the common defense?\n\nView from the Underground Fortress\n\nNorwegians are encouraged by the selection of James Mattis as U.S. defense secretary. They fought beside him and under his command in Iraq and Afghanistan, developing such expertise in counterterrorism ops, one defense official said, that they knew the names of the principal opium traders in their areas of operations.\n\nNorway has long structured its military to contribute specialized groups of troops and gear to such missions. These deployments, along with operations and training exercises closer to home, are planned and monitored at National Joint Headquarters, an underground fortress sunk deep into a mountain near Bod\u00f8. Built in the 1950s and 1960s by extending Wehrmacht tunnels dug during the Nazi occupation, the facility was envisioned as a place where military commanders might survive the nuclear blows of a war with the Soviet Union. In the years after the Berlin Wall fell, its rough-hewn rock walls may have come to seem a bit anachronistic. They feel somewhat less so now.\n\nRelated: Donald Trump Is Right About Deadbeat NATO Countries\n\nIn the two-story operations center, a column of digital clocks displayed the time in Kabul, Erbil, Juba, Moscow, and Washington, as well as the military-standard Zulu. A smaller screen detailed foreign deployments: on Jan. 19, this country of just over five million people had 360 troops participating in a dozen operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, South Sudan, and elsewhere. The duty officers here direct troops at home and abroad, and even place a weekly Skype call to Russia\u2019s Northern Fleet headquarters, an exception to the general radio silence between Western and Russian militaries since 2014.\n\nUp on the giant video wall, a map of Norway showed the locations of military forces in green and blue. (Red squares denoting Russian assets had been scrubbed for our visit.) Even when they are not deployed abroad, Norwegian forces are active across a vast swath of the Arctic, with responsibility for an ocean area nearly as large as the Mediterranean Sea. Much of their training takes place in the same locales they might be called upon to defend.\n\nAmong their current concerns is the state of anti-submarine warfare in NATO. Drawn down after the Soviet fleet withered, the alliance\u2019s ASW capability is once again rising to meet a Russian buildup. Like the U.S. and UK, Norway is replacing some of its ancient P-3 sub-hunting planes with jet-powered P-8s. But officials here worry that the balance has shifted, and that the alliance might not be able to keep Russia\u2019s quieter, cruise-missile-armed subs from severing the transatlantic resupply line \u2014 that is, sinking the ships that would carry U.S. reinforcements to Europe if war broke out. It\u2019s a concern that has grown in importance since the U.S. pulled its large tank garrisons home. Norway wants its alliance partners, at least, to overhaul the ASW command structure and boost its importance.\n\nThe Next Few Years\n\nBack at the Bod\u00f8 air base, the wind off the Norwegian Sea picked up, grounding the day\u2019s training flights. Hail rattled off dining-hall windows while a few candles burned on side tables, adding their light to a dim January day. Elsewhere on this island, a northern node of NATO\u2019s cyber defense went about its work, its indoor practitioners impervious to the storm outside.\n\nIn the next few years, the Norwegian armed forces will spend much of their time and effort preparing to assimilate the new P-8s, along with a handful of new submarines and the 52 F-35A Joint Strike Fighters that represent Norway\u2019s biggest-ever non-energy investment. The military will continue to work on ways to contribute to operations around the world. But they will also, one defense official said, build up stocks of ammunition and spare parts, train to reduce reaction times, and prepare to move quickly if attacked.\n\nThey are, he said, concerned.\n\nThis article originally appeared at Defense One.

Stanley McChrystal when he was running the war in Afghanistan, Flynn is said to have distinguished himself with an uncanny ability to unravel terrorist networks and has been called \u201cone of the most respected military intelligence officers of his generation\u201d by The Washington Post. Such a record no doubt contributed to his selection by former President Obama to head the Defense Intelligence Agency, one of the military\u2019s major spy services.\n\nThe role of National Security Adviser has been in place since the beginning of the Cold War, and Flynn is by no means the first ex-officer to hold the critical post; former Lt. General Brent Scowcroft and former four-star Gen. and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell are among those who preceded him.\n\nIn fact, National Security Advisers have had a mixed-bag of qualifications, including careers as diplomats and academics. Notable examples are McGeorge Bundy, Walt Rostow, Henry Kissinger and Condoleezza Rice, all of whom became involved in disastrous military actions overseas.\n\nHowever, perhaps no recent appointment to this role has been as controversial as Flynn\u2019s, and it raises a question that begs to be answered, especially in light of the threats America faces and the fact that Trump, like the three presidents who came before him, has zero experience in foreign affairs: Why is one of the jobs most important to the safety of the nation not subject to Senate oversight?\n\nRelated: Day of the Generals: Trump\u2019s Tilt Toward the Military\n\nAccording to a Washington Post report last month, Flynn was investigated in 2010 when he was intelligence chief in Afghanistan for inappropriately sharing secrets with allies. But the more disturbing questions center on his activities and behavior after being ousted as head of the DIA, reportedly following clashes with other powerful spooks within the Obama administration.\n\nThe consulting firm he started, Flynn Intel Group, was a paid lobbyist for a Turkish businessman with ties to the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, according to The New York Times. And in an op-ed for The Hill on Nov. 8, Flynn identified the Pennsylvania-based mullah Fethullah G\u00fclen, a fierce opponent of the Erdo\u011fan regime, as a radical Islamist whose \u201cvast global network has all the right markings to fit the description of a dangerous sleeper terror network.\u201d\n\nGiven Flynn\u2019s intel bona fides, those charges are not to be taken lightly. But it is the general\u2019s hyperbolic tone, evident at Trump rallies where he led chants of \u201clock her up\u201d directed at Hillary Clinton, that seems alarming in an adviser charged with giving clear-headed opinions to a commander-in-chief who isn\u2019t known for keeping a cool head.\n\nBeyond that, Flynn was a purveyor of fake news during Trump\u2019s campaign and has recent history with Russia that is troubling: In 2015, he was a paid speaker for RT (formerly Russia Today) and attended an anniversary gala for the Kremlin-backed TV news network in Moscow, where he was seated at the right hand of President Vladimir Putin.\n\nRelated: Looks Like Flynn Is Manipulating Trump on Russia. Where\u2019s His Pink Slip?\n\nOn Sunday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Flynn was being investigated by U.S. counterintelligence for calls to Russian officials around the time Obama was imposing sanctions on Moscow for hacking and interfering in the American election (including by using RT to disseminate anti-Clinton stories). However, on Monday night a Post story said the FBI had reviewed intercepted communications between Flynn and the Russian ambassador to the U.S. and found \u201cno evidence of wrongdoing.\u201d How all that shakes out remains to be seen.\n\nBut if the Flynn appointment has had one beneficial effect, it has been to put a spotlight on the job he now holds. The Senate must confirm the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security and the Director of the CIA. It even gets to grill the nominee for Commerce Secretary. So why not the National Security Adviser? Because that job has never has required advice and consent? Because it doesn\u2019t control a major budget?\n\nGary Samore, executive director for research at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, offers another reason why Flynn or anyone else appointed to his position should not have to sit for a Senate grilling.\n\n\"In my experience, the Senate confirmation process is badly broken, with many lengthy delays or senators seeking to extract concessions in exchange for voting for nominees,\" said Samore, who served for four years as President Obama\u2019s White House Coordinator for Arms Control and Weapons of Mass Destruction. \"So I would not favor requiring Senate confirmation for the National Security Adviser.\"\n\nYou could also argue that there are numerous other advisers who have the president\u2019s ear and won\u2019t be vetted, some of whom may be highly influential. But given the checkered, life-and-death advice National Security Advisers have delivered in the past and given the clear-and-present dangers, shouldn't the nation have the right, through its elected representatives, to question the counselor whose views may directly affect its safety?\n\nWill Flynn be the honest broker that the role demands? That\u2019s hard to know if we don\u2019t get to ask him.\n\nThis article was updated at 6:14 p.m. on Jan. 24."}, {"date": "2017/01/24", "title": "Trump v.

From Saturday\u2019s falsehood-littered first media briefing to a meeting Monday night in which Trump insisted to lawmakers -- against all evidence -- that he had only lost the popular vote because millions of fraudulent votes were cast, the new administration has shown that it cares little about the literal truth of the information it gives the American public.\n\nThe mainstream media reaction has been palpably angry. In a remarkable series of tweets last night, The New York Times called out Trump and White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer for a collection of untruths. On its front page Tuesday, the paper addressed the president\u2019s claim about voter fraud with a headline that flatly said he was lying: \u201cMeeting with Top Lawmakers, Trump Repeats an Election Lie.\u201d\n\nRelated: How the Senate Could Stop Trump's Drive to Slash Federal Spending\n\nSo far, most of the new administration\u2019s mendacity has been focused on things that appear to embarrass Trump. That includes things like his popular vote loss to Hillary Clinton or the acres of empty space on the National Mall during his inauguration and the countless empty seats along the route of the parade that followed.\n\nBut as the inauguration fades into the past, what will be really instructive about the future direction of the Trump administration is how it deals with a different kind of fact -- the ones that, unlike crowd size and whether the skies miraculously cleared as soon as Trump began his inaugural address, actually have an impact on the lives of the American people.\n\nThat\u2019s what one reporter at Spicer\u2019s Monday afternoon press briefing appeared to be trying to get at when she asked him \u201cWhat is the average national unemployment rate?\u201d\n\nWhat many saw as a strange \u201cgotcha\u201d type query meant to catch Spicer out over a specific statistic, was really something else entirely. The official unemployment rate is currently 4.7 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but on the campaign trail, Trump frequently insisted that the official figures are fraudulent, insisting that the \u201creal\u201d rate could be as high as 42 percent.\n\nRelated: 5 States That Would Get Hit Hardest in a Trump Trade War\n\nThe issue the question was trying to probe is whether or not the Trump administration is going to accept the assessment of economists and other experts when they do their best to gather hard evidence about the state of the country.\n\nTo his credit, Spicer gave a rough description of how the BLS looks at unemployment in the country, pointing out that the official rate is one of several measures that the agency takes \u201cso that economists can view them and...look at different landscapes on...how to make economic policy.\u201d\n\nWithout trying to defend Trump\u2019s indefensible 42 percent claim, Spicer promised that in the White House, \u201c[the] economic team is going to look at a multitude of statistics and drive economic policies.\u201d However, Spicer also made it plain that when his boss thinks about things like unemployment and job creation, he is less focused on hard numbers than he is on what is, effectively, anecdotal evidence.\n\nRelated: Why Trump's Family and Friends Are in for Heavy Financial Scrutiny\n\n\u201c[W]hen he sees people that are hurting, that haven't had wages lifted up, that are unemployed, that can't save for their kids\u2019 future, that are having a trouble with their healthcare costs, that's what he really cares about,\u201d Spicer said. He added, \u201cThose are the kinds of things the president, he's not focused on statistics as much as he is on whether or not the American people are doing better as a whole.\u201d\n\nSpicer defended Trump\u2019s focus on relatively trivial actions, like pressuring the Carrier company to preserve between 800 and 1,000 jobs in Indiana -- not even a rounding error in national employment numbers -- rather than focusing on the bigger picture.\n\n\u201cI think for too often in Washington, we get our heads wrapped around a number and a statistic,\u201d Spicer continued. \u201cAnd we look at and we forget the faces and the families and the businesses that are behind those numbers. And so, I think that's where his head's at, is trying to look at those people that come to his rallies, that have come to his event, that he's met with in person that are struggling and say, \u2018Mr. Trump, I'm working as hard as I can. I'm working two jobs, I'm doing everything by the rules, and I keep getting screwed.\u2019\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump Escalates His War With Media On First Full Day in Office\n\nThe thing is, the United States is a big country. Somebody\u2019s always getting screwed somewhere. Somebody else is also getting really rich. But lots and lots of other people are muddling along somewhere in the middle. The chance that someone motivated enough by their own circumstances to come to a rally or to cut a politician a big check falls in that broad middle is probably a lot smaller than Trump and his team seem to want to admit.\n\nMany people close to Trump have complained that the person who has the most influence over his decision-making is, frequently, the last person he spoke to. What the nation and the media will need to be vigilant about in the years ahead is the danger of federal policy guided more by anecdote and feeling than by provable facts and well-researched figures."}, {"date": "2017/01/24", "title": "Trump\u2019s Nuclear Defense Plan: Another \u2018Star Wars\u2019 Budget Buster?", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/24/Trump-s-Nuclear-Defense-Plan-Another-Star-Wars-Budget-Buster", "text": "President Ronald Reagan cowed the Soviet Union and eventually brought its leaders to the bargaining table with the threat of a costly space-based nuclear missile system dubbed \u201cStar Wars.\u201d In March 1983, Reagan formally launched the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) to develop and deploy an \u201cimpenetrable shield\u201d to protect the U.S. from a Soviet missile attack.\n\nAlthough the U.S. ultimately spent more than $200 billion on a system that was never successfully developed and deployed, Reagan\u2019s high-stakes defense gambit was credited by many for helping to hasten the end of the Cold War.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Nuke Talk Could Break the Budget or Much, Much Worse\n\nNow newly inaugurated President Donald Trump may be trying to play a similar head game with North Korea\u2019s 32-year-old leader Kim Jong Un. Kim recently declared that his rogue nation is in the final stages of developing an intercontinental ballistic missile with a nuclear tip capable of reaching parts of the United States.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t happen!\u201d Trump tweeted Jan. 2 in a dismissive rejoinder to Kim, which he followed up with a sharp criticism of China, North Korea\u2019s patron, for not doing enough to restrain Kim\u2019s soaring nuclear ambitions.\n\nLast Friday, shortly after Trump was sworn in as the 45th president, the new White House website declared in a policy statement that Trump will rebuild the U.S. military, boost its anti-missile capabilities and make it a top priority to defeat ISIS and other Islamic terrorist groups. Now a new addition to Trump\u2019s evolving defense posture, the website declared that the United States would develop a \u201cstate of the art missile defense system\u201d to guard against attacks from North Korea, Iran, and other rogue states.\n\nRelated: Trump Doubles Down on the Threat of a Nuclear Arms Race\n\nThe announcement was bereft of details about the technical capabilities or the potential cost to taxpayers for a more sophisticated missile defense system than the land-based and seaborne systems currently deployed in California and Alaska and aboard Navy destroyers in the Pacific.\n\nIn addition to the missile shield, the Trump White House said a new military budget would be submitted to Congress outlining a plan to rebuild the military and increase cyber-warfare capabilities. \u201cWe will make it a priority to develop defensive and offensive cyber capabilities at our U.S. Cyber Command, and recruit the best and brightest Americans to serve in this crucial area,\u201d the statement declared.\n\nSince then, Trump and his aides have had little more to say about their proposed missile defense initiative, leaving defense policy experts to scratch their heads and speculate on what the new president has in mind. Some believe the U.S. doesn\u2019t currently have a reliable system to deter North Korea\u2019s emerging road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) technology from delivering nuclear warheads to the U.S. mainland, according to reports.\n\nRelated: Was Trump\u2019s Nuclear Tweet a Poke at Putin?\n\nTrump once said that he would be happy to meet with Kim over hamburgers to try to reach an accommodation. Now that they are in power, Trump and his national security advisers are signaling they intend to take a much harder line with the unpredictable and highly dangerous North Korean dictator.\n\n\u201cArguably you could say the only anti-ballistic system we have that has some proven track record of success is the sort of mid-course phase intercept system that is deployed in Alaska and California, which is targeted at the North Korean threat,\u201d Gordon Adams, a military analyst and historian, said in an interview Monday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically a ground-launched missile system that is capable of taking out\u201d North Korean missiles, and that has done reasonably well in tests. \u201cI suspect it\u2019s something that somebody else got to him on or got the White House\u2019s agreement to put it on the website,\u201d he added.\n\nBeginning in the 1990s, the declared mission of SDI, which became known as the National Missile Defense (NMD) program, changed dramatically. It went from a \u201cskies the limit\u201d scientific and engineering venture to a more modest goal of preventing the United States from being subjected to nuclear blackmail or nuclear terrorism by a rogue state like North Korea or Iran.\n\nRelated: The Pentagon Must Now Reveal the True Cost of War to All Americans\n\nUnlike the Star Wars program \u2013 which would likely cost $400 billion or more to replicate in today\u2019s dollars \u2013 the NMD is not equipped to provide a robust shield against large attacks from a technically sophisticated adversary such as Russia. Moreover, it can\u2019t handle enemy missiles with multiple warheads, according to Adams.\n\nThe NMD in time may become less useful as North Korea rushes ahead to develop a long-range nuclear missile program \u2013 one that would threaten Alaska and the West Coast, and that also poses a more immediate threat to neighboring South Korea and Japan. This may help to explain why Trump decided to sound the alarm and pledge a more up-to-date nuclear defense system last week.\n\nLast month, former Defense Secretary Ash Carter called Kim\u2019s New Year\u2019s day ballistic missile threat serious.

Many of the programs Trump\u2019s advisers are targeting have long enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress.\n\nRelated: Trump Era Begins with Moves Against Regulations, Obamacare\n\nEven before the billionaire businessman was sworn in as the 45th president last Friday, Trump\u2019s budgetary transition team reportedly began working with the conservative Heritage Foundation on the group\u2019s wish list of major cuts in departments including Commerce, Energy, Justice and State, and the elimination of long-standing programs including the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.\n\nHeritage recently unveiled a blueprint for achieving a balanced budget necessitating nearly $10 trillion in cuts and savings over the coming decade. Trump, apparently, is eagerly embracing the spending cut road map \u2013 especially deep cuts in non-defense domestic discretionary spending, according to The Hill.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer said today that members of Trump \u201clanding teams\u201d met with department and agency officials before the inauguration and talked about ways to create greater efficiencies, eliminate duplication and maximize federal tax dollars.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more a question instead of cutting, it\u2019s about how do we spend and respect the Americans\u2019 taxpayer dollars more going forward,\u201d Spicer told reporters at the White House in discussing proposed spending cuts and the federal employee hiring freeze. \u201cThere\u2019s been frankly some degree of lack of respect for taxpayers\u2019 dollars in this town for a long time.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump Outlines an \u2018America First\u2019 Agenda in a Dark Inaugural Address\n\n\u201cAnd I think what the president is showing through the hiring freeze, first and foremost today, is that we\u2019ve got to respect the American taxpayers,\u201d Spicer added. \u201cThey are sending us a ton of money ... and to see money wasted in Washington on a job that is duplicative is insulting to the hard work they do to pay their taxes.\u201d\n\nSpicer didn\u2019t highlight specific cuts the new administration has in mind \u2013 or confirm a goal of $10 trillion in cuts over the coming decade. Nor did he reconcile the administration\u2019s drive to slash spending with Trump\u2019s ballyhooed agenda that will substantially add to the deficit.\n\nThat includes $7 trillion or more in tax cuts, construction of a costly wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, a massive buildup of defense and the U.S. nuclear arsenal, $1 trillion of highway, bridge and other infrastructure projects, and government subsidies for paid family leave, just to name a few.\n\nIf Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), Trump\u2019s choice to head the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), survives his Senate confirmation hearings beginning on Tuesday, the fiscal conservative may have a tough time reconciling some of the more glaring contradictions in Trump\u2019s fiscal strategy while the national debt fast approaches $20 trillion.\n\nMulvaney will likely be grilled by Senate Budget Committee Democrats about his failure to pay $15,000 in payroll taxes for a household employee.

Among the masses, you could not only find overflowing energy Democrats could tap into in future campaigns, but an actual policy example to guide the way forward.\n\nI\u2019m talking about hats.\n\nPink hats, to be precise, although they went by a more, er, colorful nickname, a reference to Trump\u2019s boasts about sexual assault on the infamous Access Hollywood tape. The hats became the primary iconography of the marches, with hundreds of thousands of women wearing them as a symbol of resistance to the Trump regime. What makes it more remarkable is how the hats were manufactured and distributed.\n\nRelated: Obama Left Us Much Better Off. Can Trump Top That?\u200b\n\nAs everyone knows, America makes few textiles anymore. The economics are supposed to be next to impossible, with cheap unskilled labor abroad and supply chains constructed to move clothing from Asia or Latin America to U.S. stores. The dominance of national retail chains, which have consolidated over the years and are in the throes of another disruption from Amazon, leaves little room for locally produced goods.\n\nNone of those suppliers and retailers had anything to do with the pink hats. They began in the minds of friends at the Little Knittery in Atwater Village, California. The shop created a pattern \u2014 a simple rectangle that would reveal \u201ccat ears\u201d when worn \u2014 and posted it for free online. Knitting clubs around the country and around the world started making the hats, selling out local craft stores of their pink yarn. Activists taking on the project identified collection points nationwide for distribution. Knitters gifted hats to their communities; it became a way for those who couldn\u2019t attend the marches to get involved, an outlet for activism from an unlikely source.\n\nI don\u2019t have exact numbers, but I\u2019d estimate that hundreds of thousands of hats were manufactured, shipped and worn in a matter of a few weeks, without the involvement of any big-box store or multinational corporation. Local craft stores supplied the raw materials and local knitters supplied the labor, savoring the dignity that came with their contributions. Their talents were put to use and the money stayed within the community.\n\nRelated: The Best Signs from the Women's March on Washington\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting the entire global textile supply chain could be thrown over in favor of people making hats for each other. But the strain of local self-reliance that permeated the Women\u2019s March could actually serve as a primary rallying point for progressive resurgence.\n\nAs Barry Lynn writes in the Washington Monthly, the path back to respectability for Democrats runs directly through challenging ever-concentrating corporate power, which not only drives inequality and stunts wages but hollows out huge swathes of America and depresses entrepreneurship and innovation.\n\nThe greatest threat to this corporate monopoly is a new individualism, a locally focused crusade that gives Americans the freedom to share their skills and control their own destiny. Lynn describes how this would return the Democratic Party to its roots, as an anti-monopoly movement safeguarding citizens from corporate dominance.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Brand of Nationalism Reinforces an \u2018Us v. Them\u2019 Playbook\n\nThat may sound like something Trump promised in his defiant inaugural address, which took aim at the nation\u2019s elites. \u201cThe establishment protected itself but not the citizens,\u201d Trump thundered. \u201cWhile they celebrated in our nation\u2019s capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.\u201d\n\nThere was some truth in that passage, visible in the faces of forgotten men and women who suffered while elites partied. Twenty-five years of Democratic disconnection from their self-image as the party of the people alienated many voters previously within the coalition. Elites protected their own interests and sold out voiceless workers, while assuring the public that it was for their own good. Despite hundred year-old laws to constrain monopolies, successive governments of both parties have failed to use them since the 1980s, producing a homogenized landscape of Walmarts and chain restaurants and despair in too much of our country, a regional inequality Trump capitalized on during the election.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s version of anti-elite populism conveniently left out corporate elites, who nearly destroyed the economy in the financial crisis and have pursued even more domination in the aftermath. Indeed, plenty of those corporate elites are taking roost in Trump\u2019s cabinet, and his expected selections to police market power specialize more in turning away from enforcement. He\u2019s considering naming Josh Wright, an avowed enthusiast of concentration (and its \u201csignificant benefits for consumers\u201d) who has twice been on Google\u2019s payroll, as his head of the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department.\n\nRelated: Why the Political Mainstream Keeps Failing America\u2019s Workers\n\nThis is the opening for Democrats, and the Women\u2019s March supplied proof of its power. Independent citizens created the signature icon of the protests, through their own labor and ingenuity. This return to localism creates dignity among citizens, and pride in their skills being valuable. Monopolies rob people of the liberty to display those talents. The struggle against monopoly is a struggle for equality, a struggle for the restoration and vibrancy of community, an affirmation of life over control. It encapsulates the struggle for democracy.\n\nThe chroniclers of the establishment snicker that populism is too simple-minded to lead to a better world. But there\u2019s a smart populism that would allow for broader opportunity and prosperity. Some Democrats are beginning to understand that the concept of breaking corporate power provides a framework on which to hang every critique of American politics and economy. But by and large, they have forgotten to tell this story \u2014 and after decades of hitting up capital to fund campaigns, too many of them no longer believe it.\n\nWhen you have coal lobbyists running to lead the national party and the board of the outgoing president\u2019s foundation stocked with private equity barons and venture capitalists, rank-and-file progressives can be forgiven for becoming cynical. If Democrats want to return to power, they\u2019ll have to return to their roots.

Seventy-five percent of Americans, many Trump voters agree, we must have them. It\u2019s unprecedented not to. We\u2019re going to get them.\u201d\n\nHowever, successfully bringing a lawsuit requires that the plaintiff has the legal standing to do so, which in this case requires making a credible claim that CREW has suffered an injury from Trump\u2019s alleged violation.

Coleman, addresses a very different set of circumstances than those claimed by CREW, in which a court ruled that the defendant had violated a specific duty to the plaintiff.\n\nWhile Adler and others said that the core of the complaint -- that Trump is in violation of the emoluments clause -- might have merit, others contested even that.\n\n\u201cStanding aside, the merits are what are lacking here. They make over-the-top allegations that are absurd against Mr. Trump, and if there\u2019s a violation of the emoluments clause they haven\u2019t made the case,\u201d said Tom Fitton, President of Judicial Watch.\n\nFitton\u2019s organization, a conservative-leaning, anti-corruption watchdog group that has spent years on lawsuits related to former President Bill Clinton and former secretary of state and recent Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, has been cautiously supportive of Trump\u2019s decision not to divest his business.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Brand of Nationalism Reinforces a Divisive \u2018Us v.

FATF defines family members as \u201cindividuals who are related to a PEP either directly (consanguinity) or through marriage or similar (civil) forms of partnership.\u201d Close associates, according to FATF are \u201cindividuals who are closely connected to a PEP, either socially or professionally.\u201d\n\nAccuity, a company that provides compliance services to banks and other financial institutions, created this chart outlining who might be designated a PEP.\n\nRelated: Trump Outlines an \u2018America First\u2019 Agenda in a Dark Inaugural Address\n\nThe law enforcement focus on PEPs was heightened dramatically in the years following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, as governments around the world struggled to choke off money financing international terrorism. The state-sponsored nature of some terrorism helped expand the focus of anti-terrorism operations to official corruption as well.\n\nThe PEP designation doesn\u2019t come with an assumption of guilt or nefarious activity but is a simple recognition that people close to the levers of governmental power are uniquely able to use their authority for their own personal benefit or to channel public money to non-public uses.\n\nThe designation is not unique to the Trump family. The same would have been true for the families and associates of presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush.\n\nWhat is unique to the Trump clan is its continued operation of a string of for-profit businesses in many countries around the world. President Trump, notably, refused to divest himself of his business holdings, insisting that he could satisfy all concerns about conflicts of interest by passing day-to-day management authority to his two adult sons.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Brand of Nationalism Reinforces a Divisive \u2018Us v.

Just go to Yahoo Finance, MSN Money, CNBC or any of a host of other web sites, type in the company name or ticker symbol, and you can see full financial profiles of each company. Some sites also make it easy to compare the earnings performance of multiple companies.\n\nBut what if you want to see the financial status of cities like Amarillo, Akron or Alexandria? It\u2019s not so simple. Because these cities had fewer than 200,000 people in 2015, they were not included in our City Financial Strength Index published earlier this month. Other groups that collect and publish local government financial data, like Truth in Accounting, also focus on just the biggest cities. Creating a comprehensive resource for government finance would be a complex and costly undertaking.\n\nRelated: How Strong Are Your City's Finances? 116 US Cities Ranked\n\nYet the need for such a resource is real. An online database of local government financial statistics would provide early warning of potential fiscal crises. Since fiscal crises trigger public employee layoffs, deep service cuts and sharp tax increases, they affect a large cross section of the community. By identifying which governments are most vulnerable, policymakers and citizens can take early action to avoid or minimize such emergencies. A fiscal data repository would help researchers answer such questions as whether bankruptcy filings by Stockton, San Bernardino and Detroit were straws in the wind presaging a more generalized problem, or were they exceptional events not likely to be widely repeated? And, which financial data points are the best indicators of future trouble (while I believe the indicators and weightings I used for the Financial Strength Index were appropriate, others differ)?\n\nHistorically, we have relied on rating agencies to assess government financial health, but Department of Justice settlements with S&P and Moody\u2019s over their actions that precipitated the financial crisis, suggest that we need alternative measurements. Also, many cities do not carry credit ratings. An online database would also help us assess relative government performance, showing us which units are spending their tax dollars more or less efficiently. And, it would let us see how spending priorities differ across governments, letting us determine whether they are properly emphasizing public safety or social services.\n\nThe Current Mess\n\nMost major cities publish their budgets on their websites, but budgets contain forecast revenues and expenditures, which are not completely accurate. Budgets are also not well standardized, making peer comparisons difficult. Even though they\u2019re less timely, actual financial statements certified by an independent auditor are the better choice for analyzing financial performance across governments.\n\nRelated: Chicago, New York in Worst Financial Shape Among Large US Cities\n\nMost major cities (as well as counties, states and special districts) also publish audited financial statements in a document known as a Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (or CAFR). The Government Finance Officers Association sets standards for these reports and awards a \u201cCertificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting\u201d to filers meeting these standards. The core of the CAFR, the government\u2019s basic financial statements, must adhere to principles set forth by the Government Accounting Standards Board (notably, New Jersey cities do not use this standard.)\n\nWhile these annual financial reports possess a wealth of useful information about government financial condition, they are not widely used. Historically, the documents have been hard to find, and, because their data is locked in PDFs, they are difficult to analyze.\n\nFinding the reports has become much easier in recent years. While in the 1990s, obtaining a CAFR might have required a trip to the library or municipal building, now these documents are generally online. State and local governments that issue municipal bonds usually post their CAFRs on the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board\u2019s EMMA system. Unfortunately, finding CAFRs through the system is not straightforward: EMMA was designed to provide information about individual municipal bonds, not as a database of government financial statistics.\n\nRelated: 15 States Americans Are Ditching: What\u2019s the Matter With Wyoming?\n\nRecently, the federal government has launched a new resource that eases the process of finding and downloading local government financial statements. Governments and non-profits receiving federal funds above a certain threshold (currently $750,000 annually) are required to submit audited financial statements to the federal government. Last year, the Census Bureau, which collects these statements, started to place new local government audits online with a somewhat more user-friendly interface than EMMA. Finally, many states have CAFR repositories. Good examples are those provided by Illinois, Michigan and Washington State.\n\nStill, extracting and standardizing the data from these reports remains challenging. Three years ago, the Sunlight Foundation held a hackathon to tackle the issue of \u201cscraping\u201d data from PDFs and none of the developers attending could come up with a good solution for CAFR data extraction. Since then, software tools facilitating PDF data extraction have only improved marginally.\n\nA Better Way\n\nA more useful approach is to move away from PDF filings and instead encourage or require governments to submit their financial statements in a \u201cmachine readable format\u201d like XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language). It would then be possible to create an online, searchable repository of government financial statistics. (The Census Bureau does currently provide annual state and local financial data, but, because the Census information is derived from a survey rather than the audited reports, it is inconsistent with CAFR data, unaudited and limited in scope.)\n\nRelated: The Financial Health of All 50 States, Ranked\n\nThe implementation of a machine-readable filing standard is one reason why standardized corporate financial data is so much more readily available than government data. Since the 1990s, the SEC has made corporate financial statement filings (Forms 10-K and 10-Q) available in a text format known as SGML, which is much easier to process than PDFs. In 2009, the SEC began requiring companies to file their financial statements in XBRL, which better enforces standardization across filings and internal consistency of data within a single filing.\n\nWith the 2014 enactment of the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act, the federal government embraced the use of machine readable fiscal data. The act requires the executive branch to \u201cestablish Government-wide data standards for financial data and provide consistent, reliable, and searchable Government-wide spending data that is displayed accurately for taxpayers and policy makers.\u201d DATA Act implementation, which is being led by OMB and the Treasury Department, includes an XBRL schema that facilitates standard reporting of federal expenditures.\n\nCorporate and federal XBRL filing standards offer useful precedents for a state and local government standard, which has been slow to emerge. While some existing projects are in preliminary stages, larger organizations that could all promote a single standard have yet to do so. Congressional action may be required: A bill that would have mandated a machine-readable municipal financial filing standard proposed in the last Congress died despite attracting 35 cosponsors. Perhaps this idea could be resurrected as part of Dodd-Frank changes expected in the current Congress. Citizens interested in understanding the financial health of their cities would benefit."}, {"date": "2017/01/23", "title": "There\u2019s Less to Trump\u2019s Obamacare Executive Order Than Some Suggest", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/23/There-s-Less-Trump-s-Obamacare-Executive-Order-Some-Suggest", "text": "For all of the controversy and anxiety it stirred up over the weekend, there is still considerable uncertainty over the practical impact of the executive order newly inaugurated President Donald Trump signed Friday night instructing federal agencies to use any methods allowed by law to dismantle key elements of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nTrump made good on his campaign pledge to take action his first day in office to begin the unprecedented task of wholly repealing and replacing a major modern-era health care program by signing the order. His executive order reaffirmed his intention to seek \u201cprompt repeal\u201d of former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health insurance program which covers more than 20 million Americans.\n\nRelated: Trump Era Begins with Moves Against Regulations, Obamacare\n\nThe House and Senate last week approved a budget resolution under special reconciliation rules as the first important step towards dismantling Obamacare and replacing it with a GOP plan. Trump\u2019s executive order is designed to try to speed up Obamacare\u2019s demise from within the executive branch.\n\nThe order instructs federal agencies \u2013 including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Internal Revenue Service -- to \u201cexercise all authority and discretion available to them\u201d to waive, defer or delay any provision of the law that imposes fiscal hardship on individuals, families, insurers or the health care industry.\n\nThe goal is to hasten the demise of a four-year-old subsidized health care program that has been plagued by soaring premiums and co-payments, the collapse of more than 20 experimental co-ops, and major financial losses by UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, Blue Cross-Blue Shield and other that have driven out of some markets. Yet, Obamacare enrollment for the 2017 season is setting records and the nationwide rate of uninsured has dipped below 10 percent \u2013 its lowest point ever.\n\nSign ups don\u2019t always translate into premium payments, of course, and the lowered insurance rate can be credited equally to the ACA\u2019s expanded Medicaid option and the health care exchanges.\n\nRelated: Trump Escalates His War With Media On First Full Day in Office\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s executive order doesn\u2019t specify actions that might be taken, the news media and others have speculated that they could include granting states and insurance companies much wider latitude in setting minimum standards for drug and medical treatment provided and creating a freer and more open market. The Washington Post speculated that the order could end up unwinding regulations that include enforcement of the penalty for people who fail to carry health care insurance.\n\nKellyanne Conway, a counselor to Trump, said on Sunday that the new administration may stop enforcing the mandate requiring most Americans to carry health insurance even before Congress repeals Obamacare \u2013- but without explaining how that would be accomplished.\n\n\u201cWhat President Trump is doing is, he wants to get rid of that Obamacare penalty almost immediately, because that is something that is really strangling a lot of Americans, to have to pay a penalty for not buying government-run health insurance,\u201d she said on ABC News\u2019 This Week.\n\nHowever, while the one-page executive order exhorts federal agencies to \u201ctake all actions consistent with law to minimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens of the Act to the maximum extent permitted by law,\u201d some healthcare experts say the new administration edict would have far less authority to weaken Obamacare than many assume.\n\n\u201cI think Trump has done what he promised his voters he would do, which is to put out an executive order on the first day in office, beginning the process of rolling back the Affordable Care Act\u201d Tim Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee College and an expert on health care, said in an interview. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re going to see a lot more out of him in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nJost said that there are limits to what Trump and his agency heads can do on the administrative front without going through a long and tortured federal rule-making process. He told VOX.com in a separate interview, \u201cI think he\u2019s been advised that he can\u2019t repeal the Affordable Care Act through executive action, and now we see where this goes.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Brand of Nationalism Reinforces a Divisive \u2018Us v.

Without the mandate, insurers couldn\u2019t make a profit.\n\nBut that mandate has not panned out. After doing the math, many younger Americans have opted to pay the penalty rather than sign up for Obamacare and expensive premiums, which they cannot afford. So they\u2019re taking their chances that they remain healthy and avoid serious accidents.\n\nWhile the Obama administration often granted hardship waivers to people facing penalties, experts say it is highly unlikely the Trump administration could greatly expand the waivers without congressional authorization.\n\nRelated: Congress Is Headed for a Showdown With Trump Over Obamacare Repeal\n\nJoseph Antos, a health care scholar at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said Trump\u2019s executive order \u201cis more of an admonition and political statement than an instruction to act.\u201d He predicted that little will happen internally until Trump gets his health care team in place \u2013 and that may not be for a while.\n\nRep. Tom Price (R-GA), Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of health and human services, has run into tough opposition from the Democrats during his Senate confirmation process because of allegations he repeatedly engaged in insider stock trading as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Those hearings could drag on until the middle of February or longer. Without Price and Seema Verma, Trump\u2019s choice to head the HHS\u2019s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, in place, there is relatively little the new administration can do to alter Obamacare.\n\n\u201cAny concrete action will require leadership from the Secretary of HHS,\u201d Antos said in an email. \u201cActing officials are careerists who generally won\u2019t get out ahead of the politics.

At the same time, millions of Americans marched in Washington and scores of cities across the country to protest Trump\u2019s election and policies that threaten women\u2019s rights, illegal immigrants, health care coverage for more than 20 million people, and long-standing international alliances.\n\nRelated: Trump Era Begins with Moves Against Regulations, Obamacare\n\nThe day\u2019s events were both breathtaking and alarming, as Trump and his new White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, appeared unhinged at times as they clashed with reporters and bitterly complained that the media had vastly understated the size of the crowd on hand for Trump\u2019s swearing in ceremony. The White House also complained about what proved to be an inaccurate tweet by a Time Magazine reporter that Trump had removed a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office.\n\nTrump appears to be digging in for what is likely to be a long and contentious relationship with the news media that could mean less access for reporters or even eviction from the current White House press room.

Why didn\u2019t these people vote? Celebs hurt cause badly.\u201d\n\nLater, however, he leavened his critique, tweeting that \u201cPeaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy. Even if I don\u2019t always agree, I recognize the rights of people to express their views.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump used a visit to the CIA \u2013 intended as a peacemaking gesture after weeks of clashing with the intelligence community over its assessments of Russian hacking and interference in the U.S. election\u2014to tee off against journalists, who he called \u201cthe most dishonest human beings on Earth,\u201d according to an account by The Washington Post.\n\nRelated: 8 Steps Trump Could Take on \u2018Day One\u2019 to Remake the Country\n\nTrump called out Zeke Miller, the Time magazine reporter who mistakenly tweeted a report that the Martin Luther King Jr. bust had been removed from the Oval Office and subsequently apologized and corrected the report.

All the marchers in America can\u2019t stomp out the fact that both Barack Obama and Trump entered office with four sizeable similarities.\n\nBoth began their quests for the presidency as political novices: Obama was a young, African-American former community organizer without even a full term as a U.S. senator under his belt. Trump was an aging real-estate mogul with a second career as a reality TV star and had never held public office.\n\nRelated: What We Will Miss Most About Obama\n\nBoth owe a debt of gratitude to Hillary Clinton because the undeniable and immeasurable antipathy toward her by so many Americans won them votes they might otherwise have never received. In Trump\u2019s case, his victory was as much a vote for a true outsider and symbol of change as it was a defeat for a consummate insider and a symbol of business as usual.\n\nBoth (plus Bernie Sanders) recognized what the Washington Establishment did not \u2013 that \u201cIt\u2019s my turn\u201d coronations either in primaries or the general election are a dead concept.

In Trump\u2019s, it was just unvarnished audacity.\n\nA less politically significant similarity is that they both seem to be loving fathers, though that is not a quality in a leader to be dismissed. Beyond all that, however, Obama and Trump are polar opposites when it comes to their approach \u2013 to politics and, from what we have seen so far, to America\u2019s challenges.\n\nIn 2009, it cannot be said often enough, Obama was dealt the worst hand of any president since FDR. Certainly, Richard Nixon was left a bed of thorns by Lyndon Johnson: the bright and shining lie of the Vietnam War, a nation torn apart and confused and a particularly weak economy.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Brand of Nationalism Reinforces a Divisive \u2018Us v.

Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week, or last month, or last year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions -- that time has surely passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America. \u201c\n\nEight years later, a visitor from the Red Planet listening in the rain to Trump\u2019s Inaugural Address might be forgiven for thinking the economy remains in shambles, the unemployment rate is still in double digits, the Dow is dismal and Detroit is shuttering its factories.\n\nRelated: Trump Era Begins with Moves Against Regulations, Obamacare\n\n\u201cAmericans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThese are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public. But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.

It was on display last year, as advocates of the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union, particularly the UK Independence Party, pressed their case. From the Kremlin, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been relentlessly pressing a renewed Russian nationalism.\n\nIndeed, appeals to the preservation of national identities have been heard across Europe for years now, particularly in countries that have seen large inflows of migrants, and they often come with a side order of racism and religious bigotry.\n\nSo it was no real surprise when, on Saturday, the White House dispensed with the fiction that the president wrote Friday\u2019s speech himself, and admitted that the words had been heavily influenced, if not outright written, by a pair of his closest aides. One of them is Trump\u2019s chief strategist and senior White House counselor, Steve Bannon, a self-professed \u201ceconomic nationalist.\u201d\n\nRelated: \u2018America First\u2019: Full Text of President Trump\u2019s Inaugural Address\n\nA former Goldman Sachs banker who went on to make a small fortune in movie and television production, Bannon took over the right-wing Breitbart News in 2012. The site became an unabashed supporter of Trump\u2019s campaign, which Bannon eventually joined himself last August. (Bannon rejects the accusations that Breitbart has become a forum for not just nationalists, but for white nationalists.)\n\nBannon\u2019s comments in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter late last year, in which he claimed the economic nationalist mantle, could have been the rough draft of part of Trump\u2019s inaugural address.\n\n\u201cThe globalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia,\u201d he told reporter Michael Wolff. \u201cThe issue now is about Americans looking to not get f\u2014ed over. If we deliver, we'll get 60 percent of the white vote, and 40 percent of the black and Hispanic vote and we'll govern for 50 years. That's what the Democrats missed. They were talking to these people with companies with a $9 billion market cap employing nine people. It's not reality. They lost sight of what the world is about.\"\n\nIt\u2019s a vision that Bannon has had consistently for some time. In a lengthy question and answer session delivered to a conference at the Vatican in 2014, Bannon laid out his vision of how the world is being realigned by a new political reality in which national identity plays a central role.\n\nRelated: 8 Steps Trump Could Take on \u2018Day One\u2019 to Remake the Country\n\n\u201cLook, we believe \u2014 strongly \u2014 that there is a global tea party movement,\u201d he said, according to the audio of the event obtained by Buzzfeed. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that. We were the first group to get in and start reporting on things like UKIP and Front National and other center-right. With all the baggage that those groups bring \u2014 and trust me, a lot of them bring a lot of baggage, both ethnically and racially \u2014 but we think that will all be worked through with time.\u201d\n\nThose remarks bear a striking similarity to Trump\u2019s inaugural address in their contempt for a globalist worldview and their call for a return to traditionalism and nationalism. They also help explain the deference that the Trump campaign has shown to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who Bannon referred to as a kleptocrat, even as he acknowledged his success in rallying the Russian people behind him.\n\nI think that people, particularly in certain countries, want to see the sovereignty of their country, they want to see nationalism for their country. They don\u2019t believe in this kind of pan-European Union, or they don\u2019t believe in the centralized government in the United States. They\u2019d rather see more of a States-based entity that the founders originally set up where freedoms were controlled at the local level.\n\nHowever, we the Judeo-Christian West have to look at what [Putin is] talking about as far as traditionalism goes \u2014 particularly the sense of where it supports the underpinnings of nationalism \u2014 and I happen to think that the individual sovereignty of a country is a good thing and a strong thing. I think strong countries and strong nationalist movements in countries make strong neighbors, and that is really the building blocks that built Western Europe and the United States, and I think it\u2019s what can see us forward.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Blunders on NATO and Russia Make Our European Allies Cringe\n\nThe fact that the only specific issue of global concern that Trump mentioned in his inaugural address was the fight against the terror group ISIS can be chalked up to Bannon as well. Trump pledged to \u201cunite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate from the face of the earth.\u201d\n\nIn Bannon\u2019s worldview, the fight against militant Islam is the single biggest threat -- \u201ca war of immense proportions\u201d -- that takes precedence over things like Russian aggression.\n\n\u201c[A]t the end of the day, I think that Putin and his cronies are really a kleptocracy, that are really an imperialist power that wants to expand,\u201d he said to the audience in Rome. \u201cHowever, I really believe that in this current environment, where you\u2019re facing a potential new caliphate that is very aggressive that is really a situation \u2014 I\u2019m not saying we can put it on a back burner \u2014 but I think we have to deal with first things first.\u201d\n\nThat tracks very closely with Trump\u2019s repeated insistence that the US should look away from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and evidence of massive war crimes in Syria, and focus instead on convincing Putin to assist the US in fighting ISIS.\n\nAt the earliest stages of the Trump presidency, it\u2019s impossible to know where the former reality television star who now sits in the Oval Office will take the country. But Friday\u2019s inaugural address made it pretty clear who will be giving him the directions."}, {"date": "2017/01/21", "title": "Got a Chronic Condition?

If they need health care, they\u2019ll pay for some of it out of their own pockets before their insurance takes over.\n\nBut what do those plans mean for people with common chronic health conditions such as diabetes, asthma, joint problems, and heart disease? The short answer: a hit to their wallets.\n\nRelated: Rising Health Care Costs Will Push the Nation\u2019s Debt Into High-Risk Territory\n\nPeople with chronic conditions who choose deductible-based plans should be prepared to spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars of their own money on their care\u2014perhaps even beyond what they spend to buy the insurance plan in the first place.\n\nThe results of a new study show the impact of high-deductible health plans that now cover 40 percent of Americans who buy their own health insurance or get it through an employer. Data from a national survey of Americans younger than 65 show that having a high-deductible plan makes it more likely that health-related costs will take up more than 10 percent of a chronically ill person\u2019s total income.\n\nResearchers uncovered wide disparities in out-of-pocket spending among patients with the same condition, even for those in low-deductible plans. Despite these out-of-pocket costs, few people with chronic illnesses say costs or insurance coverage issues had gotten in the way of getting the care or prescriptions they needed.\n\n\u201cIncreasingly, these plans have become woven into the fabric of health insurance in America, so it\u2019s important to look at the impact of deductibles on people who need care on an ongoing basis,\u201d says senior author Jeffrey Kullgren, assistant professor of general medicine at the University of Michigan Medical School.\n\n\u201cNot only on how they spend their money on care for their everyday health needs but also how that affects spending in the rest of their lives.\u201d\n\nRelated: Health Care Costs for Average American Family Now Exceed $25,000 a Year\n\nOut-of-pocket spending\n\nFor the study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, Kullgren and first author Joel E. Segel, a health economist at Penn State, analyzed data from 17,177 people interviewed for the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, a nationally representative survey conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The data were collected from 2011 to 2013 when many more employers started offering high-deductible health plans.\n\nOf all the respondents, slightly more than 4,100 had a high-deductible health plan, and more than 7,600 had a chronic health condition. About 45 percent of those with high-deductible plans had at least one chronic condition.\n\nResearchers looked at data from people who had heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, joint diseases, cancer (except for skin cancer), and mood disorders such as depression. They compared those patients\u2019 out-of-pocket costs against those of individuals with none of these conditions. The data encompassed those who had plans with high deductibles, low deductibles, and no deductibles.\n\n\u201cOne challenge of high-deductible health plans is that clinical decisions made in a doctor\u2019s office are often completely disconnected from the reality of what a patient has to pay out of pocket.\u201d\n\nRelated: US Health Care Costs Surge to 17 Percent of GDP\n\nIn 2013, a plan was considered high deductible if it asked patients to pay the first $1,250 in care costs for an individual or $2,500 for a family. Only people with deductibles above this amount qualify to open a health savings account that lets them put away cash to use tax-free to pay for some health costs.\n\nThe data primarily come from the time before people who needed to buy their own insurance could do so on the HealthCare.gov marketplace. Since the launch of the marketplace, more than 90 percent of shoppers have chosen high-deductible plans.\n\nLower-income people who choose silver-level marketplace plans can get assistance with out-of-pocket costs from the federal government. But those who opt for bronze-level plans with high deductibles\u2014but lower monthly premium costs\u2014aren\u2019t eligible for deductible help. Neither are people who make more than the income limit or receive coverage outside of the marketplace.\n\n\u201cIf changes in health policy remove marketplace subsidies, that could rewind the clock to the era we studied,\u201d says Kullgren, who specializes in studying the impact of consumer-directed health care plans\u2014a phrase that encompasses those with high deductibles or other cost-sharing arrangements.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Is a Fiscal Minefield for the GOP\n\nWhat will it cost?\n\nHe also studies how the companies that run such plans or offer them to their employees can help participants understand the costs and medical choices they will be responsible for.\n\n\u201cA lot of plans, employers, and policymakers are using these plans as vehicles to make consumers more active in their care, more cost-conscious, and more interested in optimizing the value of their care,\u201d Kullgren says. \u201cThis includes offering price-transparency tools that people can use to see what the care they need will cost and quality tools to show which hospitals or providers offer the best value.\n\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t know yet how often people are using these tools to help them get the care they need and avoid the care they don\u2019t need, nor how well the tools serve their needs. We need to focus on helping people who are in these plans use them better.\u201d\n\nKullgren is analyzing national survey data from people enrolled in high-deductible health plans who were asked about these topics. He is also partnering with Priority Health, a major private insurer, to design a pilot project that will launch early this year. It will test a price transparency tool that patients and health providers can use together, during a clinical appointment, to make decisions based on medical need and cost.\n\nRelated: What Obamacare Repeal Could Mean for Your Workplace Health Plan\n\n\u201cOne challenge of high-deductible health plans is that clinical decisions made in a doctor\u2019s office are often completely disconnected from the reality of what a patient has to pay out of pocket,\u201d he says. \u201cPatients have to decide whether and where to get a service, such as an operation, lab test, or medical imaging exam, that they must pay for under their plan. These are decisions where clinicians can help patients navigate\u2014and in some cases help them avoid care they don\u2019t need.\u201d\n\nResearchers from the University of Michigan Medical School and Penn State and from the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System are coauthors of the study."}, {"date": "2017/01/21", "title": "Trump Era Begins with Moves Against Regulations, Obamacare ", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/21/Trump-Era-Begins-Moves-Against-Regulations-Obamacare", "text": "President Donald Trump got something of a late start on Friday after an inaugural parade ran late and left marchers trudging past empty bleachers in the rain and dark. But on his way to a trio of inaugural balls, Trump took the time to authorize a flurry of actions signaling his new administration\u2019s intention to shake up Washington.\n\nFrom a blanket instruction that all federal agencies should immediately suspend any pending rules or regulations to a vaguely worded executive order instructing those same agencies to relieve the \u201cburden\u201d imposed on citizens and businesses by the Affordable Care Act, Trump\u2019s early moves reflected the breadth and depth of his plan to remake the country in a new image.\n\nRelated: Trump Outlines an \u2018America First\u2019 Agenda in a Dark Inaugural Address\n\nThe White House website was completely overhauled, virtually erasing the legacy of Trump\u2019s predecessor, former president Barack Obama. Gone were plans to protect the environment and provide assistance to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, replaced by promises of increased fossil fuel extraction and border walls.\n\nIn what many viewed as a rather odd choice, the first clearly stated change in policy from the new administration was the shelving of a plan to lower insurance premiums for low-income homeowners who hold Federal Housing Administration-backed mortgages. The insurance premiums were increased during the housing crisis to reflect the increased risk of borrowers defaulting on mortgage loans, which cost taxpayers $1.7 billion during the Great Recession.\n\nWith improvements in the economy and a strengthening housing market, the Obama administration had determined that it was time to lower premiums again -- a move that would have saved borrowers roughly $500 per year. The plan was opposed by Republicans, who warned that it could put taxpayers on the hook for a bailout in the event of another housing market crash. On Friday, the Trump administration announced that the premium reduction, set to take effect later this month, had been suspended indefinitely.\n\nAlso Friday, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus issued a memo to all federal agencies placing a freeze on new regulatory actions \u201cto ensure that the President's appointees or designees have the opportunity to review any new or pending regulations.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump Again Calls for Rebuilding US Infrastructure in Inaugural Address\n\nThe move, a common practice for incoming administrations of both parties, instructs agencies to refrain from publishing new rules, and in the case of regulatory actions that have been announced but have not yet taken effect, it instructs agencies to delay their implementation where possible. The memo makes exceptions for emergency measures and rules that have to be completed by statutory deadlines.\n\nBut it was Trump\u2019s executive order on Obamacare that garnered the most attention Friday night, primarily because it was unclear exactly what its impact would be. The order stated that it is the policy of the new administration to seek repeal of the law, but said that in the interim it would look to minimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens\u201d associated with it.\n\nTo that end, Trump ordered all federal agencies to \u201cexercise all authority and discretion available to them to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications.\u201d\n\nThe broad language of the order suggested that Trump might require federal agencies charged with enforcing elements of the ACA, like the individual mandate requiring every US resident to have a health insurance policy, to stop enforcing them. If that were to happen, experts warned, it could have dire and almost immediate effects on the market for individual health insurance policies, with younger, healthier patients abandoning their coverage, and health insurers reconsidering whether or not to offer policies to a population that has suddenly become older, sicker, and more expensive to cover.\n\nRelated: \u2018America First\u2019: Full Text of President Trump\u2019s Inaugural Address\n\nWhile Trump did not issue a large number of orders Friday night, there were clear signals that much more is coming. Almost within minutes of Trump taking the oath of office, the official White House website was wiped clean of any trace of former President Obama\u2019s policies and populated with many of Trump\u2019s key policy objectives.\n\nThe new 45th president \u201cbelieves the United States has incredible potential and will go on to exceed anything that it has achieved in the past,\u201d the website declared. \u201cHis campaign slogan was Make America Great Again, and that is exactly what he intends to do.\n\nThe new Trump White House site outlined a series of hardline stands on law enforcement, defense, foreign policy, and trade; renewed Trump\u2019s promises to grow the economy through corporate and individual tax cuts and unleash energy production and \u201cclean coal\u201d technology. Trump pledged to create 25 million new jobs in the coming decade.\n\nRelated: GOP Governors Voice Alarm About Losing Expanded Medicaid\n\nThe new administration vowed to rescind Obama\u2019s Climate Action Plan aimed at combating global warming while pulling the plug on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and renegotiate the NAFTA agreement with Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe Trump White House reiterated its pledge to greatly build up the military, wipe out ISIS and other terrorist groups, increase cyber-security capabilities, build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, develop a \u201cstate of the art missile defense system\u201d against possible attacks by North Korea and Iran, and deport undocumented immigrants who have committed violent crimes.\n\n\"He is dedicated to enforcing our border laws, ending sanctuary cities, and stemming the tide of lawlessness associated with illegal immigration,\" the White House website declared.\n\nRelated: 8 Steps Trump Could Take on \u2018Day One\u2019 to Remake the Country\n\nAnd in further describing Trump\u2019s foreign policy ambition, the site reads that \"In pursuing a foreign policy based on American interests, we will embrace diplomacy. The world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends, and when old friends become allies.\"\n\nOddly, though, the website is silent about the health care law and Trump\u2019s pledge to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Eviscerating President Obama\u2019s signature health insurance program was a central issue in Trump\u2019s campaign, and he and GOP congressional leaders currently are brainstorming ways to simultaneously repeal key portions of Obamacare and replace them with a more market-oriented system.\n\nAt the same time, Trump aides yanked a climate change section off the website and declined to replace it except for a fleeting mention of Obama\u2019s Climate Action Plan, a series of efforts to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Trump has yet to provide any definitive word on whether the U.S. will continue to abide by the international global warming agreement reached in Paris a year ago. Nor has he disavowed previous assertions that climate change was a \u201choax\u201d perpetrated by the Chinese, although several of his cabinet nominees have acknowledged that climate change is partially man-made and a threat to the globe."}, {"date": "2017/01/20", "title": "Why Stocks Could Have a Rocky First Month Under Trump", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/20/Why-Stocks-Could-Have-Rocky-First-Month-Under-Trump", "text": "For financial markets, the Trump era begins on Monday, and if history is any guide the following month should be a rocky one for Wall Street but positive for the dollar.\n\nThe S&P 500 .SPX has fallen a median 2.7 percent in the month after each new president has taken the keys to the White House since Herbert Hoover did so in January 1929, according to Reuters analysis.\n\nRelated: Mnuchin Says He Takes the Debt Ceiling More Seriously Than Trump\n\nOnly four presidents have seen Wall Street rise in their first month in power: Hoover (+3.8 percent), John F.

That last element, he suggested will bring Americans together in common purpose and help drive the country forward.\n\n\u201cAt the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.\u201d\n\nThroughout his remarks, Trump returned to the idea that with his election, power was being returned to the people, at the expense of a corrupt elite who have used it to enrich themselves.\n\nAlmost immediately, he went on the attack against the Washington establishment, referring to \u201ca small group in our nation's capital [that] has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.\u201d\n\nRelated: 8 Steps Trump Could Take on \u2018Day One\u2019 to Remake the Country\n\nIt was a marked departure from many past inaugural addresses, which have frequently urged citizens toward service and self-sacrifice. Exactly 56 years ago, delivering his inaugural address on the same steps where Trump stood Friday, John F. Kennedy urged Americans to \u201cask not what your country can do for you \u2013 ask what you can do for your country.\u201d\n\nSpeaking directly to those who supported him during the election, Trump outlined a very different way of thinking about the country and its relationship to the people.\n\nHe described his supporters as participants in a movement \u201cthe likes of which the world has never seen before.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cAt the center of this movement is a crucial conviction, that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves. These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why All the Ethical Problems of Trump\u2019s Cabinet Nominees Won\u2019t Matter\n\nAnd he left no question about where the government would get the resources to deliver on those promises -- not from hard work and self-sacrifice so much as by disengaging with the wider world.\n\nIn fact, the speech seemed to signal a major retrenchment in US foreign policy and did so in a tone that can hardly fail to make US allies, many of whom have come to rely on and expect military and economic support from Washington, very nervous.\n\nThe president said that for too long the US has \u201cenriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry; subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military\u201d and \u201cdefended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own.\u201d\n\nHe spoke of \u201ctrillions\u201d of dollars spent overseas to help other countries \u201cwhile America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.\u201d All the while, he added, \u201cthe wealth, strength, and confidence of our country have dissipated over the horizon\u201d and \u201cthe wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Penthouse vs. the White House: Which Is Worth More?\n\nThe answer, he insisted, is a more inward-focused country:\n\nWe assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.

These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public, but for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists.\n\nMothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities, rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation. An education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge.

We will seek friendship and good will with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.\n\nWe do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example. We will shine for everyone to follow. We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the earth.\n\nAt the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other. When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice. The Bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity.\n\nWe must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity. When America is united, America is totally unstoppable. There should be no fear. We are protected, and we will always be protected. We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and most importantly, we will be protected by God.\n\nFinally, we must think big and dream even bigger. In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.\n\nWe will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action constantly complaining but never doing anything about it. The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action. Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America. We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.\n\nWe stand at the birth of a new millennium ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth from the miseries of disease and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow. A new national pride will stir ourselves, lift our sights and heal our divisions. It's time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget, that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.\n\nWe all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American flag. And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the wind-swept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky. They fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator.\n\nSo to all Americans in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words. You will never be ignored again. Your voice, your hopes and your dreams will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.\n\nTogether we will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And, yes, together, we will make America great again. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America! Thank you.

Gary Herbert said in a letter \u201cReforms must be fiscally prudent, but should maintain or improve affordable access to health care for those that are currently covered.\u201d\n\nHerbert and eight other GOP governors were in town Thursday to confer with congressional leaders about the strategy and timing of repealing key portions of Obamacare, including taxes and subsidies, and phasing in a GOP replacement. Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) have vowed to simultaneously unveil repeal and replacement legislation in the coming weeks, although it is clear the Republicans are far from a consensus on replacement legislation.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has counseled a more deliberate pace, in which Congress first votes to repeal Obamacare, and then develops replacement legislation during an extended transition period. However, Trump is impatient to achieve both tasks simultaneously in order to make good on his campaign pledge.\n\nRelated: How Block Grants Cap Federal Costs -- and Make States the Cost-Cutting Bad Guys\n\nPerhaps one of the greatest concerns of Republican and Democratic governors alike from the 31 states receiving expanded Medicaid coverage for the poor under Obamacare is that the program will be jettisoned as part of the repeal.\n\nMany governors have complained about the Medicaid program more generally, saying that the states should be granted more leeway and flexibility in administering the program and setting eligibility requirements. However, the expanded Medicaid coverage has been a boon for many of their residents, and they don\u2019t want to lose it in a rush to eviscerate the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Expanded Medicaid currently provides insurance for about 11 million low-income able-bodied single people across the country.\n\n\u201cWe have over 600,000 Michiganders, and we have a lot of positive data showing some good things going on in our state with this program,\u201d Republican Michigan Gov.

John Cornyn of Texas, the Senate Majority Whip, sought to allay the Republican governors\u2019 concern. \u201cNobody\u2019s going to lose coverage,\u201d Cornyn told reporters after meeting with the governors. \u201cIf there\u2019s one word that came up most, it\u2019s flexibility.

Perhaps Trump\u2019s single most frequent campaign promise was that he would build a \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d between the United States and Mexico (and to force the Mexican government to pay for it.) A symbolic step toward starting construction of the wall is one of the more likely things to come out of a Trump White House today.\n\nStart Mass Deportations. Second only to the wall, at least early in his campaign, was Trump\u2019s vow that he would immediately deport the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. While senior Republicans, like House Speaker Paul Ryan, have thrown cold water on the idea that Trump will be able to form a \u201cdeportation force\u201d to start moving people across the border, it\u2019s not out of the question that the new president could take some early steps to speed up the removal of criminal aliens.\n\nRelated: Germany, You\u2019re Fired! How Trump Is Bringing Reality TV to US Foreign Policy\n\nOverturn Executive Orders. Trump repeatedly vowed to void executive orders signed by President Obama, sometimes suggesting he\u2019d invalidate all of them, sometimes promising to undo just the ones he views as \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d It seems safe to expect that there will be at least a gesture toward rolling back his predecessor\u2019s legacy of aggressive executive actions. A possible target, of a piece with promises to deport the undocumented and build a wall, is Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which lifted the threat of deportation from certain immigrants brought here illegally as children. Obama's order was nullified by an appeals court and left in place by the Supreme Court in a 4-4 decision last June.\n\nRepeal Obamacare. The law Trump called a \u201cdisaster\u201d is not going away at the stroke of a pen, regardless of how much its opponents might like to see that happen. The Affordable Care Act is far too woven into the fabric of the nation\u2019s healthcare system to be eliminated in an instant. However, given that doing away with it has been a key promise from not just Trump, but the entire Republican Party, some precursor step from Trump today directing federal agencies to prepare for a post-Obamacare world would not be a surprise.\n\nInstitute a Lobbying Ban. Trump\u2019s repeated promises to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of Washington -- personified, more often than not, by lobbyists -- was another standard on the trail. Trump said that he would take steps to shut down the revolving door between the federal government and the K Street offices of major lobbying firms. He could formalize his promise to require all his White House employees to agree to a five-year ban on lobbying after leaving they leave, and a lifetime ban on lobbying for foreign governments. He could also request that Congress follow suit, however unlikely such a move would be.\n\nWithdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The massive trade deal, years in the making, was a constant target for Trump, who has criticized that treaty and others like it for costing America jobs. At this point, anything other than total withdrawal from the arrangement will look like a failure, so an official announcement that the US will not seek to ratify the deal could be something that comes out of the White House this afternoon.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Penthouse vs. the White House: Which Is Worth More?\n\nGo After China\u2019s Currency. Usually mentioned by Trump in the same breath as the TPP was China, the great bogeyman of his story of American industrial decline. On the trail, he constantly hammered on the idea that Beijing is using unfair trade practices to make US products uncompetitive on the world market. A common Trump vow was that he would label China a \u201ccurrency manipulator,\u201d claiming the Chinese government takes illegitimate steps to keep the yuan\u2019s value artificially low. Though experts say China hasn\u2019t actually engaged in currency manipulation for several years, Trump has continued to insist that they do.\n\nGet \u2018Tough\u2019 on ISIS. Getting \u201ctough\u201d on the terror group ISIS was also one of Trump\u2019s go-to promises during the campaign. From saying he would reinstate torture, target terrorists\u2019 families, or just plain \u201cbomb the shit out of them\u201d stepping up the campaign against ISIS is something his supporters will expect Trump to do very early in his term.

Price promised Americans \u201caccess\u201d to the highest quality care and coverage possible but offered no guarantees that everyone could afford it.\n\nDuring an interview on Tuesday with Axios.com, Trump appeared to backtrack somewhat on his promise of insurance for everybody, saying that he wanted to find a \u201cmechanism\u201d \u2013 perhaps Medicaid block grants -- to help the poorest Americans. \"You know there are many people talking about many forms of health care where people with no money aren't covered.\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe can't have that.\u201d\n\nThe following day, Vice President-elect Mike Pence told CNN that he interpreted Trump\u2019s comments to The Post to mean \u201cmaking insurance affordable for everyone.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Three-Way Battle for Obamacare Repeal\n\n\u201cI think it means making insurance affordable for everyone, but also allowing for the kinds of reforms in Medicaid on a state by state basis that will ensure \u2013 that will make sure that we have healthcare coverage for the most vulnerable in our society,\u201d Pence told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash.\n\nOn the surface, at least, Trump and his top advisers appear to be struggling to forge a consensus on a plan they can sell to Congress and are sending up a series of trial balloons. But a less charitable interpretation is that Trump is engaging in a classic bait-and-switch gambit, with some low-income single Americans having the most to lose from it.\n\nAfter briefly dangling a promise to deliver universal coverage to Americans, Trump has abruptly pulled it back and offered as a substitute an old GOP chestnut \u2013 a major overhaul of the nation\u2019s Medicaid system, which was expanded to 133 percent of the poverty line under President Obama and included able-bodied people without dependent children.\n\nContrary to the Republicans\u2019 promises of improvements and broader coverage, some analysts have warned that block granting Medicaid could have an adverse impact on some of the country\u2019s poorest people.\n\nGOP efforts to transform Medicaid from a federal entitlement program covering all eligible low-income Americans into block grants to the states actually dates back to the Reagan administration of the 1980s. While the 50-year-old Medicaid program today is a health care lifeline for millions of children, pregnant women, the disabled and the poor, GOP leaders have long complained about runaway spending, fraud and waste.\n\nInterestingly, since Medicaid was conceived as a state-based program, states are not required to participate in the program. But there has been full participation in the core program since 1982. Like all health care programs, Medicaid is expensive, and a number of Republican governors and their legislatures have opted out of the expansion.\n\nAt a time when the federal debt is about hit $20 trillion, the Congressional Budget Office is warning the new administration and all the federal agencies that belt-tightening is prudent.\n\nRelated: Trump Says His Plan Would Provide \u2018Insurance for Everybody\u2019\n\nThe joint federal-state Medicaid program currently covers nearly 72 million Americans and spent approximately $545 billion during fiscal 2016. That\u2019s the equivalent of more than 15 percent of all health care spending in the U.S., according to congressional figures.\n\nLeading GOP figures including House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Price have long championed the idea of block grants to contain or cap future spending and to give states more authority in regulating the program and setting eligibility standards.\n\n\u201cFor too long, states have been treated like junior partners in the oversight and management of the Medicaid program \u2013 forced to go through long and cumbersome waiver processes just to make most changes to their program,\u201d Ryan wrote in his \u201cGOP Better Way\u201d health care reform proposal released last summer.\n\nRyan and other Republican leaders contend that governors and state legislatures are closer to patients in their states and are better equipped to seize on opportunities to achieve savings and crack down on fraud and abuse. However, critics warn that it would likely give states sweeping new authority to tighten eligibility, cut benefits, and generally make it much harder for people to enroll.\n\nRelated: 8 Big Changes Under Tom Price\u2019s Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\n\u201cBlock grants are about producing federal savings by shifting costs and risks to states,\u201d said Edwin Park, vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. \u201cTo compensate for the federal funding cuts, states either have to cover much more of their own costs by raising taxes, cutting other spending, or far more likely, taking any flexibility they\u2019re given to institute cuts to their Medicaid programs \u2013 whether its eligibility, benefits, provider payments and the like.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat likely means that many low-income beneficiaries who rely on the program will end up uninsured or under-insured,\u201d he added in an interview Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s not about expanding coverage, it\u2019s really about eventually having to make deep cuts.\u201d\n\nA block grant would essentially cap federal Medicaid funding as a way of achieving major savings in the coming decade. Currently, the federal government picks up a fixed percentage of states\u2019 Medicaid cost \u2013 on average 57 percent\u2014and the states cover the rest. Under a block grant approach, however, states would receive a fixed amount based on a formula, with the states responsible for picking up any additional costs above the cap.\n\nThe states\u2019 new block grant funding levels in most cases would be based on current or historical spending patterns, which on the surface seems fair. However, the program would be designed in a way to slow the rate of growth of funding in the coming years, gradually tightening the noose and forcing the states to adopt tighter eligibility rules, possibly including a work requirement.\n\nRelated: What Obamacare Repeal Could Mean for Your Workplace Health Plan\n\nAccording to Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analysis last November, a block grant proposal contained in a House GOP budget plan for fiscal 2017 would cut federal Medicaid funding by $1 trillion \u2014 or nearly 25 percent \u2014 over ten years, relative to current law. By then, federal funding for Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) would be roughly $169 billion, or about a third less than what it would be under existing law.\n\nAnother analysis by the Urban Institute of a previous block grant proposal advanced by Ryan in 2012 projected that between 14 million and 21 million people would eventually lose their Medicaid coverage."}, {"date": "2017/01/20", "title": "Trump\u2019s Blunders on NATO and Russia Make Our European Allies Cringe ", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/01/20/Trump-s-Blunders-NATO-and-Russia-Make-Our-European-Allies-Cringe", "text": "If you thought Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy positions were politically calculated toss-offs, think again. The interview he gave The Times of London last week put the world on notice: The views Trump expressed as he campaigned last year\u2014notably on NATO, Europe, and relations with Russia\u2014are his views as of his inauguration today.\n\nNATO\u2019s obsolete, Trump famously asserted during his run for the Republican nomination, and he\u2019ll \u201cget along well\u201d with Russia and its president. As to Europe, that\u2019s on one side of the ocean, America\u2019s on the other, and America comes first.\n\nRelated: Germany Says NATO Concerned About Trump 'Obsolete' Remark\n\nThese positions are so at variance with accepted thinking in Washington that many people assumed Trump would get with the program before moving into the White House. But he has hardly budged. Trump still thinks NATO\u2019s out of date, he told The Times and Bild, the German daily, in their joint interview. He still wants to \u201cmake some good deals with Russia,\u201d and \u201cthe U.K. was so smart\u201d when it voted last year to exit the European Union.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: Trump could make the case on all three of these issues. His error lies in making them now, making them so bluntly, and making them so\u2026 un-presidentially. In the course of a conversation, Trump has plunged Europe into a state of uncertainty that\u2019s rare in trans\u2013Atlantic relations, if not unprecedented. So is the smoldering disdain for a new American president Europeans now struggle to disguise.\n\nUntil last week Trump might have coasted for a time on the major questions hanging over trans\u2013Atlantic diplomacy. Defeating ISIS, as he also told The Times, remains his highest priority on the foreign-policy side.\n\nThat focus is fine, but Trump has just traded all his leeway with the Europeans for a few characteristically crusty remarks. He now has to address, and swiftly after taking office, questions that were fated to be difficult but are now urgent, too:\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 Crusade Is a Win with Voters: Poll\n\nRelations with Russia. How President Trump decides to shape U.S.\u2013Russian ties will determine everything else he does across the Atlantic. And on questions such as Syria and terrorism, there is little question anymore that cooperating with Russia would be of mutual benefit.\n\nTrump has long faced strong resistance to improving relations from the Pentagon and hawkish senators such as John McCain. In the past 10 days, three of his cabinet appointees\u2014Rex Tillerson (State), James Mattis (Defense), and Nikki Haley (his choice for U.N. ambassador) have joined the chorus against his idea of a new d\u00e9tente.\n\nBut Trump doesn\u2019t go into this fight unarmed. First, his cabinet choices are perfectly aware of the ideological climate in Washington and know what they have to say to minimize opposition to their nominations. None of their testimony in the confirmation hearings necessarily holds.\n\nSecond, Europeans\u2014and notably emerging right-wing populists such as France\u2019s Fran\u00e7ois Fillon\u2014are weary of the prevailing animus toward Russia and support Trump\u2019s neo-d\u00e9tente. In effect, Europeans are as divided about Trump as Americans are.\n\nRelated: NATO's Top Soldier Says Trump Comments Play Into Hands of Putin\n\nThird, President Putin knows an opening when he sees one, and he sees one now. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov announced Tuesday that Moscow is inviting the U.S. to join Russia, Iran, Turkey, the Damascus government, and an assortment of anti\u2013Assad rebel groups in new peace talks on Syria.\n\nYes or no, Mr. President? This could be your first big foreign-policy decision, and it is certainly a test of your resolve. A day after Lavrov spoke, Russia announced that it had conducted airstrikes against ISIS jointly with Turkey for the first time. As Turkey is a longstanding U.S. ally, this vastly complicates the Pentagon\u2019s anti\u2013Russian position. Your thought, Mr. President?\n\nNATO. Trump\u2019s principal complaint about Atlantic alliance is that it has ignored the threat of terrorism and remained unduly focused on advancing eastward toward Russia\u2019s border. He\u2019s wrong on the first point, right on the second.\n\nThe NATO command has shifted considerable attention to anti-terror activities since the September 11, 2001, attacks. Last summer it created a new intelligence post, at assistant secretary-general level, to coordinate intel-sharing on terrorism and other threats.\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t contradict warnings by Henry Kissinger, the late George Kennan, and others that NATO\u2019s eastward advance in the post\u2013Cold War period is a needless provocation. When John Kirby, the State Department spokesman, asserted a few years ago that Russia was too close to NATO\u2019s borders, Russian media ran a mile with the upside-down logic.\n\nRelated: Obama to Trump: Keep Russia Sanctions Separate From Nuclear Talks\n\nTrump\u2019s got complications here. Ten days ago President Obama sent U.S. troops and armored brigades into Poland for the first time since NATO announced plans to toughen its eastern flank two years ago. That ups the ante considerably.\n\nAt the same time, five of the alliances 22 members, by Trump\u2019s count, are paying their fair share of the NATO budget. This is at least partly a measure of the Continent\u2019s attenuated enthusiasm for NATO in the post\u2013Cold War era.\n\nEurope. There are obvious similarities between Trump and his anti\u2013EU counterparts on the Continent. Many of them would surely agree with Trump in his interview with The Times: \u201cYou look at the European Union and it\u2019s Germany. Basically a vehicle for Germany.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s one difference between Trump and his populist confr\u00e8res in Europe: None of them is the 45th president of the United States.\n\nAgain, there\u2019s a credible case that an unelected technocracy has undermined the EU\u2019s legitimacy and appeal, and Trump may prove right that others could follow Britain to the exits. But he has cost himself political friends, notably Angela Merkel, in making the case openly and now.\n\nIt\u2019s precisely the extent to which Germany leads the EU that Trump ought not to have said so. The German chancellor is the most committed Atlanticist in Europe. Now Trump takes office with a wary leader atop the EU.\n\nTrump\u2019s all set to exacerbate subterranean rifts in trans\u2013Atlantic ties that Obama has already worsened considerably by overplaying his hand. Maybe Trump wants a wider ocean, but he had better think it through."}, {"date": "2017/01/19", "title": "Is This Plan to \u2018Shut Down\u2019 the White House on Inauguration Day Legal?", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/19/Plan-Shut-Down-White-House-Inauguration-Day-Legal", "text": "Washington is bracing for a rash of marches and demonstrations protesting Friday\u2019s inauguration of Donald J.

Mnuchin had also originally neglected to mention that he is on the board of directors of an investment fund in the Cayman Islands, the British territory notorious for its tax havens.\n\nRelated: Trump Just Failed His First Ethics Test as President\n\nThe revelations about Mnuchin followed on a string of others:\n\n* Tom Price, the Georgia Congressman tapped to run the Department of Health and Human Services, held stock in firms in the health care sector despite holding a position in Congress that gave him significant influence over health care firms and inside knowledge of pending congressional actions.\n\n* Rep. Mick Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s pick to run the White House Office of Management and Budget, admitted that he failed to pay $15,000 in payroll taxes related to a household employee.\n\n* Commerce Secretary nominee Wilbur Ross, a billionaire investor, admitted that one of his many housekeepers turned out to be an undocumented immigrant.\n\nAnd for all anyone knows, there could be more to come. Trump\u2019s pick for Education Secretary, billionaire Betsy DeVos, hasn\u2019t had her paperwork cleared by the Office of Government Ethics yet, something Democrats said should have delayed her hearing.\n\nAfter the Senate Finance Committee released details of Mnuchin\u2019s omissions Thursday morning, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said in a statement, \u201cNever before has the Senate considered such an ethically challenged slate of nominees for key cabinet positions.

Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle was denied the position of HHS secretary after it came out that he had failed to pay taxes on some of his income. Two of President Bill Clinton\u2019s nominees for Attorney General, Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood, were forced to withdraw their names from consideration after it was revealed that they had hired undocumented child care workers.\n\nSchumer called for what he described as equal treatment for Trump nominees, although in doing so he appeared to conflate Daschle\u2019s failure to pay income tax with Baird and Wood\u2019s nanny problems.\n\n\u201cSenator Tom Daschle did the same thing and Republicans insisted that that disqualified him from becoming HHS secretary. We say to our colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle, what\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander. If Tom Daschle couldn\u2019t become a cabinet member for not paying taxes for a household employee, the same standard ought to apply to Mick Mulvaney.\u201d\n\nBut no matter how exercised Schumer and his fellow Democrats get about Trump\u2019s nominees ethics headaches, in the end they probably won\u2019t make much difference.\n\nRelated: Treasury Secretary Lew Warns Trump Against Waging a Trade War\n\nIronically, the Trump nominee facing the toughest road to confirmation, secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson, is in trouble not because of his financial disclosures, which the OGE called \u201ca sterling model for what we\u2019d like to see with other nominees,\u201d but because of his perceived closeness to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThere are two major reasons why Trump\u2019s cabinet nominees are likely to skate through the Senate approval process.\n\nThe first is purely procedural, and the Democrats have nobody to blame for it but themselves. The decision to do away with the minority\u2019s ability to filibuster cabinet appointees, adopted by the Democratic Senate in 2014, means that the Republicans can approve all of Trump\u2019s picks with a simple majority vote.\n\nThe second is the context in which their hearings are being conducted. On Friday, the nation will inaugurate a man as president who has broken so many precedents and norms when it comes to financial disclosure that things like Mulvaney\u2019s unpaid payroll taxes look trivial.\n\nTrump has refused to release his tax returns, as all presidents have done for 40 years, or to report the names of the banks, companies or individuals to whom he is in debt. Estimates of that debt run into the hundreds of millions of dollars, and some is believed to be held by foreign banks.\n\nOn top of that, Trump\u2019s continued ownership of his business -- both real estate holdings and the Trump brand -- set up a vast array of conflicts of interest that ethics experts from both the Republican and Democratic parties have declared both serious and unprecedented.\n\nShort of proving outright fraud or corruption on the part of one of Trump\u2019s nominees, Democrats are simply going to find it difficult to stir up any great degree of outrage about the relatively minor transgressions of Trump\u2019s cabinet members."}, {"date": "2017/01/19", "title": "Defense Stocks Soar Despite Tough Talk From Trump", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/19/Defense-Stocks-Soar-Despite-Tough-Talk-Trump", "text": "The incoming commander-in-chief has jawboned Boeing over the cost of building a next-generation Air Force One and trash-talked the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.

The Council for Medicare Integrity study was limited to overpayments identified by the federal Recovery Audit Contractor Program (RAC), which reviews just a fraction of the claims of Medicare Part A and B providers.\n\nDuring his second term, President Obama made cracking down on Medicare and Medicaid fraud a high priority, as federal and state law enforcement agencies launched a series of high-profile arrests and prosecutions.\n\nRelated: Audit Uncovers $124.7 B of Overpayments and Fraud in Medicare and Medicaid\n\nLast summer the administration touted a breakthrough in combating rampant fraud in the two health care program.

As Rob Garver reported here on Tuesday, the CBO estimated that passage of HR3762, the Restoring Americans\u2019 Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, would increase the uninsured by 18 million in its first year, then 32 million by the tenth year of its enactment. The report also estimated that the elimination of mandates would accelerate the already existing trend toward a so-called \u201cdeath spiral\u201d within individual insurance markets as underwriters would have an even higher trend toward high-utilization clients than they do now.\n\nThis analysis is, however, largely irrelevant. The new CBO report is an update of an earlier analysis it performed on legislation from nearly two years ago. Republicans pushed HR3762 in 2015 as a vehicle to force President Barack Obama into a veto of a repeal of Obamacare. The sponsors wrote the bill with caution about the consensus limits to the process of budget reconciliation, the only method available for avoiding a filibuster in the Senate.\n\nRepublicans plan to repeal most of the rest of Obamacare (except perhaps the Medicare reforms) through other means. There is still significant strategizing as to whether they can repeal more through budget reconciliation than first assumed when writing HR3762 as well.\n\nRelated: Repealing Obamacare Taxes Gives the Super Wealthy $7 Million More a Year\n\nCharles Blahous, a former deputy director of the National Economic Council under President George W. Bush and a public trustee of Social Security and Medicare from 2010-15, points out the errors in taking the CBO\u2019s report on HR3762 seriously as the totality of Obamacare repeal. The CBO scored only \u201cthe parts moving through the budget reconciliation process,\u201d which alone would be \u201cproblematic in the ways CBO has identified.\u201d\n\nThe initial reports gloss over the fact that even the CBO recognized that adding two other pieces to the repeal \u2013 the insurance coverage mandates and community rating requirements \u2013 would result in innovation that would add between six and nine million people to the ranks of the insured, and that premiums would be \u201csubstantially lower\u201d than presently under full repeal.\n\nBlahous writes that the CBO\u2019s analysis strengthens recent Republican arguments that reconciliation can be used for a full repeal, rather than the HR3762 approach. Those impacts \u201cwould have substantial effects on the federal budget,\u201d he notes, \u201cand could well strengthen a tactical argument that repealing these regulatory components of the ACA should also be considered germane for budget reconciliation purposes.\u201d\n\nRelated: Could a Hybrid Obamacare Plan Bring the GOP and Dems Together?\n\nWhy did CBO score an old bill that only covered part of the process, rather than wait a few weeks to see what Republicans plan to offer? The CBO report states that it was \u201cprepared at the request of the Senate Minority Leader, the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Finance, and the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\u201d All four are Senate Democrats, led my Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY), an adamant opponent of Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare. The report gives opponents of the incoming administration some significant talking points about legislation that has long since expired but still has usefulness in driving public opinion.\n\nPerhaps Schumer and his Senate allies should have made their argument before the 2016 election, using the previous scoring on partial Obamacare repeal. Oh, wait \u2013 they did, and they did in the 2014 midterms as well. Voters delivered their verdict on Obamacare, one of the most discussed policies in both elections, and Democrats lost both times. Reaching back to 2015 for data on an approach that is at best incomplete and at worst expired may give them some talking points, but it won\u2019t make voters love Obamacare or turn their back on their clear decision to replace it with policies that allow for innovation, proper risk management, and economic growth.\n\nThe big question will be whether Republicans led by Donald Trump and Paul Ryan can deliver that kind of replacement. The jury may still be out on that, and the details of both repeal and replacement may still be in negotiation. Perhaps we should wait on scoring those outcomes until we see what options Republicans produce, and take our time in analyzing them. Had we done that seven years ago rather than rush a three-thousand-page bill through Congress and trust that we would know what was in the bill after it passed, perhaps we could have avoided much of the damage that has occurred since the passage of Obamacare."}, {"date": "2017/01/18", "title": "Tom Price Makes a Big Claim: People Won\u2019t Get Shafted on Health Care", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/18/Tom-Price-Makes-Big-Claim-People-Won-t-Get-Shafted-Health-Care", "text": "The headlines out of Wednesday\u2019s Senate confirmation hearings on President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice to head the Department of Health and Human Services were two-fold:\n\nOne was that Trump would make good on his repeated campaign pledge not to cut Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security in restructuring the government health care system.

Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the HELP Committee Chair, and Senate Finance Committee Chair Orrin Hatch of Utah, did their best to defend Price from sharp attacks from Democratic Sens.

Backed by the powerful National Association of Realtors and supported broadly by middle-class homeowners, previous efforts to dismantle the mortgage deduction have gone nowhere.\n\nRelated: The Best and Worst States for Taxes in 2017\n\nHowever, the Better Way tax-reform \u201cblueprint\u201d from Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan would essentially get rid of the mortgage interest deduction, without policymakers having to vote to eliminate it. The plan would make the standard deduction far more valuable -- increasing it from $12,600 to $24,000 for a married couple. This would result in far fewer people itemizing their taxes, which is necessary in order to claim the mortgage tax deduction. (President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s tax plan calls for raising the deduction even higher, to $30,000 for joint filers.)\n\nUnder the House Republicans\u2019 plan, an estimated 38 million of the 45 million filers (or 84 percent) who currently itemize would opt instead for the standard deduction, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center. The GOP proposal states that \u201cfar fewer taxpayers will choose to itemize deductions, with the vast majority of taxpayers finding they are better off by taking advantage of the larger, simpler standard deduction instead.\u201d\n\nUnder current rules, taxpayers can itemize and deduct the interest paid on up to $1 million on a mortgage, and home equity debt of up to $100,000. The mortgage interest deduction is the third-most expensive subsidy in the tax code, costing the federal government about $70 billion per year, according to the Tax Foundation.\n\nEven with Republican control of the House, Senate and the White House, the Republican tax plan is nowhere near a done deal. Nearly three-quarters of Americans recently polled by the National Association of Home Builders say that they support the government providing tax incentives that encourage homeownership, and lobbyists for the real estate and construction industries are already gearing up to fight the provision.\n\nRelated: Companies That May Not Make It Through 2017\n\nIf the blueprint were to become law, it would have ramifications for millions of taxpayers, homeowners and sellers, but the overall impact on the housing market (and your wallet) may be smaller than you think. Here\u2019s what you need to know:\n\n1. Home values could fall in the short-term.\n\nThe total elimination of the mortgage interest deduction might push prices down around 7 percent, according a recent paper from the Federal Reserve. The impact might be smaller if the deduction is not fully repealed. That\u2019s a relatively small decrease compared to the double-digit decline seen after the housing bubble burst in 2006, but it would mean a paper loss of nearly $17,000 on the average $240,000 home. Still, the impact of increasing the standard deduction, rather than eliminating the mortgage-interest deduction, would likely have a smaller impact.\n\n2. But only a small portion of taxpayers uses the mortgage-interest deduction.\n\nWhile it enjoys broad support, the vast majority of homeowners don\u2019t benefit from the mortgage interest deduction as it currently stands. The benefit is only available to those who have a mortgage on their home and who itemize their taxes.\n\nOnly about 20 percent of taxpayers currently claim the deduction, and it has an average benefit of just over $2,000, according to the Tax Policy Center. \u201cYou go to [mid-tier markets] like Texas, Florida, and Arizona, and no one talks about buying a home to save on taxes,\u201d says John Burns of John Burns Real Estate Consulting, which provides data and advice to real estate investor. \u201cIt\u2019s not even part of the equation anymore.\u201d\n\n3. Most consumers would still be better off buying.\n\nIt\u2019s cheaper to buy than to rent a home in most parts of the country, and that wouldn\u2019t change with the elimination of the mortgage deduction. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t fundamentally affect the rent-versus-buy decision,\u201d says Trulia Chief Economist Ralph McLoughlin. \u201cIt makes it less of a better deal to buy than to rent, but buying still remains a good financial option if a household can stay in their home for seven years.\u201d\n\nA calculation by Politico finds that a homeowner with a $65,000 annual salary would see the tax benefits of buying a $263,000 condo plummet from $3,325 a year to $166. Tying up your assets and losing the ability to easily relocate may not be worth that much, although there are other benefits of homeownership, such as growing equity and protection from rising rents, and there are many emotional incentives that compel people to become home owners.\n\n4. Middle-income homeowners would feel the biggest bite.\n\nAny impact on home prices would likely be concentrated on more moderately priced homes, where the owners aren\u2019t paying enough in interest to outweigh taking the new deduction but aren\u2019t in a high enough tax bracket to get a huge break. The Tax Policy Center estimates that middle-income taxpayers would see an average tax cut of only $260 per year under the Republican plan. That\u2019s hardly enough to offset even a modest loss in home equity, although long-term demand would likely see prices bounce back over time.\n\n5. High-income homeowners would benefit.\n\nThe wealthiest homeowners would benefit from both the tax cut and continued access to the mortgage-interest deduction, since they\u2019d likely continue to itemize. Those making more than $1 million a year typically save nearly $9,000 thanks to the deduction. Under the Republic tax plan, the top quintile of taxpayers would also receive an average tax cut of $11,000 a year.\n\nDue to larger mortgages and a higher tax rate, wealthy borrowers already benefit disproportionately from the mortgage interest deductions, which wouldn\u2019t change. Wealthy taxpayers often choose to finance the purchase of a home even though they could pay cash, as part of a broader tax planning strategy."}, {"date": "2017/01/18", "title": "Germany, You\u2019re Fired!

Last August, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office reported that the fiscal 2016 budget deficit would increase in relation to gross domestic product for the first time since 2009 and would continue to rise for the coming decade.\n\nWith government spending outpacing revenues throughout the year, the fiscal 2016 deficit totaled nearly $587 billion, or about $148 billion more than the previous year\u2019s shortfall. Without major changes in policy, such as Congress approving higher taxes or reforms to Social Security, Medicare and other major entitlements, the deficit is projected to grow considerably in the coming decade as a share of the overall economy.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Is a Fiscal Minefield for the GOP\n\nPublicly held debt rose as a share of the overall economy from 74 percent at the end of fiscal 2015 to 77 percent at the end of fiscal 2016, compared to an average of 44 percent of gross domestic product over the past 70 years.

Absent a significant change in course, the debt-to-GDP ratio will surpass its historic high of 106 percent within 15 to 25 years.\n\nThe GAO report indicates that long-term shortfalls in the Medicare Hospital Insurance and Social Security trust funds \u201cadd to the importance of beginning action.\u201d Medicare and Social Security will begin to spend more than they take in by the end of the decade, according to the most recent report of the trustees.\n\nLong-term insolvency of these and other entitlement programs are problems that Congress and the incoming Trump administration will have to address. A showdown over entitlement reform could come sooner than later as Trump and congressional Republican leaders have begun pressing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe GAO report urged Congress and the new administration to consider new innovations in managing the country\u2019s long-term debt beyond existing statutory discretionary spending caps. \u201cGAO has suggested Congress consider alternative approaches that would better link decisions about borrowing to finance the debt with decisions about spending and revenue at the time those decisions are made.\u201d\n\nRelated: Deficit Hawks Take Trump on an Ominous Tour of the Fiscal Cliff\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the report said, executive actions alone cannot put the U.S. government on a sustainable fiscal path, and that it is important that departments and agencies \u201cact as stewards of federal resources.\n\nThe GAO report reiterated a series of steps that federal agencies could take to help address the government\u2019s long term fiscal problems, including the following:\n\nReduce improper payments.

Since fiscal 2003, cumulative estimates of overpayments have totaled over $1.2 trillion.\n\n\n\n\n\nAddress the persistent tax gap.

With few exceptions (notably, former Treasury Secretary Paul O\u2019Neil, who not coincidentally came from a manufacturing background) U.S. officials have consistently said that the preference among US policymakers is for a strong dollar.\n\nBut the trade-offs inherent in a strong-dollar policy aren\u2019t always obvious, and more importantly, the ability of the president to materially affect the value of the dollar without taking active steps to manipulate the currency are unclear. Some key questions:\n\nWhat\u2019s the benefit of a strong dollar?\n\nA strong dollar has a number of positive impacts on the economy, the most obvious of which is that it makes imported goods more affordable for American consumers. It also makes investing in the U.S. more attractive to foreign companies and investment funds. If the assumption is that the dollar will continue to appreciate against foreign currencies -- or at least can be expected not to lose value relative to them -- it is naturally a more attractive currency to hold.\n\nThe strong dollar also keeps the Treasury Department\u2019s borrowing costs low, meaning that when the US borrows more money or rolls over existing debt, less federal spending is dedicated to interest payments than would be under a weak dollar scenario. Those lower interest rates extend to consumers as well, who benefit from cheaper mortgages and other loans.\n\nRelated: Why the Political Mainstream Keeps Failing America\u2019s Workers\n\nWhat\u2019s the harm of a strong dollar?\n\nThe trouble with a strong dollar gets to the heart of Trump\u2019s promise to pump up the volume of American exports: it makes goods and services produced in the U.S. more expensive relative to those produced in other countries. Every time the euro, yen, yuan, or ruble gains against the dollar, relative prices of U.S. exports go down, making them more competitive globally.\n\nOn its face, this is good for the United States in that, theoretically, at least, it leads to more jobs in the manufacturing sector and in service sectors that sell to foreign clients.\n\nWhat have US policymakers done in the past to keep the dollar strong?\n\nThe short answer: Not much. The strong dollar policy has largely been a rhetorical stance for decades, with little direct action to back it up. The US dollar floats freely in the currency markets, and as a rule, the federal government doesn\u2019t act directly to influence its value vis-a-vis other global currencies. (In fact, on the campaign trail, Trump frequently railed against China for being a \u201ccurrency manipulator\u201d -- that is, for taking active measures to keep the yuan, and therefore Chinese exports, cheap.)\n\nThere was a brief episode in 2011 when central banks from various countries acted in concert to stabilize currency markets in the wake of a disastrous earthquake in Japan, but in recent years that sort of thing has been the exception rather than the rule.\n\nRelated: The Government Marks 20 Years of Failure to Balance Its Books\n\nIn fact, some would argue that US monetary policy, as implemented by the Federal Reserve, has revealed a de facto weak dollar preference by keeping interest rates at rock bottom in an effort to spur some degree of inflation. The strength of the dollar has persisted in spite of the Fed\u2019s extremely accommodative stance on monetary policy for various reasons, including the global perception of the US economy as a safe haven in times of global uncertainty.\n\nWhat can Trump do to weaken the dollar?\n\nAs an example, Trump\u2019s Treasury Department could try to weaken the dollar by buying up other currencies to drive up their prices relative to the greenback. However, the US is party to international agreements against unilateral currency manipulation.\n\nFurther, it\u2019s unclear any such policy would be effective in a market as massive as the one that exists for the US dollar internationally. Some $5 trillion in dollar trades take place every single day in foreign exchange markets, the vast majority well beyond the control of the federal government, meaning that it could be difficult for unilateral action by the Treasury Department to move the needle.\n\nOne avenue open to Trump is to follow through on his threat to impose protectionist trade restrictions meant to boost US exports at the cost of foreign manufacturers. However, that\u2019s dangerous territory, not only because it invites instability in the markets, but also because it could spark retaliatory action from trading partners that could easily spiral out of anyone\u2019s control."}, {"date": "2017/01/18", "title": "Treasury Secretary Lew Warns Trump Against Waging a Trade War ", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/18/Treasury-Secretary-Lew-Warns-Trump-Against-Waging-Trade-War", "text": "On his way out the door, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Tuesday warned the incoming Trump administration of the high global risks of launching a trade war against China, Mexico and other economic rivals with an aggressive tariff policy.\n\nRepublican President-elect Donald Trump has been rattling China\u2019s cage for months, complaining about that country\u2019s alleged currency manipulation that hurts U.S. exports and helped produce a U.S. trade deficit of $45.2 billion late last year.

Hillary Clinton fans blame Vladimir Putin for her defeat; President Obama warns that Russia is trying to \u201cweaken us,\u201d and John McCain says Moscow is out to \u201cdestroy democracy.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the country has been riveted by titillating materials purporting to show that Russia has the goods on Donald Trump, unnerved by reports that incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn has had private conversations with the Russian ambassador, and alarmed by CIA Director John Brennan\u2019s warnings that Trump doesn\u2019t have a \u201cfull understanding\u201d of Russia\u2019s capabilities and intentions.\n\nRelated: House Intel Chief Sets up Showdown Over Allegation Russia Helped Trump\n\nWhy this reversion to Cold War anxieties? Four reasons: First, Russia has become a convenient scapegoat for Clinton\u2019s defeat (along with Comey, and \u201cfake news\u201d and racism and GOP \u201cvoter suppression\u201d and the Electoral College). Second, President Obama failed to take cyber warfare seriously for eight years even as the intrusions from Russia, China, North Korea, the Syrian Electronic Army, Iran and elsewhere became bolder and costlier, finally emerging as an unacceptable effort to sway our election. Third, Donald Trump\u2019s assertions that Putin is smart (as he indeed is) and a strong leader (also true) have allowed critics to portray the President-elect as somehow besotted by and in league with the Russian strongman.\n\nFour, Putin is indeed evil and always has been. But, it is not Trump who has been naive about the threat from Russia. That dubious honor belongs to President Obama. In 2012 when Mitt Romney said Russia was our number one geopolitical foe, Obama mocked him saying, \u201cThe 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold War\u2019s been over for 20 years.\u201d Obama still had a lot to learn.\n\nNonetheless, Trump opponents, including some in the GOP, are piling on, hinting that his cabinet nominees have nefarious ties to Russia. A righteous Marco Rubio feigned astonishment that Rex Tillerson, Trump\u2019s pick for Secretary of State, would not declare Putin a \u201cwar criminal\u201d based on Russian attacks on Syrian civilians. Surely Florida\u2019s junior senator knows that no responsible candidate for our top diplomatic post would take such an undiplomatic stance.\n\nRelated: Trump Is Wrong About Russia, but He Does Get One Thing Right\n\nTillerson\u2019s transgression is that under his leadership, Exxon Mobil has acquired interests in Russia\u2019s Arctic, the Black Sea and Western Siberia, in partnership with state-owned Rosneft, led by a close Putin ally. Given that Russia ranks eighth in proven world oil reserves, and that the country has historically relied on western technology to produce oil in challenging regions like the Arctic, it follows that Exxon would work to secure access to reserves in Russia \u2013 something that most leading oil companies have done, and that would be impossible without a local partner.\n\nWhy explore in a hostile land? In 2015 Exxon Mobil was unable to replace the oil and natural gas it produced for the first time in twenty-one years. Easy-to-access oil reserves are increasingly rare and much has been put off limits due to environmental concerns. Russia has potential. Tillerson and other industry executives have had to balance the risks of operating in a country without the rule of law against providing shareholders a diminishing asset.\n\nMake no mistake; every U.S. CEO is well aware of the dangers of operating in Russia, or any other unfriendly country. They are routinely briefed by our intelligence agencies (who also seek information gleaned by U.S. firms abroad) and in addition hire outside advisors that specialize in political information before committing shareholder funds.\n\nTo protect its interests, Exxon Mobil lobbied against various sanctions in recent years that threatened its Russian operations. That\u2019s what companies do.\n\nRelated: Making Friends with Russia May Be Harder than Trump Seems to Think\n\nAt the heart of all the Sturm und, Drang about Russia is a desperate and absurd effort to undermine Donald Trump by making him out to be an ignorant and willing tool of Putin\u2019s aggression. While the indignant New York Times has fulminated about Trump\u2019s \u201cembrace\u201d of Putin, even they had to acknowledge that his nomination of James Mattis to be his Secretary of Defense points in another direction. Mattis has long been outspoken on the dangers posed by Russia, and reiterated his position during recent Senate hearings, declaring the country to be the number one threat to U.S. interests. Does The Times not think Trump knew of Mattis\u2019 hard-headed position? That he picked his name out of a hat?\n\nLike Obama, President-elect Trump has proposed that a good working relationship with Russia would be a positive for the U.S. After all, that was what Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201creset\u201d was supposed to achieve. Obama in effect welcomed such a partnership when he asked Putin to take over the disposal of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s cache of chemical weapons in Syria, and just recently reiterated that ambition, saying at a press conference in Germany he hopes Trump will find \u201careas where we can cooperate with Russia, where our values and interests align.\u201d\n\nAt that same forum, Obama also said he hoped that his successor \u201cwould stand up to Russia.\u201d That, of course, is what the White House failed to do. President Obama once promised that Vladimir Putin would pay for his sins by being isolated by the international community, but he then rescued Russia from that very isolation by inviting Moscow to resolve Syria\u2019s chemical weapons issue. He also asked for Russia\u2019s acquiescence in his legacy Iran nuke deal, allowing Putin to become the major power broker in the Middle East.\n\nRelated: A Timeline of Trump\u2019s Flirtation With Putin and Russia\n\nThere were good reasons for Clinton to attempt a reset with Russia. We need allies in the fight against ISIS and Russia fears Islamic terrorism as much as we do. However, Putin, who like all bullies respects only strength, did not respect President Obama. The White House could have adopted a more robust playbook by accelerating natural gas exports to undermine Russia\u2019s energy grip on Western Europe, for instance. Or we might have committed troops to the Baltic states earlier on, reinforcing our commitment to our NATO allies. Only recently has Obama allowed that show of force.\n\nThe bottom line is that our relations with Russia under Obama have been hostage to his legacy ambitions \u2013 primarily the Iran deal.

Additionally, several balls were added to the festive weekend during Reagan\u2019s first inauguration. And Carter purposefully kept his inauguration modest, with his wife wearing the same blue ball gown she had worn six years earlier to the celebration of his gubernatorial inauguration in Georgia.\n\nWoodrow Wilson also had a low-budget inauguration in 1913.

Bill Cassidy (R-LA) to create an unusual hybrid approach. Cassidy\u2019s approach would essentially shift major decision-making authority away from the federal government and allow the states to decide whether to stick with some version of Obamacare or opt for whatever Trump and the Republicans come up with.\n\nRelated: Congress Is Headed for a Showdown With Trump Over Obamacare Repeal\n\nCassidy, one of a half-dozen moderate Senate Republicans who has voiced concern about their party\u2019s increasingly perilous course on health care, first introduced \u201cThe World\u2019s Greatest Healthcare Plan\u201d bill a year ago in concert with Rep. Pete Sessions (R-TX). It began as a bid to give patients \u201cmarket-based solutions\u201d by lowering costs, eviscerating Obamacare mandates on individuals and businesses, and returning power over insurance to the states.\n\nBut over time, the Cassidy-Sessions approach has evolved into a potential starting point for the two parties to negotiate a compromise that would somehow preserve many of the features strongly favored by Democrats and blue states while allowing the Republican majority and its allies among red states to chart a new course in national health care.\n\n\u201cI believe that Republicans and Democrats can find common ground,\u201d Cassidy said in a floor speech earlier this month. \u201cMy replacement plan would give states the option.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am willing to concede that some folks\u2014the Minority Leader\u2014believe that Obamacare is working just fine,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my plan, we repeal Obamacare on a federal level, but if states like California or New York think that Obamacare works for them, then god bless them.\u201d\n\nRelated: Rand Paul\u2019s Obamacare Substitute: Take Two Aspirin and Call Me in the Morning\n\nUnder Cassidy\u2019s approach, state legislatures in Sacramento, Albany and the rest of the country could decide to take federal funding to maintain an Obamacare-style system in their own states or opt for the GOP alternative.\n\nThe legislation would repeal the federal mandates that require individuals to purchase health insurance and that require employers to provide coverage under the threat of penalties. Every American would receive a refundable tax credit that could be spent on health insurance premiums or deposited into a Health Savings Account and used to pay directly for health care services. They would also qualify for catastrophic major medical coverage and prescription drugs.\n\n\u201cUnder my replacement plan, we would also cover more Americans than Obamacare by giving states the option of enrolling the uninsured in a basic health plan unless they choose to opt out,\u201d Cassidy explained. \u201cThis will likely lead to 95 percent enrollment or more.\u201d\n\nThe plan calls for a two-year transition period that would give states through 2018 to decide what approach to take.

However, there is considerable concern among health care economists and other experts about the lack of a fully-articulated Republican plan.\n\nTrump and the Republicans have promised a plan that will not only cover as many Americans as the ACA, but will provide even better care at lower costs, while providing wider choice. However, all of the plans put forward so far have been outlines at best, in which hand-waving about the power of market forces does virtually all of the heavy economic lifting.\n\nRelated: 5 Key Pieces of a \u2018TrumpCare\u2019 Plan that Could Affect Your Health\n\nThis has led many to worry that the Republicans, feeling pressure to follow through on the vow to repeal Obamacare immediately, will move forward with legislation to gut the law before a replacement plan has been put in place.\n\nWhether or not that will actually happen is anybody\u2019s guess. Perhaps Trump was telling the truth when he told The Washington Post over the weekend that he has a secret plan in the works that is almost ready for public release.\n\nBut if there is no plan, or if Congress repeals the ACA and then finds itself unable to craft a new one from the mishmash of proposals currently on the table, the consequences would be enormous for the millions of Americans currently covered by either ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion or by the non-group policies sold on the state health care exchanges.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation on Tuesday released an estimate of the effect of implementing H.R. 3762, the Restoring Americans\u2019 Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015. That\u2019s the bill that President Obama vetoed last year, and while it isn\u2019t being reconsidered by the new Congress, it contains many elements that virtually any repeal bill put forward would also share. Those include repeal of the ACA\u2019s individual and employer mandates and elimination of its Medicaid expansion. H.R. 3762 also kept in place many of the insurance market reforms contained in the ACA, including a ban on refusing coverage due to pre-existing conditions and on pricing according to health status.\n\nRelated: Rand Paul\u2019s Obamacare Substitute: Take Two Aspirin and Call Me in the Morning\n\nIf the bill were passed, according to CBO and JCT, \u201cThe number of people who are uninsured would increase by 18 million in the first new plan year following enactment of the bill. Later, after the elimination of the ACA\u2019s expansion of Medicaid eligibility and of subsidies for insurance purchased through the ACA marketplaces, that number would increase to 27 million, and then to 32 million in 2026.\u201d\n\nAnd those who remained in the exchanges -- mostly older, sicker people -- would face steep premium increases.\n\n\u201cPremiums in the nongroup market (for individual policies purchased through the marketplaces or directly from insurers) would increase by 20 percent to 25 percent\u2014relative to projections under current law\u2014in the first new plan year following enactment,\u201d the report finds. \u201cThe increase would reach about 50 percent in the year following the elimination of the Medicaid expansion and the marketplace subsidies, and premiums would about double by 2026.\u201d\n\nPerhaps most troubling of all is that premium increases aside, the elimination of the mandates would drive so many insurers out of the health care exchanges that by 2026, three out of four Americans would be living in an area in which no insurer offered nongroup policies through them.\n\n\u201cPrior experience in states that implemented similar nongroup market reforms without a mandate penalty or subsidies has demonstrated the potential for market destabilization,\u201d the study notes. \u201cSeveral states that enacted such market reforms later repealed or substantially modified those reforms in response to increased premiums and insurers\u2019 departure from the market.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump Says His Plan Would Provide \u2018Insurance for Everybody\u2019\n\nAnd for many Americans, that change would be almost immediate: \u201c[A]bout half of the nation\u2019s population lives in areas that would have no insurer participating in the nongroup market in the first year after the repeal of the marketplace subsidies took effect, and that share would continue to increase, extending to about three-quarters of the population by 2026.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, this scenario is not an inescapable result of ACA repeal. Congress and the president could produce an alternate proposal that would eliminate the impact of reform, or at least lessen it. However, without a clear articulation of that plan in advance, it\u2019s natural for people who are the most vulnerable to a disrupted healthcare market to worry about a future in which Obamacare goes away, and no real replacement is ever put in place."}, {"date": "2017/01/17", "title": "What Obamacare Repeal Could Mean for Your Workplace Health Plan", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/17/What-Obamacare-Repeal-Could-Mean-Your-Workplace-Health-Plan", "text": "Even if President-elect Donald Trump succeeds in repealing the Affordable Care Act, most companies will continue to offer many of the popular provisions of the law to their employees.\n\nRelated: 8 Big Changes Under Tom Price\u2019s Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nA survey of human resources executives by outplacement firm Challenger Gray and Christmas found that 100 percent of them said that they would continue to provide coverage to employees with pre-existing conditions, and 60 percent said they\u2019d continue to offer coverage to employee\u2019s children through age 26.\n\nEven before the advent of Obamacare, employer-sponsored health care plans were typically more generous than the plans available on the individual market.

Tom Price (R-GA) purchased stock in a medical device manufacturer last year just days before introducing a bill aimed at protecting the company from an adverse government regulation.\n\nLast March, Price bought shares worth $1,000 to $15,000 in Zimmer-Biomet, a leading manufacturer of knee and hip replacements. Barely a week later, the senior Republican lawmaker introduced legislation designed to delay until 2018 a new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reimbursement formula that analysts warned would be financially harmful to the company when fully implemented, according to the report.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Health Secretary Invested in a Company Linked to the Opioid Epidemic\n\nFor more than a year, Price, a wealthy orthopedic surgeon who was picked by Trump to help lead the effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, had complained that CMS\u2019s proposed reduced Medicare payments for hip and knee replacements threatened hospitals and medical providers. Zimmer-Biomet and another large manufacturer of hip and knee replacement devices stood to lose the most from the new rule.\n\nThree months after Price introduced his bill, dubbed the Health Inpatient Procedures Act of 2016 or HIP Act, Zimmer-Biomet\u2019s political action committee contributed $1,000 to Price\u2019s campaign committee, according to the report.\n\nThe Trump transition team immediately dismissed the CNN story as \u201cjunk reporting\u201d and part of an effort by Senate Democrats and the liberal media to derail Price\u2019s nomination.

McKesson Corp., the largest drug distributor in the U.S., has been the target of two publicly disclosed U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration actions, according to The Washington Post. The company subsequently paid $163 million in fines in response to allegations that it \u201cfailed to report hundreds of suspicious orders for millions of pain pills\u201d from Internet pharmacies and others, according to the newspaper.\n\nLate last week, Price listed McKesson Corp as one of the 43 stocks he intends to sell as part of a major divestiture of his financial holdings and business interests.

You can\u2019t place yourself much closer to the political center than with the team that produced this document. With financial support from nine foundations, Apple and asset management giant BlackRock, the co-chairs included center-left Senator Mark Warner, center-right former Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels, George W. Bush\u2019s Domestic Policy Council director John Bridgeland and his immediate predecessor, Bruce Reed, former head of the Democratic Leadership Council. It doesn\u2019t get more mainstream and technocratic.\n\nTo their credit, the authors wrestle with a legitimate problem: the broken social contract between workers and employers. Corporate America, obsessed with short-term growth, squeezes its labor force to help achieve it.\n\nModern businesses, when not outsourcing jobs abroad, have stepped up reliance on independent contractors who aren\u2019t employees, and therefore not entitled to most benefits. Lawrence Katz and Alan Krueger estimate that nearly all the net employment in the Obama era came from so-called \u201calternative work arrangements\u201d like freelance or temporary work. According to the report, these trends lead to lower wages, reduced benefits, a lower labor share of national income, stagnant economic growth and living standards, workforce disinvestment and more reliance on government safety nets. \u201cThe failure to shore up democratic capitalism,\u201d the report concludes, \u201cposes grave dangers to democracy and capitalism alike.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump Is Wrong When It Comes to Saving American Jobs\n\nWith that wind-up, you might expect a radical break with the status quo, something that could really ensure broadly shared prosperity for everyone who participates in the economy. You wouldn\u2019t expect 13 different types of tax breaks, which I counted in the solutions chapter of the document.\n\nThis includes a wide variety of business tax cuts for worker education and training, a typical obsession of centrist types who implicitly blame workers for not having the right skills to compete in the global economy. In this case, the recommendations effectively bribe companies to finance these programs. Other tax breaks encourage employee stock ownership and wage increases. Workers would get a few of these tax benefits directly, but most would be funneled through their employers.\n\nThe conceit here is that the tax code offers too many incentives for physical investment capital rather than human capital. But the recommendation is not to roll back those investment capital giveaways, but to slash business taxes further in a bank shot to benefit workers. The only result is drastically reduced corporate tax revenues, and less money available for social insurance. Later in the document, the authors recommend an overhaul of the tax code to lower rates and broaden the base, but virtually all the tax cuts preceding it would tighten that base through targeted tax breaks. It\u2019s all carrots to businesses, and nearly no sticks.\n\nRelated: It's Not the Skills Gap \u2014 Why So Many Jobs Are Going Unfilled\n\nIt\u2019s in reacting to the so-called \u201con-demand economy\u201d that the technocratic center reveals itself. As I\u2019ve written before, the mode of survival for the Ubers of the world lies in harvesting giant government subsidies to make their sketchy business models work. In the name of helping workers, the Aspen Institute report goes right along with that.\n\nThe authors recommend that unemployment insurance offices should maintain an updated directory of on-demand, app-based jobs, effectively becoming a publicly funded headhunter service for private companies seeking desperate labor. They even suggest \u201cstates should be allowed to experiment with using a portion of unemployment funds to buy equipment to lend out to beneficiaries.\u201d So public money \u2014 perhaps even taken out of unemployment insurance checks, though that\u2019s not clear \u2014 would go to buying used Chromebooks that the recently unemployed could borrow to get on Taskrabbit or Lyft.\n\nI don\u2019t recall unemployment programs ever lending workers power tools, or a bus pass or any other equipment they might need to land a job. But government should spare no expense in funneling the unemployed into the very contract-labor positions the report\u2019s authors spent an entire paper identifying as contributing to the decline of the American workplace?\n\nRelated: Why 2017 Should Be a Very Good Year for Finding a New Job\n\nThe real goal here appears to be to kick people off public assistance. \u201cIf evidence shows on-demand platforms lower barriers to employment, then work requirements should be applied to certain safety net programs as appropriate,\u201d the report recommends. This would force people into contingent labor arrangements to keep their benefits. On-demand companies wouldn\u2019t benefit more from these recommendations if they wrote them on their own.\n\nThere are a few nice ideas in the report, from boosting worker representation on the job (not through unions, which are barely mentioned, but worker councils) to encouraging long-term investment to exploring portable benefits that freelance or temp workers can use (though only with state-level pilot programs). But the reliance on tax breaks and the special dispensation for on-demand work lets the slip show. The cure for an atomized workplace is further atomization, fragmenting collective worker power. The only way for workers to achieve success is through bribing employers and hoping the crumbs fall from the C-suites into their hands.\n\nIf that\u2019s the considered response from the establishment center to our economic problems, it\u2019s no surprise that populism is on the rise. Ideas like bolstering unions or breaking up concentrated markets sit far outside the centrist range of conception. They\u2019re so far removed from the experience of workers that they can\u2019t imagine how to use policy tools to truly empower them.

So, no, I don't think divestiture is too high a price to pay to be the president of the United States of America.\u201d\n\nPriebus, in an appearance on ABC\u2019s This Week, sounded a vaguely threatening note, saying, \u201cThe head of the government ethics ought to be careful because that person is becoming extremely political. Apparently, may have made a -- publicly supported Hillary Clinton as calling out the president with information on Twitter about our disentangling of the business over a month ago.\n\n\u201cSo I'm not so sure what this person at Government Ethics, what sort of standing he has anymore in giving these opinions.\u201d\n\nRelated: 4 Ways Trump\u2019s Conflicts of Interest Could Actually Hurt the US\n\nChaffetz, appearing on the same program, called attention to a series of tweets from the OGE Twitter account from Nov. 30, which Shaub had written. They praised Trump for his \u201cdecision\u201d to divest his assets, despite the fact that the president-elect had made no such announcement. Shaub later said that he was trying to nudge Trump in the right direction using \u201cthe vernacular of the president-elect\u2019s favorite social media platform.\n\n\u201cMy question is about the head of the Office of Government Ethics. Is he acting ethically when he sent out nine tweets praising Donald Trump saying that his plan was brilliant?\u201d Chaffetz asked. \u201cHow did he come to that conclusion? And how does he come to his current conclusions having never done an investigation and never looked at the paperwork in the point where he can actually come to a reasonable conclusion? I think that's unethical.\u201d\n\nChaffetz last week released a letter he had sent Shaub demanding that he present himself to staff members of his committee for a \u201ctranscribed interview\u201d and left no doubt that the funding of his agency -- and his job -- would hang on whether or not Chaffetz approved of his answers.\n\nHe also said that he was not inclined to request information on Trump\u2019s businesses once he is sworn in. Multiple ethics experts have warned that as both president and owner of the Trump Organization, Trump will immediately be in violation of the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause, which bars elected officials from accepting payments from foreign governments. Chaffetz said investigating Trump\u2019s ties to foreign governments would be a \u201cfishing expedition.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the emoluments clause is not as black and white as some have alleged. Two different articles by constitutional scholars highlight the ambiguity. A piece in The New York Times by Seth Barrett Tillman argues that the Foreign Gifts Clause in the constitution does not apply to the President. Whether or not Donald Trump is violating the letter or spirit of the emoluments law is argued in The Washington Post by Jonathan H. Adler who says:\n\n\u201cWhether or not one concludes that Trump\u2019s business dealings violate the letter or the spirit of the Emoluments Clause, the underlying controversy is almost certainly non-justiciable. It is difficult to conceive of a scenario in which someone would have standing to challenge Trump\u2019s arrangements and even harder to think what sort of remedy could be ordered by a court. In other words, if there are concerns about how President Trump handles his various investments, the only remedies will be political.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Health Secretary Invested in a Company Linked to the Opioid Epidemic\n\nThe pressure being put on Shaub, and the disinterest in Trump\u2019s potential conflicts has infuriated longtime ethics experts.\n\nAmbassador Norman Eisen, the former chief ethics officer for the Obama administration, said, \u201cI think that is terrible. Walt Shaub is a dedicated public servant, has come up through the ranks under both Democrats and Republicans...Walt Shaub is a true ethics hero for speaking out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Office of Government Ethics has taken the right position on this, one consistent with many Republicans and Democrats,\u201d said Richard Painter, the former chief ethics officer for the George W. Bush administration.\n\n\u201cI believe yes, if he doesn't make sure that all the foreign government payments -- and this includes banks and other corporations owned by foreign governments and sovereign wealth funds, that all of that money is not out of the Trump organization by Friday, when he takes the oath, he will be in violation of the Constitution,\" Painter said.\n\nEisen went on to criticize Chaffetz for placing his focus on a bureaucrat rather than the incoming president. \u201cWhy is Congressman Chaffetz investigating Walter Shaub for doing his job...for speaking so courageously? It was one of the most extraordinary acts of courage that I've seen from a career public official. Instead of investigating the fact that the president-elect is going to be violating the Constitution?\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/01/16", "title": "Rand Paul\u2019s Obamacare Substitute: Take Two Aspirin and Call Me in the Morning", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/16/Rand-Paul-s-Obamacare-Substitute-Take-Two-Aspirin-and-Call-Me-Morning", "text": "As the incoming Trump administration over the weekend reaffirmed its commitment to simultaneously repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky got an early jump in promoting his vision of a suitable \u2013 but relatively threadbare \u2013 replacement.\n\nDuring an appearance Sunday on CNN, Paul unveiled the broad outlines of his plan that contains a number of measures favored by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), the nominee to become the next secretary of Health and Human Services. Those include tax credits to help Americans defray the cost of health insurance premiums and increased use of tax-exempt Health Savings Accounts.\n\nRelated: Rand Paul Is Coming to the Rescue with an Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nBut central to Paul\u2019s approach is totally scrapping Obamacare mandates and minimum coverage requirements that the Kentucky lawmaker says discourage younger, healthier Americans from purchasing individual plans. Instead, Paul favors dramatic changes in the system that would foster the sale of cheap, bare-bone health insurance policies.\n\nCurrently plans sold in the individual market under Obamacare must include 10 \u201cminimum essential benefits,\u201d such as doctors\u2019 services, inpatient and outpatient hospital care, prescription drug coverage, pregnancy and childbirth and mental health services. Paul would scrap all those requirements and allow people to purchase coverage keyed to their specific needs and income.\n\nComing this week: THE Obamacare replacement bill. Done drafting the bill & will be discussing on @CNN Sunday AM and all week next week! pic.twitter.com/ycpBNBknOl \u2014 Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) January 15, 2017\n\n\u201cSo one of the key reforms we do is we\u2019re going to legalize the sale of inexpensive insurance,\u201d Paul told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. \u201cThat means getting rid of the Obamacare mandate on what you can buy.\u201d\n\nThat approach would also have the effect of lowering the overall quality of health care in the country, but Paul didn\u2019t comment on that. Moreover, it would make it far more difficult for major insurers to offset the cost of providing coverage to older and sicker beneficiaries with substantial premium payments from younger Americans.\n\nRelated: 5 Key Pieces of a \u2018TrumpCare\u2019 Plan that Could Affect Your Health\n\nPaul said he will also press for authorization for small businesses to band together to form networks to purchase insurance at a relatively low cost. Paul, who worked for years as an eye surgeon, said, \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why someone with four employees shouldn\u2019t be able to join with hundreds and hundreds of other businesses that are small to become a large entity to get leverage to bring your prices down.\u201d\n\nHe said those negotiations with insurers could also be used to guarantee the availability of policies that \"can't cancel you and guarantees the issue of the insurance even if you get sick.\"\n\nPaul dodged the question of whether many of the 20 million Americans currently receiving coverage under Obamacare would lose their coverage under his approach. A key question is whether the Republican majority in Congress and the Trump administration will attempt to rescind expanded Medicaid that provides the vast majority of Obamacare coverage in 31 states and the District of Columbia. Nearly 400,000 Kentucky residents would stand to lose coverage if that were to happen.\n\nPaul appeared to favor eliminating expanded Medicaid, insisting that the federal government can\u2019t afford to finance the program indefinitely with the national debt fast approaching $20 trillion.\n\n\u201cMy point is that we should be honest about it,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIf Kentucky or Tennessee or Ohio wants to expand Medicaid and they say we have a lot of people struggling and we\u2019re willing to help them, that\u2019s fine. Probably we should then raise the taxes on everybody in Kentucky [and the other states] to pay for Medicaid,\u201d he added. \u201cInstead, we have this deceitfulness of President Obama saying it would be free.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump Promises to Repeal and Replace Obamacare Together, But Can It Be Done?\n\nPaul last week was one of the first on Capitol Hill to align himself with President-elect Donald Trump in insisting it would be a huge tactical mistake for the GOP to dismantle key elements of the Obamacare law before pulling together replacement legislation. He believes that garnering the support of rank-and-file Republicans would quell fears of chaos in the insurance market and the loss of coverage for millions of Americans.\n\nSome GOP leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Paul\u2019s fellow Kentuckian, argued that the Republican-controlled Congress should first approve a budget resolution repealing key elements of Obamacare, including its subsidies, taxes and mandates, before beginning the challenging task of adopting a replacement plan. McConnell said that Congress would follow up Obamacare repeal legislation with a replacement program \u201cvery quickly,\u201d but without setting a timetable.\n\nBut President-elect Donald Trump last Wednesday made it clear that action to repeal and replace had to occur at the same time \u2013 possibly on the same day or \u201cthe same hour\u201d \u2013 and Paul agrees.\n\n\u201cI believe that it\u2019s incredibly important that we do replacement on the same day as we do repeal,\u201d Paul told Tapper. \u201cWe\u2019ve had six years to complain [about Obamacare] and we have complained. I\u2019ve been one of those complaining about Obamacare. Replacement should be the same day.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Republicans Are Hitting the Brakes on Obamacare Repeal\n\nLate last week, the Senate and House voted to begin the legislative process that would culminate in final action \u2013 perhaps as early as next month -- to repeal Obamacare, but without addressing a possible replacement. Paul was the lone Republican in the Senate to vote against the resolution while nine Republicans in the House also opposed it.\n\nRyan and other GOP House leaders now say they agree with Trump that repeal and replace must be accomplished simultaneously, in order to keep their campaign pledge and reassure the public and the insurance industry. McConnell has been non-committal on the topic, in part because he will need Democratic support in order to adopt comprehensive replacement legislation.\n\nVice President-elect Mike Pence reaffirmed Trump\u2019s pledge to get both tasks accomplished in record time during an appearance on the \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d program.\n\n\u201cThe president-elect made it very clear to leaders in the Congress this week that he wanted to do both at the same time,\u201d Pence said. \u201cI would anticipate that in the first 100 days that we will deliver on that promise to the American people.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/01/16", "title": "I Have a Dream: The Full Text of Dr. Martin Luther King's Speech", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/16/I-Have-Dream-Full-Text-Dr-Martin-Luther-Kings-Speech", "text": "I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.\n\nFive score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity.\n\nBut one hundred years later, we must face the tragic fact that the Negro is still not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize an appalling condition.\n\nIn a sense we have come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men would be guaranteed the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nIt is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check which has come back marked \"insufficient funds.\" But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check -- a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice. We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to open the doors of opportunity to all of God's children. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.\n\nIt would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment and to underestimate the determination of the Negro. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.\n\nRELATED: FOR TOO FEW, DR. KING'S DREAM HAS BECOME REALITY\n\nBut there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred.\n\n\n\nWe must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force. The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny and their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.\n\nAnd as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, \"When will you be satisfied?\" We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.\n\nI am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.\n\nGo back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair.\n\nI say to you today, my friends, that in spite of the difficulties and frustrations of the moment, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.\n\nI have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.\"\n\nI have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at a table of brotherhood.\n\nI have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a desert state, sweltering with the heat of injustice and oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.\n\nI have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\n\nI have a dream today.\n\nI have a dream that one day the state of Alabama, whose governor's lips are presently dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, will be transformed into a situation where little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls and walk together as sisters and brothers.\n\nI have a dream today.\n\nI have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.\n\nThis is our hope. This is the faith with which I return to the South. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.\n\nThis will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with a new meaning, \"My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring.\"\n\nAnd if America is to be a great nation this must become true. So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania!\n\nLet freedom ring from the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado!\n\nLet freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California!\n\nBut not only that; let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia!\n\nLet freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee!\n\nLet freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi. From every mountainside, let freedom ring.\n\nAnd when this happens, when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, \"Free at last! free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!\""}, {"date": "2017/01/16", "title": "Blind Trust in Donald Trump Could Be Costly", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/01/16/Blind-Trust-Donald-Trump-Could-Be-Costly", "text": "Donald Trump has refused to divest himself of his business interests before being inaugurated as president and has instead said he would hand control over to his sons. However, as the director of the Office of Government Ethics, Walter Shaub, Jr., said in a letter last December, a point he reiterated after Trump announced his plan to turn control over to his sons last week, \u201cTransferring operational control of a company to one's children would not constitute the establishment of a qualified blind trust, nor would it eliminate conflicts of interest.\"\n\nIn response, Trump argues that his numerous conflicts of interest won\u2019t affect his decisions as president. But there have already been instances where meetings with foreign leaders had a clear connection to his business pursuits, his nominations for important government positions show a strong bias toward favoring business interests, and his proposed legislative agenda, while touted as a populist, contains the standard Republican pro-business slate of policies. The stage is set for those coming into power to use their government offices to enrich themselves, and if they do, it has the potential to undermine US competitiveness and reduce long-term economic growth.\n\nRelated: 4 Ways Trump\u2019s Conflicts of Interest Could Actually Hurt the US\n\nEconomists use the term \u201cprincipal-agent problem\u201d to describe one important way in which conflicts of interest can be harmful. The principal-agent problem describes a situation where the person who is making important decisions (e.g. a manager in business) is not the same as the person or people whose interests are being served (e.g. shareholders). If the manager pursues his or her own interests, for example taking what amount to lavish vacations and charging it to the company instead of maximizing profit on behalf of shareholders, then in effect money that should have gone to shareholders goes to the manager instead \u2013 it is taken from them.\n\nThere are many, many instances where principal-agent type conflicts of interest exist, parents making decisions for their children, elected officials representing the interests of constituents, investment fund managers operating on behalf of investors, and so on. Economists have spent considerable effort figuring out how to design institutions and contracts to minimize the chance that those with decision-making power promote their personal interests over the interests of those they represent (for example by making mangers\u2019 salaries depend upon the long-term profitability of the company), and the solutions economists have proposed for the conflict of interest problem can be effective in many cases.\n\nBut when it comes to politicians representing the interests of constituents, adjusting institutions to prevent unethical behavior is difficult if not impossible, and we cannot write contracts between politicians and constituents the way we can between, say, the managers and owners of firms. We have to rely upon politicians\u2019 honor in upholding their oath to represent their constituent\u2019s best interests and the checks and balances such as Senate confirmation for those they appoint to key government positions. In Trump\u2019s case, I have little faith that Congress will stand in the way when potential conflicts of interest arise for his nominees, and even less faith that his choices as president will be independent of his business interests.\n\nFor an individual business, the harm that conflicts of interest can cause goes beyond, for example, taking money out of shareholders pockets and giving it to managers. It also undermines the efficiency and competitiveness of the firm. The same is true for the nation as a whole. Just like managers taking from shareholders, politicians and government officials can manipulate taxes, the regulatory environment, the provision of government services, and so on to enrich themselves at the expense of others. But this is harmful to the economy.\n\nRelated: Why Trump\u2019s Conflicts of Interest Will Come Back to Bite Him \u2026 And Us\n\nPolicies such as removing regulations that address important market failures, favoring one business over another (picking winners and losers as Trump has already shown a tendency to do), and imposing tariffs on imported goods have the effect of insulating firms from the foreign and domestic competitive forces that compel them to innovate and operate efficiently, both of which are keys to maximizing long-run economic growth. To make matters worse, the political system itself can be manipulated by those in power to perpetuate their hold on government leading to even more looting of the economy, and even more long-run damage to our economic potential.\n\nThe Republicans are fond of calling low-income households \u201ctakers.\u201d But it\u2019s abundantly clear that the real takers are those who use their wealth, influence, and government positions to enrich themselves and their cronies at the expense of others without seeming to care how much damage it does to the economy, or how many people might be harmed by the large cuts to essential social services that will be needed to finance tax cuts for the wealthy.\n\nTrump is not president yet. So I can\u2019t say for sure if he will continue or even expand upon the recent Republican tradition of favoring the interests of the wealthy and powerful over the interests of the working class while disregarding long-standing government ethics and norms along the way.

Again, it's more than just about Mr. Trump, and it's about the United States of America.\u201d\n\nIn a few days, he said, Trump will be \u201cthe most powerful person in the world in terms of sitting on top of the United States government,\u201d adding, \u201cI think he has to recognize that his words do have impact.\u201d\n\nRelated: On Day One, Trump Faces Two Huge Foreign Policy Challenges\n\nAnd Brennan made it plain that he doesn\u2019t believe Trump has, at this point, fully grasped the nature of the challenge in front of him.

The president-elect spent months denigrating the Intelligence Community\u2019s finding that the Kremlin ordered the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and prominent individual Democrats in an effort to influence the US presidential election.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump finally admitted that he accepted the evidence that Russia had perpetrated the hack, though he and his team continue to downplay the impact of the steady stream of leaked documents that dominated coverage of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the final month of the campaign.\n\nBrennan, on Sunday, didn\u2019t seem convinced that Trump has truly absorbed the intelligence agencies\u2019 finding that Russian meddling in the election process was a major and unprecedented attack on US Democracy. He also sounded concerned about Trump\u2019s appreciation of Russia\u2019s new role on the world stage.\n\n\u201cI don't think he has a full appreciation of Russian capabilities, Russia's intentions, and actions that they are undertaking in many parts of the world,\u201d Brennan said.\n\nRelated: Trump Bites Back at Buzzfeed and the Media for Publishing Fake News\n\nThat will be part of the job facing US intelligence agencies in the coming months, he said, as Trump makes decisions about how to respond -- or not -- to the Kremlin\u2019s provocations. \u201cWhat we need to do is make sure that Mr. Trump and vice president-elect. Mr. Pence, understand exactly what it is that we know, what we have intelligence about, so that when they make those decisions, it will be -- they will be informed decisions.\n\nWallace asked if he is concerned that the incoming Trump administration might act quickly to remove economic sanctions that were put in place against Russia for its election attacking as well as its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI think he has to be mindful that he does not yet have a full appreciation and understanding of what the implications are of going down that road, as well as making sure he understands what he's doing,\u201d the CIA director said.\n\nWallace asked Brennan to address Trump\u2019s claim that intelligence agencies may have been responsible for leaking a dubious dossier of supposed compromising information on Trump, including reported video of the president-elect in engaging in potentially embarrassing sexual activity.

Four committees in the House and Senate now must report back to the Senate and House Budget Committees by Jan. 27 with specific language for eviscerating key provisions of the law, including taxes, premium subsidies and mandates.\n\nRelated: Congress Is Headed for a Showdown With Trump Over Obamacare Repeal\n\nThen the GOP leadership must sell the final package to their members in the House and the Senate before holding final votes in the two chambers. But that, in the greater scheme of things, will be the easy part, since special budget reconciliation rules being utilized by the GOP will require a simple majority vote in the two chambers to pass the resolution.\n\nThe heavy lifting will come when the leaders must craft and sell a legitimate and workable replacement program to Republican rank and file as well as some moderate Democrats, whose support will be critical in pushing through a replacement plan without the reconciliation protections. Without reconciliation, it will take at least 60 votes in the Senate to adopt new health care legislation. Right now, the Republicans hold a narrow 52 to 48 majority, which is not nearly enough to work their will.\n\nFor all the Republicans\u2019 brave talk about swiftly upending Obamacare and writing a replacement within days or weeks of Trump\u2019s ascension to power, major legislative and programmatic surgery of this sort is proving extraordinarily challenging. That is becoming especially true amid growing fears that the GOP\u2019s strong-arm tactics could foster chaos in the health insurance markets and ultimately strip millions of Americans of their coverage under Obamacare and expanded Medicaid.\n\nTrump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) this week said they would concurrently repeal and replace measures within the first 100 days (on the outside) of the Republican President-elect\u2019s administration. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has been far more cautious, saying that Congress must first repeal Obamacare and then turn its attention to a replacement approach.\n\nRelated: Trump Promises to Repeal and Replace Obamacare Together, But Can It Be Done?\n\n\u201cDefinitely there is a plan within the first 100 days to get moving on this legislation,\u201d Ryan said Thursday night during his appearance on a nationally televised CNN town hall meeting.\n\n\u201cI believe we can and should have a system in this country where everybody can have access to affordable health care, including people with pre-existing conditions, no matter how much money they make,\u201d Ryan said as he began what will likely be an uphill campaign to sell to lawmakers and their constituents. \u201cThat\u2019s not what the [Obamacare] law is doing. This law is failing on this front, and I think there\u2019s a much, much better system that could be put in its place.\u201d\n\nYet even as an overwhelming number of GOP lawmakers in the House lined up behind Ryan on Friday to approve the budget resolution to get the repeal process underway, many voiced uneasiness that their leaders and Trump may be biting off more than they can chew without a clear pathway to a new law. \u201cWe just want more specifics,\u201d Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), the chair of the arch-conservative Freedom Caucus, told The Washington Post yesterday. \u201cWe need to know what we\u2019re going to replace it with.\u201d\n\nNine Republicans broke with the leadership and voted against the budget resolution this afternoon, while the Democrats were united in opposing the measure.\n\nThe Democrats are accusing Ryan and others of leading Congress on a reckless mission to dismantle a system that has more benefits than flaws, and with no consensus within the GOP over precisely how to replace Obamacare.\n\nRelated: Why Republicans Are Hitting the Brakes on Obamacare Repeal\n\n\u201cWe recognize that there are ways it can be improved,\u201d said Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee. \u201cBut the idea that there is a plan competing on the other side is just hilarious.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the problem with the exercise we are going through,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are heading down a road with no final determination or destination. We\u2019re going to repeal the Affordable Care Act, eliminating all of the protections that we have provided for 300 million Americans \u2013 expanded coverage, expanded guarantees and benefits and quality, and we don\u2019t know what\u2019s the alternative.\u201d\n\n\u201cWaving around a bunch of papers does not mean there\u2019s a plan\u2014does not mean that the Republicans can say to the American public, \u2018Here is what your health care is going to look like when we get finished with our repeal and replace.\u2019 If we go down this path, we won\u2019t have repeal and replace. What we will have is repeal and repent.\u201d\n\nThe Republicans have spent the better part of six years attempting to upend the Affordable Care Act, but to this day they not developed an alternative that could gain the blessing of the vast majority of their members. Throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump floated a number of disparate proposals, including retaining some of the most popular features of Obamacare. Those include allowing children to remain on their parents\u2019 health insurance plans until age 26 and barring insurers from discriminating against applicants with pre-existing medical conditions.\n\nRelated: Repealing Obamacare Taxes Gives the Super Wealthy $7 Million More a Year\n\nRyan, meanwhile, tried to build interest in his \u201cGOP Better Way\u201d approach to health care reform last summer with a glossy document containing high concepts and a raft of proposals. However, a lot of the proposals were sketchy, and he offered no clues as to how many people would retain their health insurance coverage and how much the program would cost.\n\nRyan\u2019s approach is similar to one that Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), Trump\u2019s choice to be secretary of Health and Human Services, has been touting for years and that he converted into the Empowering Patients First Act. Price, an orthopedic surgeon, would start from scratch with a \u201cpatient-centered solution\u201d and greater reliance on market forces than government intervention.\n\nWhile there are numerous differences between the three approaches, all share at least five things in common that are likely to be retained when GOP leaders and health care experts turn their attention to the drawing board and produce a first draft of TrumpCare. Here are brief summaries:\n\nState operated \u201chigh-risk pools.\u201d Before the advent of Obamacare, older and sicker Americans who had trouble buying private insurance because of the prohibitive premium costs turned to states for assistance in purchasing more reasonably priced coverage in subsidized insurance pools. If Republicans repeal Obamacare, these older and sicker people likely will need help high-risk the states in finding relatively affordable coverage. Ryan and others are discussing providing states with at least $25 billion to help ease their financial burden. Some critics say the old system didn\u2019t work very well, and that many of the insurance plans were inadequate.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Could Push Rural Hospitals to the Brink\n\nRefundable tax credits for those without employer, Medicare or Medicaid coverage. Many conservatives have complained over the years that it is unfair that employer-paid premiums for health insurance are exempted from federal income taxes, while employees without coverage in the workplace must buy insurance themselves without the benefit of a tax write-off.\n\nRyan and Price are advocating a \u201crefundable\u201d tax credit that people of all income groups can use to buy coverage in the private markets. Premium payments could be directly written off individual\u2019s income tax obligations. Low-income people who pay little or no federal income tax would qualify for a tax refund to help cover their premium costs. However, some analysts say that Price\u2019s approach is far less generous than previous GOP proposals.\n\nFor one thing, there is no income test under Price\u2019s approach as there is under Obamacare. Instead, the credit is adjusted for age, with older Americans getting the lion\u2019s share of the benefit. The credit would provide $1,200 for someone 18 to 35 to purchase an annual policy, $2,100 for those 35 to 50, and $3,000 for those who are 50 and over. At a time of steadily mounting premiums and out-of-pocket costs, the Price approach would likely cover just a fraction of Americans\u2019 annual health insurance costs.\n\nHealth Savings Accounts. These tax-exempt accounts are a fixture in many workplaces, and the Republicans would provide incentives to employers and employees to expand their use. The idea is to encourage workers to sock away money for unexpected or uncovered medical expenses throughout the year. Employers and individuals would jointly make contributions to the accounts. There were $34.7 billion in roughly 18.2 million HSA accounts last year, according to Forbes. And if the Republicans have their way, there will be plenty more.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Dilemma: Can He Repeal Obamacare Without Killing Medicare?\n\nSelling health insurance across state lines. This idea is one of Trump\u2019s favorites, and he mentioned it frequently throughout the campaign. In effect, insurance companies could market their individual plans to consumers in any state as long as they are licensed in their home states and adhere to their home-state regulations.\n\nHowever, The Wall Street Journal has reported that Trump\u2019s interstate insurance marketing plan is meeting resistance from state insurance regulators, the health insurance industry and independent health care analysts who say the approach has been tried before on a limited basis and has many shortcomings.\n\nConverting Medicaid to a block grant program. The future of federally-funded Medicaid programs for the poor could be very much up in the air, like Trump, Ryan and Price all are pressing for major reforms and savings. The proposal would allow states to choose whether to continue to accept federal Medicaid funding as a per capita cap or to take it as a block grant \u2013 and then exercise control over how the money is spent.\n\nAlthough the fiscal impact of the change is far from clear, some analysts say that the federal funding would be far below current levels. And Republican governors and state legislatures would be likely to tighten regulations for qualifying for coverage."}, {"date": "2017/01/13", "title": "How Obamacare Repeal Could Hurt Retirees on Medicare", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/13/How-Obamacare-Repeal-Could-Hurt-Retirees-Medicare", "text": "Anyone nearing retirement - or already retired - should pay very close attention to the doings of the 115th Congress that was sworn in this week.\n\nRepeal of President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act (ACA) tops the agenda for Republicans, who will control the White House as well as both houses of Congress when Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. That will place a heavy financial toll on millions of older Americans who do not have access to employer-sponsored insurance or Medicaid, and who are too young to enroll in Medicare. But repeal of the ACA will also raise the cost of Medicare for current and future enrollees.\n\nRelated: Congress Is Headed for a Showdown With Trump Over Obamacare Repeal\n\nThe details surrounding the repeal of what became known as Obamacare - and how it will be replaced, if at all - are unknown. But it is clear that Republicans, rather than fix the existing system's problems, intend to gut the most important social insurance legislation since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965.\n\nAnd this is despite the fact that a strong majority of Americans actually like what the ACA has brought them. Last year, 77 percent of adults in marketplace plans, and 88 percent of those who received Medicaid coverage under the ACA expansion, were either very or somewhat satisfied with their coverage, according to polling by the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation focused on healthcare research.\n\nFor older Americans, ACA repeal will mean higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs. Most Republican proposals that have been circulated loosen or eliminate restrictions on higher policy prices for older buyers. The program's income-related tax subsidies, which aim to make premiums affordable for middle- and lower-income households, likely would be replaced by a flat tax credit that shifts costs to enrollees. Some repeal-and-replace plans also weaken the current ban on covering people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nACA AND RETIREMENT\n\nThe ACA, enacted in 2010, typically is not considered retirement-related legislation, but it has made a big difference for millions of workers in the critical years leading up to retirement.\n\nRelated: Trump Promises To Repeal and Replace Obamacare Together, But Can It Be Done?\n\nDespite the improving economy, many older Americans have never fully recovered from the Great Recession (reut.rs/2iIf86F). Before the ACA, it was near impossible for jobless older workers to find quality insurance in the individual insurance market. Insurers were permitted to charge much higher premiums for older customers than for young. Coverage of catastrophic health events, such as cancer or a stroke, was weak or absent entirely.\n\nIn 2013, before ACA coverage fully kicked in, 14 percent of workers aged 55-64 were uninsured. The percentage dropped to 9.1 in 2016, meaning there were 3.1 million previously uninsured people who now had health insurance. Adults in this age bracket have the lowest uninsured rates of any age group, Commonwealth reports. The foundation\u2019s research also finds that the ACA helps people bridge coverage gaps when they temporarily lose employer-based insurance.\n\n\u201cIf you think about what the world looked like prior to the ACA for people who had to retire early or didn\u2019t have an employer plan, really their only option was the individual insurance market,\u201d said Sara Collins, vice president of Commonwealth.\n\nRepeal of the ACA would also have a direct impact on Medicare spending and costs to beneficiaries.\n\nFull repeal would increase Medicare spending by $802 billion from 2016 through 2025, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), primarily by restoring higher payments to health providers and Medicare Advantage plans. That would lead to higher Part A (hospitalization) deductibles and copayments, and higher premiums and deductibles in Part B (outpatient services).\n\nRepeal also would worsen the long-range outlook for the Part A trust fund. Prior to the ACA, Medicare\u2019s trustees projected the fund would lack revenue to meet all its expenses starting this year; the law\u2019s cost savings and new taxes pushed that date back to 2028.\n\nMEDICARE REFORMS\n\nCongress may also take up conservative Medicare reform proposals that could hit the pocketbooks of future retirees.\n\nPremium support, an idea long advanced by House Speaker Paul Ryan, would replace today's defined set of promised Medicare benefits with an annual voucher that enrollees would use to buy health insurance in a market exchange. Competing plans could include traditional Medicare and plans offered by commercial insurance companies. The impact on premiums would depend on the specifics of whatever program might be enacted.\n\nMeanwhile, conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation has proposed raising the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to \"at least 68\" over a period of 10 years, and then indexing it to life expectancy. Unless they are still working, these folks would rely on whatever replaces the ACA for health insurance.\n\nIt all adds up to a period of frightening uncertainty about coverage and cost over the next few years for people close to retirement, and possible higher Medicare costs for those already in retirement.\n\nOne thing it does not sound like is a formula to make healthcare great again."}, {"date": "2017/01/13", "title": "Are Mass Deportations Coming in the US?

He also continues to hold out hope for compromise legislation that would provide legal status to many illegal immigrants, despite conservatives\u2019 complaints that that would be tantamount to amnesty.

The GAO reports that in 2016 the volume of improper payments -- that is, money that was paid out but should not have been, climbed to $144 billion from $137 billion the previous year. Historically, federal agencies have a terrible track record when it comes to recouping money that is paid out improperly, getting back pennies on the dollar.\n\nOther uncertainties that stood in the way of GAO signing off on the consolidated federal report had nothing to do with bookkeeping at individual agencies but were tied to broader uncertainties about the government\u2019s future obligations.

His stock holdings included Aetna Inc., Pfizer Inc, Amgen Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Eli Lilly & Co.\n\nOn Thursday, Price listed McKesson Corp as one of the 43 stocks he intends to sell as part of a major divestiture of his financial holdings and business interests. That move comes ahead of the Senate hearings into his nomination to lead the nation\u2019s premier health services and research agency -- hearings that likely will extend through mid-February because of the complexity of his case.\n\nRelated: 8 Big Changes Under Tom Price\u2019s Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nAccording to a list of Price\u2019s stock purchases and sales between 2008 and 2016 compiled by the public watchdog Public Citizen, the Georgia lawmaker invested as much as $15,000 in McKesson on March 17, 2016. Public Citizen early this month formally requested the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Office of Congressional Ethics to investigate suspicious stock trading by Price and Rep. Chris Collins (R-NY).\n\n\u201cExtensive stock trading activity in industries that Price and Collins oversee as congressmen, and unusually good timing and financial benefits of those stock trades, raise red flags about the potential use of insider information,\u201d Craig Holman, government affairs lobbyist for Public Citizen\u2019s Congress Watch division, said in a statement Jan. 5. \u201cThe public information available falls short of hard evidence of insider trading, but the patterns of trading activity certainly warrant further investigation to determine if it occurred.\u201d\n\nCongress and the Obama administration have attempted to come to grips with the problem of the questionable trading practices of lawmakers, with mixed results. In 2012, President Obama signed into law the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act that barred members from using \u201cany non-public information derived from the individuals\u2019 position \u2026 or gained from performance of individual duties for personal benefit.\u201d\n\nBut the measure was subsequently weakened under pressure from lawmakers and members of the executive branch.\n\nThe decision by Price to invest in a company like McKesson with such a checkered past is a curious one at best. A spokesperson in Price\u2019s congressional office didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on Thursday.

The new president remains a seat-of-the-pants man, as his Wednesday press conference at Trump Tower made plain. Tillerson, if his confirmation hearings are any guide, is more of a pragmatist than critics on the Democratic side seem to think.\n\nBut if Trump and Tillerson are smart enough to spot a couple of quick, astute moves open to them, they can establish a new policy framework that will make it a great deal easier to cope with the tangled web Obama and his State Department leave behind.\n\nNot coincidentally, the key strategies involve Russia and China.

It\u2019s obvious now that Trump faces a brutish battle with some elements of the national security apparatus and the Pentagon that oppose his preference for a neo-d\u00e9tente with Moscow. Trump should stick to his guns; better relations with Russia are the key to too many problems to count.\n\nRemember, Trump\u2019s opponents are the same people who scuttled Secretary of State Kerry\u2019s ceasefire efforts in Syria last year by refusing to work jointly with the Russian military. Now look: Russia, Turkey, and Iran have pushed through a new ceasefire while effectively pushing the U.S. out of the picture.\n\nKerry was startlingly blunt on this point when Charlie Rose interviewed him earlier this week. \u201cTalking to Russia,\u201d as the outgoing secretary put it, is essential to any solution in Syria.

Kim Jong-un\u2019s New Year\u2019s Day announcement that the North will shortly test its first intercontinental ballistic missile more or less forces Trump to choose among the three alternatives now on the table:\n\nTrump can tell the Chinese, \u201cEither you bring Pyongyang into line, or we go to war.\u201d But this alternative is flawed. Washington consistently over-estimates Beijing\u2019s leverage over the North and pushing an ultimatum of this kind risks serious damage to Sino\u2013U.S. ties. More grimly, Pyongyang is capable of destroying significant parts of Seoul in response to direct military intervention. Probability: Low to zero.\n\nTrump can do nothing. In view of Kim\u2019s claim to be testing an ICBM, this takes on a brand-new level of risk. Probability: Again, low to zero.\n\nRelated: China Just Gave Trump a 999-Foot-Long Middle Finger\n\nTrump can swallow hard and revive efforts to negotiate a treaty with Pyongyang.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), a major cheerleader for dismantling President Obama\u2019s signature health insurance program, insists the way to go is to repeal the program with a lengthy transition period and then come back with a full blown replacement down the road.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what Trump has in mind. Trump vowed during a press conference at Trump Tower on Wednesday to unveil proposals to repeal and then replace the Affordable Care Act literally within days or hours of each other by next month, after Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), his choice to head HHS, is confirmed by the Senate.\n\nIn the wee hours of Thursday morning, the Senate voted 51 to 48 to formally kick off the process of repealing Obamacare, with two Senate committees required to report back by Jan. 27 with specific language for gutting key provisions of the law, including taxes, premium subsidies and mandates on individuals and businesses. McConnell told reporters on Tuesday that his office will be working with Trump\u2019s new Department of Health and Human Services officials to \u201ccraft the way forward\u201d in replacing Obamacare \u2013 but that the \u201cfirst step towards replacement is to repeal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be essentially simultaneously,\u201d Trump told reporters in New York. \u201cIt will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably the same day, could be the same hour \u2026 And we\u2019re going to get a health bill passed. We\u2019re going to get health care taken care of in this country.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Republicans Are Hitting the Brakes on Obamacare Repeal\n\nMeanwhile, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) has gradually been inching towards Trump\u2019s position, telling reporters earlier this week that Congress would do repeal and replace \u201cconcurrently,\u201d rather than \u201csimultaneously,\u201d which would leave the lawmakers with a little more latitude in designing a comprehensive replacement. Ryan also said he was exploring options for including parts of a replacement plan in the budget reconciliation bill approved by the Senate and that awaits House action on Friday.\n\nIn a news conference on Capitol Hill today, the Speaker declared, \u201cI\u2019ve spoken with President-elect Trump probably two times in the last three days on this and [Vice President-elect] Mike Pence was in my office yesterday to discuss this, and we agree we want to make sure that we move these things concurrently, at the same time, repeal and replace.\u201d\n\nTiming is everything in politics, as the saying goes, and Congress and the incoming Trump administration may be on a collision course. If McConnell persuades lawmakers in both chambers to move full steam ahead on repealing Obamacare \u2013 with the understanding that a comprehensive GOP replacement would be dealt with later \u2013 Trump may be confronted with a repeal-now, replace-later bill on his desk in the Oval Office contrary to what he says he wants.\n\nRelated: 5 Big Promises Trump Won\u2019t Be Able to Keep\n\nThe notion of Trump vetoing a bill dealing with Obamacare seems unthinkable at this point, although the president-elect has shown no reluctance to call out or challenge congressional Republicans when he disagrees with them. However, with Trump bearing down on Ryan and McConnell to make good quickly on his campaign pledge to repeal and replace the \u201cdisastrous\u201d Obamacare program, the president-elect is more likely than not to get his way.\n\nThe idea once advanced by some veteran GOP lawmakers including Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the chair of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and Finance Committee Chair Orrin Hatch of Utah that it might take another year or two to fashion a replacement plan now seems out of the question.\n\nYet, Trump, Ryan and McConnell are kidding themselves if they think any permutation of repeal and replace legislation they dream up will have smooth sailing through Congress. That\u2019s especially true amid the growing unease among GOP lawmakers in both chambers about their party overplaying their hand, and in the process triggering a collapse of the health insurance market and stripping millions of Americans of their coverage in the coming year or two.\n\n\u201cCongressional Republicans are like the dog that finally caught the car,\u201d said William Galston, a political scholar at the Brookings Institution and one-time domestic policy adviser to President Bill Clinton. \u201cAnd the questions that they have tap-danced around for six years are now squarely on the front burner.\u201d\n\nRelated: Rand Paul Is Coming to the Rescue with an Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\n\u201cAcross party lines, health care experts are sending up rockets of alarm about this destabilization of the entire health care markets that could occur if there is a significant interval between the repeal and the replace,\u201d he added today. \u201cI think that President-elect Trump has much better political instincts than Mitch McConnell does. I think it\u2019s increasingly clear that the momentum has shifted in favor of a much smaller gap between repeal and replace.\u201d\n\nJoseph Antos, a health care expert with the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said yesterday that Trump\u2019s timetable for simultaneous action \u201cseems impossible to me,\u201d and that developing a complex replacement plan could take many months if the new president is serious about changing the law. Because Republicans are using special budget reconciliation rules to repeal Obamacare, McConnell needs to muster a simple majority of 51 votes to ram through repeal legislation.\n\nMcConnell was able just to muster 51 votes on Thursday to pass the preliminary budget action after Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) sided with the Democrats in trying to stop the measure.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Could Push Rural Hospitals to the Brink\n\nHowever, those rules won\u2019t apply when Congress must do the much more challenging task of drafting sweeping replacement legislation, which must be approved in the Senate by a 60-vote supermajority. When the time comes for that, McConnell will have to seek out a handful of moderate Democrats to push the replacement legislation through. That won\u2019t be easy because Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York is unwilling to bail out the Republicans unless they agree to delay repeal while the two sides hash out a bipartisan compromise.\n\n\u201cIt is more than possible for Trump and the Republicans to have a decent outline of the major themes of a replacement, but the idea of having a bill that is ready to go is out of the question,\u201d Antos said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s not just because of the complexity but because of the need for negotiations with Republicans first and then ultimately there will have to be negotiations with Democrats.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd all of those negotiations end up changing something or other,\u201d he added."}, {"date": "2017/01/12", "title": "3 Questions the Senate Needs to Ask Treasury Nominee Steve Mnuchin", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/12/3-Questions-Senate-Needs-Ask-Treasury-Nominee-Steve-Mnuchin", "text": "Steven Mnuchin, the former Goldman Sachs banker, Wall Street investor and Hollywood financier who has been nominated for Treasury Secretary by president-elect Donald Trump, says he will divest sizeable holdings if confirmed.\n\nOn its face, that seems like a selfless and patriotic act.

The law that Trump relies on for the claim that presidents \u201ccan\u2019t have\u201d conflicts of interest was passed for a narrow purpose, Schaub explained.\n\nWhile the law demands that executive branch nominees recuse themselves from dealing with matters that could affect them personally, \u201cCongress understood that a president can\u2019t recuse without depriving the American people of the services of their leader. That\u2019s the reason why the law doesn\u2019t apply to the president.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, he said, \u201cCommon sense dictates that a president can, of course, have very real conflicts of interest.\u201d And while Schaub admitted that divestiture would be expensive for Trump, he argued, \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that the president is now entering the world of public service. He\u2019s going to be asking his own appointees to make sacrifices. He\u2019s going to be asking our men and women in uniform to risk their lives in conflicts around the world.

Allegations of pay-to-play policies.\n\nTrump has promised to donate all of his profits from money spent by foreign governments at his properties to the U.S. Treasury for the duration of his presidency. Without addressing the bookkeeping nightmare of such a plan, it still doesn\u2019t address concerns that foreign governments -- not to mention domestic and foreign businesses, special interests groups and pretty much anybody with business before the federal government -- will either feel compelled to patronize Trump\u2019s properties or will do so willingly in an effort to curry favor with the Trump administration. It also doesn\u2019t address the value of the prestige that would accrue to the Trump Organization in general if it becomes the brand of choice for international diplomats.\n\nThe end result could be decisions made by the Trump administration that favor Trump\u2019s customers rather than American national interests.\n\n2. Questions of regulatory favoritism.\n\nThe Trump Organization will continue to profit from multiple properties and licensing agreements in the United States, all of which fall under the oversight of elements of the executive branch to some degree. That means that any federal workers dealing with a Trump property -- from an Internal Revenue Agency auditor to a workplace safety inspector -- will know that the decision they make could ultimately affect the personal bottom line of their ultimate boss. The problem extends to state government as well. It\u2019s not hard to imagine a governor angling for a large federal grant leaning on state regulatory agencies to go easy on the president\u2019s businesses.\n\nThe end result could be decisions made by federal regulators that favor Trump\u2019s businesses rather than American national interests.\n\n3. Law enforcement favoritism.\n\nThe number of times Trump and his businesses have been sued by angry creditors, customers, employees and others is legendary. Some of those lawsuits, like the highly publicized Trump University suit, were heard in federal court. And in the distant past, the Department of Justice brought cases directly against Trump\u2019s company. In an era where federal prosecutors all owe their jobs to the Trump White House, critics could justifiably wonder if any subsequent violations would be treated with the same level of seriousness and impartiality.\n\nThe end result could be decisions made by law enforcement and the courts that favor Trump\u2019s businesses rather than American national interests.\n\n4. Security costs.\n\nAs more than a few people have noticed, Trump tends to put his name on everything, and buildings in dozens of cities and multiple countries around the world currently boast the Trump name and logo. From Trump Tower on down, every one of these facilities could be seen as a potential target for terrorists looking to damage the United States in general and Trump in particular. It\u2019s unclear what Trump\u2019s status as president will mean for their security, but the U.S. taxpayer is already footing the bill for heightened security at Trump Tower in Manhattan. To the extent that this and some of his other commercial properties also require additional protection, critics will be able to ask whether the Trump Organization is receiving a federal benefit because of Trump\u2019s status as president.\n\nThe end result could be higher security costs paid by American taxpayers to protect the Trump Organization\u2019s business interests.\n\nRelated: Is Trump Too Impulsive to Be President? 58% of Americans Think So\n\nEthics experts appear to be holding out vain hope that something will change in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201c[T]here\u2019s still time to ... come up with something that will resolve his conflicts of interest,\u201d Schaub said Wednesday. \u201cIn developing the current plan, the President-elect did not have the benefit of OGE\u2019s guidance.

These factors include U.S. shale production, political stability returning to Libya and Nigeria, the amount of oil sitting in storage and rising role of renewable energy.\n\nU.S. shale producers were a leading factor in the 2014 oil crash because of how much oil they brought to domestic and international markets. Since then they have shed billions in unproductive assets and have lowered break-even costs, which means they can quickly start to replace supply that OPEC is attempting to cut. OPEC could be taking a huge risk betting against shale producers.\n\nRelated: As OPEC cuts, traders send European oil volumes to Asia\n\nNo one is as technologically experienced or has such large shale finds ready to be exploited like the U.S. OPEC will need 100% member compliance to ensure shale doesn\u2019t keep oil prices lower than is currently being assumed.\n\nThere are approximately 30 oil-producing U.S states, and with a more energy-friendly incoming administration, pipelines such as the Keystone XL and Dakota Access are likely to be approved, leading to increased heavy oil flows from Canada and the Bakken. Has this potentially significant new amount of oil been factored into the production cuts causing prices to rise? It doesn\u2019t seem it has.\n\nLibya is ramping up oil exports after political reconciliations facilitated by the United Nations, and they are exempt from OPEC cuts. In the near-term, Libya could put 700,000 to 900,000 barrels per day on to the market. However, the Libyan government believes they can ramp up production to 1.1 million bpd by the end of 2017, which is a significant amount unaccounted for during this current trading uptick.\n\nThere are still challenges in Libya between the Petroleum Facilities Guard and the Libyan National Army, but even if these tensions endure, significant amounts of oil will be shipped to an already oversupplied European market.\n\nRelated: Oil rises by most in over a month on weak dollar after Trump conference\n\nAnother complicating factor is Nigeria which has been trying to reach some kind of settlement with militants which have been bombing its oil facilities while trying to woo oil majors to raise investment and production. All of their internal problems aside, the African nation still produces around 1.6 million bpd with near-term goal according to President Buhari to reach 2.2 million bpd.\n\nAnother indicator that could put a damper on rising oil prices is the amount of crude currently sitting in storage. The U.S. has roughly 500 million barrels in storage, OECD nations have another 375 million barrels, and China has over 400 million barrels in storage while attempting to expand its reserves to 500 million barrels. At some point investors and the market have to account for this inventory.\n\nThe storage issue is further complicated by Supertankers used for storage. These massive vessels that are now parked from Singapore to Europe are under no obligation to report accurate supplies as well. They can be tracked by satellite and reporting done at docks and ports, but this makes for cryptic and volatile markets. For an investor or interested parties in the OPEC production cuts it should be understood how fast can this crude be sold on the market and how much it could affect prices.\n\nCheating on the production cut quotes by the likes of Iran, Iraq and potentially Saudi Arabia are other influences not being put into consideration by anyone who has a vested interest in oil reaching the $60-70 dollar per barrel range. If OPEC members fail to live up to production quotas, prices might fall much faster than anticipated as supply will continue to outpace demand.\n\nWith the Chinese economy now emphasizing stability over growth, and uncertainty about the growth prospects of the European economy, these large economies are reducing demand growth and this doesn\u2019t bode well for oil prices rising in 2017.\n\nAbovementioned are some of the issues that can cause oil to plateau before even reaching $60 a barrel. Every energy investor and interested party in fossil fuel\u2019s stability wants to see job growth and geopolitical steadiness. Particularly, countries that depend heavily upon higher oil prices to fund their government budgets. Failing to understand the factors that can stall this rally could bring back a 2014 scenario that saw investors, companies and governments lose hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nThis article originally appeared on OilPrice.com.

Those taxes \u2013 which have long been criticized by Republican lawmakers and special interest groups \u2013 potentially could be wiped away if the Republican-controlled Congress moves ahead with plans to repeal Obamacare in the coming month or two, without a clear replacement plan.\n\nThe study released on Thursday focused on two Obamacare taxes that target the wealthiest households in the country but have virtually no effect on middle and lower-income Americans. One is a 0.9 percent federal Hospital Insurance tax increase on individuals with incomes above $200,000 and couples with incomes above $250,000. The other is a 3.8 percent Medicare tax on \u201cunearned income\u201d that wealthy Americans derive from capital gains, dividends and royalties.\n\nThe top 400 highest-income taxpayers -- with average annual incomes of more than $300 million each -- would receive an estimated average annual tax cut of $7 million as part of the repeal, according to the study of Internal Revenue Service data.That would result in a $2.8 billion a year loss in tax revenue to the Treasury.\n\nRoughly 160 million households with incomes below $200,000 would get nothing from the repeal of these two taxes, according to the report.\n\nRelated: Why Republicans Are Hitting the Brakes on Obamacare Repeal\n\nMeanwhile, the repeal of Obamacare would effectively raise taxes on about seven million low-and-moderate income families that currently qualify for health insurance premium tax credits under the federal tax code. Those credits, which can be used to purchase private health insurance policies through government-run marketplaces, will be worth on average $4,800 this year.\n\n\u201cThe $2.8 billion a year total tax cut for the top 400 . . . is roughly the value of premium tax credits that 813,000 people in the 20 smallest states and Washington, D.C. would lose combined if the ACA is repealed without a replacement,\u201d the study notes.\n\nBefore the advent of the 2010 health reform law, Medicare taxes applied only to wage and salary and self-employment income, and not to unearned income from wealth, according to the study. That meant that low and moderate income families with little if any unearned income felt the brunt of the tax on practically all of their income, while the wealthiest taxpayers owed no Medicare taxes on their hefty dividends and capital gains -- which frequently accounted for a significant share of their total income.\n\n\u201cRepealing the two ACA Medicare taxes, particularly the 3.8 percent tax on investment and other unearned income, delivers tax cuts that are extremely tilted to the top,\u201d the report states. \u201cIn fact, the 0.4 percent of households with income of over $1million a year would reap 80 percent of the benefits of repealing these two provisions in 2017.\n\nRelated: 8 Big Changes Under Tom Price\u2019s Obamacare Replacement\n\n\n\nSimilarly, the Urban Institute last December published an analysis of the effects of Obamacare repeal suggesting that doing away with the law would be a de facto tax cut in and of itself, with the benefits disproportionately going to the wealthy and very wealthy.\n\n\u201cRepealing the Affordable Care Act would cut taxes significantly for the highest income one percent of US households,\u201d wrote Howard Gleckman of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center in Washington. \u201cAt the same time, it would raise taxes on average for low- and moderate-income households.\u201d\n\nThe reports are speculative in part because there is no way of knowing at this point the fate of these tax increases which have been vital in operating the Obamacare program and providing subsidies to many of the 20 million people who take part in the program.\n\nAs The Fiscal Times has reported, it is now dawning on GOP leaders that repealing the dozen or so major Obamacare tax increases along with the premium subsidies for low and middle-income Americans would seriously crimp their effort to devise and finance a substitute health insurance program down the road."}, {"date": "2017/01/12", "title": "Trump Bites Back at Buzzfeed and the Media for Publishing Fake News", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/01/12/Trump-Bites-Back-Buzzfeed-and-Media-Publishing-Fake-News", "text": "Be careful when you fight monsters, philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche warned, lest you become one.

Craig Silverman claimed that the top twenty \u201cfake news\u201d items got more social-media access than the top twenty \u201creal news\u201d items, even while offering no evidence of the correlation between Facebook clicks and voting behavior, let alone causation.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Needs to Hold Countries That Hack and Steal Accountable\n\nThe hypothesis took an even bigger hit from the Washington Examiner\u2019s Tim Carney, who pointed out that the top five in the \u201creal news\u201d category consisted of four liberal opinion pieces and a New York Post story on Melania Trump\u2019s nude modeling in the 1990s.\n\nNevertheless, the mainstream media has continued to hyperventilate about \u201cfake news\u201d even in the absence of any evidence of its impact. Media outlets like The New York Times and the Associated Press have run news articles exposing false stories as part of their pushback on the phenomenon; the latter runs a post-script on those stories as \u201cpart of an ongoing AP effort to fact-check claims in suspected false news stories.\u201d Barack Obama even indirectly referenced it in his farewell speech on Tuesday evening, warning that engaging \u201cwithout some common baseline of facts\u201d was a threat to democracy, following up on other warnings Obama has issued about \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nAt nearly the same time as Obama delivered that speech, Buzzfeed published a dossier on Donald Trump that it reported had been \u201ccirculating among elected officials, intelligence agents, and journalists for weeks.\u201d The memos alleged that Trump\u2019s campaign officials had met with Russian government officials to coordinate efforts, and that Russia had highly damaging personal and financial information on Trump, including a predilection for sexually deviant behavior. It provided more context for a CNN report hours earlier that said US intelligence officials had briefed Trump and Obama on the Russian blackmail threat as well as the alleged contacts between Team Trump and the Russian government.\n\nRelated: Release of Salacious \u2018Russian\u2019 Report Further Poisons Trump-Media Relationship\n\nHours later, both stories fell apart. As it turned out, this dossier had floated around media circles for months without anyone biting on it or being able to corroborate it. One key part that alleged contacts between Trump attorney Michael Cohen and Russian agents fell apart almost immediately on publication, as Cohen provided clear evidence that he\u2019d never been in Prague \u201cin his life,\u201d let alone at the time the dossier declared, and that he\u2019d actually been at the University of Southern California with his son that entire week.\n\nTom Brokaw said the next morning that NBC had been unable to verify any of its claims and had decided to drop it after weeks of interest. By late morning, just before Trump held his first press conference as president-elect, NBC News reported that the two-page annex that summarized the documents was intended as a lesson on disinformation, not an assessment of legitimate intelligence.\n\nIn fact, the intelligence briefers had decided not to include that in their presentation anyway. Had they done so, NBC reported, it would have been used to \u201cprovide context, should they need it, to draw the distinction for Trump between analyzed intelligence and unvetted \u2018disinformation.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat certainly put an even more ironic twist on a report from the tip of the spear on \u201cfake news.\u201d Buzzfeed had acknowledged that the report had some obvious errors in it and that it had done nothing to verify its contents \u2013 and yet published it anyway.\n\nRelated: Is Trump Too Impulsive to Be President? 58% of Americans Think So\n\nIts editor in chief, Ben Smith, e-mailed staff to explain that he \u201cerred on the side of publishing\u201d because the memos were \u201cin wide circulation at the highest levels of American government and the media.\u201d The context of that circulation seems to have eluded Smith, however; other media outlets didn\u2019t publish it because it was impossible to verify, and intelligence agencies had it but considered it \u201cdisinformation\u201d \u2013 which Buzzfeed then made public, doing the damage that intel agencies had wanted to warn against. And almost immediately, the other major media outlets reported on Buzzfeed\u2019s report, exponentially adding to the damage.\n\nWhat gives this \u201cfake news\u201d yet another level of irony is the fact that some of it had been published in the past. David Corn had covered the outlines of the dossier at the far-Left magazine Mother Jones in October without delving too far into the details. Some of the more lurid information from the dossier had been picked up by 4chan in the same time frame, one of the more notorious sources for supposed \u201cfake news.\u201d The allegations didn\u2019t attract much attention at the time despite their lurid and sensational qualities.\n\nThe fever swamps and ideologically driven media didn\u2019t fan this into a flame \u2013 it took the mainstream media to do that, and specifically the outlet that first created a nonsensical hysteria about ideologically driven \u201cfake news.\u201d This is almost certainly why other media outlets \u2013 especially CNN, whose own story got eclipsed and then damaged \u2013 have turned on Buzzfeed and its decision to publish a document whose veracity they barely attempted to validate, other than its existence.\n\nRelated: A New Risk for US Businesses: Being Called Out by Trump\n\nThis episode undermines their credibility on \u201cfake news,\u201d and, perhaps more importantly, their overall credibility on fairness and objectivity when it comes to covering a Republican administration.\n\nThat essentially inoculates Trump from investigative reporting that relies on anonymous sourcing and leaked documents. The public already has deep suspicions about the motives of national media outlets when it comes to Republican political figures, and this example of \u201cfake news\u201d will validate their skepticism.\n\nThat\u2019s not just a crisis for the media, but a potential problem for transparency in governance over the next four years.

He insisted that GOP congressional leaders will have to pick up the pace to demonstrate to Americans that this is a seamless way to achieve the long-promised goal.\n\nDuring his first major news conference since last summer, Trump said that within days of the Senate confirming Rep.

Democrats hope to slow the process a little tonight by offering scores of \u201cpoison pill\u201d amendments in a marathon \u201cvote-a-rama.\u201d The House will follow suit on Friday with a floor vote to get the ball rolling, and the same deadline for committees to report back with details of the repeal.\n\nRelated: 5 Big Promises Trump Won\u2019t Be Able to Keep\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has pledged to bring up the replacement legislation as \u201cquickly\u201d as possible, and Ryan insists that \u201cour goal is to bring it all together concurrently. But that sounds more like wishful thinking than an iron-clad strategy to accommodate an impatient incoming Republican president.\n\nVirtually anyone who knows anything about the way Congress operates understands that replacement legislation of that magnitude takes many months, if not years, to assemble and enact. Even if McConnell and Ryan (R-WI) manage to ram through a budget resolution repealing Obamacare on an expedited basis, drafting replacement legislation that meets the approval of Republican and Democratic rank and file members, insurers and other special interests and the more than 20 million Americans currently covered by Obamacare will be a herculean effort.\n\nIt took President Obama and his Democratic allies nearly two years to negotiate the terms of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cEven the repeal part isn\u2019t very easy because you have to think yourself through what provisions you really want to keep and what you can afford to change,\u201d said Joseph Antos, a health care expert with the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. \u201cBut replace is so much more complicated. There are layers and layers of policy decisions that have to be made, and they interact with each other.\u201d\n\nRelated: Rand Paul Is Coming to the Rescue with an Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\n\u201cOn any given topic, there might appear to be a policy change you want to make, but you have to think yourself through what does that mean for essentially everything else.\u201d\n\nAlthough it all seemed so simple for the Republicans coming off their startling Nov. 8 presidential and congressional election victories, the party since then has been splintering over whether to forge ahead with repealing Obamacare \u2013 and possibly stripping millions of Americans of their Obamacare and expanded Medicaid coverage \u2013 or move more cautiously. A growing chorus of interests, including the insurance industry, pharmaceutical companies, hospitals and other health facilities and Republican governors are warning of a dire situation if Congress moves ahead with repeal legislation without any idea of how to replace it.\n\nFive Senate Republicans led by Foreign Relations Committee Chair Bob Corker of Tennessee are urging that the leadership wait until March to vote on repealing key aspects of the Affordable Care Act, while a handful of conservative Republicans in the House are also cautioning their party to slow down.\n\nSen. Alexander told reporters he only favors repealing Obamacare once \"there are concrete, practicable reforms in place.\" \"It's not about developing a quick fix,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's about working toward a long-term recovery that works for everyone.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Could Push Rural Hospitals to the Brink\n\nDuring his meeting with reporters today, Trump renewed his assault on Obamacare, dismissing it as a \u201cdisaster\u201d with astronomical premium and copayment costs that must be dismantled. \u201cThe deductibles that are so high that after people go broke paying their premiums which are going through the roof, healthcare can\u2019t even be used by them because the deductibles are so high.\u201d\n\nTrump said it would be easy for the Republicans to sit back for another year or two and watch Obamacare continue to implode rather than stepping in to ease the burden of average Americans facing soaring premium costs. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to own it politically,\u201d he said of the controversial program. \u201cThey [the Democrats] own it right now. So the easiest thing would be to let it implode in \u201917, and believe me, we would get pretty much everything we wanted, but it would take a long time.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/01/11", "title": "Trump Just Failed His First Ethics Test as President", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/11/Trump-Just-Failed-His-First-Ethics-Test-President", "text": "After months of delay, President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday presented his plan to distance himself from his company during his time in the White House. Under the proposal, laid out by an attorney during a press conference with the incoming president, Trump would retain ownership of his company -- including hotels, golf courses, commercial real estate and various branding arrangements -- but would relinquish all management responsibilities.\n\nHe also proposed to donate any profits from his hotels derived from foreign governments directly to the U.S. Treasury in a move meant to silence critics who claim that accepting such payments would be a violation of the emoluments clause of the Constitution.\n\nRelated: Release of Salacious \u2018Russian\u2019 Report Further Poisons Trump-Media Relationship\n\nTrump\u2019s press conference came at a contentious moment, after the website BuzzFeed published an unverified dossier suggesting that the Russian government has compromising information about the president-elect, including evidence of illicit financial entanglements and potentially embarrassing sexual activity.\n\nThe publication of the report -- which, again, could not be verified -- plainly enraged Trump and his advisers. During the press conference Trump repeated his claim, aired on Twitter Wednesday morning, that he has no deals, loans or other financial interests in Russia.\n\nWhen he was asked if he would release his tax returns to offer support for that claim, he declined, saying as he has for well over a year now that he cannot because they are under audit. (As many critics have pointed out, there is no law or other requirement that officially prevents a person under audit from releasing his or her returns.)\n\n\u201cThe only one that cares about my tax returns is reporters,\u201d he said, shortly before turning the event over to attorney Sheri Dillon, a partner with the law firm Morgan Lewis in Washington.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Needs to Hold Countries That Hack and Steal Accountable\n\nDillon said that at Trump\u2019s instruction, she and her colleagues had worked out a plan to \u201ccompletely isolate him from the management of the company\u201d and to \u201cbuild in protections that will assure the American people the decisions he makes and the actions he takes as president are for their benefit and not to support his financial interests.\u201d\n\nAll of Trump\u2019s investments and business assets will be signed over to a trust by the time he takes office, Dillon said, and he will give up \u201cleadership and management of the Trump Organization\u201d to his adult sons and a senior company executive. His daughter, Ivanka, will also shed all management responsibilities.\n\nTrump will retain sharply limited information rights to his companies, which Dillon described as periodic reports on the profit and loss statement of the consolidated Trump Organization, and not information on individual holdings and business lines.\n\nThe company will also add an \u201cethics adviser\u201d to its management team, who will be required to approve any new deals made by the company are \u201cbeyond reproach and cannot be viewed to be exploitive.\u201d\n\nRelated: How China Can Fight Trump's Trade Policies\n\nShe said that the organization will not do any foreign deals while Trump is in office, but will pursue domestic opportunities. That would appear to violate a promise trump made in December, when he said \u201cno new deals\u201d would be made while he is president.\n\nThe trust Trump is establishing will hold liquid assets like cash and cash equivalents, Treasury securities and possibly mutual fund holdings. It will also hold what Dillon described as \u201cpre-existing, illiquid and very valuable business assets.\u201d That includes golf resorts, hotels, rights to royalties, etc.\n\nDillon said that after his election, Trump ordered the termination of 30 pending deals, which caused an immediate loss of millions of dollars.\n\nEthics experts have argued that the only way to truly remove conflicts of interest in Trump\u2019s case would be total divestiture of his assets. However, Dillon argued, selling everything would be both impractical and rife with its own conflicts. For example, selling the business would immediately create questions about whether the price paid was fair.\n\nRelated: Is Trump Too Impulsive to Be President? 58% of Americans Think So\n\nFurther, selling the companies while retaining royalty rights to the Trump name would mean Trump retained an interest in the brands, but no ability to prevent it from being used to exploit his position. Stripping the Trump name from the company, she said, would vastly diminish its value, leading to a \u201cfire sale.\u201d\n\nDillon pushed back hard against claims that Trump will violate the emoluments clause if he profits from payments that foreign governments make to his hotels. She insisted that the clause does not apply to fair value exchanges.\n\n\u201cPaying for your hotel is a value-for-value exchange\u201d and \u201cis not an emolument.\u201d she said. That is a position that many ethics experts hotly dispute, but Dillon said Trump will try to make the question moot with his promise to redirect money from foreign governments to the Treasury.\n\nHe will, she said, \u201cvoluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments to his hotels to the U.S. Treasury. This way, it is the American people who will profit.\u201d\n\nRelated: Five Moves That Can Help Trump Win Big on Day One\n\nGovernment ethics experts were extremely critical of Trump\u2019s plan, insisting that nothing short of total divestment would truly eliminate conflicts of interest.\n\n\u201cToday was his first test as president. He failed,\u201d said Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not worried about conflicts of interest because the statutes don\u2019t apply to the president. If that sounds familiar, it was the position Nixon took when he told David Frost \u2018when the president does it, that means it is not illegal.\u2019 Just because it\u2019s not illegal, does not mean it is right or moral.\u201d\n\nAll of Trump\u2019s decisions as president, Bookbinder said, \u201cwill be followed by the specter of doubt, and will be questioned as to whether his decision is in the best interest of the American people or the best interest of his bottom line.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s proposals today make decent sound bites, but, in reality, fall short of meaningfully solving the problem,\u201d said Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight. \u201cRetaining ownership and allowing his children to operate the family business is a page out of the Corruption 101 Handbook.\u201d\n\nThe plan, Brian said, \u201cwill likely embroil Trump in controversy and litigation.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/01/11", "title": "US Army Wants a New Weapon: Mini-Drones Made by 3-D Printers", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/11/US-Army-Wants-New-Weapon-Mini-Drones-Made-3-D-Printers", "text": "Imagine a squad of Army Rangers prepping to capture a high-value subject barricaded inside a three-story building.

Theft pays.\n\nIntellectual property is stolen when American corporate employees are thrown in prison or harassed in a government shake-down, or when American companies are hauled into foreign courts and accused of stealing their own patents. Sometimes American Internet companies are kicked out a country that fosters its own imitative companies to displace the American ones. In other places, pharmaceuticals are manufactured without license. And by now everyone knows about foreign hackers invading American websites.\n\nRelated: It Looks Like Trump Is Serious About Starting a Trade War With China\n\nAmerican businesses have grown inured to intellectual property theft. They expect theft in countries around the world and they cannot fight back because they risk being banned from lucrative markets. The combination of theft and no enforcement reinforce one another, and our government needs to respond.\n\nIt is not just American businesses that lose, it is also American creators. Millions of Americans create and promote intellectual property. When foreigners copy CDs and sell these pirated copies on the streets, our creators are worse off.\n\nAlthough USTR publishes reports every year identifying American intellectual property theft, it usually does nothing to prevent such theft or punish countries that foster intellectual property theft.\n\nAmerica continues to provide full access to American markets for offending countries. Pirate countries have little if any incentive to respect our property. The wonder is not that some countries steal our intellectual property; the wonder is that all countries do not steal our intellectual property given the weakness of our response.\n\nCountries may tell us that it is impossible for them to prevent their citizens from copying our goods.

The clear and present danger, he said, is for Americans to succumb to xenophobic fears, racial and religious prejudices and poisoned rhetoric.\n\n\u201cDemocracy can buckle when we give into fear,\u201d Obama said. So while the nation must remain vigilant, he added, \u201cWe must guard against a weakening of the values that make us who were are.\u201d\n\nThe speech was less of a State of the Union-style recitation of his accomplishments than a summoning of the spirit of a badly demoralized Democratic Party. The Democrats suffered one of their worst drubbings in the Nov. 8 election, essentially solidifying Republicans\u2019 control of the Senate and House while losing the presidency.\n\nDespite his numerous setbacks on the domestic and foreign front \u2013 with many of his environmental and regulatory initiatives tied up in court and his strategy for dealing with the civil war in Syria and the Middle Eastern hot spots in shambles \u2013 Obama couldn\u2019t resist recalling some of the victories, especially his success in pulling the country out of the worst financial crisis and recession in modern history.\n\nRelated: 5 Big Promises Trump Won\u2019t Be Able to Keep\n\n\u201cIf I had told you eight years ago that America would reverse a great recession, reboot our auto industry and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history ...

More than six years after Obama and the Democrats enacted the program without a single GOP vote in the House or Senate, the program remains highly controversial with the public at large.\n\nPolls have consistently shown that a majority of Americans don\u2019t approve of the legislation, although most would prefer to see the program fixed instead of repealed. While the program was highly ambitious and addressed a real need for millions of families that have struggled without coverage for years, Obamacare suffered a disastrous, glitch-filled on-line launch four years ago. One problem was that the plan didn\u2019t match its promises -- including Obama\u2019s pledge that beneficiaries could keep their doctors, there would be plenty of insurance options and that premiums and copayments would be highly affordable.\n\nEven while millions of people subsequently benefitted from the subsidized private health insurance plans sold on government-run markets or expanded Medicaid coverage in 31 states and the District of Columbia, the coverage turned out to be a lot more costly in many areas of the country, nearly two dozen experimental insurance co-ops went out of business and major insurers including Aetna, UnitedHealthcare and Blue Cross-Blue Shield pulled out of the program following losses of tens of millions of dollars.\n\nRelated: Most Americans Don\u2019t Want to Repeal Obamacare: Here\u2019s What They Want Instead\n\nFrom the very start, Republicans \u2013 goaded on by McConnell and former House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio \u2013 denounced Obamacare and staged a series of more than 50 votes over the years to try to repeal the legislation. Rather than seeking to work with the Democrats to fix some of the more glaring problems with the program, they demanded to eviscerate Obamacare and replace it with a less ambitious, more market-oriented program.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s take-no-prisoners approach to health care, in which he kept the Republicans united in opposition to Obamacare and sought to thwart the rest of the president\u2019s agenda, proved to be a fateful pivot that impacted Obama\u2019s administration and the Democrats\u2019 political fortunes for the remainder of his time in office.\n\nOr as Mike DeBonis of The Washington Post wrote Wednesday, it was the point at which \u201cthe audacity of hope gave way to the reality and frustrations of divided government.\u201d Obama would subsequently sign one more major piece of legislation \u2013 the Dodd-Frank financial reform law \u2013 and a fiscal stimulus to try to revive the economy. But after that, the Democrats lost control of the House and the last six years in office were focused largely on budgetary disputes with Congress over spending levels and the debt ceiling.\n\nBy the last year of his administration, DeBonis noted, Obama\u2019s party had lost 14 Senate seats, 68 House seats, 12 governorship and hundreds of state legislative seats.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Could Push Rural Hospitals to the Brink\n\nNow, on his way out the door, Obama is being treated to the spectacle of House and Senate GOP leaders rushing to repeal Obamacare in the coming weeks, even without a solid replacement plan in hand. The Senate and House are scheduled to take the first important votes towards that end later this week. And by the end of the month, the GOP-dominated Congress may give final approval to legislation that would dismantle most of the key elements of Obamacare, although the effective date may be months or years away.\n\nIf Obama can take any solace from the situation, McConnell and Ryan are discovering that repealing and replacing Obamacare isn\u2019t nearly as easy as they thought. Now a growing number of Republicans in the House and Senate are having second thoughts about the effort, fearing a voter backlash if their efforts result in millions of Americans losing their health insurance and major insurers and hospitals incurring significant financial losses."}, {"date": "2017/01/11", "title": "How China Can Fight Trump's Trade Policies", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/11/How-China-Can-Fight-Trumps-Trade-Policies", "text": "President-elect Donald Trump says he will push China hard on trade \u2014 and many are wondering how Beijing will push back.\n\nA number of Beijing watchers say leaders there are already brainstorming ways to reply if Trump does in fact push forward with trade agreements that make life harder for Chinese companies that export into the United States.\n\nRelated: Release of Salacious \u2018Russian\u2019 Report Further Poisons Trump-Media Relationship\n\n\"China will try to have a disproportionate response.

The news network did not reveal the explicit details of the allegations, which it said had also been presented to President Obama.\n\nThe long-term impact of the publication of the dossier is impossible to assess at this point. The allegations will become the subject of intense media investigation and speculation. It seems probable that US law enforcement and intelligence services are also probing its claims, though Federal Bureau of Investigation director James Comey declined to comment on the existence of such an inquiry in a hearing on Capitol Hill yesterday.\n\nRelated: Five Moves That Can Help Trump Win Big on Day One\n\nBut it\u2019s not hard to predict the impact that the revelation will have on Trump\u2019s already toxic relationship with the media. The incoming president attacked the report on Twitter Monday night, writing \u201cFAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday morning, he was back at it, citing official Russian denials of a campaign to gain influence over him. \u201cRussia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is \u2018A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FABRICATION, UTTER NONSENSE.\u2019 Very unfair!\u201d he wrote.\n\nLater, he added, \u201cRussia has never tried to use leverage over me. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA - NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!\u201d\n\nTrump, as of early Wednesday, was still expected to appear at an 11 a.m. press conference, his first since July. Whether or not it will happen, given the circumstances, was in question. Indeed, Trump has previously announced press conferences that either never materialized or wound up being extended campaign events at which no actual questions from the media were taken.\n\nBut if Trump does take questions from the press, it seems likely that the vast number of pressing questions about his impending presidency -- his conflicts of interest, his policy agenda, the role of his family members, the inexperience of his cabinet nominees -- will now take a back seat to the allegations raised in the dossier released last night.\n\nThat\u2019s a shame because barring substantial corroboration, those allegations will only serve to deepen the impression held by Trump and his strongest supporters that the media is biased against him and untrustworthy. As a result, it will color public perception of future critical reporting about the Trump administration.\n\nExpect to hear the \u201cFAKE NEWS\u201d claim a lot in the weeks to come, whether justified or not."}, {"date": "2017/01/11", "title": "Is Trump Too Impulsive to Be President? 58% of Americans Think So ", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/11/Trump-Too-Impulsive-Be-President-58-Americans-Think-So", "text": "Just ten days before President-elect Donald Trump is handed the keys to the White House and the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons code, more than half of voters fret that he is too impulsive to make level-headed decisions for the country according to a revealing new survey.\n\nAfter being treated to the spectacle of a Republican president in waiting virtually dominating the world stage, discrediting the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s findings about Russian interference with the election, intimidating car manufacturers, filling his new Cabinet with business moguls, and even bad-mouthing legendary Hollywood star Meryl Streep, Americans are largely on edge as the Jan. 20 inauguration fast approaches.\n\nRelated: Why Republicans Are Hitting the Brakes on Obamacare Repeal\n\nFifty-eight percent of Americans said that when it comes to making important decisions, Trump will be \u201ctoo impulsive,\u201d while 34 percent think he will be \u201cabout right\u201d and a mere four percent think he will be \u201ctoo cautious,\u201d according to a new Pew Research Center poll released on Tuesday, the day before Trump holds his first full-blown news conference since late July.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that voters continue to be troubled by his demeanor, in light of his frequent outbursts and petulant comments. Long after his stunning defeat of Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election, Trump continues to use Twitter to hurl biting, 140-character darts at critics, opponents and even GOP allies at times.\n\nThroughout the campaign, voters voiced concerns about Trump\u2019s temperament, even as many were drawn to his policies and promises. Last October, for example, 69 percent of voters surveyed characterized Trump as \u201creckless\u201d while 65 percent said he had \u201cpoor judgment.\u201d\n\nIn the latest Pew survey conducted nationally Jan. 4 through 9, Americans as a whole continued to worry about his temperament, although Republicans are obviously far more trusting of Trump to behave properly than Democrats.\n\nRelated: 5 Big Promises Trump Won\u2019t Be Able to Keep\n\nOverall, 65 percent of Republicans said they think Trump\u2019s approach to making important decisions will be about right, according to Pew, while 28 percent fear he will be too impulsive. By contrast, an overwhelming 84 percent of Democrats are convinced Trump will be too impulsive, and just nine percent think his approach and style will be about right.\n\nTrump is certain to be peppered by reporters today on a multitude of questions, including how he and family members who will either be handling his business interests or advising him in Washington can avoid major conflicts of interest. Just this week, Trump announced that he is hiring his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a real estate businessman in his own right, as a senior adviser in the West Wing.\n\nCNN reported late Tuesday that classified documents presented last week to President Obama and Trump included allegations that \u201cRussian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump.\u201d Trump is certain to be questioned at length about the controversy over Russia\u2019s hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign.\n\nReporters also are likely to press Trump to explain precisely what he has in store for the country in terms of new immigration policy and a crackdown on illegal immigrants, big changes in the health care system, new trade policies and his plans for beefing up U.S. defenses and the nuclear arsenal. Many Americans are keenly interested in what Trump will have to say about these and other issues, according to the new survey.\n\nRelated: You Wanted a Woman President \u2013 You Got One!\n\nAmericans disapprove of the job Trump has done since the election in explaining his future plans, with 55 percent saying they disapprove and 39 percent saying they approve, according to the Pew survey.\n\nThere is also widespread concern about Trump\u2019s potential conflicts of interest in running the country while his family-owned businesses, hotels, and country clubs could be helped or by future government tax and regulatory policies. Fifty-seven percent of those interviewed said they are very or somewhat worried about conflicts of interest, according to Pew, while 42 percent indicated they were not particularly concerned.\n\nSome 60 percent said that Trump has a responsibility to release his tax returns, a move that would give the public insight into his business dealing in the U.S. and overseas and determine whether he was honest in boasting of making generous charitable contributions. Thirty-three percent said they didn\u2019t think Trump was obliged to release his tax returns. Trump has insisted that he is unable to release his tax returns because they are the subject of an IRS audit. The president-elect\u2019s critics say that is a bogus excuse and that he could release the returns if he wanted to."}, {"date": "2017/01/11", "title": "Five Moves That Can Help Trump Win Big on Day One", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/01/11/Five-Moves-Can-Help-Trump-Win-Big-Day-One", "text": "Half the country is excited about President-elect Donald Trump; half is not. What can he do to win over more Americans? Simple; charge out of the gate on January 21 with a bevy of policies that voters will like.\n\nHere are five things Trump should do on Day One:\n\nCall for term limits in Congress.\n\n\n\nWalk away from the TPP.\n\n\n\nCall for a halt to admitting Syrian refugees until the authorities have the vetting process down cold.\n\n\n\nIssue an executive order rescinding Congress\u2019 exemption from Obamacare, an excellent idea proffered by Heather Higgins, President of the Independent Women\u2019s Voice. As she suggests, there\u2019s nothing like skin in the game to light a fire under legislators. Next, announce that Congress will repeal Obamacare to take effect December 2018. Meanwhile, allow insurers to immediately begin offering state-legal policies without the ACA\u2019s expensive and unwieldy mandates. Make it clear that no one will lose coverage.\n\n\n\nApprove the Keystone Pipeline.\n\nFor soon-to-be President Trump, there is no single act that could more swiftly satisfy his pledge to \u201cDrain the Swamp\u201d than calling for term limits. Ethics watchdogs say that nothing is a greater predictor of corruption than time in office. Former Representative Chaka Fattah, recently sentenced to ten years in prison for bribery and corruption, is a perfect example.\n\nHe has served for 20 years. The longest sentence ever awarded a member of Congress was the 13-year term given to Louisiana\u2019s William Jefferson in 2009 after $90,000 was discovered in his freezer. He had served for 18 years. In the 2012 listing of Most Corrupt House members by left-leaning ethics watchdog CREW, the average time in office was eight terms. That\u2019s too long to feed at the public trough.\n\nA Rasmussen poll in October found that 74 percent of the country backed term limits for members of Congress; in 2013, Gallup concluded that 75 percent of Americans felt the same way. Our founding fathers never imagined \u201ccareer politicians,\u201d and we should not accept the notion either.\n\nThe Trans-Pacific Partnership multi-nation trade pact, proposed and endorsed by President Obama, has been attacked from right and left. Indeed, denouncing the TPP may have been the only policy that Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton (after some persuasion) and Bernie Sanders all agreed upon.\n\nPolling from Pew and a YouGov survey for The Economist shows that most registered voters also oppose the TPP. To explain why he is scuttling the deal, Trump can cite a comprehensive World Bank study -- one of the few done on the pact -- which concludes that Vietnam, Japan and Malaysia will be the big beneficiaries of the agreement. The benefits to the U.S. are described as \u201climited.\u201d Much better, Trump can assert, to craft bilateral deals that can actually help the U.S.\n\nAs for NAFTA, Trump should promise that negotiations to overhaul the agreement will be initiated in his first year. That 1993 deal is woefully out of date; e-commerce, for instance, is not even mentioned. But, jettisoning NAFTA immediately is not feasible. Too many supply chains run across our borders; reckless tinkering would undermine numerous industries. Lofting uncertainty onto U.S. businesses as the Obama White House did was a major factor in slowing the recovery. Trump will not repeat that mistake.\n\nIn 2015 Donald Trump was pilloried for advocating \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on,\" a position he took in the wake of the San Bernardino shootings. After reports that Syrian refugees may have been behind terror attacks in Europe, Trump refined his proposal, suggesting we should \"suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe, or our allies.\u201d In other words, Trump opposed President Obama\u2019s plan to admit at least 10,000 refugees from Syria, a goal the White House exceeded last year.\n\nPolling after the Paris terror attacks showed more than half the country agreed with Trump. A more recent survey, taken by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, showed that only 36 percent of the country backed settling Syrian refugees on our soil.\n\nTrump should suspend the program to admit refugees from war-torn countries until our intelligence agencies can prove their ability to truly \u201cvet\u201d newcomers from Syria, Iraq and elsewhere. The United States can and should do more to help settle these struggling peoples in other countries in the Middle East; there is no reason to import trouble.\n\nHaving pledged to do so, Trump and Republicans in Congress must immediately address Obamacare. On day one, President Trump should support the repeal, but push the effective date to the end of 2018. Congress will be instructed to recraft the failing program in the interim, allowing for more market-based solutions, reducing Obamacare\u2019s costly and absurd mandates and allowing religious groups more flexibility in providing controversial coverage. Trump must make it clear that no one will lose his health coverage, that the needy will be able to access care and that the changes will target lower costs. He has already promised to keep the popular parts of the ACA, which allow children to stay on their parents\u2019 program and which guarantee coverage for those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nFinally, Trump will approve the Keystone Pipeline. A majority of the country backs the pipeline, which has been reviewed ad nauseum, and which will create jobs. Even Obama\u2019s State Department could find no authentic reason to oppose it. Trump will let this valuable conduit to one of the world\u2019s largest energy reserves move forward. Even Canada\u2019s progressive new leader Justin Trudeau has supported Keystone. This is a slam-dunk.\n\nConsumer optimism just hit a twelve-month high.

But Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Investigations, has done his colleagues one better. The Utah Republican is proposing to move Washington itself outside the beltway.\n\nAs part of a proposal that is described as \u201cthe first step in a process to bring government closer to the people by evaluating which agencies might better serve their purpose elsewhere,\u201d Chaffetz on Tuesday introduced H.R. 38, the Divest DC Act.\n\nRelated: The Best and Worst States for Taxes in 2017\n\n\u201cGovernment needs to be closer to the people it regulates,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAs it stands, decision makers at various agencies are largely shielded from the impact of their decisions. Housing federal agencies in a city with one of the highest median incomes in the United States is not only expensive, but keeps federal bureaucrats in an economic and political bubble that offers a distorted view of the realities facing this country.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThis resolution is the first step toward decentralizing federal agencies and initiating a process that shares the wealth of stable federal jobs with other communities across the United States. I look forward to working with my colleagues on legislation to identify locations where these agencies can best serve the American people.\u201d\n\nThere are, to be sure, a few impediments to shipping the Commerce Department to Kalamazoo and sending the Pentagon to Peoria. The first is whether or not it\u2019s wise to think about abandoning the Washington-based infrastructure that the federal government has created for itself over hundreds of years. Employees of different parts of the executive branch frequently meet with each other, and that\u2019s much easier to do when it doesn\u2019t involve flying across the country.\n\nAnother is whether or not such a proposal could survive the sustained assault of the lobbyists, government contractors, law firms and others who have grafted themselves so completely to D.C. and the surrounding suburbs over the generations and who would be loath to decamp for somewhere else.\n\nFinally, though, is the question of whether a greatly decentralized federal government would be able to attract the kind of talent it needs to operate effectively. Part of what attracts many young, smart people to federal service is that Washington is a cosmopolitan place with lots of social, cultural and other opportunities for a wide range of people. The same can\u2019t be said for all parts of the country.\n\nRelated: The 9 States (and One District) Americans Are Flocking To\n\nChaffetz\u2019s proposal is, in the end, not likely to lead to an actual restructuring of the federal government. But like many pieces of legislation introduced in Washington, then Divest Act is more about symbolism than about actual policymaking.\n\nIt\u2019s a way to win points with conservative voters, and to raise questions about whether the federal government is in touch with the needs of the people.

Firms have been more vocal in publicizing job creation and they have sometimes let Trump claim credit.\n\nFiat Chrysler Automobiles , the No. 3 automaker in the United States, announced plans on Sunday to create 2,000 U.S. jobs. The timing was partly influenced by CEO Sergio Marchionne's desire to get the news out ahead of any possible criticism from Trump for the automaker's overseas manufacturing, a person familiar with the company's thinking said.\n\nTrump has in the past few weeks attacked FCA's two Detroit rivals, as well as Japan-based Toyota, for their manufacturing operations in Mexico and threatened to impose stiff border taxes on any imports.\n\nIn December, SoftBank Group Corp , majority owner of Sprint Corp , unveiled a $50 billion U.S. investment at the Trump Tower in Manhattan.

Now, in the harsh light of day, the GOP victors are struggling to figure out how to make good on that promise without prompting a voter backlash from millions of Americans who could lose their current subsidized insurance or extended Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Could Push Rural Hospitals to the Brink\n\nUnderscoring that dilemma for the GOP, a new Morning Consult/Politico poll released Tuesday found that nearly two-thirds of voters say the Republican-controlled Congress should not repeal Obamacare without having a replacement plan in hand.\n\nWhile Republicans typically have voiced much stronger feelings than Democrats for the need to dismantle Obamacare in short order, the new poll found that 48 percent of Republicans and 61 percent of independents said there should be a \u201cclear alternative announced\u201d before repealing the 2010 health care law.\n\nA Gallup poll conducted shortly after Trump\u2019s surprising November 8 victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton found that while more than half of Americans were dissatisfied with Obamacare, 57 percent said they either wanted to keep the law as is or wanted to keep it and change the law significantly. Little more than a third said they wanted to repeal and replace it as the Republicans have vowed to do.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Is a Fiscal Minefield for the GOP\n\nThe Senate is scheduled to take the lead with a vote on Thursday to formally launch the budget \u201creconciliation\u201d process and put repeal of Obamacare on a fast track by ordering the Finance Committee and Health, Education and Labor Committees to report back with final repeal language by Jan. 27.\n\nThe House appears set to vote on a similar budget resolution Friday that instructs the Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce Committees to draft language and report back by Jan. 27. The House vote originally was scheduled for next week, but it\u2019s possible the leadership decided to move up the vote before any internal party resistance began to gel.\n\nOnce the GOP leadership resolved differences in the two resolutions, the House and Senate would then vote on the final resolution targeting key elements of Obamacare for elimination, including premium subsidies, taxes and mandates on individuals and businesses.\n\nRyan told reporters Tuesday that he and other Republicans have already put forward a replacement plan that potentially could start to come together around the time of final action on the repeal of Obamacare. \u201cIt is our goal to bring it all together concurrently,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to use every tool at our disposal \u2026 so that we can save people from this mess.\u201d\n\nRelated: Republicans Are Having Second Thoughts About Scrapping Obamacare Taxes\n\nHowever, five GOP senators \u2013 Corker, Rob Portman of Ohio, Susan Collins of Maine, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2013 offered an amendment on Monday that would extend the target date for House and Senate committees to complete work on the final wording of the resolution to March 3, according to media reports.\n\nCorker said that since Trump stated shortly after the election that repeal and replacement of Obamacare should take place simultaneously, the amendment would provide the incoming administration with more time to outline its priorities.\n\nMeanwhile, Paul, the Kentucky libertarian who unsuccessfully challenged Trump for the GOP presidential nomination, has thrust himself into the debate by calling for a delay in repealing the law until Trump and the Republicans can cobble together a replacement plan acceptable to a majority of Republicans.\n\nPaul said that he and Trump were in contact last Friday and that Trump is open to considering a replacement plan that Paul is working on. Trump, Ryan, Rep. Tom Price of Georgia, and other Republicans have floated various proposals for a new, more market-based approach to health care coverage, but none of them has gained traction yet.\n\nRelated: Here's the GOP's 2017 New Year\u2019s Resolution: Avoid Self-Inflicted Wounds\n\nCorker \u2013 possibly tongue in cheek \u2013 asked Trump to tweet out confirmation that he and Paul were working together on an alternative approach. \u201cIf it is his view, it would be really good if he would consider tweeting it out very clearly,\u201d Corker told reporters. \u201cThere\u2019s more and more concerns about not doing it simultaneously.\u201d\n\nIn the House, meanwhile, members of the arch-conservative Freedom Caucus met Monday night to confer on possibly seeking a delay in acting on the budget resolution. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), the new chair of the caucus, told Bloomberg that his group wants to see more details about a replacement plan before voting on the budget resolution.\n\nMeadows and about a dozen other caucus members conferred with Rand Paul last week, who argued that the budget resolution not only could cause chaos in the health care system but also add substantially to the debt. \"We hope they would see the prudence of waiting,\" Meadows said of the GOP leadership."}, {"date": "2017/01/10", "title": "The Federal Spending \u2018Wastebook\u2019 Is Outrageous in More Ways Than One", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/10/Federal-Spending-Wastebook-Outrageous-More-Ways-One", "text": "Retired Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn was always going to be a tough act to follow when it came to producing the colorful \u201cWastebook\u201d that he and his staff put out every year to document what they saw as profligate government spending. But Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, who inherited the Wastebook when Coburn retired after the 2014 edition, is certainly trying hard. Maybe too hard.\n\nThis year\u2019s edition, released Tuesday, is titled \u201cPorkemon Go\u201d and features a cartoon version of Flake on the front, dressed as the character Ash Ketchum from the Pokemon series. It follows on last year\u2019s version, \u201cWastebook 2015: The Farce Awakens\u201d which took the film from the Star Wars franchise as its theme.\n\nRelated: Here's the GOP's 2017 New Year\u2019s Resolution: Avoid Self-Inflicted Wounds\n\nThe collection of supposed outrages has always been presented as an affront to fiscal responsibility, and this year\u2019s version is no different. \u201cWithin mere days, the national debt will top $20 trillion, the largest amount ever owed by any nation in history, and the federal government\u2019s authority to borrow expires in March,\u201d Flake writes in the introduction. \u201cBut rather than making a long overdue resolution to be fiscally responsible, the promises from Washington are to spend even more.\u201d\n\nHe continues, \u201cAs an example, this past year the outgoing Administration requested that Congress provide billions of dollars in additional money to pay for efforts to address the spread of Zika, a virus transmitted by mosquitoes that can cause birth defects. At the same time, the nation\u2019s most prestigious science agencies were squandering resources already available by investigating matters most would consider obvious or even absurd.\u201d\n\nThe Wastebook is a complicated subject to write about objectively. Heavy on snark and mockery, it identifies dozens of examples of obscure federal spending, many of which are objectively wasteful or corrupt. But it also has a history of ridiculing scientific research grants by describing them in narrowest possible way, often omitting their connection to a larger field of legitimate research. Grantees have also criticized it for vastly inflating the amount of money spent on specific studies, or using misleading descriptions of programs to generate anger at the government.\n\nThis year\u2019s version looks as though part of it could be subjected to similar criticism. For example, one supposed outrage is that a handful of liquor stores have taken advantage of a Department of Agriculture program to support rural businesses\u2019 effort to install energy efficient lighting.\n\nRelated: 15 States Americans Are Ditching: What\u2019s the Matter With Wyoming?\n\nThe section, titled \u201cGetting Lit at the Liquor Store,\u201d complains that the $5,000 grant to a store called Newberry Liquors, in Newberry, Florida, went to an establishment that, \u201cIn addition to liquor, wine, and beer ... also serves cigarettes and tobacco products.\u201d\n\nThe section flags several other liquor stores that also benefited from the program, creating the impression that the program is specifically aimed at them. The truth, though, is that thousands of rural businesses benefit from the Rural Energy for America Program, from family farms to supermarkets. The Wastebook barely acknowledges that fact at the end of the section, with the throwaway line, \u201cTaxpayers should not have to subsidize the lighting or electricity costs of liquor stores or other businesses\u201d -- where \u201cother businesses\u201d represents the overwhelming majority of the program\u2019s beneficiaries.\n\nA quick read of the report would also suggest that the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry was given a $150,000 federal grant to develop \u201cearthquake-proof gingerbread houses.\u201d\n\nRelated: Republicans Risk \u2018Expanding the Swamp\u2019 by Ramming Through Cabinet Picks\n\nOnce past the headline, the write-up of the study at least acknowledges that the holiday-themed gingerbread program was aimed at engaging mostly younger visitors with the principles of engineering in an accessible manner. But what the book doesn\u2019t do is point out that the $150,000 grant was provided to fund a series of three different exhibits, of which the gingerbread-themed program appears to have been just one.\n\nOn page 137 of the Wastebook, after 50 examples of supposed government profligacy comes the disclaimer, \u201cThe best effort was made to determine the precise cost of the activity, product or service profiled in an entry paid for with taxpayer funds. However, in some cases the exact amount spent was not tracked by the agency, could not be determined, or was spent over a number of years, including future years. Therefore, the amount provided may be the total amount budgeted for the program or grant profiled rather than for the specific purpose highlighted.\u201d\n\nNone of this is to say that the Wastebook doesn\u2019t identify some pretty iffy government projects.\n\nFor example, Flake\u2019s researchers identified a \u201cspaceport\u201d in Alaska that continues to receive government funding from the Department of Defense despite the fact that it hasn\u2019t been used in years, and appears to be in a serious state of disrepair.\n\nRelated: Rand Paul Is Coming to the Rescue with an Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nAnother is a Florida municipal planning authority that has apparently spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on dubious projects that include golf tournaments and dragon boat races.\n\nAnd there is no shortage of scientific studies that -- at least presented the way they are by Flake\u2019s writers -- seem pretty absurd. There are fish on treadmills, lustful monkeys and surfing cats. But in many cases, the authors of the book don\u2019t really give the recipients of the grants the opportunity to explain themselves.\n\nThat might have been a better use of their time than composing really dreadful paragraphs like this one, complaining about funding for a fishing museum in Massachusetts:\n\n\u201cBy reeling in $32,000 from two different agencies, the fledgling Fishing Heritage Center proves that catching government grants is like shooting fish in a barrel. Both grants are supporting efforts to bait tourists to the area by telling fish tales.\u201d"}, {"date": "2017/01/10", "title": "Rand Paul Is Coming to the Rescue with an Obamacare Replacement Plan", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/10/Rand-Paul-Coming-Rescue-Obamacare-Replacement-Plan", "text": "Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) may have just derailed congressional GOP leaders\u2019 efforts to swiftly repeal the Affordable Care Act without a clear replacement plan in hand. He did it by apparently enlisting the support of President-elect Donald Trump in concocting an alternative health insurance program that could garner widespread support within their party.\n\nPaul and a small handful of other Senate Republicans have raised concerns about GOP leaders forging ahead with a budget \u201creconciliation\u201d bill that would repeal key provisions of Obamacare -- including premium subsidies and new taxes to finance the program\u2013 without immediately addressing the impact on more than 20 million Americans enrolled in plans and insurers likely incur huge losses.\n\nRelated: Could Rand Paul End Up Saving Obamacare?\n\n\u201cWe should repeal Obamacare, but partial repeal will only accelerate the current chaos and may eventually lead to calls for a taxpayer bailout of insurance companies,\u201d he wrote recently.\n\nNow Paul, 53, a libertarian who ran an unsuccessful campaign for president last year, is attempting to thrust himself in the middle of the GOP debate over how best to keep a solemn campaign pledge to obliterate Obamacare within weeks of Trump taking power -- but without triggering an angry backlash from millions of people who likely would lose their coverage.\n\nPaul says he is working on a replacement plan of his own. It is one made up of some of the best ideas floated by Republicans in recent years, and he hopes to have it ready for Trump\u2019s consideration early this week.\n\nHe told Politico Monday that Trump called him last Friday night after seeing an interview in which Paul said that Congress should vote on an Obama replacement at the same time it repeals the law.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Could Push Rural Hospitals to the Brink\n\n\u201cHe said he was in complete agreement with that,\u201d Paul told Politico, after tweeting out the news last week.\n\nI just spoke to @realDonaldTrump and he fully supports my plan to replace Obamacare the same day we repeal it. The time to act is now. \u2014 Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) January 7, 2017\n\nTrump told CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d shortly after the Nov. 8 election that he would like to see repeal and replacement of Obamacare handled simultaneously, although he subsequently backed away from any specific timetable.\n\nYesterday, Trump told reporters in New York that he\u2019s \u201cnot even a little bit worried\u201d about how Republicans will replace Obamacare, and that in the end everything will work out. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said over the weekend that Congress would follow up Obamacare repeal legislation with a replacement program \u201cvery quickly,\u201d but without setting a timetable. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) said last week that he was confident a replacement plan could be approved by the end of this year.\n\nBut this is no simple task. Getting all the stakeholders\u2014hospitals, doctors, insurance companies, governors of states that expanded Medicaid\u2014to agree on a framework is like holding a tenant\u2019s meeting in a New York City apartment building.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Is a Fiscal Minefield for the GOP\n\nSenior Republican lawmakers, including Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the chair of the Health, Education and Labor Committee, has warned that it could take as long as two years before Congress finally sorts out a replacement for the Affordable Care Act that could garner some needed Democratic support.\n\nPaul says he\u2019s not trying to be the fly in the ointment but a catalyst for speeding up the process by pressing for simultaneous consideration of repeal and replacement legislation. Senate and House GOP Leaders are determined to stage votes this week and next on the preliminary budget action required to authorize committees in both chambers to draft the specific language for repealing Obamacare subsidies, taxes and mandates. That process could take weeks or months before a final plan is stitched together and approved by the House and Senate.\n\nDemocrats and other critics say it\u2019s reckless of Trump and his GOP allies on Capitol Hill to rush to repeal the 2010 law before they can agree on a comprehensive replacement plan that preserves coverage for millions of Americans who signed up for Obamacare and prevents the insurance markets, health care providers and the pharmaceutical industry from falling into a financial death spiral.\n\nPaul is not alone in his effort to forestall a vote on repealing Obamacare until a consensus emerges on replacement legislation. Others including Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Bob Corker of Tennessee and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana have also voiced support for a coordinated approach. And with a relatively modest 52 to 48 seat majority, McConnell can\u2019t afford more than two to three defections to achieve his goals.\n\nRelated: Republicans Are Having Second Thoughts About Scrapping Obamacare Taxes\n\nPaul didn't offer any details yesterday concerning what he would include in his healthcare bill. He wrote in an op-ed recently that Obamacare should be replaced with \"freedom\" to choose inexpensive insurance free of government dictates. He also said he favors allowing unlimited savings in health savings accounts and authority for major insurers to sell policies across state lines \u2013 proposals that Trump has also endorsed.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell delivered a farewell address on Monday warning of a looming chaotic situation in which tens of millions of Americans could lose their coverage.\n\n\u201cI think we haven\u2019t seen a real [Republican] proposal for replacement,\u201d she said in responding to a question about whether any of the GOP proposals being floated might be acceptable to the Democrats. \u201cWe have not seen a plan that can be measured or scored\u201d or that adequately addresses the need for broad coverage and access, affordable premiums and quality of health care.\n\nRelated: GOP and Dem Governors Are Closing Ranks Against Obamacare Repeal\n\nLast night, Senate Democrats planned to deliver floor speeches and Facebook Live broadcasts denouncing the Republicans\u2019 efforts to unravel Obamacare and push for cuts in Medicare, Medicaid and Planned Parenthood, according to Huffington Post. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and his members also are preparing to slow Senate action on a budget \u201creconciliation\u201d package to repeal key elements of Obamacare by offering scores of \u201cpoison pill\u201d amendments late this week in a \u201cVote-a-Rama\u201d that could last a day or more.\n\n\u201cIf the Affordable Care Act is repealed without a replacement, the damage to the country\u2019s individual insurance market will begin this spring,\u201d Burwell said in her speech. \u201cIf health insurance companies don\u2019t know what the market will look like going forward, many will either raise prices or drop out. That means more Americans won\u2019t be able to afford coverage, and others won\u2019t be able to find it at all.\u201d\n\nWhile estimates vary on the potential adverse effect of a repeal of Obamacare, a recent Urban Institute study concluded that as many as 30 million Americans could lose their coverage. The share of non-elderly people lacking insurance coverage would increase from 11 percent to 21 percent \u2013 a higher rate of uninsured than before the advent of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cIf Congress never enacts a comprehensive replacement, the consequences for American health care would be stark.

But the current prosecution of the Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal brings into focus how easy it would have been to proceed this way for the last eight years, especially in the cases of financial institutions involved in the 2008 crisis and its aftermath.\n\nOver the weekend, the FBI arrested Oliver Schmidt, who led the key U.S. regulatory compliance office at Volkswagen, for conspiracy to commit fraud. According to the indictment, Schmidt repeatedly lied to regulators, denying that Volkswagen used special software to cheat emissions tests for its diesel vehicles, when he knew that was company strategy. These \u201cdefeat devices\u201d allowed VW cars on American roads that emitted up to 40 times the legal limit of nitrogen oxide (NOx). If convicted, Schmidt would face five years in prison.\n\nRelated: US Approves First Fix for 70,000 Polluting VW Diesel Vehicles\n\nThe indictment accompanies an expected settlement of a criminal investigation against Volkswagen, in which the company will actually have to plead guilty to criminal misconduct and pay billions in fines. That\u2019s on top of $16 billion in class-action civil settlements involving half a million cars, where customers can either sell their vehicles back to Volkswagen or have them fixed to reduce NOx emissions.\n\nJust forcing a guilty plea on a car company is an upgrade on previous settlements with General Motors and Toyota. But the VW scandal broke just as the Justice Department promised in an internal memo to prioritize individual prosecutions of corporate criminals, after facing criticism for failing to do so after the financial crisis. The so-called Yates memo, named after Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, said that companies must turn over officials responsible for corporate crime, including senior management. The VW case offered a key test of whether the Yates memo would be adhered to when the target was a giant global conglomerate.\n\nProsecutors obeyed the Yates memo by following the chain of command. In September, Robert Liang, who worked in the company\u2019s engine development department, pled guilty to conspiracy charges, agreeing to cooperate with investigators in exchange for a lighter sentence. In the Schmidt complaint, the FBI revealed that it has two other unnamed cooperating witnesses from Volkswagen, who are also working with investigators on the case.\n\nRelated: Silicon Valley\u2019s Self-Serving Vision for Self-Driving Cars\n\nAny law enforcement professional would call this \u201cpolice work 101.\u201d The FBI identified lower-level employees involved in circumventing U.S. emissions tests, flipped them to work with the investigation and moved on to find those responsible for authorizing and directing both the scandal and the response.\n\nSchmidt is the first such higher-ranking official charged, but probably not the last. According to the complaint, Schmidt and his colleagues learned in March 2014 about a West Virginia University study that found that VW cars would perform differently on the road than in emissions tests. That was over a year before the VW executives finally disclosed the defeat devices to regulators. Schmidt wrote specifically in a chart that failure to explain what researchers discovered about increased emissions would lead to \u201cindictment.\u201d\n\nIn July 2015, Schmidt attended a meeting at VW headquarters, where the subject of handling regulator questions was broached. \u201cRather than advocate for disclosure of the defeat device to regulators, VW executive management authorized its continued concealment,\u201d the complaint reads. Right after that meeting, Schmidt followed orders and lied to the Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board about the emissions discrepancies.\n\nRelated: VW, Justice Dept. Nearing $3 Billion Deal to Resolve Diesel Allegations\n\nAt another meeting in Germany in August 2015, Schmidt huddled with \u201cother co-conspirators\u201d to plot how to handle an upcoming meeting with regulators. Senior VW managers approved a plan for \u201ccontinuing to conceal the defeat device.\u201d But one of the FBI\u2019s cooperating witnesses blew the whistle a week later, disclosing the defeat devices at the meeting \u201cin direct contravention of instructions from his management.\u201d\n\nThe narrative in the complaint directly implicates senior management at Volkswagen in covering up the defeat devices. It\u2019s almost certain that more executives will face criminal charges as a result. That could lead all the way to Volkswagen\u2019s former CEO Martin Winterkorn.\n\nSo after a methodical investigation, prosecutors secured cooperation from knowledgeable insiders, amassed evidence and found top executives responsible for criminal actions. The prosecutorial playbook works, in other words, and claims of difficulties in finding explicit culpability among executives do not hold water, given the VW case.\n\nThere is no reason that the same process could not have been used for Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and many other institutions that played a role in the financial crisis. We had the names of the traders who marketed and sold dodgy mortgage securities to investors without disclosing the risks. We had millions of false documents issued to courtrooms and county offices nationwide, with forged signatures attached to them. That\u2019s a wealth of raw material from which to begin an effort to locate who authorized the fraudulent materials, and who directed those people to authorize them, and so on, until law enforcement reached every C-suite at every major financial institution in America.\n\nRelated: Another Wells Fargo Scandal Proves Our Financial System Is Still Broken\n\nWaiting nearly eight years to put this detective work into practice begs the question of why it laid dormant for so long. Moreover the buzzer-beating conduct in the Volkswagen case could go for naught. Within weeks, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions will likely take over running the Justice Department. There\u2019s no guarantee he will follow through with Volkswagen executive criminal indictments; in fact, senators on the Judiciary Committee should ask him that question at his confirmation hearings, which begin today.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Sessions did say in 2010 that DoJ shouldn\u2019t hesitate to charge companies that break the law, and Volkswagen actually wants to close its settlement with the current administration rather than facing the unknown with the new attorney general. But off-the-cuff statements in the Senate and actual responsibility at Justice are two different things. We simply don\u2019t know how Sessions will act and whether the Yates memo will have any meaning.\n\nOf course, prosecutors shouldn\u2019t need a memo to know the importance of seeking accountability for all crimes, regardless of wealth and power. Seeing this principle enforced in the case of Volkswagen would give Americans renewed confidence in the justice system.

Trump and his advisers leapt on the news immediately on Monday morning, suggesting that it was the prospect of a Trump administration that led the automaker to invest more in the U.S.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s What Americans Want Most to Hear from President Trump\n\nThey did this, even as they linked to news reports in which auto executives said that manufacturing expansions on this scale are decided on years in advance and that Fiat Chrysler is actually just executing a plan announced long before anyone seriously believed Trump could be elected president.\n\nBut whether or not Trump actually deserves credit for the creation or \u201creshoring\u201d of these jobs is less important to experts on labor economics than the type of jobs he is focused on.\n\nTrump was elected, in part, by the votes of men and women in states across the Rust Belt, where the brutal decline of heavy manufacturing between 1980 and 2000 left millions out of work.\n\nDay after day in rallies in Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania, he promised that he would bring back the glory days, when manufacturing jobs were plentiful and promised a solid middle-class lifestyle.\n\nThe problem is that those days just aren\u2019t coming back. The U.S. lost 6.7 million manufacturing jobs between 1980 and 2014. If Trump convinced one company a week to create 2,000 new manufacturing jobs in the US, it would take 64 years to replace them.\n\nRelated: Trump Wants a Much Bigger Navy: Here\u2019s How Much It\u2019ll Cost\n\n\u201c[N]o one should be under the illusion that millions of manufacturing jobs are coming back to America,\u201d Mark Muro writes in the MIT Technology Review.\n\nMuro, a senior fellow and the director of policy at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, points out that contrary to Trump\u2019s claim, relentlessly repeated on the stump, that \u201cWe don\u2019t make anything anymore,\u201d the U.S. manufacturing sector is actually extraordinarily strong.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the total inflation-adjusted output of the U.S. manufacturing sector is now higher than it has ever been,\u201d he writes. \u201cThat\u2019s true even as the sector\u2019s employment is growing only slowly, and remains near the lowest it\u2019s been. These diverging lines\u2014which reflect improved productivity\u2014highlight a huge problem with Trump\u2019s promises to help workers by reshoring millions of manufacturing jobs. America is already producing a lot. And in any event, the return of more manufacturing won\u2019t bring back many jobs, because the labor is increasingly being done by robots.\u201d\n\nChart: MIT Technology Review\n\nIf Trump really wants to help displaced factory workers, Muro says, he\u2019d do better to focus on education, job training and retraining, and cash assistance to those displaced, rather than trying to reassemble a 1960s era manufacturing economy.\n\nRelated: 5 Reasons So Many Americans Are Living Paycheck to Paycheck\n\nAs it stands, Trump\u2019s outsized attachment to the style of U.S. manufacturing he may remember from his childhood comes at the cost of attention to other U.S. workers who are being displaced from different jobs. Trump\u2019s intervention to defer the planned closing of an air conditioner factory last year drove weeks\u2019 worth of headlines and won Trump praise when Carrier Corp. agreed to keep about 800 workers in Indiana, for the time being, at least.\n\nContrast that with the attention Trump has paid to the announcement last week that the retail clothing chain The Limited was closing its 250 stores. That means the loss of some 800 full-time jobs and more than 3,000 additional part-time jobs.\n\nThe closing mirrors a broader trend in the retail industry. Trump\u2019s one-time partner, Macy\u2019s, announced the closure of dozens of stores this month as well. And while Trump at least didn\u2019t cheer the company\u2019s latest stumble, he also didn\u2019t lament it. It\u2019s not exactly clear why, especially given that the retail trade sector employs more Americans right now than the manufacturing sector has in well over a decade.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Job No. 1: Recoup the Jobs, Wages and Security Lost to Trade Deals\n\nThe same sort of technology-led innovation that has hammered the manufacturing sector is hitting the retail sector now, except that retail clerks are being replaced by web browsers instead of robots. And guess who\u2019s doing all the jobs in the fulfillment centers that drive online retailing? Yep. Increasingly, it\u2019s robots. Angel Gonzalez of the Seattle Times reported in January on the continued growth of what he called Amazon\u2019s \u201crobot army.\u201d\n\nThe world\u2019s largest e-commerce retailer said it has 45,000 robots in some 20 fulfillment centers. That\u2019s a bigger headcount than that of the armed forces of the Netherlands, a NATO member, according to World Bank data. It\u2019s also a cool 50 percent increase from last year\u2019s holiday season, when the company had some 30,000 robots working alongside 230,000 humans.\n\nWhile it won\u2019t make him look as though he\u2019s riding to the rescue, at least in the next news cycle, if Trump really wants to help American workers, he might focus less on a backward-looking return to a \u201cgreatness\u201d he remembers from decades ago. Instead, he should be asking the smartest people he can find -- economists, technologists, innovators and entrepreneurs -- what the country will need to be great in a world where the direct input of human labor into the economy looks much different than it did in the past."}, {"date": "2017/01/09", "title": "House GOP Quietly Shields Lawmakers Records from Ethics Probes", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/09/House-GOP-Quietly-Shields-Lawmakers-Records-Ethics-Probes", "text": "After congressional ethics experts, voters, and President-elect Donald Trump forced House Republicans to back down last week from a rules change that would have eviscerated the independent Office of Congressional Ethics, one important sentence quietly slipped through another rule change.\n\nThat sentence enables individual members to hide official documents that could prove embarrassing or even incriminating if they were suddenly investigated by the ethics office or the Justice Department for criminal activity.\n\nRelated: Republicans Risk \u2018Expanding the Swamp\u2019 by Ramming Through Cabinet Picks\n\nThe new rule states that records created, generated or received by the congressional office of a House member \u201care exclusively the personal property of the individual member\u201d and that the member \u201chas control over such records,\u201d according to a report by OpenSecrets.org.\n\nWhile the rule change might seem relatively benign on the surface, it has severe and troubling implications for future ethical oversight and investigations of members of Congress as the Republicans fully take charge of Congress and the White House.\n\nSheila Krumholz, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, said Monday that the rules change \u201cis not good\u201d and threatens to erode ethical oversight in government further.

That spending included a $40,000 \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d-style redecoration of his Capitol Hill office, complete with a $5,000 chandelier.\n\nSchock was charged with wire fraud, making false statements and filing false federal income tax returns in a 52-page indictment filed last November. But before the indictment, Schock\u2019s lawyers and the Justice Department argued over who held control of his financial documents, which included records of expenditures for redecorating and other purchases.

She also called for protections for the media.\n\nTrump responded by attacking and denigrating Streep. Calling her \u201cone of the most overrated actresses in Hollywood\u201d and a \u201cHillary flunky who lost big.\u201d He also repeated his angry denial that he had mocked the reporter, something that the video of the moment appears to confirm. Trump even took a midnight phone call from a New York Times Culture section reporter so that he could denounce Streep\u2019s criticism.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s What Americans Want Most to Hear from President Trump\n\nThere is a popular undercurrent in social media-enabled criticism of the mainstream press that Trump and his team are deviously clever when it comes to misdirection -- offering up shiny objects to send the press pack scurrying off for comment on his latest Twitter outbursts at a time when they ought to be digging into more serious issues.\n\nThis appears to credit Donald Trump with more foresight than he really deserves.

Shaub added that he is unaware of any occasion in the 40 years since the ethics office was established when the Senate held confirmation hearings before the nominee had completed the ethics review process.\n\nSchumer complained over the weekend that Trump\u2019s transition team had conspired with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and other GOP leaders to \u201cjam through\u201d the nominations. What\u2019s more, Schumer and other Democrats have urged the House Ethics Committee to begin investigating the stock holdings and investment strategy of Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), a leading proponent of dismantling Obamacare who has been nominated by Trump to be the next Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported late last month that Price traded more than $300,000 in shares of health-related companies during the past four years while he sponsored legislation \u2013 including a replacement for Obamacare and a measure to privatize Medicare \u2013 that potentially could impact those companies\u2019 stocks.

The analysis includes 116 U.S. cities with populations greater than 200,000. See the full rankings here.\n\nChicago\u2019s position at the bottom of the ranking is no surprise to anyone who follows municipal finance. The Windy City has become a poster child for financial mismanagement, having suffered a series of ratings downgrades in recent years. Aside from having thin reserves and large volumes of outstanding debt, Chicago is notorious for its underfunded pension plans.\n\nFor example, the city\u2019s Municipal Employees' Annuity and Benefit Fund (MEABF) reported $4.7 billion in assets and $14.7 billion of actuarially accrued liabilities at the end of 2015, representing a funded ratio of just 33 percent. The actuarial calculations rely on a controversial practice of discounting future benefits at a rate of 7.5 percent, which is the assumed return on the fund\u2019s portfolio return. If a more conservative assumption was employed, MEABF\u2019s liabilities would be higher and its funded ratio lower.\n\nRelated: See the Full 2017 Fiscal Strength Index Ranking of 116 US Cities\n\nBecause the ranking is based on 2015 financial audits \u2014 you can see the full data behind the scores here \u2014 it does not take into account more recent news. Last summer, Mayor Rahm Emmanuel announced a plan to resolve MEABF underfunding by raising water and sewer rates and increasing employee contributions to the system. Because these changes don\u2019t take effect until this year, it will take some time for them to impact Chicago\u2019s audited financial statements and their fiscal health scores.\n\nWhile Chicago\u2019s place at the bottom of the list is unsurprising, New York City\u2019s position \u2014 just one step above \u2014 was unexpected. An extended bull market and soaring real estate prices have pumped money into the Big Apple\u2019s coffers. Total municipal revenues rose from $60 billion in 2009 to $81 billion in 2015. But the city has been spending the money almost as quickly as it has been coming in.\n\nAt the end of its 2015 fiscal year, the city\u2019s general fund reserves amounted to just 0.67 percent of expenditures \u2014 well below the Government Finance Officers Association recommendation of 16.67 percent (equivalent to two months of spending). A city\u2019s general fund is roughly analogous to an individual\u2019s checking account.\n\nRelated: The Financial Health of All 50 States, Ranked\n\nNew York City also carries a very heavy debt burden. According to a report issued by City Comptroller Scott Stringer, New York\u2019s per capita debt greatly exceeds that of all other large U.S. cities, and is even 50 percent higher than that of Chicago. But the comptroller\u2019s report only focuses on bonded debt. Government financial accounting standards require cities to report other long-term obligations such as pensions, compensated absences for municipal employees (accrued sick and vacation leave payable at retirement) and \u201cother post-employment benefits\u201d (or OPEB).\n\nIt is New York\u2019s OPEB obligation that really sets the Big Apple apart. In 2015, the city\u2019s OPEB liability was $85 billion \u2014 roughly equivalent to its bonded debt.\n\nThe large OPEB liability is driven by the size of the city\u2019s workforce and the relatively high cost of health care in New York. According to its most recent OPEB Actuarial Report, the city is providing retiree health benefits to 222,000 retirees, while another 315,000 current and separated employees are potentially eligible for future benefits. In 2015, benefits per retiree ranged as high as $17,000 a year (for workers who were not yet Medicare-eligible and who had eligible dependents).\n\nHigh debt burdens and insufficient general fund reserves are associated with episodes of fiscal distress, which are marked by employee furloughs, layoffs and, in extreme cases, bond defaults and bankruptcy filings. Still, if New York City continues to record strong revenue growth, it can shoulder its sizeable obligations. With the stock market perking up in the aftermath of Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, the odds of a fiscal crisis in the near term appear long \u2014 but a bear market could place the city in jeopardy.\n\nRelated: Is Your State the Next Puerto Rico?\n\nSuch was the case back in 1933, when New York City briefly defaulted on its municipal bond debt. In the aftermath of the stock market crash and the Great Depression, city revenues declined amidst a rash of property tax delinquencies. The city faced a second fiscal meltdown in 1975, when the federal government refused to provide a bailout and the state declared a moratorium on certain city bond payments. Although the default occurred during another bear market, the proximate cause of the crisis was rising interest rates. At the time, the city relied heavily on short-term debt, which became more difficult and expensive to roll over as inflation spiked in the early 1970s.\n\nAside from New York and Chicago, three other cities received scores below 40: Reno, St. Louis and Toledo. All three of these cities had relatively small general fund balances and high debt burdens.\n\nOne Perfect Score\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, with a perfect score of 100, is Irvine, California \u2014 a rapidly growing \u201cedge city\u201d south of Los Angeles. Rising revenues have resulted in a series of budget surpluses that have bulked up the city\u2019s reserves. In 2015, the city reported over $700 million of cash and investments on its balance sheet, more than enough to fund two years of government spending. Irvine is also unique among large American cities in that it has no outstanding bond obligations. All municipal borrowing in Irvine is done by special districts, which levy supplemental taxes to service their debt.\n\nTwo cities in California\u2019s Inland Empire, Fontana and Moreno Valley, took the second and third spots. Both cities have modest debt loads and large general fund reserves.\n\nRelated: The Worst States for Retirement 2016\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nThese high-ranking cities are both located within a short drive from San Bernardino, which filed for bankruptcy protection in 2012. Their presence near the top of the list is testimony to California\u2019s economic recovery, but it also suggests that sound financial management practices make a difference. Although Fontana and Moreno Valley faced similar challenges to San Bernardino during the Great Recession, both of these cities avoided a fiscal crisis \u2013 apparently because officials showed greater discipline with respect to spending and borrowing.\n\nKeep in mind, though, that it is not necessary for a city to have a near-perfect score to be regarded as a good fiscal steward. Any score higher than 70 could reasonably be interpreted as a level of fiscal health sufficient to justify a triple-A credit rating.\n\nBankruptcies and Delinquencies\n\nThe universe of cities we analyzed includes three that filed for bankruptcy since the Great Recession: Stockton and San Bernardino, which filed in 2012, and Detroit which filed in 2013. Both Stockton and Detroit have emerged from bankruptcy, while San Bernardino is close to doing so. All three cities have scores in the middle of the pack. Detroit and Stockton benefited from court-mandated reductions in their debt, while San Bernardino has been running general fund surpluses during its extended time in bankruptcy.\n\nOf the 116 cities we analyzed, three had not published 2015 Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports by the end of 2016. One of them, Baltimore, will publish its 2015 CAFR in early 2017, which is quite late. Federal regulations require state and local governments that receive over $750,000 in federal funds to file audited financial statements no later than nine months after their fiscal year end. Since Baltimore\u2019s fiscal year ends on June 30, it should have filed its 2015 CAFR no later than March 31, 2016.\n\nSee the full ranking of 116 cities here.

Further, they are also unanimous in their belief that Russia did so with the express intention of harming Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and helping Donald Trump.\n\nRelated: Is Trump Headed for a Showdown With America\u2019s Spy Agencies?\n\nThe report is also very specific about what the three agencies did not try to do.\n\nOn the very first page of the report is this unambiguous statement: \u201cWe did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election. The US Intelligence Community is charged with monitoring and assessing the intentions, capabilities, and actions of foreign actors; it does not analyze US political processes or US public opinion.\u201d\n\nThat has not stopped Trump and his inner circle from brazenly and repeatedly claiming the exact opposite.\n\n\u201cIntelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results. Voting machines not touched!\u201d Trump tweeted on Saturday.\n\nRelated: Trump Sides with WikiLeaks\u2019 Assange Against US Intel Community\n\nOn Sunday, Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway appeared on several talk shows and discussed testimony that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper had delivered to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday.\n\nClapper, after making it plain that the Intelligence Community believes with absolute certainty that Russia interfered in the election to hurt Clinton and help Trump, was asked if the agencies had determined whether or not the effort was successful.\n\nHere\u2019s what Clapper said: \u201cThe intelligence community can\u2019t gauge the impact [Russia's efforts] had on the choices the electorate made.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how Conway characterized his testimony: \u201cMr. Clapper, in his testimony, made very clear on Thursday, under oath, that any attempt, any aspiration to influence our elections failed.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump and the GOP Are On a Collision Course over Russian Sanctions\n\nAlso on Sunday, Conway addressed the written report in which the intelligence agencies specifically said they were making no determination whatsoever about whether the hacks impacted the outcome of the election.\n\n\u201cThey did not succeed in throwing this election to Donald Trump,\u201d Conway said. \u201cThat is very clear in this report.\u201d\n\nThe thin reed that Conway and Trump appear to be grasping onto is the finding that there was no actual Russian hacking of the machines used to tally votes nationwide. But there is nobody claiming there was, and it beggars credibility to claim that that is the only way to influence the outcome of an election.\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who will serve as Trump\u2019s White House Chief of Staff, also made the rounds on Sunday. And while he didn\u2019t claim that the intelligence agencies found there was no impact, he did repeatedly contradict another of their specific findings.\n\nRelated: Trump Steps Up Effort to Discredit Sanctions Against Russia\n\nSpeaking with Chris Wallace on Fox News, he said that Trump accepts the general finding that Russia was hacking computers in the U.S. during the election, but characterized it as a run-of-the-mill piece of espionage.\n\n\u201cThis is something that's been going on in our elections for many, many years, both the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians. It happens every election period,\u201d he said. Priebus made similarly dismissive comments about the attacks in an interview on CBS later Sunday morning.\n\nBut that\u2019s exactly the opposite of how the intelligence agencies characterized Russia\u2019s interference in the November 8, 2016, election.\n\nThe attacks and leaks to the media, they said, represented \u201ca significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations.\u201d Further, they added, \u201cMoscow\u2019s use of disclosures during the U.S. election was unprecedented.\u201d\n\nRelated: Making Friends with Russia May Be Harder than Trump Seems to Think\n\nIn an appearance on Meet the Press, South Carolina Sen.

And while he may face some rude awakenings with regard to the demands -- and limits -- of the job, he won\u2019t be the only one coming to grips with unpleasant facts.\n\nSooner or later, Trump\u2019s voters are going to learn that a lot of the president-elect\u2019s campaign promises are not going to be kept, either because Congress won\u2019t allow it or because they were never really feasible in the first place.\n\nRelated: Air Force to Trump: Sorry, but the F-18 Can\u2019t Replace the F-35\n\nThe list of unlikely things Trump said he would do is a long one, but here are a few of the most high-profile campaign trail promises he made that he has either already backtracked on or will almost certainly be forced to abandon.\n\n1. Build a wall and make Mexico pay for it\n\nThis was Trump\u2019s go-to promise from the very beginning of the Republican primaries. Not only would he build a giant wall across the entire border between the United States and Mexico, he would also use his superior business skills to get the Mexican government to foot the bill.\n\nTrump\u2019s wall promise began to crumble before the campaign was even over, as he reluctantly admitted that the wall would actually be more of a fence in many places and that in others it would make sense to simply allow natural barriers to do the work.\n\nOn Friday, though, news broke that the Trump team plans to ask Congress to appropriate funds for the wall\u2019s construction, meaning that U.S. taxpayer dollars -- not pesos from Mexico City -- will be paying for it. Trump erupted on Twitter, writing \u201cThe dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!\u201d\n\nPeople who have been following Trump in the campaign have a pretty good idea by now what to expect when the president-elect promises something will happen \u201clater.\u201d (See: Tax returns, release of.)\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s What Americans Want Most to Hear from President Trump\n\n2. Mass deportations\n\nThe anti-immigrant animus of Trump\u2019s base of support was evident early and consistently throughout his campaign. Trump regularly fanned its flames with the promise of mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.\n\nHe suggested the formation of a \u201cdeportation force\u201d and repeatedly made vows such as this, from September 2015: \u201cI will get them out so fast that your head would spin, long before I even can start the wall,\" Trump said. \"They will be out of here. You know we have tremendous problems of crime.\"\n\nAt the time, he said he believed all of the undocumented immigrants could be out of the country within 18 months to two years.\n\nThis is never going to happen. Multiple experts have pointed out that it would require tens of thousands of deportations a day, every day, for two years. Even respecting only the most basic due process rights of prospective deportees would make this utterly impossible. And logistics aside, it\u2019s not likely the American people would countenance the wholesale rounding up and incarceration of families on suspicion of being undocumented.\n\n3. Congressional term limits\n\nThis one was never going to happen either. First of all, the Supreme Court has ruled Congressional term limits unconstitutional, meaning that creating them would require a constitutional amendment. And unless Trump calls a constitutional convention, which hasn\u2019t happened since 1787, that amendment would have to go through Congress. Trump is simply not going to get members of Congress to pass a law that puts them out of a job.\n\nRelated: Trump Wants a Much Bigger Navy: Here\u2019s How Much It\u2019ll Cost\n\n\u201cI would say we have term limits now,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters after Trump was chosen as the next president. \u201cThey\u2019re called elections. And it will not be on the agenda in the Senate.\u201d\n\n4. Lock her up!\n\nThroughout the campaign, Trump regularly called Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton a criminal and suggested that she would face investigation by law enforcement if he were elected president. This led to the fantasy among many his supporters of seeing Clinton in a prison jumpsuit, and loud chants of \u201cLock her up! Lock her up!\u201d at Trump rallies.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Trump to let his supporters down on this one. Within days of winning the election, he made it plain that he had no interest in pursuing Clinton for the vast array of crimes he accused her of during the campaign.\n\n5. Drain the swamp\n\nTrump promised to root out crony capitalism and to diminish the influence of Wall Street on Washington once he entered the White House. At his rallies, he promised to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d a phrase that entered his supporters\u2019 repertoire of rally chants, along with \u201cBuild the wall!\u201d and \u201cLock her up!\u201d\n\nBut from the look of Trump\u2019s cabinet nominations and his set of close advisers, all those people in \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats may as well have spent their time chanting \u201cGoldman Sachs! Goldman Sachs!\u201d\n\nTrump has hired billionaires, campaign donors and current and former Wall Street bankers to staff his administration, leading to many jokes about how his version of draining the swamp looks more like gentrifying it with a better class of alligators.\n\nThat Trump can\u2019t and won\u2019t keep his campaign promises really ought not to surprise anybody, given the vast amount of evidence that was presented during the campaign about his willingness to back out of deals, abandon partners and stiff creditors. But it probably will nonetheless."}, {"date": "2017/01/08", "title": "Here's the GOP's 2017 New Year\u2019s Resolution: Avoid Self-Inflicted Wounds", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/08/Heres-GOPs-2017-New-Year-s-Resolution-Avoid-Self-Inflicted-Wounds", "text": "Republicans in Washington began their era of total control over the levers of power by stepping on a rake. In a secret vote last week, the Republican conference in the House of Representatives decided to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics, igniting a firestorm of public opposition that forced them into an embarrassing retreat on the very first day of the 115th Congress.\n\nAs political miscalculations go, it was a doozy. That day, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham called it \u201cthe dumbest fricking thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d\n\nRelated: Seven Tests That Can Keep Republicans from Screwing Up\n\nThe question for Republicans now is whether they\u2019ve learned something from the experience or not. The party has a history, in recent years, of treating control of some or all of the nation\u2019s policymaking apparatus as an opportunity to enact massive changes that don\u2019t always have the level of public support that they seem to believe.\n\nGovernment shutdowns are an obvious example. As Newt Gingrich in 1995 and Ted Cruz in 2013 both learned, holding the entire federal government hostage to a narrow political goal is frowned upon by the majority of Americans.\n\nIn 2005, fresh off his reelection victory and looking at Republican majorities in the House and Senate, George W. Bush rolled out privatization of Social Security as his top domestic priority. It was beaten back amid howls of public protest and helped Democrats take over both houses of Congress just two years later.\n\nWhether The 115th Congress and President Trump will overreach politically in the coming years is, obviously, not yet known. But there will be plenty of opportunities. Here are a few areas where Republicans should scan the ground for more rakes before rushing forward.\n\nRelated: Most Americans Don\u2019t Want to Repeal Obamacare: Here\u2019s What They Want Instead\n\nObamacare Repeal\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 call for repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act during the 2016 campaign clearly was a smart political tactic that paid off big dividends in the November election. But in their haste to make that one of their first orders of business, congressional leaders and President-elect Donald Trump are moving into politically treacherous and largely uncharted waters.\n\nWith the possible exception of some of the changes in the 1996 welfare reform law, Congress has never before dismantled a major social service or health care program in modern times. For sure, Obamacare was plagued from the beginning by operational and financial problems, overpromising by President Obama, and faulty business models that ended up driving major insurers out of the market and driving up premiums and copayments for consumers.\n\nBut the four-year-old subsidized healthcare insurance system that Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) denounce as a \u201cdisaster\u201d and \u201cfailed partisan experiment\u201d has extended first-time coverage to 20 million Americans through subsidized private insurance policies and expanded Medicaid in 31 states and the District of Columbia. It has also raised the standards of coverage in most policies, helped bend the national health care cost curve, provided added relief to rural hospitals and created a bonanza of new business for many insurers, hospitals and medical facilities, pharmaceutical companies and others.\n\nEven without a suitable replacement in hand after years of attacking the Affordable Care Act, Republicans are on track to use special budget \u201creconciliation\u201d rules to ram through a resolution in the coming months that would pull much of the Obamacare program up by the roots.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Could Push Rural Hospitals to the Brink\n\nYet surveys show that Americans are more interested in Congress fixing Obamacare than replacing it with an entirely new program. And for all their complaints about President Obama\u2019s signature health insurance plan, most of the major players in the healthcare world are warning that the GOP strategy will lead to major financial losses for insurers and hospitals and the loss of coverage for millions of Americans.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, GOP political allies including the American Medical Association (AMA) and Republican governors whose states expanded Medicaid under Obamacare are pressuring Congress to postpone the repeal legislation until a feasible substitute is in hand.\n\nGOP leaders have shrugged off the warnings and insist that rapid action is essential in order for Trump and the congressional Republicans to make good on their political promises to voters. Yet already there are tiny fissures developing within the GOP over strategy. Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Bob Corker of Tennessee are all raising concerns about repealing Obamacare without a replacement and other issues related to the fiscal 2017 budget resolution being used as the main vehicle.\n\nRelated: Could Rand Paul End Up Saving Obamacare?\n\nSpending and the Debt\n\nTrump once boasted that he could retire the nearly $20 trillion national debt in eight years through his tax cuts, budget savings and renegotiated trade deals with China, Mexico and Canada.\n\nYet throughout the 2016 presidential campaign, he sought to overshadow Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton with promises of massive tax cuts, $1 trillion of new infrastructure investment, a military buildup, affordable child care and family leave benefits.\n\nRepublicans have long prided themselves as the party of fiscal conservatism and balanced budgets. But in the early going of the new Congress, Trump and the GOP seem to be prepared to break the bank in pursuit of Trump\u2019s ambitious agenda. Even before taking office as president, Trump has expanded on his government spending ambitions, boasting that he was prepared to renew a costly nuclear arms race with Russia, China and other nuclear powers.\n\nLate last week, Politico reported that Trump\u2019s team and Republican lawmakers are considering adding funds to a must-pass spending bill this spring to help finance his plans to build a wall along the southern border after concluding that Trump can\u2019t make good on a major campaign pledge to force Mexico to pay for it. That idea alone would add billions of dollars to the government appropriations bills in the coming years.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Is a Fiscal Minefield for the GOP\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget calculates that when taken together, Trump\u2019s tax and spending promises \u2013 including his pledge to boost military spending and make cuts in non-defense discretionary programs-- would drive up the debt to 105 percent of GDP within a decade, or one of the highest levels since World War II.\n\nBut that analysis didn\u2019t include the cost of a major increase in highway, bridge and other infrastructure spending because Trump\u2019s advisers have yet to figure out how to finance it. And the long term economic and budgetary impact of the Republicans\u2019 drive to repeal and replace Obamacare are still open to conjecture.\n\nRepublicans are hijacking the fiscal 2017 budget resolution to use as the vehicle for dismantling much of Obamacare. While all eyes are focused on the political fight over repealing Obamacare, there has been little discussion about the spending and deficit numbers that Republicans have plugged in as place holders until Congress can fully turn its attention to spending levels later this year, when a second resolution will be offered to members.\n\nSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky is one of the few Republicans who has made an issue of this tactic, urging fiscal conservatives in the House and Senate to balk at approving a budget resolution repealing Obamacare that on the surface, at least, allows the debt to rise by $9.7 trillion in the coming decade because of major tax cuts and spending increases. \u201cIt should be a conservative document that should not add $9.7 trillion to the debt over ten years,\u201d Paul told reporters late last week after meeting with two dozen conservative House Republicans who belong to the Freedom Caucus.\n\nRelated: Trump Wants a Much Bigger Navy: Here\u2019s How Much It\u2019ll Cost\n\nBixby, the Concord Coalition official and deficit hawk, calls all of this \u201cvery concerning\u201d for fiscal conservatives.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of chickens coming home to roost here,\u201d he said in an interview Friday. \u201cA lot of campaign promises were made and they didn\u2019t add up. And now that we\u2019re heading into budget season, lawmakers and the new administration are trying to perform some fiscal alchemy here to make it all work.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe tough things for Republicans is that a lot of them are beginning to realize that they are faced with either scaling back substantially some of their campaign promises or scaling back their concern about the debt,\u201d he added. \u201cThe tension we are seeing now is whether they can accommodate big spending plans and a big tax cut and still go to their constituents with a straight face and say they\u2019re worried about the debt.\u201d\n\nSocial Issues\n\nThere are many, many Americans who are extremely socially conservative, and they are already cheering an effort by Republican lawmakers to shoehorn language that strips all federal funding from Planned Parenthood into the budget bill repealing Obamacare. But a Congress that dedicates itself to the agenda of social conservatives will likely find itself at odds with a broader American electorate that is increasingly less concerned about such issues.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s What Americans Want Most to Hear from President Trump\n\nPlanned Parenthood is just one example, but it\u2019s a good one. Poll after poll after poll has shown that the organization, which provides health care services to women around the country, many of whom might not be able to access reproductive care otherwise, is extremely popular.\n\nWith Republicans in charge of both the White House and the Senate, the possibility of manufacturing a Supreme Court majority to overturn Roe v. Wade, clearing the way to make abortion illegal, is another near-term goal for social conservatives. And while doing so would make a portion of the Republican electorate rapturously happy, it would be extraordinarily unpopular among the majority of Americans.\n\nSo would laws rolling back protections for LGBTQ Americans. While gay marriage and anti-discrimination laws remain a flashpoint for the religious right, the rest of the United States has, for the most part, moved on.

Just 37 percent wanted to repeal and replace it as the Republicans have vowed to do.\n\nRelated: Could Rand Paul End Up Saving Obamacare?\n\nNot surprisingly, views differ sharply between Republican and Democratic voters, reflecting the larger political divide throughout the country and in Washington. Seventy-one percent of Republicans told Gallup they disapprove of the law and want it repealed, while 59 percent of Democrats want to keep it with significant changes.\n\nTaken together, the findings suggest a national unease among Americans over GOP leaders\u2019 determination to pass a budget resolution in the coming weeks that would repeal President Obama\u2019s signature national health insurance program that \u2013 for all its flaws \u2013 has provided coverage to more than 20 million Americans in recent years.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) have joined Trump in denouncing Obamacare as irredeemable. They have vowed rapid legislative action in the coming weeks and months to repeal the law, even while the party is far from a consensus on replacement legislation.\n\n\u201cObamacare is a disaster,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cInsurance markets are collapsing. Premiums are soaring. Patients\u2019 choices are dwindling. The law has failed to deliver on its core promises, hurting far more than it is helping.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Could Push Rural Hospitals to the Brink\n\nGOP leaders, for now, intend to repeal the program by the spring while setting the effective date a year or two down the road while Republican lawmakers hammer out a comprehensive alternative program that depends on more on market forces than government intervention and subsidies.\n\nYet that strategy is being met with opposition from insurers, hospitals and doctors, drug companies, consumer advocates and even many Republican governors who fear chaos and a collapse of Obamacare while the Republicans struggle to map out a new approach.\n\nJust this week, the American Medical Association (AMA), the premier physician organization, wrote a letter to Republican leaders warning against jeopardizing the health care coverage of millions of Americans by abruptly repealing Obamacare without a suitable replacement. And Republican Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan hailed the success of his state\u2019s expansion of Medicaid that was made possible by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA dozen moderate Democratic senators, including Tim Kaine of Virginia, Clinton\u2019s vice presidential running mate, wrote to the GOP leadership yesterday urging them to slow down and work with them to draft changes to the existing law to address concerns such as soaring premium and onerous taxes and mandates.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Is a Fiscal Minefield for the GOP\n\n\u201cThere is so much we can immediately improve, but by pushing an immediate repeal through a partisan budget process, we won\u2019t have the opportunity to work together to build on that common ground,\u201d Kaine said, according to The New York Times.\n\nG. William Hoagland, a vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former Senate Republican budget expert, said that the Republicans are still caught up in their campaign slogans and enthusiasm and aren\u2019t being pragmatic. However, reality will begin to set in when House and Senate committees begin stitching together the specific budget instructions to dismantle Obamacare, and many divisive issues rise to the surface, he said.\n\nRelated: Republicans Are Having Second Thoughts About Scrapping Obamacare Taxes\n\n\u201cCampaign rhetoric is one thing and legislating is another thing,\u201d Hoagland said in an interview Friday. \u201cAnd I think the word \u2018repeal\u2019 is maybe being overused here by the Republicans \u2013 even before President-elect Trump is sworn in. What people are really talking about is amending the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nHoagland, a health care policy expert, suggested that there is plenty of room for bipartisan compromise on changes to Obamacare, including adding Trump\u2019s proposals for lowering barriers to interstate sales of health insurance and the establishment of health care savings accounts. The biggest sticking point between Republicans and Democrats will be over how to subsidize health care costs for low-income Americans through the federal tax code and whether to make coverage mandatory or voluntary.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act mandates uninsured Americans to acquire coverage or pay the penalty. Ryan and others say their goal is to replace Obamacare with a law that guarantees \u201cuniversal access\u201d to health care coverage, but not necessarily to force everyone to be covered. Ryan yesterday declined to speculate on whether the 20 million or more Americans currently receiving coverage under the Affordable Care Act would continue to receive coverage under the GOP approach.\n\nThere is another obstacle for the Republicans in completely reinventing a national health insurance program: the cost. Blowing up Obamacare and starting from scratch would be a very costly enterprise. A complete repeal would include getting rid of a dozen major tax provisions that help underwrite the program\u2019s operating costs.\n\nRelated: GOP and Dem Governors Are Closing Ranks Against Obamacare Repeal\n\nBefore the election, the Congressional Budget Office projected that Obamacare operating costs would total $1.24 trillion between 2019 and 2026. There is compelling evidence that if the Republicans scrap all of the Obamacare taxes, they could raise at most $850 billion of the total required cost through a number of budgetary and tax policy maneuvers, according to a recent Brookings Institution analysis.\n\nFor these and other reasons, Hoagland says he could imagine a bipartisan deal next summer or fall that would retain the basic framework of Obamacare while layering in GOP provisions and innovations.

In an interview reported on Thursday by DefenseNews, Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said, \u201cThe Air Force does not view the F/A-18 and the F-35 to be substitutable at all.

Referring to the F-18, she said, \u201cIt's a fine aircraft, it's a different aircraft, it does not fulfill the same requirements ... It's a little bit apples and oranges and I have to believe before any final decision would be made with respect to a final shift, the chief requirements officer would be consulted.\u201d\n\nOthers were not as diplomatic.

Freedom Caucus members are universally opposed to Obamacare and have long called for its repeal.

However, he declined to commit when asked if the Republican plan would allow everyone covered through Obamacare to remain insured.\n\nAn aide to the Senate Budget Committee agreed with Ryan that the fiscal 2018 budget will be a comprehensive plan \u201cthat will put our fiscal house in order.\u201d He added that, the current budget resolution would at least provide $2 billion in savings for deficit reduction. \u201cAnd we know repeal will generate a lot more savings, according to the Congressional Budget Office,\u201d he added."}, {"date": "2017/01/06", "title": "Trump\u2019s Job No. 1:  Recoup the Jobs, Wages and Security Lost to Trade Deals ", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/01/06/Trump-s-Job-No-1-Recoup-Jobs-Wages-and-Security-Lost-Trade-Deals", "text": "President-elect Trump\u2019s choice of Robert Lighthizer as his special trade representative, announced Tuesday afternoon, completes the first string of the new administration\u2019s trade team. So it\u2019s time to draw a couple of clear conclusions.\n\nConclusion No. 1: Trump is a dead-serious hawk on trade questions\u2014all in for everything he promised on the campaign trail. Prominent among these promises is a remake of economic relations with China and a halt to the southward drain of American jobs\u2014\u201cthe giant sucking sound,\u201d as Ross Perot put it during his 1992 presidential run\u2014to Mexico.\n\nRelated: Trump Completes His Trade Triumvirate with Former Reagan Hand\n\nConclusion No. 2: Trump\u2019s trade hawks have three alternatives: They can learn on the job and backtrack on the campaign pledges, they can limit themselves to jawboning and gestures, or they can sustain bloody noses.\n\nThere is one other possibility: Trump\u2019s trade team can make an unholy mess of the U.S.\u2013China relationship altogether if they take their animus too far and disputes spill into already-fraught security questions.\n\nWhat Trump will not be able to do, for better or worse, is fundamentally alter the structure of U.S.\u2013China trade or Mexico\u2019s role as a low-cost manufacturing platform. Encouraged by the U.S. in the first place, too many people here and there benefit from these arrangements to alter them now.\n\nLighthizer, a protectionist from way back, has a decades-long record as a China-basher. When he served as President Reagan\u2019s deputy S.T.R. in the 1980s, Japan was Public Enemy No. 1 and Lighthizer\u2019s office wielded threats of import quotas and punitive tariffs\u2014the latter now prominent on Trump\u2019s menu.\n\nRelated: What a Trade War With China Could Do to the Economy\n\nLighthizer joins Wilbur Ross, commerce secretary-designate, and a practiced hand at Rust Belt salvage jobs, and Peter Navarro, head of the newly created National Trade Council and another hard-liner on trade.

Trump\u2019s on the record opposing the sweeping trade deals negotiated under Presidents Clinton and Obama, and they\u2019re both vulnerable to one or another degree.\n\nObama\u2019s Trans\u2013Pacific Partnership, ambitious to a fault and structured in secret by the corporations that would have benefited from it, is all but a dead letter already. Clinton\u2019s North American Free Trade Agreement\u2014 Trump called it \u201cthe single worst trade deal ever approved in this country\u201d during the debates last year\u2014is plainly in Trump\u2019s sights.\n\nOn this score Trump is right. Even the Mexicans now acknowledge NAFTA simply hasn\u2019t delivered many of its promised benefits. As to the TTP, look at it carefully\u2014to the extent one can\u2014and it is less a trade deal than a sweeping deregulation regime that will prove as much a letdown as its predecessor.\n\nRelated: Why GOP Leaders Are Balking at Trump\u2019s Call for Punitive Tariffs\n\nTrump\u2019s pulling a Ross Perot act, in effect\u2014saying the unsayable.

It won\u2019t do\u2014as Trump\u2019s stunning victory last November 8 has just advised us.\n\nScrapping the TTP will actually do relations with Beijing some good, given the Obama administration wielded it as an economic weapon intended to isolate the Chinese. As to NAFTA, Team Trump will have to limit its ambitions to adjustments, and even those that are justified are likely to prove hard to make.\n\nThe big problem with Trump\u2019s aggressive position on China is very simple: China\u2019s not the problem. America\u2019s traditional short-sightedness is the problem.\n\nWhen Deng Xiaoping\u2019s reforms unleashed pent-up energies in the early 1980s, U.S. companies piled in big time. Here was a low-wage production platform from which they could export to developed markets, including their own. Complex supply chains and multiple-site assembly operations now make a very dense weave.\n\nRelated: Trump Will Be Steadier on China Than His Taiwan Call May Suggest\n\nAmericans did the same thing in Japan after the 1945 victory, and by the 1980s\u2014Lighthizer\u2019s time in the Reagan administration\u2014the strategy was biting U.S. companies on their backsides. Imbalances in the economic relationship with China are nothing more than a not-quite-instant replay of earlier events across the Pacific.\n\nThe lessons then are the lessons now.\n\nFirst, Washington can ask the Chinese to make ameliorating adjustments at the margins, but China will never abandon its fundamental growth strategy, which is to export into prosperity while the domestic market begins to mature.\n\nSecond, America has to make the serious adjustments. China\u2019s economic rise has cost the U.S. jobs while treating the American workforce with benign neglect. The government invested too little in education and compensatory retraining programs, to name two.\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting, we\u2019re sending overseas a lot of the higher-tech jobs workers who lost their jobs to Deng\u2019s reforms.

Millions more obtained expanded Medicaid coverage for low-income adults in rural states that opted into the program under Obamacare.\n\nRelated: Republicans Are Having Second Thoughts About Scrapping Obamacare Taxes\n\nNow the government-run health insurance exchanges and the expanded Medicaid program are on the chopping block on Capitol Hill, along with a third lesser known but highly important prescription drug discount program that is vital to the operation of more than a thousand rural hospitals.\n\nTucked away in the fine print of the ACA is a provision that obliges major drug companies to provide deep discounts to rural hospitals and other health care providers under the \u201c340B\u201d program first enacted by Congress in 1992. That law was originally designed to provide low-cost drugs to \u201csocial safety net\u201d medical facilities operating in economically distressed regions of the country.\n\nIn drafting the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration and congressional Democrats specifically targeted 340B to hospitals in rural areas. The ACA designated 1,100 rural hospitals eligible for 340B coverage. Those facilities subsequently extracted major discounts from pharmaceutical companies for medicine used in treating outpatients who qualified for Medicaid.\n\nAccording to a report by Morning Consult, the 340B program is critical to the operation of many rural facilities because the drug cost savings can be used to fund essential medical services for their communities, such as emergency rooms, as well as sharply reducing the cost of medicine for indigent patients.\n\nRelated: GOP and Dem Governors Are Closing Ranks Against Obamacare Repeal\n\nFor example, the Cass County Memorial Hospital in Atlantic, Iowa, uses some of its 340B program savings to help fund the hospital\u2019s Behavioral Health Unit, which is one of only two critical access hospitals in the entire state that offers psychiatric services. At the same time, the RiverView Health facility in Crookston, Minn., has used savings from drug purchases to recruit orthopedic surgeons and oncology specialists, according to the report.\n\nMorgan, the rural health association official, said that most rural hospitals have been \u201cjust operating on a break-even margin or at a loss in certain cases,\u201d and can\u2019t afford to lose any income source or coverage.\n\n\u201cTo be able to have these deep drug discounts was a great way to assure that access remained in the community,\u201d he said. \u201cThe 340B provision doesn\u2019t require that the savings be passed on to the community, but it\u2019s just common practice that this form of discounting is going on.\u201d\n\nThe loss of subsidized health insurance, expanded Medicaid for low-income people and the 340B mandate taken together would have a devastating impact on the remaining rural hospitals, Morgan warned.\n\n\u201cIf Congress were to proceed with an outright repeal with no replacement whatsoever, and they just ended these programs altogether, that would be the triple whammy,\u201d he said."}, {"date": "2017/01/05", "title": "Is Trump Headed for a Showdown With America\u2019s Spy Agencies?", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/05/Trump-Headed-Showdown-America-s-Spy-Agencies", "text": "How incoming president Donald Trump will interact with the U.S. Intelligence Community is an increasingly urgent question given the threats that the nation and its interests face from terrorists and unfriendly state actors.

Since the summer, when the various agencies got together and released a statement asserting their agreement that the Russian government was responsible for cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and top Democratic operatives, Trump has been dismissive and antagonistic about the nation\u2019s spy agencies.\n\nHe also tapped retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, a man with a notoriously difficult relationship with top intelligence officials, to be his National Security Advisor. Flynn was forced out of his job running the Defense Intelligence Agency by current DNI James Clapper, and has since become a full-throated critic of the IC as it exists today. Flynn also accepted payment for an appearance in Russia from the state propaganda network, RT, and was seated next to President Vladimir Putin at a celebratory dinner.\n\nWhen the IC went a step further and clarified that the agencies believe the Russian hacking was aimed at helping Trump during the election, the president-elect denied that the report was accurate, and slammed the CIA in particular for its mistaken claim in the early years of the George W. Bush administration that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Trump tweeted his displeasure with the IC again, writing, \u201cThe \u2018Intelligence\u2019 briefing on so-called \u2018Russian hacking\u2019 was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case.

The intelligence chiefs said that the IC stands behind its determination that Russia was involved in the hacks and that the operation was directed at the highest levels of the Kremlin.\n\nClapper, who will retire in just over two weeks, suggested that Trump\u2019s attacks on the IC had gone beyond the realm of healthy skepticism into \u201cdisparagement\u201d and said that he has been contacted by counterparts in other countries expressing concern about the president-elect\u2019s apparent disdain for the work done by intelligence professionals.\n\nRogers said that he was concerned about losing talented staff who may decide not to work for a Trump administration if they believe that their work is not respected and their conclusions dismissed without any consideration.\n\nRelated: Trump Steps Up Effort to Discredit Sanctions Against Russia\n\nAll this comes as Trump is reportedly refusing his daily intelligence briefings, meeting instead with briefers once a week or so, and has yet to name a replacement for Clapper.\n\nThat job could be tough to fill. Spicer\u2019s insistence that there is no shake-up of the DNI position in the works sounded definitive, but Trump\u2019s willingness to change directions at a moment\u2019s notice, and the emergence of multiple power centers within the nascent administration make it difficult to know what his real plans are.\n\nOn top of that uncertainty, the new DNI would be responsible for riding herd on the 16 different agencies that make up the Intelligence Community, many of which are reportedly suffering serious morale problems in the wake of the incoming president\u2019s attacks on them.\n\nHis top pick is reported to be retired Indiana Sen. Dan Coats, who until the end of the previous Congress served on the Senate Intelligence Committee, but no formal announcement has yet been made.\n\nThe job may be less attractive today than it looked when Coats visited Trump Tower in Manhattan last November.

President-elect Donald Trump drew a line in the sand. \u201cWon\u2019t happen,\u201d he said on Twitter. If North Korea attempts to test an ICBM, the United States has a number of options to stop it. All carry risks.\n\nTrump\u2019s red line mirrored past statements from policymakers. Ten years ago, future Defense Secretary Ash Carter and former Defense Secretary William Perry wrote, \u201cShould the United States allow a country [North Korea] openly hostile to it and armed with nuclear weapons to perfect an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of delivering nuclear weapons to U.S. soil? We believe not.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump Plays War Games on Twitter, and Americans Are Getting Worried\n\nHow close is North Korea to an actual nuclear ballistic missile and what are the president\u2019s military and policy options? Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nNorth Korea is researching a variety of missiles that with research and development could be converted into ICBMs. In February, North Korea launched a satellite into orbit aboard its 28-meter, three-stage Unha rocket.\n\n\u201cSeveral U.S. four-star commanders have said North Korea has, or we must assume they have, the ability to reach the continental U.S. with a nuclear warhead with the Taepo Dong (Unha) missile,\u201d said Bruce Klinger, an analyst with the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank. The Unha has a range of 10,000 kilometers, sufficient to hit the United States. Klinger argues that the range might be closer to 13,000 kilometers, enough to reach the East Coast.\n\nBut shooting a satellite into space is a different feat of physics than demonstrating an ICBM, which must re-enter the earth\u2019s atmosphere along a controlled and precise trajectory to its target.\n\n\u201cThe Unha-2 or -3 could serve as a springboard for the development of an ICBM, but the history of long-range missile development by other countries, including the Soviet Union, the United States, China, and France, indicates that satellite launch activities have limited impact on missile programs. No country has converted a satellite launch rocket into a long-range ballistic missile,\u201d according to Michael Elleman and Emily Werk of the Arms Control Association.\n\nA more likely candidate for a near-term ICBM test is the 16-meter-long KN-08 ballistic missile. It can be launched via a truck platform, making it harder to hit with a pre-emptive strike. It currently has a documented range of about 6,700 km, due to fuel limitations. In April 2016, North Korea unveiled photos of an engine test that purported to show a new rocket engine capable, potentially, of sending a nuclear warhead to the United States.\n\nRelated: China Just Gave Trump a 999-Foot-Long Middle Finger\n\n\u201cUsing this technology, North Korea\u2019s road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the KN-08 or the KN-14 modification, could deliver a nuclear warhead to targets at a distance of 10,000 to 13,000 km. That range, greater than had previously been expected, could allow Pyongyang to reach targets on the U.S. east coast, including New York or Washington,\u201d John Schelling wrote in April on the blog of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. \u201cIf the current ground test program continues and is successful, flight tests of a North Korean ICBM could begin in as little as a year. Moreover, Pyongyang may be able to deploy this delivery system in a limited operational capability by 2020.\u201d\n\nThe second component needed for a nuclear missile is a miniaturized warhead. On Tuesday, State Department spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. does not believe that North Korea has a weapon small enough to fit atop ICBM. But that may be little more than a temporary state of affairs.\n\nAt a Defense One event in November, Adm. Harry Harris, commander of U.S. Pacific Command, said, \u201cI have to assume that they have it\u2026I believe it when Kim Jong Un expresses his intent.\u201d\n\nCounter Strategies\n\nSo how do you make sure the test \u201cwon\u2019t happen?\u201d On the one hand, you could launch a coordinated airstrike, sending jets or bombers over North Korea to destroy the missile on the launch pad as it is about to take off. But that carries risks of triggering a rocket retaliation against South Korea, risking massive casualties.\n\n\u201cThe reason why the U.S. didn\u2019t do what Carter and Perry had suggested [in 2006] of course, was we were concerned that if we did that, North Korea would probably shell Seoul with artillery. That was an unacceptable escalation,\u201d said RAND Corporation\u2019s Bruce Bennett.\n\nOnce an ICBM is launched, here are the options to stop it. To protect the continental U.S., the United States has 30 ground-based interceptor missiles in Fort Greely, Alaska, and Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Doesn\u2019t Stand a Chance of Shutting Down the $400 Billion F-35 Project\n\nThe United States is working to deploy other anti-missile systems, such as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD system, but those are designed to intercept shorter-ranged missiles.\n\nThe \u201cTHAAD battery is designed to intercept their medium-range missiles like the No-dong missile and the Musudan missile, if fired at South Korea. The THAAD missiles have a range of only 200 kilometers, and that battery would be put close to Busan, so they can\u2019t even really cover Seoul with that battery, let alone something flying out over the Pacific,\u201d said Bennett. South Korea long has expressed interest in an anti-rocket defense system similar to Israel\u2019s Iron Dome, but has not bought that system or fielded such protection.\n\nThe United States also has Aegis BMD-equipped ships in the Pacific armed with Standard missiles capable of intercepting medium-range ballistic missiles. But \u201cthese aren\u2019t designed for intercontinental-range missiles,\u201d said one Defense Department official. The Aegis system is designed primarily to protect ships, not shoot down ICBMs.\n\n\u201cSome of these ships are based in Europe as part of a NATO missile defense system. Some of them are based in the Pacific as part of a defense system for our allies. There\u2019s also a terminal defense system in Guam that\u2019s designed to defend Guam. These things exist; there are capabilities. But for an ICBM, obviously the major concern of an ICBM is defending against a sufficiently long-range threat, which would be the homeland, right? You wouldn\u2019t use an ICBM if you were North Korea trying to attack Japan, it\u2019s too close, doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d said the official.\n\nIt may make sense from a resource perspective, but does show Trump\u2019s red line to be difficult to enforce.\n\nKill It With Lasers\n\nThe military has shown that it can take down ballistic missiles with laser-armed planes, going back to 1983. Today, the Missile Defense Agency is researching new methods for stopping an ICBM before it hits the air. Lasers are still the most attractive option. \u201cOne of the options available to us that we are going to start testing here in the next couple years is a laser aboard a unmanned vehicle, [or drone] something that has some level of persistence that can be in the area and could engage when the missile is at its most easily targetable, but that\u2019s some ways off,\u201d said the official, referring to the low power laser demonstrator program.\n\nThe program follows the airborne laser program, or ABL. \u201cWe have proven that capability, so now the idea is if we can make it small enough and powerful enough and have a UAV with sufficient dwell capability, we would be able to keep them in some numbers over an area,\u201d said the official.\n\nUnlike ABL, the low-power demonstrator would use a safer, more energy-saving solid state laser rather than a chemical laser.\n\nA laser-armed drone flying over North Korea could easier to deploy than an airstrike, and damage could be limited to the missile itself. And it still risks North Korean retaliation against U.S. allies in the region. Until then, the United States has a number of non-violent policy responses.\n\n\u201cThere is still much that can be done against North Korea and, through third-party sanctions, foreign entities that facilitate North Korea\u2019s prohibited programs,\u201d said Klinger. \u201cRather than initiating an attack on North Korea for crossing yet another technological threshold, it would be more prudent to reserve a preemptive attack for when the Intelligence Community has strong evidence of imminent strategic nuclear attack on the U.S. or its allies. Similarly, a lone North Korean missile on a test flight aimed only at open water does not pose an imminent or existential threat to the United States. Intercepting such a flight, as some have advocated, would redirect international focus and anger away from another North Korean violation of UN resolutions and instead to the U.S. military action.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared on Defense One.

Asked what they want Trump to focus on most when he delivers his inaugural address on January 20, 75 percent of American voters said keeping manufacturing jobs in the U.S. and bringing jobs back from overseas.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, 52 percent said they want to hear the new president discuss his threats of slapping tariffs on imported goods made in China and Mexico.\n\nWhile many voters are eager for him to speak out on issues that dominated the campaign, including immigration reform, building a wall along the southern border and temporarily banning Muslims from entering the country, the nation also yearns to hear conciliatory rhetoric from the new 45th president of the United States.\n\nRelated: Senate Dems Plan to Slam the Brakes on Trump\u2019s Cabinet\n\nSeventy-four percent of the 2,000 voters surveyed December 28 and 29 said they want to hear from Trump on the importance of healing the country after one of the dirtiest and most divisive presidential campaigns of modern times. A sizeable majority (62 percent) also said it was important for Trump to talk about his plans for selecting a new Supreme Court justice to succeed the late conservative jurist Antonin Scalia.\n\nVoters are also interested in hearing from Trump on several issues that he may not want to talk about.\n\nThose include the real estate mogul\u2019s efforts to separate himself from his family business interests to avoid a conflict of interest, and revelations of Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, which Trump has repeatedly scoffed at. Fifty-three percent would like to hear about the hacking and 61 percent are keenly interested in the billionaire\u2019s potential conflicts of interest.\n\nBut those voters interviewed were most interested in jobs, and presumably what Trump has in mind to fulfill his promises.\n\nSince winning the election November 8, Trump has focused on preserving or bolstering manufacturing jobs in the U.S. Through a series of tweets and off-handed comments, Trump has aggressively jawboned the auto industry and other manufacturers into keeping some jobs in this country or bringing them back from Mexico and overseas.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Needs to Take the Economy More Seriously\n\nThose efforts ranged from persuading an Indiana air conditioning and heating manufacturer to keep 800 jobs in the state that were slated for transfer to Mexico to badgering Ford Motor Co. to jettison plans this week to build a $1.6 billion small-car factory in Mexico.\n\nTrump is spoiling for more run-ins with U.S. corporations that operate overseas and import their products back here, or that are considering plans to move more jobs overseas. And he is promising hard-edged bargaining with China, Mexico and other trading partners to lower overseas obstacles to U.S. products by threatening retaliatory import duties and tariffs.\n\nTrump\u2019s choice of attorney Robert Lighthizer as the U.S. Trade Representative, billionaire businessman Wilbur Ross as Commerce Secretary and economist Peter Navarro as the head of a new government trade council, will bring together three veteran trade experts who share Trump\u2019s determination to shake up the international trade scene to the advantage of the U.S.\n\nHouse Republicans have drafted a border tax plan to discourage imports, according to The Wall Street Journal.

If this were an external threat to our national security, we would bolster our national defense. If this were a foreseeable natural disaster, we would harden our infrastructure to mitigate that risk.\u201d\n\nAs evidence, he cites the Government Accountability Office, which found that the debt limit fight in 2011 resulted in Treasury\u2019s borrowing costs increasing by between $1 billion and $1.7 billion. Those costs, he noted, \u201care ultimately borne by the taxpayer because Treasury will be making higher interest payments, which ultimately must be funded through higher taxes.\u201d\n\nThe repeated threats of default on the debt, he said, are also \u201ca clear risk that could result in an unacceptable threat to the health of our financial system.\u201d Countless investors around the world rely on US Treasury securities as an effectively risk-free asset. Treasury holdings undergird mutual funds, retirement plans, and the holdings of banks and insurance firms. Certainty about their safety and value not only keeps borrowing costs low but provides assurance about the safety and soundness of the financial system as a whole.\n\nIn Congress, battles over the debt limit are frequently cast as a fight against government spending. But, as Lew points out when the time comes to borrow money to pay federal obligations, the question of how much money the government is going to spend has already been settled, by Congress itself.\n\nRelated: Trump Picks a Leading Deficit Hawk to Run the White House Budget Office\n\n\u201c[W]hen the bills for expenditures already authorized by Congress come due, they must be paid, and these bills are not an abstraction; they are the salaries of our troops, benefits for our veterans and retirees, and payments to hospitals for providing care, not to mention turning on the lights for the federal government,\u201d Lew writes.\n\nHe adds, \u201cRaising the debt limit does not authorize any federal spending; it simply allows the government to pay bills already incurred.\u201d\n\nBottom line, Lew argues, the utter politicization of the debt limit is a threat to the safety of the United States: \u201cWhat once was a deadline that drove debates on the budget has transformed into a nihilistic platform for some in Congress to promote the very real risk of a default to advance narrow partisan agendas.\u201d\n\nRelated: Experts Warn of a Coming Fiscal Crisis as Trump Prepares to Take Charge\n\nEven using all of the methods at its disposal, he said, constant fights about the debt limit expose the system to \u201cneedless risks that Treasury cannot meaningfully mitigate.\u201d\n\nWhile it remains unlikely that members of Congress can be persuaded to put down what has become an extremely powerful weapon in policy battles, Lew at least offers his successors at Treasury a coherent argument that, for the good of the country, they should."}, {"date": "2017/01/05", "title": "Seven Tests That Can Keep Republicans from Screwing Up", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/01/05/Seven-Tests-Can-Keep-Republicans-Screwing", "text": "It didn\u2019t take long for Republicans to make their first tin-eared mistake after winning a broad victory in November. In fact, they had barely opened the new session of Congress before performing a pratfall that called into question whether they learned anything from the populist revolt that struck both parties over the past two years.\n\nOn Monday night, House Republicans met to consider their top priorities for the 115th Session of Congress, after an election in which voters made clear their displeasure with the Washington DC establishment and the status quo. Instead of focusing on moves to improve accountability within the Beltway, they instead put their efforts into limiting the independence of the Office of Congressional Ethics.\n\nRelated: GOP House, Off to a Shaky Start, Backtracks on Killing Ethics Panel\n\nLawmakers from both sides of the aisle have complained about alleged abuses from OCE, and there may well be defensible changes to reduce the potential for future reforms. However, as Paul Ryan reportedly warned the caucus, this self-interested focus was hardly what voters expected of the new Congress, and it didn\u2019t take long for Ryan to be proven prescient. The media gleefully reported that House Republicans had \u201cgutted\u201d ethics accountability, and even Donald Trump tweeted out his disapproval. Less than 24 hours after their vote to change the House rules on OCE, the GOP caucus reversed course and threw in the towel.\n\nThe Washington Post headlined this as \u201ca day of chaos.\u201d It certainly wasn\u2019t a propitious start to the ambitious session planned by president-elect Trump and Republican leadership. The fumble left the impression that many Republicans still thought voters would accept business as usual, and perhaps even assumed that their lopsided victory at all levels in November signaled a specific embrace of the Republican Party and carte blanche to act on the agenda of its politicians.\n\nThat would be a dangerous assumption. Voters did not suddenly embrace Republicans as much as they rejected Democrats, with the GOP benefiting from the binary political system. Democrats made a similar assumption after winning sweeping victories in the 2006 and 2008 elections, and have paid for it ever since. Democrats failed to understand that and spent the last six years reducing their party to its worst political position since the 1920s, and possibly since Reconstruction.\n\nRelated: The Republican War on Obama\u2019s Regulations Is About to Begin\n\nVoters did not elect Republicans as much as they elected for a change \u2013 and want it to result in positive action, economic revival, a secure and strong America, and most of all greater accountability from Washington DC. Had they articulated among themselves a set of tests for proposed actions that reflected those principles, they might have avoided this debacle entirely. These seven tests, in descending priority order, will provide Republicans on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue insight into whether their actions reflect their understanding of that mandate:\n\nDoes it serve to bring accountability to the political establishment in Washington DC? \u2013 No other value mattered more to voters in both parties in this cycle. Donald Trump ran explicitly on a promise to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d a promise he has reaffirmed after his election. Had Republicans internalized this properly, they never would have dared to make OCE changes as their Day One action item. Does it add to the economic power of the US and create good jobs for Americans? \u2013 Populists on the Left cared more about attacking corporate and individual wealth, but on the Right, the main driver was economic stagnation outside of the coastal enclaves and Washington DC. Twenty-five years ago, James Carville said, \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid,\u201d but now it\u2019s the making sure the economy produces winners across the board. That may matter most in trade agreements, but the expected regulatory and tax reforms have to take this into account as well.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Is a Fiscal Minefield for the GOP\n\n\n\nDoes it address the most critical needs of the country ahead of the ideological agendas of the parties? \u2013 Voters increasingly see Republicans and Democrats in Washington as a separate species, not as members of their communities. They want the government to fix what\u2019s truly broken and stay out of what\u2019s not. Voters expect politicians to find solutions rather than conduct the same endless debates we have had for decades. Delivering practical solutions that benefit their communities will go a long way in establishing credibility.\n\n\n\nDoes it enhance national security and the defense of Americans both at home and abroad? - Voters demand both liberty and security as part of making America great again. They want national security tailored to our needs rather than those of other nations, or a very good explanation of why the latter falls within our national interest.\n\nDoes it serve the rule of law equally applied to all? \u2013 Perhaps no more corrosive belief to well-functioning self-governance exists than the assumption that power and privilege result in favorable treatment from the government. That manifests itself in many ways \u2013 law enforcement as well as regulatory and tax policy, but also in accountability. Restoring confidence in the system requires a renewed commitment to the rule of law rather than the rule of whim or cronyism. The failure to adhere to this principle is a key factor in the rise of populism.\n\nRelated: The GOP May Get a Taste of Its Own Medicine on Supreme Court Nominations\n\n\n\nDoes it restore the proper balance of power between the executive and legislative branches? \u2013 Braggadocio about pens and phones might have proven satisfactory for the outgoing president, but the legislature is the most accountable branch of government to voters. Regulatory reform must account for a massive shift in power to executive agencies when it comes to rule-setting and law enforcement over the last several decades, much of which leaves Americans at the whim of bureaucrats without due process to protect them. Congress needs to exert control over the bureaucracy as part of reducing regulation as an end in itself.\n\n\n\nDoes it restore the proper balance of power between Washington DC and the states? \u2013 Voters feel disconnected from self-governance because the government has increasingly become disconnected from them. A renewed push for federalism and subsidiarity will allow voters more control over policies in their own communities and states, while at the same time reducing the opportunities for cronyism and corruption in Washington DC. Republicans promised this the last time they had single-party control in the Beltway, and instead delivered the K Street Project and more federal programs that crowded out local and state initiatives. They can ill afford another failure.\n\nRepublicans don\u2019t have a great deal of time to prove to voters that they have learned this lesson. Both the Trump administration and the GOP on Capitol Hill need to earn their credibility by adhering to the principles on which voters put their trust in them.

Bush\u2019s term. McConnell and his colleagues inflated the comment into the \u201cBiden Rule\u201d and pretended that it had been the actual policy of the Democratic Party in order to justify blocking the nomination of an appointee, Federal Judge Merrick Garland, who members of both parties had said was eminently qualified.\n\nIn criticizing Schumer\u2019s suggestion that Democrats could hold the Scalia seat open during Trump\u2019s term, McConnell also failed to note that just days before the presidential election, members of his own party were suggesting that if Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton were to win, they would do exactly that.\n\n\u201cThere is certainly long historical precedent for a Supreme Court with fewer justices,\u201d said Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, discussing the prospect of refusing to seat Clinton\u2019s Supreme Court nominees. \u201cI would note, just recently, that Justice [Stephen] Breyer observed that the vacancy is not impacting the ability of the court to do its job. That\u2019s a debate that we are going to have.\u201d\n\nAt around the same time, North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr reportedly said in a private gathering, \u201c[I]f Hillary Clinton becomes president, I am going to do everything I can do to make sure four years from now, we still got an opening on the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Trump Needs to Take the Economy More Seriously\n\nWhether or not Schumer will follow through with a threat to block a Trump nominee is unclear. The Democrats are facing a tough slate of senate elections in 2018, with several incumbents running in states that Trump won in the presidential election. Convincing enough Democrats to uphold an indefinite filibuster of a Trump nominee could be too heavy a lift.\n\nAnd even if Democrats are able to hold the line, they have already provided Republicans with a roadmap for getting around it. When former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid invoked the \u201cnuclear option\u201d in 2014, doing away with the filibuster for presidential nominees other than Supreme Court justices, the decision to leave the high court out of it was optional.

Republicans, as much as they detest Obamacare, have repeatedly said that the plan is not to repeal it and walk away, but to engineer a replacement that delivers health insurance coverage to the same number of people at a lower cost, with fewer requirements on individuals and businesses.\n\nHow they will do that remains a large and still unanswered question, and the CRFB analysis provides a useful breakdown of some of the challenges that the GOP will face in both repealing the ACA and keeping their promises about a replacement.\n\nThe biggest money-saver would be a full-on repeal of the law\u2019s coverage provisions, CRFB finds. \u201cOf the $1.55 trillion in savings from repealing the ACA\u2019s coverage provisions, $900 billion comes from repealing insurance and cost-sharing subsidies and $1.10 trillion from repealing the Medicaid expansion. These savings are partially offset by $250 billion of cost from repealing the legislation\u2019s insurance mandate penalties and another $200 billion from interactions and various other provisions.\u201d\n\nHowever, that would also result in about 23 million people losing their insurance -- something Republicans have repeatedly promised not to allow.\n\nRelated: Republicans Are Having Second Thoughts About Scrapping Obamacare Taxes\n\nThose savings, though, would be offset by repealing the law\u2019s revenue provisions.\n\n\u201cAbout half of the $800 billion of revenue loss from repealing ACA\u2019s taxes comes from removing the 0.9 percent Medicare payroll surtax on wages above $200,000 ($150 billion) and the 3.8 percent surtax on investment income above the same threshold ($250 billion). Another quarter of the revenue loss comes from repealing various fees on insurance companies, medical device companies, and drug manufacturers.\n\n\u201cRepealing the \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on high-cost insurance plans costs $100 billion over a decade; those costs are slated to grow substantially over time, and repealing the Cadillac tax without a replacement would also remove a key tool in helping to slow overall health care cost growth.\u201d\n\nFinally, CRFB notes, total repeal of Obamacare would entail getting rid of numerous measures that have successfully slowed the rate of growth in healthcare spending, and which are expected to save $1.1 trillion between now and 2027.\n\nRelated: GOP and Dem Governors Are Closing Ranks Against Obamacare Repeal\n\nAlso possible, though, are various versions of a partial repeal of the ACA, leaving in place certain elements of the law and eliminating others. This would, in theory, break the GOP\u2019s promise of total repeal, but under some circumstance would give lawmakers enough financial running room to at least make a credible attempt at a replacement.\n\nFor example, CRFB reports, if all the existing coverage provisions were repealed, but the revenue and cost-saving measures were kept in place, there would be $1.55 trillion (or $1.75 trillion on a dynamic scoring basis) available to fund a replacement to cover the 23 million people expected to lose coverage under the original legislation.\n\nIn the end, none of these things will happen in a vacuum. The GOP can\u2019t simply flip a switch and turn off programs that have been baked into the nation\u2019s healthcare infrastructure over the course of years, and many of these programs will likely be phased out over time. But the report offers a good bird\u2019s-eye view of the scope of the challenge Republican lawmakers have set for themselves."}, {"date": "2017/01/04", "title": "The 3 GOP Senators Who Could Stop Obamacare Repeal", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/04/3-GOP-Senators-Who-Could-Stop-Obamacare-Repeal", "text": "President Obama and GOP Vice president-elect Mike Pence staged dueling appearances on Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning with two very different missions:\n\nWith less than three weeks left in his administration, Obama sought to rally the Democrats to try to salvage key elements of the Affordable Care Act. Meanwhile, Pence sought to stiffen the Republican majority\u2019s resolve to repeal a national health insurance program that has extended coverage to more than 20 million Americans.\n\nRelated: Republicans Take the First Step to Repeal Obamacare\n\nThe Republicans, for sure, are holding most of the high cards in this critically important political poker game, with GOP majorities in the House and the Senate and President-elect Donald Trump, an arch foe of Obamacare, about to succeed Obama in the White House. And the Senate wasted little time yesterday, during the opening day of the new Congress, in unveiling a skeletal budget bill that will be used as the vehicle for dismantling much of Obamacare in the coming weeks.\n\nBut as the Republicans appear on the verge of realizing a six-year-old goal of repealing one of Obama\u2019s crowning achievements, the enormity of their action is sinking in. And at least a few GOP lawmakers are having second thoughts about the wisdom of repealing the Affordable Care Act before having a suitable replacement in hand.\n\nEven without Republican opposition, Obamacare has had challenges from the outset. The millions of dollars spent on Healthcare.gov that took more than a year to function properly was the first blow. The second was Obama\u2019s broken promises: You can keep your doctor and your health plan, neither of which was true.\n\nBut the greatest setback was the lack of signups by young people who were supposed to pay for the chronically ill and aged. That led to higher premiums and outrageously high deductibles for people who in some cases could not afford to go to a doctor even if their premiums were subsidized. Without the young people buttressing the old, insurers lost money, and some decided to bail out of the program altogether.\n\nFor consumers who depended on Aetna and United, this was yet another nightmare. But through it all, 20 million people had access to healthcare \u2013 many for the first time in their lives.\n\nRelated: Republicans Are Having Second Thoughts About Scrapping Obamacare Taxes\n\nTrump, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), Rep Tom Price (R-GA), Trump\u2019s designated health and human services secretary and others bravely insist the key elements of a market-oriented GOP replacement plan are on the drawing board. Yet with many Americans just waking up to the fact they could lose their Obamacare or expanded Medicaid coverage and a growing uproar among insurers, hospital administrators, doctors and consumer advocates worried about the consequences of the GOP\u2019s planned actions, some Republicans are raising a cautionary flag.\n\nAt least three Republican senators \u2013 Susan Collins of Maine, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana \u2013 have signaled to their leaders that it would be a big mistake to plunge ahead with repealing Obamacare without a replacement plan waiting in the wings, as the Morning Consult reported today.\n\nObamacare provides tax subsidies to low and moderate income families and individuals to purchase private health insurance on government-run exchanges. It also requires uninsured Americans to purchase coverage, imposes other mandates on insurers, the pharmaceutical industry, hospitals and the medical device industry, and it levies taxes to help finance operating costs.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Will Test the Definition of \u2018Insurance\u2019\n\nBecause of the special budget \u201creconciliation\u201d rules being followed to sidestep Democratic opposition, the Republicans can repeal some but not all of Obamacare. Moreover, Trump has said he wants to preserve some provisions of the current law, including a ban on insurers discriminating against consumers who have chronic illnesses and allowing parents to keep their children on their health insurance plans until they turn 26.\n\nThe three GOP senators cited concerns about adverse market reaction to a swift, partial repeal of Obamacare without an alternative to replace it. Even if the repeal doesn\u2019t formally take effect for two or three years, the lawmakers worry about a continued exodus of major insurance companies from Obamacare and rising premiums during the transition.\n\nCassidy on Tuesday tweeted that \u201cMany are worried about losing insurance coverage.\u201d Collins told the Portland Press Herald late last month that she didn\u2019t \u201cwant to see people drop through the cracks.\u201d And on Monday, Paul warned in an op-ed in Rare that unless they moved quickly to replace Obamacare with a fully-developed plan that works, the Republicans could end up being blamed for the continued deterioration of the program.\n\nRelated: Stock Trades by Trump\u2019s Top Health Care Reformer Raise Some Swampy Questions\n\n\u201cWe should repeal Obamacare, but partial repeal will only accelerate the current chaos and may eventually lead to calls for a taxpayer bailout of insurance companies,\u201d he wrote.\n\nPaul added, \u201cPartial repeal of Obamacare will likely win the day, but when the insurance companies come to Washington crying for a bailout don\u2019t say that no one warned of this preventable disaster.\u201d\n\nAlthough none of the three Republicans are threatening to vote against a repeal budget package, they all sit on committees that will work directly on the repeal effort and the subsequent replacement legislation. What\u2019s more, with Republicans holding a relatively narrow 52 to 48 seat majority in the Senate, it would only take three defections to stop the repeal effort in its tracks.\n\nA number of studies by the Congressional Budget Office and independent research organizations have warned that a partial repeal of Obamacare would result in millions of Americans losing their health insurance and Medicaid coverage or having to settle for considerably less coverage.\n\nRelated: 3 Years to Replace Obamacare?

Just as the billionaire developer was famous for convincing reluctant financiers that his next deal was going to be the biggest, the best, the most fabulous ever \u2013 and that they would rue the day they turned down his loan -- Trump has sold Americans on the promise that he can create jobs.\n\nRelated: The Insiders Already Cashing In on the Trump Presidency\n\nThe Left says he lies all the time; mostly, he just exaggerates.

And 2016 saw further retrenchment. Only the Ivory Tower set- people who have never created a job or built a business \u2013 dismiss the critical need for regulatory overhaul.\n\nObama has paid lip service to the negative impact of regulatory overload \u2013 even as he has gone about spinning them out at a record clip.\n\nTrump promises more than lip service, and his pledge to help businesses has already boosted morale.

Trump spent his entire campaign deeply angered by how the government treats veterans, particularly regarding their medical care. He promised to overhaul the Veterans Administration (VA) health care system and \u201ctake care\u201d of the vets. Everyone has interpreted this as code for privatizing the VA, a long-awaited conservative goal.\n\nBut last week at Mar-a-Lago, after a meeting with health care executives about his VA plans, Trump told reporters this: \u201cWe think we have to have kind of a public-private option, because some vets love the VA. Definitely an option on the table to have a system where potentially vets can choose either/or or all private.\u201d\n\nIf the current VA system is so reviled, so horrific, so offensive in its unfair treatment of veterans, why do \u201csome vets\u201d love it? Why must it be preserved as a choice?\n\nRelated: The Pentagon Must Now Reveal the True Cost of War to All Americans\n\nTrump appears to be running up against a typical problem for those favoring total overhaul to tweaks along the edges, especially in health care: People fear change over what they have. In the case of the VA, that\u2019s certainly true for veterans, who like the current arrangement. And it\u2019s also true of the privatization-friendly group of experts who looked at the VA just last year.\n\nLet\u2019s back up: The VA is a unique feature of the U.S. health care system, more reminiscent of Britain\u2019s National Health Service. Doctors and medical personnel work directly for the VA, and it owns the facilities where they operate. The rationale is that veterans experience several common combat ailments, from traumatic brain injuries to PTSD to amputations requiring prosthetics. Centralizing care at the VA allows for specialization on the unique needs of veterans, which private hospitals lack. The VA serves more than 8.9 million veterans a year at 1,233 facilities.\n\nTrump bases his stance on the VA mostly on a 2014 scandal about backlogs for patient care and falsifications of waiting periods, which led to the dismissal of several top officials. But as The Fiscal Times\u2019 Rob Garver explained, the VA\u2019s new leadership has already acted to reform the system and change the agency\u2019s culture. Pending claims are way down, virtually all VA facilities extend same-day access to care and performance exceeds the private sector by nearly every measure.\n\nRelated: Most Veterans Say They Are Not Treated Well by the Government\n\nOn top of that, Trump\u2019s preferred option of giving veterans the choice of VA or private care has already been implemented, with interesting lessons. After the backlog scandal, Congress passed a reform bill co-authored by Bernie Sanders, and as part of it, a pilot program gave veterans a Choice Card to use at private facilities if their local VA hospital is more than 40 miles away, or if the wait time is over 30 days. This theoretically ensures that no veteran has to wait for or be inconvenienced by seeking medical care.\n\nThe rollout has been shaky, mainly because the 90-day deadline Congress demanded for setting up the system meant that the VA had to turn to private contractors with a history of botching health care management. This has led to a secondary waitlist for those seeking difficult-to-access private care, along with numerous billing errors and questions of eligibility. There was also no setup for integrating care between VA and non-VA providers, which meant veterans skipping between the two could get duplicative or substandard care. While some have predictably used this to label the VA as incompetent, it says more about the hurdles to delivering a public/private hybrid.\n\nRepublicans have responded by advocating for a permanent Choice Card, allowing veterans to go to anywhere they want (oddly, they haven\u2019t offered the same kind of single-payer card for the nation\u2019s other 300 million-odd citizens to present at any medical facility). That mirrors the Trump plan of a \u201cpublic/private option.\u201d But that would further strain a hobbled scheme private contractors couldn\u2019t figure out for a much smaller universe of patients. It would also double the costs of the current VA.\n\nRelated: Two Years After VA Scandal, System Still Stacked Against Vets\n\nIt\u2019s clear that conservatives expect the private market to deliver better service than any public agency. The VA, they expect, would obviously wither on the vine if challenged by the free market. These true believers have perhaps never had to navigate the private health care system and its even longer wait times; comparatively the VA looks like a dream.\n\nRepublicans tried to lay the groundwork for back-door privatization. The 2014 VA reform legislation mandated a report from a bipartisan Commisson on Care on how to best redesign the VA. This was a stacked deck, widely expected to give Republicans a blue-ribbon pro-privatization report to \u201cprove\u201d their case. Three of the 15 commissioners were CEOs of health care companies that would financially benefit from breaking up VA hospitals; two others had ties to the Koch Brothers, who have bankrolled the privatization front group Concerned Veterans for America for years.\n\nBut a funny thing happened. The final report of the Commission on Care did not endorse privatization. It recommended enlisting credentialed community provider networks to increase capacity for veterans care, integrated with the VA\u2019s electronic medical records system. The 18 recommendations largely tracked with what VA Secretary Robert McDonald has already been implementing.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Could Provide a Huge Tax Break to the 1 Percent\n\nWhen considering privatization, the commission sought feedback from the veterans themselves. Consistent with recent polling, the vets didn\u2019t want the VA privatized. They preferred the quality of care at the VA and had problems with outsourcing treatment to non-VA providers. Veterans groups also prefer the current system. Transition officials reportedly met with 30 organizations last month, finding that they held near-unanimous opposition to privatization. American Legion Executive Director Verna Jones said of the VA recently, \u201cthere is no better care or value available anywhere in the United States \u2014 period.\u201d\n\nSo like Trump, the Commission on Care pulled its punch. When you can\u2019t even get a commission seeded with conservative ideologues to sign off on VA privatization, it shows the formidable nature of the task.\n\nThe VA continues to be demonized and maligned in conservative media, for the reading benefit of the large numbers of Americans who have no military experience. (Blaming the VA for over-prescription of opioids rather than the drug companies who relentlessly pushed them on patients as a miracle cure is just one example). But those who know and study the system find it indispensable.

They have also asked to limit the number of confirmation hearings that can be held in a single week.\n\nRepublicans, for their part, are envisioning an accelerated series of hearings and votes to have many of Trump\u2019s picks installed by the time he is inaugurated or shortly after that.\n\nRelated: The Insiders Already Cashing In on the Trump Presidency\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said he planned to do everything in his power to slam on the brakes. \u201cPresident-elect Trump is attempting to fill his rigged cabinet with nominees that would break key campaign promises and have made billions off the industries they\u2019d be tasked with regulating.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cAny attempt by Republicans to have a series of rushed, truncated hearings before Inauguration Day and before the Congress and public have adequate information on all of them is something Democrats will vehemently resist. If Republicans think they can quickly jam through a whole slate of nominees without a fair hearing process, they're sorely mistaken.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s a problem. Whether that is indeed Republicans\u2019 intentions, it\u2019s not clear the GOP would be \u201cmistaken.\u201d Schumer and his fellow Democrats in the Senate enter the 115th Congress in what is arguably the weakest position a minority facing a slate of new presidential nominees has ever faced.\n\nIn 2014, Majority Leader Harry Reid, (D-NV) pulled the trigger on the long-threatened \u201cnuclear option,\u201d eliminating the filibuster for all presidential nominees other than Supreme Court Justices. When Republicans took over the Senate a few months later, they opted to keep Reid\u2019s rule change in place.\n\nRelated: Trump Rips Obama on Transition ... Then Praises Him\n\nThat means that the Democratic minority has been stripped of its last-ditch defense -- preventing a vote on Trump\u2019s nominees -- which makes Schumer\u2019s vows of resistance ring hollow. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has little incentive to bow to a minority leader who possesses no real leverage.\n\n(To the extent Schumer has leverage, it is over legislation, which is still subject to the filibuster. If threats against future GOP legislative priorities count as leverage in the battle over nominees, Schumer could be argued to have at least some influence over McConnell. However, the Republicans have already signaled their intention to pack some of their top priorities -- including a repeal of the Affordable Care Act and certain tax cuts -- into filibuster-proof budget reconciliation bills, which reduces the danger of seeing their agenda stymied.)\n\nDemocrats claim that the unique nature of the incoming Trump presidency -- one in which family members and a wide variety of friends and associates with no experience in government -- make it especially important to vet top nominees closely. Additionally, they argue, Trump\u2019s outright refusal to release his tax returns, breaking with decades of precedent, makes the finances of his cabinet choices all the more relevant.\n\nTrump\u2019s nominee for Secretary of State, Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, has been the target of particular attention, with Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, including ranking member Ben Cardin (D-MD) demanding that he hand over his tax returns. That\u2019s something that most cabinet nominees, except the Treasury Secretary and a handful of others, are not normally asked to do.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Needs to Take the Economy More Seriously\n\nDemocrats are promising to devote special attention to Tillerson, as well as to others nominees, including billionaire Betsy DeVos, an advocate of private sector educational initiatives who has been tapped to run the Department of Education, and fast food executive Andrew Puzder, who is set to run the Department of Labor.\n\nIn the end, though, the level of disruption Democrats can cause to the confirmation process will be limited primarily by how much Mitch McConnell wants to avoid negative news stories about the GOP steamrolling powerless Senate Democrats. Which is to say, Democrats probably won\u2019t be able to do very much.\n\nMcConnell may throw Schumer a few bones in the interests of future cooperation, but barring a revolt among McConnell\u2019s members, Trump\u2019s cabinet will likely be in position in relatively short order."}, {"date": "2017/01/02", "title": "Republicans Are Pressing to Ban Food Stamp Purchases of Junk Food", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/02/Republicans-Are-Pressing-Ban-Food-Stamp-Purchases-Junk-Food", "text": "Spending on the federal food stamp program has gradually declined over the past two years as congressional Republicans and many states tightened eligibility requirements and the economy improved to the point that many dropped off the rolls after landing jobs.\n\nMore than 46 million Americans had been on food stamps in the depths of the recession or nearly one in every seven people.

Ryan has proposed converting food stamps to a block grant and allowing states to determine how to spend a diminished level of funding.\n\nWhile lawmakers are certain to insist on stiff work requirements for able-bodied recipients and other eligibility rules, Republican lawmakers in two states -- Maine and Arkansas -- are eying additional potential savings by targeting beneficiaries who spend part of their monthly food subsidy on junk food and sodas, according to the Daily Signal.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s Department of Agriculture previously rejected waiver requests from nine other states \u2013 including California, New York, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas and Vermont \u2013 to prohibit beneficiaries from buying junk food with their food stamps.\n\nBut with a new Republican Trump administration taking charge Jan. 20, GOP officials in Maine and Arkansas believe they stand a much better chance of getting their waiver request approved by the USDA.\n\nRelated: $74 Billion Food Stamp Program in Budget Crosshairs\n\nThe push is being made with an eye toward improving public health and reducing health care costs as well as government food subsidies. State officials in Maine and Arkansas say that the ban on food stamp purchases of junk food would reduce their states\u2019 obesity rates, contain Medicaid costs for low-income people and help ensure that beneficiaries use the program for its original intent \u2013 namely insuring a healthy diet for low-income families.\n\nProponents say the goal is to save lives and reduce health care costs by improving people\u2019s diets, and not slashing overall spending or reducing the food stamp rolls. But depending on how the regulations are written, people caught purchasing forbidden junk food and soda could be suspended or even dropped from the program. Moreover, food stamp advocates such as the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities say the program already improves the diets and health of women and children.\n\nLast year, the House Budget Committee adopted a budget plan that would slash food stamp spending by more than $150 billion \u2013 or more than 20 percent \u2013 over the coming decade and change the program into block grants. CBPP analysts warn that cuts of that magnitude would force millions of low-income families out of the program and reduce the monthly benefits for those who remain on the rolls.\n\nArkansas ranks sixth nationally among all states in the rate of obesity, according to a 2016 national survey, posing a public health crisis among residents and a huge financial burden on the state and federal government. Medicaid and Medicare finance nearly 40 percent of the state\u2019s alarming $1.25 billion annual obesity-related medical costs, according to a 2015 report by the Winthrop Rockefeller Institute.\n\nMary Bentley, a Republican member of the Arkansas Assembly, introduced a bill in early December to restrict what food stamp recipients are allowed to purchase. Although the bill doesn\u2019t specifically bar the purchase of junk food and soda, Bentley told the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that potato chips, soda and candy would be among the items that would be banned in the waiver request submitted to the USDA.\n\n\u201cChips and Cokes and candy bars,\u201d Bentley told the newspaper as she enumerated the prohibited food. \u201cPeople can go buy Red Bull with food stamps, and that\u2019s not encouraging health.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services plans to submit a waiver request to the USDA shortly after Trump takes office.

But Trump\u2019s habit of claiming more credit than he deserves stands in sharp contrast to President Obama\u2019s inability to communicate all of the good things that have happened during his presidency.\n\nA report by Catherine Rampell in The Washington Post cites a poll on Obamacare: Astonishingly, about a third of respondents believe the share of Americans without health insurance has risen in the last five years. Even a sizable chunk of Clinton voters (21 percent) believes this. In fact, the uninsured rate has fallen precipitously, and now stands at an all-time low.\u201d\n\nRelated: Economists, Blogs, and Donald Trump\n\nOr, to cite another example, how many people know that Obama cut payroll taxes for workers in an attempt to stimulate the economy? Workers received a \u201cMaking Work Pay\u201d tax cut of $400 ($800 for couples) that was distributed in small amounts in 2009 and 2010. Amazingly, it was intentionally underplayed based upon an idea from behavioral economics that the tax cut would stimulate the economy more if workers were unaware of it. There is some debate about how well the tax cut worked, but the point is that very few people were even aware that they received it.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s lack of effective communication with the public was a big mistake. When Bill Clinton was president, it seemed like you could hardly turn on the TV without seeing someone vigorously and effectively defending his administration, and there was certainly no shortage of people defending George Bush. But, at least as I see it, the Obama administration did not benefit as much as it should have from effective spokespeople in the media (and where were members of the House and Senate for the past 8 years, they dropped the ball too).\n\nThere is a way in which the Obama administration communicated admirably, but unfortunately, it was mostly with policy wonks. What I will miss the most when Obama leaves office is the excellent work performed by his Council of Economic Advisers. The role of the CEA is to provide objective economic analysis that the president can use to make informed decisions.\n\nFor example, when George W. Bush was considering imposing a tariff on imported steel, the chair of the CEA at the time, Glenn Hubbard, warned him of the consequences for the US economy. Bush imposed the tariffs anyway (though they were rescinded two years later when other countries threatened to retaliate), but at least he did so with full knowledge of the potential harm it would do.\n\nRelated: Why the Public Has Stopped Paying Attention to Economists\n\nPresident Obama appointed top-notch economists to the CEA, and the work they have done on a variety of issues is careful and academically rigorous (for example, since August there have been reports on Active Labor Market Policies: Theory And Evidence For What Works, Labor Market Monopsony: Trends, Consequences, and Policy Responses, and The Performance of Community Banks over Time).\n\nOne piece of research, a report on Occupational Licensing, changed my mind. I have always thought about occupational licensing as a way to overcome a market failure due to lack of information about the quality of, say, medical procedures. The idea is that since consumers lack the knowledge needed to evaluate the quality of the service they receive, licensing and professional groups can police members and enforce quality standards. This is\n\nThis is useful and serves the interest of consumers, but the report convinced me it has gone too far. In many cases, licensing thwarts competition by erecting barriers to entry with no corresponding benefit to consumers, and it would be helpful to reevaluate the need for licensing using the guidelines given in the report.\n\nWhat we seem to be getting from the Trump administration, which has floated Larry Kudlow as head of the CEA \u2013 he has no formal training in economics \u2013 is a slate of appointments that will provide political cover for whatever the administration wants to do. I find that distressing. One of the most important roles of the CEA is to shut down bad ideas, but it looks as if it will be transformed into a cheerleading agency for whatever Trump proposes.\n\nI understand that macroeconomics has not performed perfectly in recent years, but it would be a mistake to use the shortcomings as a reason to throw out economic analysis altogether. There is a substantial body of both theoretical and empirical analysis of policies such as tax cuts for the rich, the imposition of tariffs, infrastructure spending, shutting down immigration, and the other things Trump has talked about. Even with policies I disagree with, there are good and bad ways to put them into place. Ignoring what economists have learned would be a big mistake.\n\nEven with policies I disagree with, there are good and bad ways to put them into place.

These range from the fundamental question of what actually constitutes \u201chealth insurance coverage\u201d to thorny questions about whether refundable tax credits would actually create the necessary incentive to encourage the uninsured to purchase coverage.\n\nWhile the Republican plan to replace the ACA isn\u2019t fully-formed yet, it seems safe to assume that it will abolish the individual mandate that requires all individuals to have health insurance, repeal the expansion of Medicaid, slash minimum coverage requirements for plans sold in the non-group market, and allow insurers to sell policies across state lines.\n\nRelated: Obamacare RIP: Republicans Finally Have a Plan\n\nDemocrats have been warning for years that the impact of this combination of policies could be disastrous for the health insurance market. The individual mandate creates a risk pool that is much healthier -- and therefore cheaper to insure -- than a market where those least likely to need health care are free to opt out.\n\nCutting minimum coverage requirements will inspire health insurers to offer bare-bones policies that do little to insulate consumers from financial risk related to major health problems but provide just enough coverage to qualify for the refundable tax credit covering the premiums. Removing state-level regulation of health insurance, experts warn, could accelerate that race to the bottom.\n\nIn late December, the Congressional Budget Office issued a warning to Republicans in the form of a post to the agency\u2019s blog. In it, authors Susan Yeh Beyer and Jared Maeda noted that the various proposals currently floating around Capitol Hill would be judged by both CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation, which score legislation for lawmakers as greatly reducing the number of Americans with health insurance.\n\nThis includes the Empowering Patients First Act, put forward by Georgia Congressman Tom Price, a physician himself and President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to run the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nRelated: Republicans Are Having Second Thoughts About Scrapping Obamacare Taxes\n\nCBO, which scores legislation for lawmakers to estimate costs and benefits, would not count someone as \u201cinsured\u201d unless they had significant protection against major financial risk, they wrote. The proposals being aired by the GOP, by making it possible for companies to issue low-coverage policies, would likely leave many people outside that category.\n\n\u201cIf there were no clear definition of what type of insurance product people could use their tax credit to purchase,\u201d they wrote, \u201csome of those insurance products would probably not provide enough financial protection against high medical costs to meet the broad definition of coverage that CBO and JCT have typically used in the past\u2014that is, a comprehensive major medical policy that, at a minimum, covers high-cost medical events and various services, including those provided by physicians and hospitals.\u201d\n\nBottom line, they said, \u201cCBO and JCT would not count those people with limited health benefits as having coverage.\u201d\n\nSome Obamacare policies are also on shaky ground in terms of consumers having adequate insurance coverage without exposing them to major financial risk. Insurance premiums are rising an average 25 percent this year and deductibles for silver plans will average $3,572 for individuals, while families will have to cover $7,474 before insurance pays a dime. The cheapest Bronze plans will cost individuals an average $6,000, while families will shell out $12,393 before insurance kicks in.\n\nWhile this may seem trivial, a finding from CBO and JCT that an Obamacare replacement plan would result in fewer Americans having health insurance would be a political problem for Republicans, from Trump on down, who have promised that their new plan would cover the same number of people, but for less money.\n\nRelated: 3 Years to Replace Obamacare? Republicans Are Wading Into a Quagmire\n\nBut whether or not particular policies that qualify for a tax refund are actually insurance in the real sense of the word is only one of the questions that would have to be answered under an ACA repeal program. Another is whether refundable tax credits would induce consumers to purchase health coverage in the first place.\n\nIn a blistering editorial this month, the editors of the New England Journal of Medicine argued that, at least in the context of Price\u2019s Empowering Patients First Act, they would not.\n\nThe plan proposes eliminating the ACA\u2019s expansion of Medicaid and replacing it with tax credits based on age. For example, people aged 18-to-35 would receive a credit of $1,200 per year, while people 50 and over would receive $3,000. The proposal, according to NJEM\u2019s editors, would leave younger consumers paying more than $2,500 out of pocket for the most basic plan, while the bill for older consumers would approach $6,000. What\u2019s more, the tax credits are not scaled to recipients\u2019 income, meaning that low-earning consumers would pay a much larger share of their disposable income in health insurance costs than high-earners.\n\nThe Price tax credits, NJEM argues, are far too meager to encourage mass participation in the individual health insurance market.\n\nRelated: GOP and Dem Governors Are Closing Ranks Against Obamacare Repeal\n\n\u201cTo put the plan\u2019s subsidies into perspective, consider that in 1992 when per capita health expenditures were just one-third of what they are today, President Bush and HHS Secretary Sullivan proposed a slightly larger individual tax credit ($1,250) for the purchase of insurance than Price proposes today. Even in 1992, analysts reported that the credit would be insufficient to induce most people to buy coverage.\u201d\n\nThe editorial\u2019s criticism of the Price plan was not limited to the tax credit. It blasted the plan as a giveaway to doctors at the cost of reducing consumer protections.\n\n\u201cIn sum,\u201d they wrote, \u201cPrice\u2019s replacement proposal would make it much more difficult for low-income Americans to afford health insurance. It would divert federal tax dollars to people who can already buy individual coverage without subsidies and substantially reduce protections for those with preexisting conditions. The end result would be a shaky market dominated by health plans that offer limited coverage and high-cost sharing.\u201d\n\nRepublican lawmakers have floated the idea of a lengthy phase-in period for their replacement plan, allowing them to symbolically \u201crepeal\u201d Obamacare while effectively leaving it in place for an indefinite period.

Trump could argue that his hands were tied and that he couldn\u2019t readily repeal the sanctions without causing political upheaval within his own party.\n\nBut if Trump attempts to lift the sanctions on Russia next year after taking the helm at the White House, it could trigger a bitter fight within his own party that could spill over into other policy areas and even harm the prospects of winning Senate confirmation of Tillerson.

That doctor or hospital would be reimbursed by the federal government in a program much like Medicare.\n\nThe President-elect spent considerable time and energy on the campaign trail bad-mouthing the VA system for what he described as disgraceful treatment of ailing veterans, including long wait times, poor service, and questionable care. Speaking to the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in July, he said, \u201cThe VA scandals that have occurred are widespread and inexcusable.\u201d He said they constituted \u201ca permanent stain on this government.\u201d\n\nRelated: Two Years After VA Scandal, Healthcare System Still Stacked Against Vets\n\nOn Wednesday, an aide outlined to reporters the plan under consideration to allow vets to seek care outside the VA system, saying there is \u201cdefinitely an option on the table to have a system where potentially vets can choose either or, or all private.\u201d\n\nHowever, it seems as though the idea -- not something that originated with the Trump administration -- isn\u2019t quite fully baked yet. Among the questions being pondered by the incoming administration, the aide said, are some pretty basic ones: \u201cHow would you implement a program that could get vets the ability to go to any hospital that they wanted to go to?\u201d and \u201cIf you were in the VA or out of the VA, how would you set it up?\u201d\n\nThe problem here is that team Trump may well be dedicating scarce resources to a problem that is well on its way to being solved.\n\nThe VA, to be sure, was a national embarrassment a few years ago. In 2014 a wave of revelations found administrators falsifying documents in order to create the impression that they were compliant with departmental requirements regarding wait times. Veterans died while waiting for care, and overworked doctors began leaving the system in droves.\n\nRelated: Facing $1 Billion in Cost Overruns, VA Hospital Execs Head for the Exits\n\nHowever, that was before President Obama tapped Army veteran and former Proctor and Gamble chairman and CEO Robert McDonald to take over the system in an attempt to turn it around. McDonald stepped into the role of VA secretary in July 2014, and since then, according to two recent reports by outside groups, the results have been dramatic.\n\nMcDonald began by firing 14 of 17 top leaders in the system, replacing them with a combination of internal promotions, former high-ranking military officers, and private sector business executives. The mission, as McDonald described it, was to change the culture of the agency from a \u201crules-based\u201d system to a \u201cprinciples-based\u201d system.\n\nCritics of the VA often described a department in which employees hewed closely to a rigid system of rules, often to the detriment of patients, because they knew that following the rules would keep their jobs safe.\n\nIn a study of the VA updated this month, the Harvard Business Review cited a particularly egregious example:\n\nThe leadership team had to work through vestiges of VA\u2019s rule-based past. For instance, in May 2015, an employee answering the phone at the Puget Sound VA in Seattle received a call from a veteran who had broken his foot, driven himself to the hospital\u2019s entrance and needed help getting into the building. Stymied by rules like don\u2019t abandon your post, and advise patients outside the hospital to call 911 for assistance, the employee refused to go to the veteran and advised him to hang up and call 911. Ultimately, a team of Seattle firefighters was dispatched to the hospital\u2019s parking lot to help the veteran from his car to the emergency room \u2014 a distance of 10 feet. In a rules-based organization, employees lack the flexibility of discretion.\n\nRelated: How Bureaucratic Red Tape Could Give a Convicted VA Exec Her Job Back\n\nHowever, according to the investigators from Harvard Business School, much has changed at the VA since McDonald took over.\n\n\u201cAlthough the transformation remains ongoing, they have made considerable progress after two and a half years: Pending claims at VA have fallen by more than 90 percent; VA health care now performs better than the private sector on 96 percent of outpatient measures, according to RAND; and by the end of the year, all VA hospitals will offer same-day access to care, relative to none in 2014. In a survey conducted last month, 75 percent of veterans reported that VA effectively delivers care and services, up from 65 percent just a year ago.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the improvement in care has led to veterans signing up for VA Care at record numbers -- to the point, Harvard noted, that wait times are on the rise again, this time due to demand, not inefficiency.\n\nThese don\u2019t appear to be hallmarks of an organization in need of a massive shake-up but rather of one that had already endured the shake-up and is now showing marked improvement. The positive changes raise the question of whether the incoming administration should be considering a major privatization push at this point in the VA\u2019s renaissance.\n\nIf you ask veterans\u2019 groups now, the answer is obvious: No.\n\nTrump transition team members met with a number of veterans groups at the American Legion\u2019s headquarters in Washington early this month. Afterward, the Legion\u2019s executive director, Vera Jones, told Military.com that none of the groups were in favor of privatization.\n\n\u201cThe American Legion absolutely opposes privatization,\u201d she said. \u201cWe strongly advocate for a healthy VA health care system for veterans.\u201d"}, {"date": "", "title": "Trump Rips Obama on Transition ...

For instance, it\u2019s unclear whether he is talking about going well beyond the Obama Administration\u2019s current pricey modernization program for the U.S. nuclear arsenal, or whether he would scrap the New Start treaty between the U.S. and Russia that caps nuclear warhead deployment and mandates regular inspections.\n\n\u201cThis is an attitude, not a policy,\u201d Gordon Adams, a defense policy expert, said in an interview this week. \u201cHe\u2019s not giving you anything\u2026to stand on in terms of what he means by \u2018expand.\u2019\u201d\n\nYet, by raising the issue weeks before he is sworn in as the 45th president, Trump has opened the door to a renewed debate on U.S. nuclear defense strategy that could lead to the government committing tens of billions of dollars more to Pentagon spending in years to come.\n\nAlthough he vowed to substantially reduce the threat of nuclear weapons during his first term, President Obama in his second term embarked on an ambitious program designed to upgrade the nation\u2019s warheads and launch systems -- including the missiles, bombers and submarines that deliver the warheads.\n\nRelated: Russian State Media Warns that Trump Is Facing a \u2018Coup d\u2019Etat\u2019\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has estimated that over the coming decade, the Obama administration\u2019s plan for nuclear force modernization, maintenance and operations will cost $348 billion, or an average of about $35 billion a year. The CBO study released in January 2015 said that over the coming two decades, Congress will need to make decisions about the extent to which \u201cessentially all of the U.S. nuclear delivery systems and weapons will be modernized or replaced with new systems.\u201d\n\nWhile the government doesn\u2019t provide comprehensive figures for the amount of federal resources that go to all aspects of nuclear defense, the Defense Department and the Department of Energy spent an estimated $42.3 billion on the nuclear program in 2015, according to the Nuclear Threat Initiative.\n\nAbout $23.9 billion of that total went for nuclear forces and operational support. The remainder of spending covered missile defense operations, environmental cleanup of nuclear waste and programs to reduce the global nuclear threat, according to the NTI, an anti-nuclear proliferation research organization.\n\nEstimates of how much the government spends on its nuclear weapons program and stockpile vary significantly. But there is no question that spending as a share of the budget has plummeted substantially since the peak of the U.S.-Soviet Union nuclear weapons race during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.\n\nRelated: Was Trump\u2019s Nuclear Tweet a Poke at Putin?\n\nThroughout the 1960s and early 1970s, nearly two of every 10 dollars spent by the Defense Department went for developing and stockpiling nuclear weapons.

However, that share is estimated to climb to four percent or five percent over the coming decade under Obama\u2019s remodeling program\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet and subsequent comments to MSNBC\u2019 Mika Brzezinski suggesting he would welcome a renewed nuclear arms race with Russia and others set off alarm bells among nuclear weapons experts and anti-nuclear advocacy groups fearful of a potential global catastrophe -- let alone the added costs to the military.\n\nRelated: The Pentagon Must Now Reveal the True Cost of War to All Americans\n\n\u201cThe use of even a single nuclear weapon, anywhere in the world, would be a global humanitarian, environmental and economic disaster,\u201d Derek Johnson, the executive director of Global Zero, said in a statement last week., according to the New York Times. \u201cA nuclear buildup in the U.S. and Russia only makes that nightmare scenario more likely.\u201d\n\nAdams, a professor emeritus at American University who specializes in military history, said that \u201cthe Obama plan is expensive enough \u2013 and in the judgment of many not necessary \u2013 or at least elements of it are debatable.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgain, what Trump would do, if anything, in addition\u201d to Obama\u2019s proposals \u201cis anybody\u2019s guess,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not clear what it would be.\u201d"}, {"date": "", "title": "How Team Trump Is Changing the Rules of the Media Game", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2016/12/27/How-Team-Trump-Changing-Rules-Media-Game", "text": "After a brief Christmas Day break, President-elect Donald Trump re-emerged on Twitter, his pulpit of choice, mixing self-promotion, vague suggestions about foreign policy and questionable statements about his charitable foundation in a storm of post-holiday tweets. According to incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, that approach is likely to be the norm as the country moves forward into 2017.\n\nIn an interview with a television station in his home state of Rhode Island over the weekend, Spicer said to expect Trump to continue to go directly to the public via social media rather than relying on traditional filters like the White House press office and the media.\n\nRelated: How Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart Helped Elect Trump\n\n\u201cHe does communicate in a much bigger way than ever\u2019s been done before, and I think that\u2019s going to be a really exciting part of the job,\u201d said Spicer, currently the chief strategist and communications director for the Republican National Committee.\n\n\u201cI think that his use of social media in particular \u2026 is gonna be something that\u2019s never been seen before,\u201d Spicer told WPRI. \u201cHe has this direct pipeline in the American people, where he can talk back and forth.\u201d\n\nWhile it might not come as a great surprise to the nation\u2019s diplomatic corps, it serves as confirmation that an era of carefully considered and closely vetted statements about international affairs is probably coming to an end.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump continued fulminating about the decision by the Obama administration last week to abstain from voting on a U.N. Security Council measure censuring Israel for building settlements in both disputed territory and on land owned by Palestinians. Israel and its most hardline supporters in the U.S. had called on the Obama administration to veto the resolution, and were infuriated when it was allowed to pass.\n\nRelated: Trump Doubles Down on the Threat of a Nuclear Arms Race\n\nIn a notable break from protocol, Trump last week called for a veto in advance of the vote and then criticized the sitting president\u2019s administration for not taking his position, promising -- in a tweet, naturally -- \u201cAs to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, he blasted the U.N. in general, writing, \u201cThe United Nations has such great potential but right now it is just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time. So sad!\u201d\n\nThe president-elect\u2019s return to social media after the holiday appears to have been jump-started by remarks President Obama made in an interview Monday suggesting that be believes that he could have beaten Trump had it been legal for him to run for a third term.\n\nRelated: Talk of Tariffs from Team Trump Makes Economists Very Nervous\n\nIt was that remark that prompted the president-elect\u2019s first post-Christmas tweet, late Monday afternoon, in which he declared, \u201cPresident Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me. He should say that but I say NO WAY! - jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc.\u201d\n\nIt was as if a dam had finally broken, and Trump\u2019s brief Christmas silence was no more.\n\nHe followed up shortly thereafter by claiming that his election had lifted a pall of gloom from the planet, and that a rising stock market and holiday spending increases were also due to the prospect of a Trump presidency.\n\nThe world was gloomy before I won - there was no hope.

News broke over the weekend that he would be shutting down the controversial Trump Foundation, which Trump has repeatedly characterized as a benevolent charitable organization, to avoid conflict of interest charges during his time in the Oval Office.\n\nThe problem, though, was that much of what Trump said about his foundation was either exaggerated or flat out untrue, something that is now widely known thanks to the dogged reporting of The Washington Post\u2019s David Fahrenthold.\n\n\u201cI gave millions of dollars to DJT Foundation, raised or [received] millions more, ALL of which is given to charity, and media won't report!\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nIn fact, Trump has not personally donated a penny to the Trump Foundation since 2009. In recent years, much of the money given to the foundation has come from professional wrestling impresarios Vince and Linda McMahon. Mrs. McMahon was recently nominated to serve as a member of Trump\u2019s cabinet, helming the Small Business Administration. Trump also has a history of soliciting money from other charitable organizations, and then repackaging that money as a donation from the Trump Foundation.\n\nRelated: Experts Warn of a Coming Fiscal Crisis as Trump Prepares to Take Charge\n\nTrump\u2019s claim that \u201cALL\u201d of the donations to the foundation have gone to charitable causes was echoed in a follow-up tweet.\n\n\u201cThe DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses. 100% of money goes to wonderful charities!\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, that is also pretty clearly untrue. The Post\u2019s Fahrenthold uncovered multiple examples of the Trump Foundation spending money impermissibly, including the purchase of large portraits of Trump himself and professional sports memorabilia, which Trump used to decorate his commercial properties. More controversially, the foundation has been accused of using its funds to settle legal debts owed by Trump\u2019s for-profit business. The attorney general of the state of New York is currently investigating the Trump Foundation for various violations of law governing non-profits, and the Trump Foundation itself has admitted to breaking rules against self-dealing in a filing with the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nTrump\u2019s incoming White House staff is putting a brave face on their boss\u2019s determination to continue using Twitter and other social media platforms to communicate with the public, but the intense media pressure that comes with the Oval Office is going to amplify apparent policy statements, misleading claims and outright falsehoods even well beyond the considerable range Trump already has as president-elect.\n\n\u201cExciting\u201d may not be the word incoming press secretary Spicer and his colleagues are using to describe the president\u2019s social media habits a few months from now."}, {"date": "", "title": "Why the Dow Is Struggling to Break Through 20,000", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/12/27/Why-Dow-Struggling-Break-Through-20000", "text": "Can the Dow finally push past 20,000?

The Dow has climbed for seven consecutive weeks, a run unmatched since the \"Bullard bounce\" of late 2014 that ended the Ebola scare stocks suffered in October that year.\n\nAnd the failure to take 20,000 is downright odd considering just how lofty expectations are heading into 2017.

Dow 100 proved troublesome throughout the 1910s. Dow 1,000 set the ceiling for the market between 1964 and 1982. Dow 10,000 was won, lost and won again in a decade-long, back-and-forth battle that finally ended in 2010.\n\nMore recently, the Dow struggled to break north of the 18,000 level from late 2014 through July 2016.\n\nOne other possible explanation is that Wall Street equity strategists are, on the whole, surprisingly dour on the outlook for 2017, mainly on valuation fears and the drag from higher expected interest rates. According to Goepfert, the average strategist expects the S&P 500 to end 2017 barely 4 percent ahead of where it is now. That's the weakest annual gain estimate since forecasts for 2003 were being made in late 2002, when war with Iraq loomed.\n\nRelated: Oil Rises Further Above $55 as Looming Supply Cuts Provide Support\n\nThis is notable for two reasons. One, normally strategists just add 9 percent or so to wherever stocks are trading heading into the holidays and call it good. So this is unusually cautious. Second, there has been a large reduction in the variability of these forecasts \u2014 many of the 2017 targets are between 2,300 and 2,350 \u2014 indicative that some groupthink is setting in.\n\nHere's the nerve-rattling kicker: The last time groupthink was in play to such a degree was at year-end 2007, when strategists were looking for a 9 percent gain in 2008.

And it created enormous good will for the Air Force.\n\nRelated: Trump Dumps on F-35 Contract and Calls for \u2018Lifetime\u2019 Ban on Revolving Door\n\nOver the years, the Air Force and other branches of the military have perfected the art of \u201cpeanut-buttering.\u201d And this helps to explain why Lockheed Martin\u2019s highly controversial and costly F-35 Joint Strike Force will survive and thrive in the coming years, regardless of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s threat last week that he might abandon it in favor of a less expensive jet fighter.\n\nTrump momentarily stunned the defense industry and caused a substantial dip in Lockheed Martin\u2019s stock by tweeting that cost overruns in the $400 billion program to develop a new generation of stealth jet fighters had prompted him to ask rival Boeing to \u201cprice out\u201d a comparable F-18 Super Hornet \u2013 although the F-18 lacks many of the F-35\u2019s stealth features. Trump had earlier complained that the $100 million-per-copy cost of the F-35 was \u201cout of control\u201d and vowed to negotiate big savings.\n\nBut extracting huge additional concessions from Lockheed Martin after the company agreed to previous cuts won\u2019t be easy, even though the F-35 remains the Pentagon\u2019s costliest military hardware project in history. That\u2019s because the project is slathered in peanut butter.\n\nThe F-35 program boasts a supply chain that reaches out to practically every state in the country. While government watchdogs and critics have long derided the project\u2019s runaway costs and frequent setbacks, the F-35 program has generated tens of thousands of jobs in 45 states and enjoys strong bipartisan support throughout Congress.\n\nThe F-35 is a stealthy state-of-the-art jet fighter designed to span the military services for the U.S. and its allies, including Israel, Canada and Great Britain. There are three distinct models that take off and land in conventional ways, do short takeoffs and vertical landings, and that are launched from aircraft carriers using a catapult.\n\nRelated: Trump Says No to Daily Redundant Intel Briefings Because He's a 'Smart Person'\n\nLockheed Martin has teamed up with more than 1,250 suppliers to produce thousands of components for the complex aircraft system, including sophisticated radar sensors and parts of the aircraft\u2019s fuselage, according to the company. Overall, the F-35 program is responsible for more than 146,000 U.S. jobs, according to an Associated Press report.\n\nSome 18 states have counted on the F-35 for $100 million for more of economic activity throughout the life of the contract, including Arizona, California, Connecticut, Texas, Georgia, and Florida. The program is responsible for 38,900 jobs in Texas alone and close to 10,000 in Connecticut.\n\n\u201cThis is the thing that is going to make it devilishly difficult for Trump or anybody else to do anything about it,\u201d said Adams, a professor emeritus of foreign policy at American University. \u201cI\u2019m staggered that a president of the United States thinks he\u2019s going to negotiate hardware contracts.

Frey, a senior fellow in the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. In the 2015-2016 period, the U.S. population increased by only 0.7 percent. That\u2019s compared to a rate of about .95 percent, on average, over the past 70 years, and spikes as high as 2.1 percent during the height of the post-World War II Baby Boom.\n\n\u201cIt is likely that some of the reduced fertility in recent years is attributable to recession-related delays in family formation among young adult millennials; this trend could reverse in the near future as the economy continues to grow,\u201d Frey writes. \u201cBut higher death rates are likely to continue due to the long-term aging of the population, a phenomenon contributing to projected declines in U.S. growth rates, which could drop as low as 0.5 percent in 2040.\u201d\n\nNew babies, of course, aren\u2019t the only source of population growth. Throughout its history, the U.S. has seen economic growth boosted by waves of immigrants who take part in the economy as both workers and consumers.\n\nHowever, immigration rates are also down in recent years, and Congress has been reluctant to pass sweeping immigration reform laws. The conclusion of a presidential election in which the winner spent much of his time promising to build a wall along the Mexican border and otherwise move to block new entries to the U.S. makes it seem unlikely that major immigration reform will be in the offing anytime soon.\n\nRelated: Talk of Tariffs from Team Trump Makes Economists Very Nervous\n\nWithin the United States, Western States and Southern States in the \u201cSun Belt\u201d are experiencing significantly faster growth than the nation as a whole, driven in part by internal migration.\n\n\u201cOverall,\u201d Frey writes, \u201cthe United States seems to be in the midst of a population growth paradox: As the nation\u2019s population growth continues to stagnate due to fertility declines in the context of an aging population, internal population shifts help places like the Sun Belt continue to grow. Because the latter is more economically driven than former, it is encouraging to see that a key demographic indicator of a strong economy \u2013 migration in response to newly emerging employment opportunities \u2013 is reviving in tandem with the economy.\u201d\n\nBut it could be worse, Frey notes. The U.S. population is growing slowly, but at least it isn\u2019t shrinking.\n\n\u201cSeveral other industrialized countries, such as Japan, Germany, and Italy are facing the specter of long-term population decline,\u201d he writes. \u201cBy comparison, the United States can look forward to continued population growth, albeit at lower levels, for decades to come.\u201d"}, {"date": "", "title": "Stock Trades by Trump\u2019s Top Health Care Reformer Raise Some Swampy Questions", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2016/12/23/Stock-Trades-Trump-s-Top-Health-Care-Reformer-Raise-Some-Swampy-Questions", "text": "On the face of it, at least, the stock trades look pretty fishy.

In 2012, President Obama signed into law the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act that barred members from using \u201cany non-public information derived from the individuals\u2019 position \u2026 or gained from performance of individual duties for personal benefit.\u201d\n\nThe anti-insider trading legislation was enacted on the heels of a shocking 60 Minutes report in 2011 that members of Congress could legally trade stocks based on potentially market-moving information garnered as part of their duties \u2013 information that wasn\u2019t available to the public. Correspondent Steve Kroft reported that then-Rep. Spencer Bachus (R-AL), a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, bet against the market in the lead up to the 2008 financial crisis after receiving an \u201capocalyptic briefing\u201d from then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson.\n\nRelated: Conflicts of Interest With Trump\u2019s Businesses Are Already Occurring\n\nThe STOCK Act, signed by Obama with much fanfare, also applied to officials of the executive branch and their staffs. It greatly expanded financial disclosures and made all of the data searchable to make it easier for investigators and journalists to ferret out potential wrongdoing.\n\nBut a year later, Congress and Obama quietly watered down some of the most important provisions as part of a bill shepherded through the House by then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA). The plan to automate and digitize financial disclosure forms was abandoned. Investigators now have to apply in the basement of the Cannon House Office Building for authority to print out hard copies of relevant documents.\n\nPrice joins an administration in which conflict of interest concerns are far from isolated. President-elect Trump himself appears to plan on retaining ownership of his business, which ethics experts have warned will inevitably -- and quickly -- lead to questions about whether he and his family stand to benefit from specific actions taken by his administration.\n\nRelated: GOP and Dem Governors Are Closing Ranks Against Obamacare Repeal\n\nFor example, Trump's National Security adviser, retired Army Lt. General Mike Flynn, has served on the board of a defense contractor and ran a lobbying company that had contracts with foreign government, and continued to do so even as he was receiving classified intelligence briefings with Trump during the campaign.\n\nTrump's nominee for Defense Secretary, retired Marine General James Mattis, is on the board of a major defense contractor, General Dynamics, which has paid him well over $1 million in cash and stock since 2013. The new administration's pick for secretary of state, Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, served as a board member of an oil company joint venture between Exxon and the Russian government that has been affected by U.S. sanctions.\n\nNone of these potential conflicts are disqualifying on their own -- Trump's nominees can make a clean public break with their past commitments when they join the government. But the sheer volume of them creates the impression among critics at least that the president-elect is staffing his administration with people who have extraordinarily close ties to companies and foreign governments that will have business before the federal government.\n\nRob Garver contributed to this report."}, {"date": "", "title": "What a Trade War With China Could Do to the Economy", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/12/23/What-Trade-War-China-Could-Do-Economy", "text": "\u2018Tis the season for research reports from Wall Street economists looking ahead to 2017. And as you can imagine, the surprise victory of Donald Trump dominates most of these pages, which are filled with estimates of the impact of the president-elect\u2019s fiscal plans on GDP growth, inflation and share prices.\n\nUnlike most, I go straight for the \"tail risk\" what-ifs to get an idea of what is in the realm of possibility. If there is any lesson from 2016 as we look ahead to the new year, it's that political uncertainty and popular anger have ushered in an era of instability and black swan events. We had Brexit and the Trump win. Fresh elections in Europe are coming next.\n\nYet one of the biggest black swans out there is the other half of Trump's political platform: A pledge to renegotiate America's trade deals, especially those with China, possibly inciting an outright trade war.\n\nRelated: It Looks Like Trump Is Serious About Starting a Trade War With China\n\nMore than a few eyebrows have been raised by Trump's aggressive post-election behavior toward Beijing, first by his acceptance of a call from Taiwan's president and his suggestion that he may abandon the One China principle, and second by his Twitter comments in the wake of China's seizure of a U.S. Navy underwater drone.\n\nThe prospects of a standoff with China are likely higher now that Trump\u2019s has appointed \"Death by China\" author and Harvard-trained economist Peter Navarro to head a newly created National Trade Council within the White House. The Trump transition team said the NTC would lead a \"Buy American, Hire American\" program that would boost job creation with a focus on infrastructure and defense.\n\n\"The new administration should bear in mind that with economic and trade ties between the world's two largest economies now the closest they have ever been, any move to damage the win-win relationship will only result in a loss for both sides,\" China\u2019s official English-language newspaper said in an editorial Friday.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Threats on Trade Endanger US Jobs\n\nOf course, Trump or some of his supporters might not see the current relationship as win-win. So just what would Trump\u2019s proposals mean for that relationship, and for the U.S. economy?\n\nDeutsche Bank researchers recently looked at a possible \"border tax adjustment\" proposal put forward by House Speaker Paul Ryan and congressional Republicans and supported by Trump. Basically, the proposal would tax imports, reduce taxes and exports and be tantamount to a one-time competitive devaluation of the U.S. dollar \u2014 the type of strategy that Trump has accused China of abusing for years.\n\nDeutsche Bank estimates it would boost U.S. trade competitiveness by 15 percent instantly as imports would become 20 percent more expensive while exports would be 12 percent cheaper after taking the tax changes into account. In their view, this would be enough to almost completely close the U.S. trade deficit.\n\nThere are downsides.\n\nA border tax would likely boost inflation by increasing the cost of everyday items imported from China and elsewhere. Retailers and producers would be in a lurch: Either pass the costs onto consumers or allow profitability to be pinched. Higher inflation would encourage more rapid Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.\n\nRelated: Experts Warn of a Coming Fiscal Crisis as Trump Prepares to Take Charge\n\nChina would be angered. Not only would higher inflation and higher interest rates continue to strengthen the dollar \u2014 which would increase the cost of trillions in off-shore dollar-based emerging market loans \u2014 but a drop in export activity would weaken an already vulnerable Chinese economy trying to extricate itself from a bad debt problem.\n\nStill, there is hope that thanks to China's slow reduction in its reliance on the U.S. economy, Beijing will resist the urge to retaliate and instead focus on reducing factory oversupply in areas like steel and textiles in an effort to reorient its economy toward Chinese consumers and the production of higher quality, higher priced goods. As things stand now, less than 4 percent of China's GDP depends on the United States, according to Societe Generale.\n\nRelated: Talk of Tariffs from Team Trump Makes Economists Very Nervous\n\nOn the other hand, China may choose to retaliate and more firmly establish its place in the global economy. The Global Times, which Reuters describes as \u201can influential tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily,\u201d responded to the choice of Navarro with an editorial that said, in part: \"China is powerful enough to withstand pressures from the Trump government. Beijing will get used to the tensions between the two countries. If Washington dares to provoke China over its core interests, Beijing won't fear setting up a showdown with the U.S., pressuring the latter to pay respect to China.\"\n\nThat\u2019s a tail risk to watch for as we enter 2017."}, {"date": "", "title": "Trump Doubles Down on the Threat of a Nuclear Arms Race", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2016/12/23/Trump-Doubles-Down-Threat-Nuclear-Arms-Race", "text": "President-elect Donald Trump on Friday appeared to signal that he is open to a new nuclear arms race. His soon-to-be counterpart in Russia, President Vladimir Putin, said that if one has begun, it wasn\u2019t the Kremlin that started it.\n\nThe two statements kicked off a second day of anxious theorizing about what role the two men believe nuclear weapons will play on the international stage in coming years.\n\nRelated: Was Trump\u2019s Nuclear Tweet a Poke at Putin?\n\nThe issue came to the public\u2019s attention Thursday, when Putin delivered a speech to the Kremlin\u2019s Defense Ministry Board in which he vowed to continue Russia\u2019s massive investment in upgrading its military. He said, in part, \u201cWe need to enhance the combat capability of strategic nuclear forces, primarily by strengthening missile complexes that will be guaranteed to penetrate existing and future missile defense systems.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t precisely clear what he meant by \u201cstrengthening missile complexes\u201d (language that the Kremlin provided in its own translation of the speech into English.) But the remarks could be read as a reference to an expansion of Russia\u2019s nuclear arsenal -- something that both the U.S. and Russia have avoided doing for the most part since the Reagan administration.\n\nTrump responded with an equally vague statement, delivered on Twitter: \u201cThe United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.\u201d\n\nIn a wide-ranging, four-hour press conference on Friday, Putin returned to the topic of nuclear weapons and was asked about the possibility of reviving the arms race that defined the Cold War era. He said that if a new arms race occurs, or indeed if one has already started, it will be due to the George W. Bush administration\u2019s decision to pull out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty with Russia in 2002.\n\nRelated: Russian State Media Warns that Trump Is Facing a \u2018Coup d\u2019Etat\u2019\n\nThe Bush administration\u2019s controversial decision to withdraw was made, officials said, because the country needed to be able to develop an effective nuclear \u201cshield\u201d against attacks from rogue states that were not a party to the treaty.\n\n\u201cWhen one party unilaterally withdrew from the treaty and said it was going to create an anti-nuclear umbrella, the other party has to either create a similar umbrella \u2013 the necessity of which we are not sure about, considering its questionable efficiency \u2013 or create effective ways to overcome this anti-ballistic missile system and improve its strike capabilities,\u201d Putin said Friday.\n\nWhile Russia is upgrading its nuclear capabilities, he denied that doing so constitutes an arms race. \u201cIf anyone is unleashing an arms race, it's not us ... We will never spend resources on an arms race that we can't afford.\u201d\n\nHe claimed that the United States is upgrading tactical nuclear weapons in several NATO countries, saying to a BBC reporter, \u201cI hope that your program audiences and Internet users know about that.\u201d\n\nRelated: Team Trump Is Singing from Putin\u2019s Songbook on DNC Hacks\n\nNot long afterward, Trump delivered another statement on nuclear weapons, this time through television host Mika Brzezinski, on the MSNBC program Morning Joe. Brzezinski said that she had spoken with Trump Friday morning and that the president-elect told her he wasn\u2019t worried about an arms race -- not because he doesn\u2019t believe it will happen, but because he believes the U.S. would win it.\n\n\u201cLet it be an arms race,\u201d he told her, Brzezinski said. \u201cWe will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all.\u201d\n\nLater, Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, struggled to push back against the idea that his boss was blithely inviting nuclear proliferation.\n\nHe told NBC host Matt Lauer that there won\u2019t be an arms race, but that \u201cother countries need to be put on notice that he is not going to sit back and allow them to undermine our safety, our sovereignty ... He is going to match other countries and take action.\u201d\n\nWhen Lauer pointed out that matching other countries advances in weaponry is practically the definition of an arms race, Spicer again insisted that nothing like that was going to happen, because Trump \u201cis going to ensure that other countries get the message he is not going to sit back and allow that ... What\u2019s going to happen is they will all come to their senses and we will all be just fine.\u201d\n\nPerhaps concerned that all the discussion about nuclear weapons was making people nervous, the Trump transition team late Friday morning, released a letter that Putin sent to Trump. Dated December 15, it offers holiday greetings and notes that \u201crelations between Russia and the U.S. remain an important factor in ensuring security and stability of the modern world.\u201d\n\nIt continues, \u201cI hope that after you assume the position of the President of the United States of America we will be able\u2014by acting in a constructive and pragmatic manner\u2014to take real steps to restore the framework of bilateral cooperation in different areas as well as bring our level of collaboration on the international scene to a qualitatively new level.\u201d\n\nIn a brief statement, Trump called it \u201ca very nice letter\u201d and said, \u201c[H]is thoughts are so correct.

Since the Nov. 8 election, Republican governors such as Susana Martinez of New Mexico have voiced alarm over possibly losing millions in federal funding to provide Medicaid and Children\u2019s Health Insurance coverage for seven million people.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Democratic governors sent a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and other GOP congressional leaders warning that repeal of Obamacare would strip tens of millions of their health coverage and shift enormous health care costs to states governments \u2013 effectively \u201cblowing a hole\u201d in state budgets.\n\nRegardless of mounting warnings from state chief executives across the country, President-elect Donald Trump, and Republican lawmakers are almost certain to make good on their pledge to repeal Obamacare as early as next month -- but without adopting a suitable replacement for at least another two or three years.\n\nAshLee Strong, a spokesperson for Ryan, told The New York Times, \u201cThis disaster of a law has led to massive premium spikes, less choice for patients and a collapse of the exchange markets, and no amount of spinning from the White House can hide this ugly reality.\u201d\n\nSome 24 million Americans potentially could be removed from the health care insurance rolls in 2021 if the GOP fails to come up with an effective alternative approach. And federal spending on health care would decline by $927 billion over the next decade, leaving it up to the states to pick up much of the slack, according to a recent study by the Urban Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\nRelated: Nearly Half of Obamacare Co-Ops Are Closing\n\nOne of the ironies of all of this is that while Obamacare has had an extraordinarily rocky existence from the beginning \u2013 including court challenges, internet launch woes, financial problems, mass defections by the insurance industry, and soaring premiums \u2013 enrollments for the upcoming 2017 season are moving apace at a record clip.\n\nAbout 6.4 million Americans have signed up so far for health insurance as of Wednesday, according to the Obama administration, an increase of about 400,000 over a similar point a year ago. The administration and its Democratic allies on Capitol Hill and in statehouses across the country are stepping up a campaign to try to salvage critical pieces of Obamacare, including expanded Medicaid, and the latest enrollment figures are a heartening sign to them.\n\nOf course, signing up is the first step. The real test is how many people will pay their first-month premium and stay with the plan for a year, especially when they see that premiums have risen an average 25 percent from last year and deductibles are also high.\n\nSylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, told Times reporters Wednesday that the number of Obamacare signups was remarkable in light of \u201cheadwinds\u201d created by the premium increases and the uncertainty over the future of the program.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that long ago that most state and local governments were still struggling to recover from the worst effects of the Great Recession, with many forced to cut back on services, raise taxes and shortchange their public employees\u2019 retirement and health care funds.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California sent a letter this week urging her colleagues to stage events in early January to showcase Democratic support for Obamacare and Medicare, according to Morning Consult. She said the events should \u201chighlight the risks of repeal of the ACA and ending the Medicare guarantee.\u201d\n\nRelated: States Face a $1 Trillion Pension Problem: Here Are the Worst 10\n\nEven now, many state and local governments are unable to return to spending and personnel levels enjoyed before the economic crisis dating back to 2007 and 2008. State-run retirement systems reported shortfalls totaling $934 billion in fiscal 2014, the latest figures available, which was a slight improvement over the $969 billion deficit from the previous year, according to research by the Pew Charitable Trust.\n\nHowever, if the federal government no longer picks up the majority of expanded Medicaid coverage for poor adults in 31 states as it now does under the ACA -- most of those states would suffer massive budgetary losses to provide the health care services people now expect.\n\nThe Democratic Governors Association estimated that states could face nearly $69 billion in costs for uncompensated care over the coming decade if Obamacare is repealed.\n\nRelated: States Keep Using Gimmicks to \u2018Balance\u2019 Their Budgets\n\n\u201cThis plan appears to be nothing more than a Washington, D.C. bait-and-switch that puts an untenable burden on the states,\u201d Democratic Governors Dan Malloy of Connecticut, Jay Inslee of Washington, and Andrew Cuomo of New York wrote in the letter. \u201cThe American public has yet to see any alternative that retains coverage and financial protections for the millions of consumers currently benefitting from the ACA.\u201d\n\nThey noted that nearly a third of those covered under the Medicaid expansion have a mental health or substance abuse disorder \u2013 an important point to make amid the nation\u2019s shocking opioid and heroin epidemic that has claimed more than 33,000 lives in 2015 alone.\n\n\u201cYour plan would send us back to a time when those who were sick were left uninsured or relegated to state high-risk pools with exorbitant premiums, inadequate coverage, and waiting lists,\u201d the Democratic governors complained."}, {"date": "", "title": "Trump\u2019s Threats on Trade Endanger US Jobs", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/12/23/Trump-s-Threats-Trade-Endanger-US-Jobs", "text": "Heading toward his inauguration in less than a month, President-elect Donald Trump has already waved a big stick at every American multinational company that\u2019s even thinking about moving productive operations to another country.

It weakens our economy and our political system when the incoming chief executive of the federal government tries to dictate to U.S. companies how they should deploy their productive assets.\n\nRelated: Talk of Tariffs from Team Trump Makes Economists Very Nervous\n\nAccording to a new report issued by the U.S. Commerce Department, more than 4,000 U.S. companies operate more than 32,000 affiliates around the world. Those companies don\u2019t invest abroad primarily to take advantage of low wages or to send products back to the homeland, but to instead reach new customers and expand their market share globally. Locating production in foreign markets allows U.S. companies to better tailor products for local consumer tastes, to reduce transportation costs and to protect trademarks and intellectual property. Various services can\u2019t be exported; they must be delivered in the local market.\n\nIn today\u2019s global economy, U.S. companies sell more of their brand-name goods and services through their majority-owned foreign affiliates than they do by exporting from the United States. According to the most recent numbers from the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. majority-owned affiliates supplied $4.49 trillion in goods to foreign customers in 2014, compared to the $1.63 trillion exported from the United States. U.S. affiliates supplied $1.66 trillion in services to foreigners, compared to $743 billion in exported services. That means U.S. companies sell more than twice as much in global markets through their foreign affiliates as they do by exporting from the United States.\n\nWhat U.S. majority-owned affiliates produce abroad is overwhelmingly sold abroad. Of the more than $4 trillion in goods they supplied in 2014, 8 percent were sold as imports to the United States; 92 percent were sold in the host country or in third countries. A full 96 percent of the goods supplied by U.S.-owned affiliates in China were sold in that country or others outside the United States. In Mexico, 68 percent of the goods they supplied were sold in Mexico or other foreign countries.\n\nRelated: It Looks Like Trump Is Serious About Starting a Trade War With China\n\nFord Motor Co. has also come under Trump\u2019s Twitter fire for its plans to shift production of lower-margin vehicles to Mexico. Its competitor General Motors now sells almost twice as many cars in China than it does in the United States, not by exporting to China but by producing them in China through joint ventures. Few of the cars are exported back to the United States. In 2015, GM\u2019s China operations returned more than $2 billion in profits, improving the company\u2019s long-term viability after its 2009 bankruptcy.\n\nUnited Technologies Corp., the parent company of Carrier as well as Otis Elevators, operates 25 factories in China that generate $6 billion in annual sales and employ 24,000 workers. As Politico recently reported, United Technologies\u2019 vice president for international government relations, David Manke, said of the company\u2019s operations in China, \u201cWe\u2019re not going anywhere. We like doing business there.\u201d Manke said United\u2019s joint ventures make products for the Chinese domestic market, not the U.S. market. \u201cWe don\u2019t go there to make elevators and ship them back to the U.S. We go there to make elevators and sell them in China.\u201d\n\nWhile investment in Mexico and China draws the president-elect\u2019s ire, most of the foreign affiliates are located in other high-income, high-standard countries, accounting for three quarters of the affiliate value added. What attracts U.S. investment is not primarily low wages but wealthy customers, skilled workers, free movement of goods and money across borders, the rule of law and political stability. U.S. majority-owned affiliates employ twice as many workers in Canada, Europe, Japan and Australia as they do in Mexico and China.\n\nRelated: Experts Warn of a Coming Fiscal Crisis as Trump Prepares to Take Charge\n\nExpanding operations abroad not only generates profits but also supports U.S. employment at the parent company. More production abroad can increase demand for higher-end components and services exported from the United States. It creates demand for more U.S. engineers, designers, accountants and managers to support global operations. From 2009 through 2014, while U.S. multinationals were expanding their affiliate employment overseas by 3.0 million, they were adding 3.6 million jobs at their parent-company operations in the United States.\n\nThe irony of Trump\u2019s fixation on outward manufacturing investment is that the United States remains the world\u2019s largest recipient of manufacturing investment. Foreign multinationals, year after year, invest more than twice as much in the U.S. manufacturing sector as American manufacturing companies invest abroad. About one in six American manufacturing workers, more than 2.4 million, are employed by foreign-owned companies.\n\nWhile candidate Trump was calling out Carrier for its plans to send 1,300 jobs to Mexico, the Japanese automaker Subaru was shifting production of its new Impreza model from Japan to its operations in Indiana, adding 1,400 new jobs in the past year. We should be grateful that Japan\u2019s government is not threatening \u201cretribution\u201d against its companies that \u201cship jobs\u201d to the United States.\n\nRelated: There Are Still Some Big Holes in Trump\u2019s Plan for Economic Growth\n\nIf a Trump administration succeeds in erecting a financial Berlin Wall that prevents U.S. companies from investing abroad, the result will be a retreat from global markets, with European, Japanese and Chinese multinationals ready to grab market share. U.S. companies will sell fewer American-branded goods and services abroad, reducing the returns to their shareholders and employment opportunities for American workers.\n\nDaniel Griswold is a senior research fellow and co-director of the Program on the American Economy and Globalization with the Mercatus Center at George Mason University."}, {"date": "", "title": "Trump\u2019s Nuclear Tweet: A Response to Putin?", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2016/12/22/Trump-s-Nuclear-Tweet-Response-Putin", "text": "President-elect Donald Trump rattled a lot of people Thursday afternoon when, seemingly out of nowhere, he began tweeting about nuclear weapons. It was unclear whether Trump was calling for more nuclear weapons, better ones or both. As with much of what the public learns from Trump on Twitter, the 140-character limit leaves little room for nuance.\n\n\u201cThe United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes,\u201d was his exact wording.\n\nRelated: Russian State Media Warns that Trump Is Facing a \u2018Coup d\u2019Etat\u2019\n\nAt first, it appeared to simply be another example of Trump just venting whatever stray thought is passing through his head at the time, only this time with much more alarming subject matter. He had already tweeted about a vote on Israeli settlements being held at the UN today, and had subtweeted his occasional adviser Newt Gingrich, denying claims by the former Speaker of the House that the phrase \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d was no longer approved for use by Team Trump.\n\nBut there may have been more to Trump\u2019s tweeting about nukes than met the eye. On Wednesday night, Trump had met with several high-ranking military officers, including an Air Force general in charge of part of the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons program. His communications team reported on Thursday that Trump had, for the second day in a row, opted not to skip the President\u2019s Daily Brief from his national security advisers.\n\nIn today\u2019s PDB, Trump likely heard that Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered an address to the Kremlin\u2019s Defense Ministry Board in which he declared the Russian military the strongest in the world and called for upgrading the Russian nuclear program with missiles that would defeat even the most advanced anti-missile systems. \u201cWe need to enhance the combat capability of strategic nuclear forces, primarily by strengthening missile complexes that will be guaranteed to penetrate existing and future missile defense systems,\u201d Putin said, according to the Kremlin.\n\nRelated: A Timeline of Trump\u2019s Flirtation With Putin and Russia\n\nPutin made clear that the military build-up of the past few years, on which Russia has spent large amounts of its shrinking budget, is slated to continue \u2014 but that it has already had results.\n\n\u201cMany factors, such as military factors, our history and geography and the general mood in the Russian society, allow us to say confidently that today we are stronger than any potential aggressor. I repeat, any aggressor,\u201d Putin said. \u201cHowever, if we allow ourselves to relax even for a minute, if we make a single significant mistake in modernizing the Army and the Navy and training military personnel, the situation will change very quickly, in light of the speed of global events.

The man he picked to run the NTC, University of California-Irvine economist Peter Navarro, is a trade hawk who has repeatedly warned that China is attempting to destroy the United States through unfair trade practices.\n\nBut while Trump has talked about tariffs before, they were typically presented as specific and punitive -- like a 45 percent tax on all Chinese goods as a punishment for what Trump claims are Beijing\u2019s illegal trade practices, or a 35 percent tariff on goods manufactured by U.S. companies that move production overseas.\n\nAn across the board 5 percent tariff would be so unprecedented and counter to most economic theories about trade, that some economists weren\u2019t ready to take the idea completely seriously, reacting instead with cautious disbelief.\n\nAlan Cole, an economist with the Center for Federal Tax Policy at the Tax Foundation, said he was considering the idea a \u201ctrial balloon\u201d that may not actually reflect the incoming administration\u2019s real plans. \u201cMaybe they want to see how people will react.\u201d\n\nRelated: Experts Warn of a Coming Fiscal Crisis as Trump Prepares to Take Charge\n\nHowever, he said, \u201cIf they keep going forward with this, I would expect more attention is going to be paid to it by economists and think tanks, and that attention is going to be negative.\u201d\n\nIn general, economists dislike tariffs because they are an inefficient form of taxation, and they cause particular problems when the nation levying the tariff is, itself, a major exporter.\n\nIf the sole purpose of a tariff was to raise money for the government, there\u2019s at least an argument that they are a good idea. The hope, basically, is that part of the additional 5 percent cost of goods coming into the country would be borne by foreign merchants, meaning that the Treasury would gain more in tax revenue than the U.S. population would pay. However, tariffs don\u2019t operate in a vacuum. For one, they tend to cause the currency of the country imposing them to rise in value relative to other countries\u2019 currencies, which hurts domestic industries whose exports are now more expensive to foreign buyers.\n\nTariffs also frequently trigger retaliation by other countries, doing still more damage to domestic companies that export their goods. They also raise prices on goods that consumers in the country imposing the tariff saw as a good value.\n\nRelated: Want to Pay Less than Half for Your Meds?

When Congress passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010, it required hospitals, the health insurance industry, medical device manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies to share in the cost because of the huge profits they would likely accrue from millions of new paying customers.\n\nRepublican critics of Obamacare have long derided these additional taxes \u2013 especially the 2.3 percent medical devices tax, a 10 percent tax on indoor tanning services, and taxes on brand-name drugs and health insurance companies selling policies on and off the government exchanges as millstones around the necks of businesses large and small.\n\nRelated: GOP Sets the Clock for Obamacare Repeal as Health Care Groups Hit the Panic Button\n\nThey have also targeted two other Obamacare tax hikes on the earnings and investments of those making more than $250,000 a year.\n\nBut there is compelling evidence that if the Republicans go ahead next month and scrap all the taxes hikes as part of an overall repeal of the Affordable Care Act, they will not have enough revenue to finance a replacement plan.\n\nObamacare operating costs are likely to total $1.24 trillion between 2019 and 2026, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

And that\u2019s even if they assume the economy is near full employment the entire time, and that there are no new wars or crises that would further drain the coffers.\n\nThese projections are remarkably conservative and assume there will be no new major changes in taxes or spending \u2013 which we all know will not be the case. Trump and the House Republicans have unveiled tax plans that would slash federal revenues by $6 trillion and $2.5 trillion, respectively, according to Tax Policy Center and Penn-Wharton Budget Model estimates. And that\u2019s even after accounting for the positive effects on economic growth that Trump and the GOP are claiming.\n\n\u201cBut leading Republicans have sent mixed signals about how big any tax cuts will be, with some Congressional leaders suggesting their plan will be revenue neutral.

By including that, the debt figures would go higher. However, they also do not account for increased economic growth and lower government spending.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) tamped down expectations last week by telling reporters he wants to avoid \u201ca $1 trillion stimulus, according to the Associated Press.

Donald Trump will take office on January 20th, and leave his long career as a real-estate developer and resort mogul behind. Or more accurately, Trump will leave some of it behind \u2013 and that\u2019s where the problems begin.\n\nIt has become customary for presidents to put their assets into a blind trust or other hands-off financial structure after first liquidating significant assets that might present a conflict of interest. Federal law requires executive branch officials to use blind trusts, but the separation-of-powers doctrine makes the applicability to the president and vice-president questionable at best. Still, those occupying the highest office have found it politically appropriate, at the very least, to put their personal financial interests at arms\u2019 length from their policy decisions.\n\nBarack Obama moved his assets into index funds and bonds with full disclosure in order to settle the question \u2013 but not a blind trust. In April 2010, more than a year after taking office, The Washington Post took notice on how the now-outgoing president \u201chas rejected the approach taken by most of his predecessors in the modern era\u201d by simply converting assets into Treasuries and widely diversified funds.\n\nRelated: Conflicts of Interest With Trump\u2019s Businesses Are Already Occurring\n\nThe Post\u2019s Michael Shear pointed out that then-mayor and multi-billionaire Bloomberg had not put his assets in a blind trust either. Bloomberg adviser Kenneth Gross dismissed the need for Obama to use a blind trust, arguing that his investments would have little to do with presidential policy. \"He's got his money in exactly the kinds of investments that don't require a blind trust.\"\n\nThat didn\u2019t keep Obama free of all allegations of potential conflicts of interest. A 2011 controversy at the FCC over spectrum allocations involving a venture firm called LightSquared reached the White House when a four-star Air Force general accused Obama\u2019s aides of pressuring him into altering Congressional testimony in favor of the firm. Three months earlier, the Huffington Post had reported that several well-connected Democratic donors and officeholders had taken stakes in LightSquared, including \u201cObama himself\u201d as \u201can early investor\u201d who \u201cremains close to other early investors.\u201d\n\nLightSquared eventually lost the fight long after the media lost the minimal interest it showed about the conflict of interest. It nonetheless demonstrates the political risks involved in refusing blind trusts. Obama\u2019s predecessors utilized them as a ready shield against critics of their policies. And as recent coverage of the potential for conflicts between Trump\u2019s personal finances and his responsibilities as president, the president-elect can\u2019t count on media disinterest to shield him.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Kids Are on His Transition Team: A Serious Conflict of Interest?\n\nTrump\u2019s good business fortune makes it more difficult to resolve those potential conflicts. Where Obama\u2019s assets were primarily investments that could easily be liquidated or converted, Trump\u2019s holdings are primarily real estate in an empire that remains a personal and family business. Even if Trump was inclined to liquidate, it could take years to unwind his properties in a rational manner \u2013 and he\u2019s clearly not inclined to liquidate. Like most men and women who build personal business empires, Trump wants to pass the business along to his children.\n\nThe conflict-of-interest issue will only get amplified as a result of Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks, most of whom are top executives at firms such as Goldman Sachs and Exxon. Wilbur Ross, Trump\u2019s nominee as Secretary of Commerce, is a billionaire investor whose position would directly impact his portfolio. Some have already begun to notice a pattern of benefit just from being mentioned as a potential member of the next administration. Federal laws and rules would apply to these officials, which is why the Trump team has begun to look at whether discretionary blind trusts could be used to satisfy the requirements \u2013 as well as Trump\u2019s political needs.\n\nA discretionary trust would allow Trump to retain ownership of the assets while being run by either a family member or a trusted third party. The principal benefit for Trump would be the elimination of the need to liquidate his assets, which a true blind trust would require in order to shield the president from questions about conflicts of interest. However, a discretionary trust allows the trustee to communicate with the owners about business matters, which would negate the political benefits of the trust for the Trumps \u2013 and probably fail to satisfy the legal requirements for Trump\u2019s Cabinet to boot.\n\nRelated: Trump: Nobody but the Media Cares About Conflicts of Interest\n\nRichard Painter, who served as George W. Bush\u2019s ethics lawyer, told Politico that a discretionary trust would be \u201chighly inappropriate,\u201d and leaving existing assets in place while determining policy would constitute \u201ca violation of at least the spirit of the rules.\u201d That might still be a problem even if his children buy him out completely. In one potential demonstration of this futility, foreign governments have already begun toadying up to Trump through his resorts. We can expect more of these efforts after the inauguration. In short, we have a mess that won\u2019t be quickly or easily resolved.\n\nWill voters care enough about this to damage his political capital? So far it seems to have done little to dampen enthusiasm for Trump among his supporters, and a new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll suggests he\u2019ll have a honeymoon with a broader range of voters as he takes office. After all, over sixty-two million voters voted for the businessman even with the potential for these conflicts already apparent, and they may be inclined to give Trump a pass \u2013 at least until they suffer some disillusion over his governing choices.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Massive Global Business Footprint Can Subvert US National Security\n\nThat may come sooner rather than later.

At the heart of their argument was the assurance that Trump\u2019s plans for a massive tax cut wouldn\u2019t harm the federal budget because of offsetting gains from his trade policy.\n\n\u201cIn considering how to score these competing plans fiscally, it is important to note that the Trump plan generates positive and substantial tax revenue offsets from its synergistic suite of trade, regulatory, and energy policy reforms,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAny analysis that scores the Trump tax cuts in isolation is incomplete and highly misleading.\u201d\n\nIn their analysis, they argued that the gains from trade could be expected to add $1.74 trillion in additional tax revenue to the U.S. Treasury over the space of 10 years.\n\nEconomists -- particularly conservative economists with a free trade bent -- were incredulous.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s $1Trillion Infrastructure Plan Raises a Red Flag\n\nAn economist from the Tax Foundation called it \u201cnonsense.\u201d Another from the Cato Institute tweeted out the hashtag #WeAreAllDoomed. A conservative Canadian financial columnist warned a colleague not to even try reading it, predicting, \u201cyou will poke your eyes out with hot spikes.\u201d\n\nMany economists were troubled by the paper\u2019s apparent assertion that simply by exporting more and importing less, the U.S. GDP would grow dramatically. Experts said that prediction flies in the face of basic economic theory about what contributes to GDP growth.\n\nThe paper also advocated a far more confrontational approach to dealing with international partners such as the World Trade Organization, threatening to pull out of the organization entirely unless U.S. goods receive more favorable treatment.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump understands that the only way to correct this unfair tax treatment is for the US to use its status as the world\u2019s largest economy, the world\u2019s largest consumer, and the world\u2019s largest importer to put pressure on the WTO to change this unequal treatment,\u201d Navarro and Ross write. \u201cWithout the US as a member, there would not be much purpose to the WTO, but prior occupants in the White House have been unwilling to lead on this issue despite its significant negative impacts.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump Proposes $1 Trillion for Infrastructure Without Raising Taxes\n\nAgain, trade economists were stunned at this proposal, which one described as \u201cplaying chicken with the WTO.\u201d They argued that the idea that the U.S. could strong-arm the WTO -- a body where all decisions must be unanimous -- is fanciful.\n\nBut it\u2019s precisely the willingness to ignore conventional thinking about trade policy that makes Navarro so attractive to Trump.\n\nThe transition team release noted, \u201cNavarro has been instrumental in challenging the prevailing Washington orthodoxy on so-called free trade.\u201d\n\nA statement attributed directly to Trump said, \u201cI read one of Peter\u2019s books on America\u2019s trade problems years ago and was impressed by the clarity of his arguments and thoroughness of his research. He has presciently documented the harms inflicted by globalism on American workers, and laid out a path forward to restore our middle class. He will fulfill an essential role in my administration as a trade advisor.\"\n\nAlso in a prepared statement, Navarro said, \u201cI am deeply honored for the opportunity to serve the President-elect and this nation and to advise on policies to rebalance our trade, rebuild our industrial base, and restore America\u2019s comprehensive national power by making America great again.\u201d"}, {"date": "", "title": "Outraged by Spiking Drug Prices, Congress Tiptoes Around Price Controls ", "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2016/12/21/Outraged-Spiking-Drug-Prices-Congress-Tiptoes-Around-Price-Controls", "text": "A bipartisan Senate Aging Committee report on predatory drug pricing released on Wednesday highlights a now familiar rogue\u2019s gallery of pharmaceutical companies --including Turing and Valeant \u2013- that have shamelessly jacked up the prices of life-saving drugs that they exclusively control.\n\nThese companies engaged in marketing and pricing strategies worthy of the most cutthroat private equity firms, the committee found. They typically purchased decades-old, off-patent and previously affordable drugs and then abruptly raised the prices by staggering amounts. They have raked in billions in revenues at the expense of shocked consumers, insurers and government health agencies that purchase large quantities of drugs.\n\nRelated: Want to Pay Less than Half for Your Meds? Join the Throngs and Try Canada\n\nBy now it\u2019s an old story: Turing, once headed by bad-boy hedge fund businessman Martin Shkreli, raised the price of Darprim, used in treating a dangerous parasitic infection, by 5,000 percent \u2013 from $13.50 a pill to $750 per pill. Valeant, meanwhile, spiked the prices of two off-patent drugs, Cuprimine and Syprine, used to treat a rare genetic disease, from about $500 to about $24,000 for a 30-day supply.\n\nRetrophine Inc. and Rodelis Therapeutics, the two other drug companies that came under the Senate committee\u2019s scrutiny during a year-long investigation, engaged in similar practices and drove up the prices of some of their drugs by 2,000 percent or more.\n\nEach of the companies acquired a sole-sourced \u201cgold standard\u201d drug for which there is a small but desperate market. In most cases, the companies did nothing to improve on the drug or invest in further development. They also created a \u201cclosed distribution system\u201d to block competition, while they jacked up their prices, according to the report on drug pricing.\n\nIn some instances, investors actively encouraged company executives to pursue this hard-nosed strategy despite the unwelcome attention it received from the media, politicians and even federal investigators. And some of the companies were headed by senior managers \u201chailing from the hedge fund world\u201d who lacked experience in the drug industry, the report said.\n\nRelated: Prescription Drug Prices Headed for Double-Digit Increases in 2017\n\n\"The skyrocketing prices of prescription drugs affect every American family, particularly our seniors,\" Collins said in a statement. \u201cWe must work to stop the bad actors who are driving up the prices of drugs that they did nothing to develop at the expense of patients just because, as one executive essentially said, \u2018because I can.\u2019\"\n\nSen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said the business model of many drug companies are predatory and \u201cimmoral\u201d for the patients and taxpayers who ultimately foot the bill. This is especially galling, she said, because generic drug substitutes can be made for pennies per dose.\n\n\u201cWe've got to find ways to increase competition for medicines and ensure that patients and their families aren't being gouged,\u201d she said.\n\nDrug price gouging and other predatory practices have triggered angry calls for congressional action from consumer advocates, insurers, politicians and others staggering under the weight of mounting health care costs. High-cost specialty drug prices are projected to increase 18.7 percent next year, after growing 18.9 percent in 2016, according to HR Consultancy Segal. At the same time, the overall cost of all drugs prescribed for employees under age 65 is expected to grow 11.6 percent next year, on top of an 11.3 percent hike this year.\n\nSlideshow: The 10 Most Frequently Prescribed Drugs in America\n\nDuring the campaign, Republican President-elect Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton repeatedly raised the issue of soaring drug prices and outlined possible solutions.\n\nTrump told Time magazine recently after being chosen the \u201cPerson of the Year,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to bring down drug prices. I don\u2019t like what\u2019s happened with drug prices.\u201d\n\nBut the nagging question is what can be done in a practical way to halt the unscrupulous drug pricing practices of the industry? And here, the Senate committee sidestepped the most obvious answer: government controls.\n\nCanada, which boasts some of the lowest drug prices in the world, pioneered federal and provincial level measures for containing drug prices, including a national drug formulary to set prices and the creation of a semi-judicial body that controls factory-gate prices. Governments across the globe impose tough limitations on drug prices, and multi-national pharmaceutical companies have learned to live with them and still thrive economically.\n\n\u201cThe problem with the Senate report is that the issue is so complicated that there are no simple solutions,\u201d Joseph Antos, a health care expert with the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said in an interview today. \u201cIf they wanted to say they did something, then this idea of essentially imposing price controls would certainly be popular with Democrats and some Republicans, especially in this space of older drugs that have a limited market.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump Jolts the Pharmaceutical Industry with Vow to \u2018Bring Down Drug Prices\u2019\n\n\u201cThe risk there is that if you do that, then maybe the company that has a monopoly on that drug might say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s not worth it anymore,\u2019\u201d Antos added. \u201cAnd then, how do you get somebody else to go in?\u201d\n\nInstead of risking a head-on confrontation with Big PhRMA by calling for government price controls, Collins, McCaskill and other senators have urged a more back door approach. It is one that would help shake up and revitalize the market so that generic drug manufacturers would be more inclined to compete with producers of brand-name drugs.\n\nThe report provides a laundry list of ideas for spurring competition and putting heat on unscrupulous drug manufacturers like Turing and Valeant.\n\nOne approach, which already has been blessed by Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), is to remove legal barriers to the re-importation of certain drugs to this country from Canada and overseas, in order to put competitive pressure on U.S. manufacturers that currently have a lock on certain drugs. Millions of Americans have for years quietly purchased drugs from Canada and overseas to save money, and this proposal would make it legal in many cases.\n\nRelated: How Big Pharma Lobbyists Keep Medicare Drug Prices High\n\nHowever, there would be numerous safety issues to deal with, including whether the government can sanction the sale of drugs in this country that have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). And Trump and his campaign staff have not provided further details on the extent of their support for this idea.\n\n\u201cThe Committee believes the temporary importation may be a viable short-term solution to combat sudden price spikes,\u201d the report states, \u201cbut notes that while this approach is favored by a number of academic professionals, many caution that are must be taken in structuring such a regime to avoid unintended consequences.\u201d\n\nThe committee also recommended ways to speed up FDA approval of generic alternatives to high-priced brand drugs, including limiting the review process to five months and requiring manufacturers of newly introduced brand drugs to share samples of their drugs with potential rivals. That would enable generic manufactures to conduct tests on the samples to prove that their drugs are as effective as the brand name drug.\n\nRelated: Two Big Reasons Prescription Drug Prices Are So Much Higher in the US\n\nFinally, the committee report takes a swipe at \u201cpatient assistance programs\u201d offered by major drug companies to help low-income consumers pay for their drugs.

Musk was also invited to a special meeting with the President-elect, a Tech Summit, at Trump Tower, last week. Further piquing the media\u2019s curiosity, Musk was said to have been invited to another, much more intimate meeting, with Trump and Apple\u2019s CEO Tim Cook after the summit.\n\nPolitical and business observers seem to be unanimous about the significance of these moves by Trump. Firstly, Musk\u2019s appointment to the advisory body and his participation in the Tech Summit underline the importance of Tesla, SpaceX and Musk\u2019s solar business in the respective industries.\n\nRelated: Gas Prices Are Headed Higher for the Holidays\n\nSecondly, it looks like Donald Trump is indeed keeping an open mind on climate change, as he stated in an interview for the New York Times.\n\nThirdly, and perhaps more importantly, the move demonstrates that job creation is indeed a top priority for the future administration \u2013 Musk has a brilliant track record as an employer, having created 30,000 jobs already, 25,000 of which have been in the U.S., and planning to add another 3,000 soon to its Fremont car factory.\n\nThe implications of Musk\u2019s appointment, however, are much more far-reaching. In fact, the attention given him by the President-elect and his transition team suggests that Trump is ready to make peace with the renewables industry despite what he said more than once about climate change on the campaign trail.\n\nThe truth, which the President-elect seems to be aware of, is that there is no going back on electric vehicles. The fact that he invited Musk to his Tech Summit is a demonstration of this awareness. Whatever Trump\u2019s stance on fossil fuels, he seems to have realized EVs have their own place in the larger scheme of things, especially in light of his pledge to help the U.S. tech business \u201ckeep going with the incredible innovation.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump Family Sells Access to the President to Raise Money for Private Charity\n\nThe fact that as part of this incredible innovation Tesla\u2019s Model 3 alone can take out 300,000 bpd of gasoline from U.S. daily demand by 2035 seems to be of no concern. First, 2035 is far in the future and second, until then the energy industry will be sure to have found a way to cope with the EV trend.\n\nThe EV revolution is being led by four companies in the U.S. \u2013 Tesla, Uber, Alphabet, and Apple. All four CEOs were at the Tech Summit. It\u2019s unlikely that Donald Trump or his team are unaware that Alphabet just spun off its self-driving electric car project into a separate company, Waymo; that Uber is already offering ride-sharing services using EVs in London; and that Apple is working on its own EV, the iCar.\n\nThese are developments that could represent the meeting point between two of Trump\u2019s priorities: supporting business in general and the mining industry specifically.\n\nThe EV revolution will boost demand for lithium like nothing else, whatever skeptics are saying. Government support for this revolution will make this demand boost all the greater. In short, it\u2019s a win-win situation for all parties concerned, and the green energy lobby could allow itself a small sigh of relief that maybe Trump\u2019s presidency will not turn the U.S. into Fossil Fuel Hell on earth.\n\nThis article originally appeared on OilPrice.com.

When the program was first proposed just before the turn of the century, the Navy estimated that building 32 ships would cost about $46 billion.

But a new report from the White House warns that unless the U.S. is smart about preparing for a future in which many, many more jobs are automated, the country runs the risk of a severely unequal distribution of the benefits from the increased efficiency that automation brings.\n\nTo a great degree, automation has already had a dramatic effect on the U.S. labor market. Political rhetoric aside, manufacturing output in the United States is at historic highs. But automation of many factory processes has made it possible to increase output with fewer workers.\n\nRelated: The Robot Revolution Could Wipe Out 5.1 Million Jobs by 2020\n\nThe report, a combined effort by the Council of Economic Advisers, the National Economic Council, the Domestic Policy Council, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the Chief Technology Officer, says that further automation is not only going to continue, but advances in artificial intelligence (AI) make it likely that it will accelerate in coming years.\n\n\u201cThese transformations will open up new opportunities for individuals, the economy, and society, but they have the potential to disrupt the current livelihoods of millions of Americans,\u201d the report finds.\n\nCiting a recent CEA report, the authors note, \u201cthere is growing concern about a general reduction in competition among firms for workers and a commensurate shift in the balance of bargaining power toward employers. Market concentration resulting from the development of AI has the potential to worsen these trends. A displacement of workers from industries being disrupted by AI-driven automation would also create slack in the labor market in the short to medium-run, which is likely to depress wages.\u201d\n\nThe report calls for a strong policy response to assure that workers are able to share in the economic growth that results from increased automation. That would include strengthening the social safety net and empowering labor unions in negotiations with employers. (Both steps that would be extremely difficult to achieve in the current political environment.)\n\nRelated: Robots Muscle in on the Gig Economy\n\nOverall, the White House report advocates a three-pronged approach to preparing for a future remade by AI that includes aggressive investment in the very research and technology that is expected to disrupt the labor market.\n\n\u201cIf care is taken to responsibly maximize its development, AI will make important, positive contributions to aggregate productivity growth, and advances in AI technology hold incredible potential to help the United States stay on the cutting edge of innovation,\u201d the report finds. \u201cGovernment has an important role to play in advancing the AI field by investing in research and development.\n\nAlongside investment in research and development, the report suggests, the country should also prioritize education and training that prepares workers for a world in which simple tasks are increasing automated, making educational achievement vital to employment prospects. For example, the report estimates that more than 80 percent of jobs that currently paid an average of $20 or less per hour in 2010 are likely to be automated in the future.\n\n\u201cAs AI changes the nature of work and the skills demanded by the labor market, American workers will need to be prepared with the education and training that can help them continue to succeed,\u201d the report finds. Delivering this education and training will require significant investments.\u201d\n\nRelated: Will the US Unleash an Army of Killer Robots? Ask Clinton or Trump\n\nThe report calls for funding of robust educational programs from childhood on, \u201cso that all families can prepare their students for continued education, as well as investing in graduating all students from high school college- and career-ready, and ensuring that all Americans have access to affordable post-secondary education.\u201d\n\nFinally, the report recognizes that increasing automation will inevitably lead to disruption, particularly for low-skilled people already in the workforce. This will require, among other things, modernizing the social safety net, including unemployment insurance, Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).\n\nThe authors of the report take a hopeful stance toward the ability of public policy to address the most disruptive effects of increasing automation.\n\n\u201cTechnology is not destiny; economic incentives and public policy can play a significant role in shaping the direction and effects of technological change. Given appropriate attention and the right policy and institutional responses, advanced automation can be compatible with productivity, high levels of employment, and more broadly shared prosperity.\u201d"}, {"date": "", "title": "Want to Pay Less than Half for Your Meds?

Trump also embraced another idea that was favored by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Sen.

Many U.S. drug manufacturers market their products throughout the world and negotiate different price structures in virtually every country.\n\nThe idea of lowering barriers to overseas drugs has been around for a long time, fueled by reports showing that Americans pay some of the highest prescription drug prices in the world. Countries like Canada, Mexico, Great Britain, South America and India pay far less because prices are typically dictated by the government. According to the International Federation of Health Plans, Americans pay anywhere from between two and six times what the rest of the world pays for brand name prescription drugs.\n\nFor instance, last year Gleevec, a cancer treatment drug, cost Americans and their insurers $6,214 per month for treatments, while Canadians paid only $1,141 and residents of Great Britain paid $2,697 per month, as CNN reported. It was a similar situation with Humira, a drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis that cost U.S. residents $2,246 per monthly treatment compared with $881 in Switzerland and $1,102 in England.\n\nSlideshow: The 10 Most Frequently Prescribed Drugs in America\n\nA December 2015 international drug cost survey by Bloomberg concluded that prices for brand-name drugs are typically much higher in the U.S. than in other developed countries, even when factoring in the discounts and rebates that pharmaceutical companies frequently provide to insurers, government agencies such as the Veterans Administration and Medicaid. Even with discounts of as much as 50 percent to 60 percent, seven out of ten top-selling brand name drugs were still much costlier in the U.S. than overseas.\n\nThose drugs included Crestor, a pill to lower cholesterol; Lantos, a long-acting insulin; Advair, an asthma inhaler; Januvia, a pill to treat diabetes; Sovaldi, the wonder drug for treating the Hepatitis-C virus; Humira, a rheumatoid arthritis drug self- injector; and Herceptin, an infusion for the treatment of cancer.\n\nIn the case of Sovaldi, manufactured by Gilead Sciences in California, one pill for treating Hep-C cost $1,000 in the United States but only $4 in India, where the manufacturer agreed to lower the price in exchange for volume sales.\n\nAs the cost of prescription drugs in this country continues to mount, millions of Americans appear to be taking matters into their own hands and looking overseas for relief \u2013 even if that may require breaking the law. It has long been known that many Americans routinely purchase prescription drugs on the Internet or while traveling to Canada, Mexico or other countries.\n\nRelated: Trump Jolts the Pharmaceutical Industry with Vow to \u2018Bring Down Drug Prices\u2019\n\nPricey specialty drug prices are projected to increase 18.7 percent next year, after growing 18.9 percent in 2016, according to HR Consultancy Segal. Meanwhile, the overall cost of all drugs prescribed for employees under age 65 is expected to grow 11.6 percent next year, on top of an 11.3 percent hike this year, as The Fiscal Times reported recently.\n\nA new Kaiser Family Foundation national poll conducted in November found that eight percent of those interviewed said they or someone in their household had imported a drug at some point. That would be the equivalent of about 19 million adults, based on current census estimates.\n\nThose people ranged from college students in their 20s to retirees in their 80s, according to the analysis. Some purchased medication to treat high blood pressure and other chronic conditions. Others acquired the drugs to treat acute problems like sinus infections and acne.\n\nThose numbers, if accurate, indicate a major surge in the number of Americans seeking bargain-basement drug prices from neighboring countries or overseas \u2013 or at least an increase in the number of people willing to openly discuss it. Previous government surveys dating back to 2011 suggested that the share of Americans buying prescription drugs from other countries was about two percent, according to the report.\n\nRelated: How Big Pharma Lobbyists Keep Medicare Drug Prices High\n\nSome people may have been reluctant to talk about their health care costs or admit that they have turned to overseas markets for better deals, according to experts.\n\nBut with Trump and some prominent Democrats and independents endorsing the idea of drug re-importation as a cost-saving measure, average Americans may feel more comfortable about admitting that they have been quietly engaging in those transactions for years.\n\nIt is illegal for individuals to import drugs into the U.S. for personal use, according to the Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Customs officials. The basic argument that federal authorities use against drug re-importation is one of safety. That is because many drugs from other countries that are available for purchase by individuals here have not been formally approved by the FDA for sale in the United States \u2013 and may not be safe for use.\n\n\u201cFDA cannot ensure the safety and effectiveness of drugs that it has not approved,\u201d the agency says on its website.\n\nRelated: Two Big Reasons Prescription Drug Prices Are So Much Higher in the US\n\nThat\u2019s a far-fetched argument to make in discouraging drug purchases from countries like Canada or Great Britain whose health care standards are on par with those of the United States. However, it may have more sway in arguing against buying drugs from other countries in Europe, Latin America, South America and Asia, or from acquiring drugs on through the internet.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry \u2013 which has long opposed drug re-importation because of the adverse impact it would have on its profits in this country\u2013 cites World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 10 percent of medicines worldwide \u2013 and up to 50 percent of the drugs consumed in developing nations \u2013 are counterfeit.\n\n\u201cWithout proper FDA oversight and enforcement of laws designed to protect patient safety\u2014which importation undermines\u2014 these products could infiltrate the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain, with life-threatening consequences,\u201d Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the drug industry\u2019s chief lobbying arm, has argued.\n\nHowever, the FDA and customs officials have not been overly aggressive in enforcing the law \u2013 although U.S. border inspectors have broad discretion in deciding whether to destroy the drugs if they are discovered at a point of entry. And the FDA says that it \u201ctypically does not object to personal imports of drugs that FDA has not approved under certain circumstances.\u201d\n\nFor example, the FDA makes exceptions for a drug needed for a serious condition for which effective treatment is not available in the United States, or in cases where there is no commercialization or promotion of the drug to U.S. residents."}]
