Joni Ernst (R) from telling her constituents there that she is perturbed by the president\u2019s frequent jaunts to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla.\n\n\u201cI do wish he would spend more time in Washington, D.C. That is what we have the White House for,\u201d Ernst said at a town hall meeting Tuesday in Wall Lake, Iowa. She said she has not spoken to Trump about \u201cthe Florida issue,\u201d but it \u201chas been bothering not just me, but some other members of our caucus.\u201d\n\nAs Republican lawmakers face questions from their constituents back home, some elected leaders have been willing to break with their party\u2019s president. Although they generally support Trump\u2019s agenda on such priorities as a tax overhaul and health care, these Republicans are criticizing the president over his continued refusal to make public his tax returns, as past presidents have, and his costly trips to Florida.\n\nSome of those criticizing Trump are not moderates eager to establish political independence, but rather conservatives from red states who are popular with the voters who propelled Trump into office.\n\nSen.

The American people are a lot more concerned about their own taxes than President Trump\u2019s, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s focused on.\u201d\n\nDemocratic leaders are connecting the two issues, however, threatening to block Trump\u2019s efforts to overhaul the tax code unless he releases his tax returns so the public can determine whether he would personally benefit from the legislative changes.\n\nMar-a-Lago, President Trump\u2019s private resort in Palm Beach, Fla. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nTrump has had plenty of defenders, of course. At a town hall meeting Monday in Little Rock, one man asked Sen.

One woman stood and shook her head as the senator finished his response.\n\nSome Republican campaign operatives said their party\u2019s politicians would be wise to move on from the tax returns debate, recognizing that it may be nearly impossible to persuade Trump to do something he has steadfastly refused to do.\n\n\u201cAnyone who thought Trump would ever release his taxes is mistaken,\u201d said Alice Stewart, a GOP consultant. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen \u2014 no way, no how. Everybody has to get used to that idea.\u201d\n\nStill, the list of Republican senators and House members saying Trump should release his tax returns has grown to at least a dozen.\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said this week on CNN that releasing his tax returns is \u201cthe right thing to do.\u201d Several other GOP House members \u2014 including some House Freedom Caucus conservatives \u2014 have either signed a letter calling on Trump to release his returns or backed a Democratic measure to force their release.\n\nOn Tuesday in rural Rogers County, Okla., where Trump won 76 percent of the vote last November, Lankford was asked at a town hall meeting about Trump\u2019s decision not to release his tax returns.\n\n\u201cHe promised he would,\u201d Lankford responded, according to the Tulsa World newspaper. \u201cHe should keep his promise.\u201d\n\nRep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) was quick to join her colleagues, saying in a statement Wednesday that Trump \u201cshould release his taxes voluntarily like his predecessors did before him.\u201d She went on to say, \u201cIf the investigative committees believe that they need the president\u2019s taxes during the course of their investigations [into Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 campaign] then it is in their right to subpoena them.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s frequent trips to Mar-a-Lago have also been raising concerns in the GOP. He has spent seven of the 13 weekends since he has been president at his Florida resort, often combining golf outings and leisurely meals with official business, such as the visits of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like him going down to Mar-a-Lago, or wherever it is,\u201d Rep.

I\u2019m all for agreements, but that was a bad one, as bad as I\u2019ve ever seen negotiated.\u201d\n\nThe president's comments came in a nearly 20-minute news conference Thursday afternoon with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, with Trump weighing in on several global trouble spots, including Iran, North Korea and Libya.\n\n\u201cIran has not lived up to the spirit of the agreement, and they have to do that, they have to do that,\u201d the president said.\n\nAsked whether Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea, was mentally unstable, Trump demurred.\n\n\u201cI can't answer your question on stability,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope the answer is a positive one, not a negative one. But, hopefully, that will be something that gets taken care of.\u201d\n\nThe president also repeated his calls for China to play a larger role in helping pressure North Korea, a dictatorship whose nuclear weapons program has caused deep consternation around the world and created special tension with the United States.\n\nTrump said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping have a strong relationship of mutual respect \u2014 while noting that he told Xi that he plans to use trade negotiations as a bargaining chip to force China to engage more on pushing North Korea to limit its nuclear ambitions.\n\n\u201cI actually told him, I said, \u2018You\u2019ll make a much better deal on trade if you get rid of this menace or doing something about the menace of North Korea, because that\u2019s what it is, it\u2019s a menace right now,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nAnd shortly after the Italian prime minister said that a U.S. role in Libya was critical, Trump, in response to a question about whether he believes his administration should play a part in helping to stabilize that country, said bluntly, \u201cI do not see a role in Libya.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the United States has, right now, enough roles,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a role everywhere, so I do not see that.\u201d\n\nBut, he added, \u201cI do see a role in getting rid of ISIS.\u201d ISIS is an alternative acronym for the Islamic State militant group.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a horrible thing to say, but we have no choice and we are effectively ridding the world of ISIS,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI see that as a primary role, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do, whether it\u2019s in Iraq or in Libya or anywhere else, and that role will come to an end at a certain point and we\u2019ll be able to go back home and rebuild our country, which is what I want to do.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trump-says-the-us-has-enough-roles-in-the-world/2017/04/20/1ff9ef24-260a-11e7-928e-3624539060e8_video.html", "text": "- \"I do not see a role in Libya.

(Ross D. Franklin/Associated Press)\n\nFirst, candidate Donald Trump said a judge of Mexican descent couldn't give him a fair hearing.\n\nNow, President Trump's attorney general, Jeff Sessions, is suggesting that a judge from Hawaii \u2014 which he dismissively labels \u201can island in the Pacific\u201d \u2014 should not be able to strike down Trump's travel ban.\n\nHere's what Sessions told radio host Mark Levin on Wednesday, in audio uncovered by CNN's Andrew Kaczynski:\n\nWe are confident that the president will prevail on appeal and particularly in the Supreme Court, if not the Ninth Circuit. So this is a huge matter. I really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the president of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and Constitutional power.\n\nThere are a few problems with this.\n\nThe first is that Hawaii is a state and has been since 1959. Dismissing it as \u201can island in the Pacific\u201d is the kind of thing that will earn you the pleasure of apologizing to an entire state. We'll start the countdown clock.\n\nThe second is that the judge isn't a Hawaiian judge, per se. Derrick Watson is actually a federal judge who happens to serve on a district court in Hawaii. And in case you were wondering, he has some of that all-important mainland experience and perspective, having worked as a lawyer in San Francisco.\n\nAnd the third is that Hawaii does have major ports of entry, with international travelers arriving regularly. (We hear the beaches are nice or something?) Hence, it is affected by Trump's travel ban.\n\nThe Aloha State says President Trump's revised executive order still violates the Constitution. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post)\n\nThis is hardly the first time the Trump administration has sought to undercut or question the powers of judges who run afoul of Trump. There was Gonzalo Curiel, of course, and then there was Trump's lengthy campaign to question whether the courts even had the authority of overrule his travel ban.

(Nati Harnik/AP)\n\nThe Democratic candidate for mayor of Omaha, who\u2019s set to appear at a rally Thursday night with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), said earlier in the day that his personal views against abortion would not lead to antiabortion policies at City Hall.\n\n\u201cWhile my faith guides my personal views, as mayor I would never do anything to restrict access to reproductive health care,\u201d Heath Mello said in a statement Thursday morning.\n\nAn interview The Washington Post had scheduled with Mello was canceled due to the candidate\u2019s campaign schedule.\n\nThat statement came after NARAL Pro-Choice America had condemned Sanders and Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez for endorsing Mello and intending to campaign with him. NARAL\u2019s president, Ilyse Hogue, called the campaign stop \u201cpolitically stupid\u201d; Daily Kos, the progressive site that had been crowdsourcing donations for a series of campaigns in red states, pulled its endorsement of Mello after admitting it was unaware of his views about abortion.\n\nMello, a 37-year-old state senator who has out-fundraised Omaha\u2019s incumbent Republican mayor ahead of the May 9 election, has been highly touted by local Democrats. They lost the mayoralty in 2013, one in a string of defeats that had seen the party wiped out in Nebraska\u2019s major elected offices; in 2016, they lost the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District.\n\nNebraska Democrats scheduled Thursday\u2019s rally in Omaha to boost Mello and local activists, and after booking Sanders, they distributed close to 7,000 tickets.\n\nIn interviews with the Wall Street Journal and The Post, Sanders and Perez, who are touring together to promote local candidates, said Mello is a case study in how the party needs to elect candidates who sometimes diverge from the national platform.\n\n\u201cIf he were running in the People\u2019s Republic of Takoma Park, the voters might do it differently,\u201d Perez, a former Montgomery County Council member in Maryland and a past U.S. secretary of labor, said in an interview from Kentucky, the second stop on his speaking tour with Sanders. \u201cIf we have a one-size-fits-all requirement for every Democrat who seeks office, that\u2019s a formula for a filibuster-proof majorities in the Senate; that\u2019s a formula for failure in many areas of this country.\n\n\u201cIn order to execute a 50-state strategy, we need to understand what\u2019s going on in all 50 states, and attract candidates who are consistent with their messages but perhaps not on 100 percent of the issues,\u201d Perez said. \u201cIf you demand fealty on every single issue, then it\u2019s a challenge.\u201d\n\nSanders used some of the same framing to explain why Mello deserved progressive votes and support. \u201cI am 100 percent pro-choice, but not every candidate out there has my views 100 percent of the time,\u201d he said. \u201cTo have it 95 percent of the time, it makes sense to support him. If this fellow wins in Nebraska, that would be a shot across the bow \u2014 that in a state like Nebraska, a progressive Democrat can win. That will give the folks in more conservative states [the idea] that maybe they can run and win as well.\u201d\n\nComments like those raised the ire of NARAL, which like most national progressive groups had taken no position on the Mello race. On Wednesday, when Sanders\u2019s comments were printed in the Wall Street Journal, NARAL\u2019s Hogue asked how Democrats could back a candidate who had supported a bill introducing transvaginal ultrasounds for pregnant women, a goal of antiabortion groups.\n\n\u201cThe actions today by the DNC to embrace and support a candidate for office who will strip women \u2014 one of the most critical constituencies for the party \u2014 of our basic rights and freedom is not only disappointing, it is politically stupid,\u201d she said. \u201cToday\u2019s action makes this so-called \u2018fight back tour\u2019 look more like a throw-back tour for women and our rights.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Nebraska Democratic Party Chairwoman Jane Kleeb said that Mello had been wildly misrepresented. The 2009 ultrasound bill, she explained, had been a compromise. Republicans began the legislative session with a bill that would have required ultrasounds for pregnant women, to make sure they saw what their fetuses looked like before they could consider abortion.\n\n\u201cTony Fulton had the votes to pass the more restrictive bill,\u201d said Kleeb, referring to the main Republican sponsor. \u201cThe bill that Heath negotiated, and the bill that passed, says a woman can have the option of seeing the ultrasound.\u201d\n\nKleeb, who backed Sanders for president in 2016 and won the state party\u2019s chairmanship that year, said she was disappointed to see the Mello rally spiral into a battle between interest groups. The event would feature a speech from a Dreamer who\u2019d thank Mello for his immigration policy work; it would clear up attacks on Mello for backing the Keystone XL pipeline, pointing out that he favored limits on eminent domain and a liability fund paid for by energy companies.\n\n\u201cHeath was one of the very few people, even when it was controversial, to stand up for Dreamers,\u201d said Kleeb. \u201cHe is pro-life. A lot of Dems are pro-life. That is a reality that I share. I was pro-life until 2004 \u2014 I mean, my mom was president of Broward County Right to Life. Does that mean that I\u2019m not a Democrat, that I\u2019m not a progressive?\u201d\n\nThat tension has simmered inside the Democratic Party since last year. NARAL\u2019s Hogue, a member of the DNC\u2019s platform committee, helped insert language that put the party on record against the Hyde and Helms amendments, which every Congress now passes to block any federal funds paying for abortions. The change briefly flummoxed Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), the party\u2019s 2016 vice presidential nominee, who had run and won statewide with moderate abortion views.\n\nAnd in Virginia, where Sanders has endorsed former representative Tom Perriello for governor, NARAL has backed Perriello\u2019s opponent on the grounds that the former congressman supported the Stupak Amendment, language that would have restricted funding from the Affordable Care Act along the same lines as Hyde.\n\nIn an interview, Hogue said that Mello\u2019s statement did not end questions about his abortion record.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to say you\u2019re not going to do anything new when you\u2019ve already done everything you can,\u201d she said. \u201cOne politically expedient statement doesn\u2019t erase a very clear track record.

(Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThursday is Donald Trump\u2019s 90th full day as president of the United States.\n\nIn March 2016, before he secured the Republican nomination for the presidency and well before he won the general election, Trump sat down for an interview with The Washington Post\u2019s Robert Costa and Bob Woodward. Over the course of that interview, Trump was asked what he hoped to accomplish in his first 90 days, should he be lucky enough to be elected president.\n\nHere\u2019s what he said:\n\nTrump: What I would do \u2014 and before I talk about legislation, because I think frankly this is more important \u2014 number one, it\u2019s going to be a very big tax cut. Because the middle class has been \u2026 And Larry Kudlow and numerous people have liked very much \u2026 You know, I put in a plan for tax cuts, and I\u2019ve gotten some very good reviews. I would do a tax cut. You have to do a tax cut. Because we\u2019re the highest-taxed nation in the world. But I would start \u2014 because I noticed your question briefly \u2014 boom, what would you do in the first 90 days? I would immediately start renegotiating our trade deals with Mexico, China, Japan and all of these countries that are just absolutely destroying us. And they have been for years. It\u2019s an incredible tribute to our country that we can lose billions \u2014 hundreds of billions \u2014 of dollars consistently, year in and year out \u2014 and still even survive. We have rebuilt China. We have rebuilt it. I mean, you look at what\u2019s going on in China. We have rebuilt China single-handedly. Now, they\u2019ve done okay with Europe, too, but \u2026 Costa: So renegotiate trade deals and have a tax cut. That would be your first 100 days? Trump: Renegotiate trade deals and renegotiate military deals. Costa: Real quick on trade deals \u2026 Trump: And by the way, and renegotiate with NATO. And renegotiate with Japan \u2026\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate his progress.\n\n\u201cA very big tax cut.\u201d For some reason, Trump framed his push for a tax cut as not being \u201cabout legislation.\u201d Regardless, the administration hasn\u2019t yet pressed Congress to take up tax reform. Shortly after taking office, Trump and Republican leaders in the House agreed to first tackle an overhaul of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 Obamacare \u2014 before moving on to change the tax system. Optimistic estimates figured that both could be achieved by August, a longer time frame than 90 days, but still an early effort.\n\nThe Obamacare overhaul collapsed last month, though the administration appears to be working on an effort to resuscitate it. On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin declared that enacting tax reform by August was \u201chighly aggressive to not realistic.\u201d\n\nHad the House and the Senate passed the Obamacare overhaul in March, it would have fallen in that 90-day window. But the time frame Trump promised on the repeal of Obamacare was 89 days shorter.\n\n\u201cRenegotiate trade deals.\u201d Within days of taking office, Trump pledged to immediately address trade deals, including the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), by quickly signing an executive order. On Jan. 23, he officially ended participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership with such an order.\n\nBut after that, things stalled. In late March, the administration again promised to sign an order reviewing NAFTA and a similar agreement with Central American countries. What emerged, though, was an executive order looking at the trade deficit and the possibility of new tariffs. He also signed an order emphasizing the use of American-made products, which is only tangentially related to NAFTA.\n\nTo renegotiate that agreement, Trump needs to inform Congress 90 days before such discussions begin. That hasn\u2019t happened. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that will probably be coming in a few weeks. Of course, he said that in early March.\n\n\u201cRenegotiate military deals,\u201d \u201crenegotiate with NATO\u201d and \u201crenegotiate with Japan.\u201d One of the things Trump emphasized during his campaign was that he felt as though the United States was being taken advantage of in its interactions with foreign governments. For example, during the first presidential debate, he said: \u201cWe defend Japan. We defend Germany. We defend South Korea. We defend Saudi Arabia. We defend countries. They do not pay us what they should be paying us, because we are providing a tremendous service and we\u2019re losing a fortune.\u201d\n\nGermany, of course, is one of the countries that\u2019s part of NATO. Trump also complained that NATO members weren\u2019t paying their \u201cdues\u201d \u2014 his term for countries not committing 2 percent of GDP to military spending, per the terms of the NATO mandate.\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t appear to have begun any sort of formal renegotiation with any of these partners. When German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the White House last month, Trump reportedly pressed her on committing more spending to the military, but he doesn\u2019t seem to have received any such commitment.\n\nHe has claimed success in one renegotiation: The cost of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, from which Trump says he was able to trim $700 million. Our fact-checkers, though, note that the cost reductions were already in the works.\n\nBefore he was inaugurated, Trump made an additional 90-day pledge on Twitter. Within that window, he said, he\u2019d release \u201ca full report on hacking\u201d related to Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election.\n\nTotally made up facts by sleazebag political operatives, both Democrats and Republicans \u2013 FAKE NEWS!

(YouTube)\n\nDemocrats are increasingly bullish on their chances in Montana\u2019s May 25 special election, in which country-folk singer Rob Quist is competing for the state\u2019s sole seat in the House of Representatives. One problem: In a January interview, Quist floated the idea of legislation to create a registry for automatic weapons.\n\nPolitically, it didn\u2019t matter that he left handguns and rifles out of the idea, or that some heavy weapons already must be registered. Republicans, always looking for a kill shot, began portraying Quist as a gun grabber. An ad from the National Republican Congressional Committee threw images of hunting rifles on-screen and said Quist would create a \u201cgun registry,\u201d leaving the impression that he\u2019d take away every gun he could.\n\nQuist\u2019s response comes in the surprisingly robust tradition of ads that feature candidates shooting guns. In \u201cDefend,\u201d Quist sets up a shot at a TV screen that\u2019s playing the ad in question.\n\n\u201cFor generations, this old rifle has protected my family\u2019s ranch,\u201d said Quist. \u201cI won\u2019t stand by while a millionaire from New Jersey tries to attack my Montana values.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cmillionaire\u201d is Greg Gianforte, Quist\u2019s Republican opponent, who settled in Bozeman 24 years ago but who Democrats have portrayed as an out-of-touch interloper. (This was effective in 2016, when Gianforte lost a bid for governor.) And the ad itself resembles \u201cDead Aim,\u201d a spot Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) ran in 2010 to blunt Republican attempts to tie him to the Obama administration.\n\nA key difference between those spots, though, is the salience of the gun issue. In 2010, as Manchin pointed out, he\u2019d won the endorsement of the National Rifle Association. But after the 2012 Newtown massacre, Democrats \u2014 who\u2019d been reluctantly ready to punt on gun bills \u2014 pushed for new background-check legislation. The NRA became even more of a partisan political player, spending nearly all of its political ad money on behalf of Republicans. In 2016, it endorsed Gianforte for governor, and Democrats expect it to go to the airwaves to attack Quist.\n\nAnd on Thursday, Gianforte set them up for it, with an ad demonstrating his opposition to a gun registry \u2014 by shooting a screen with a gun."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/gop-leaders-downplay-revisions-to-health-care-bill-offered-by-house-moderate/2017/04/20/3890a8f8-25d7-11e7-bb9d-8cd6118e1409_story.html", "text": "(Reuters)\n\nRepublicans, under heavy pressure from the White House, are inching closer to passing a bill to repeal and replace parts of the Affordable Care Act, but possible revisions released Thursday may not clinch a deal.\n\nThe White House said the plan is to circulate revised legislative language Thursday night, followed by a conference call Saturday to gauge support. A top White House official said a tentative aim is for the House to vote next Wednesday on the GOP-backed measure, which would roll back the law\u2019s major health coverage expansions and repeal its taxes and mandates.\n\nYet House Republican leaders are playing down the likelihood that changes to the GOP health-care measure proposed by moderate Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.) would win over enough conservative and moderate holdouts, who have butted heads over removing some of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s key insurance regulations.\n\n\u201cThe question is whether it can get 216 votes in the House, and the answer isn\u2019t clear at this time,\u201d a senior GOP aide said. \u201cThere is no legislative text and, therefore, no agreement to do a whip count on.\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear whether there\u2019s a pathway forward for the measure, which Republicans were forced to pull from the floor abruptly last month when too many members defected. Moderate Republicans worry about depriving consumers of certain health-care benefits, and some conservatives say they think the GOP plan leaves too much of the Democrats\u2019 health-care law in place.\n\n[Republicans try to revive health-care effort as leaders seek to temper expectations]\n\nMacArthur is trying to shore up moderate support for the bill with his amendment, which would reinstate the health-care law\u2019s \u201cessential health benefits,\u201d a list of federally mandated health services that marketplace plans must cover. The GOP measure as it stands would instead allow states to spell out essential health benefits.\n\nThe amendment may also appeal to conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus because it would give states a way to opt out of some insurance regulations. With special permission from the federal government, states could write their own essential health benefits and allow insurers to charge people with preexisting conditions higher premiums, as long as they also make a high-risk pool available to those patients.\n\n[Trump delivers ultimatum to House Republicans: Pass health-care measure on Friday or he\u2019ll move on]\n\nThe White House is pushing hard on the GOP-led Congress to pass legislation that would repeal and replace much of President Barack Obama\u2019s 2010 health-care law, as Republicans have vowed to do for years.\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said Wednesday night that fulfilling that goal is \u201calways a potential.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that our team has continued to work with members of the House in particular to see if there\u2019s a way forward,\u201d Spicer said on Fox News. \u201cAnd fortunately for us, I think the appetite to really get this done continues to grow. The enthusiasm is there.\u201d\n\nRepublicans departed for recess unable to agree on a replacement. They will return to Washington next week, and some are holding out hope that a deal can still be reached. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said Wednesday from London that Republicans are \u201cvery close\u201d to legislation that can pass the House.\n\nThe MacArthur amendment is likely to get more members on board, but lobbyists and aides say it might not tamp down enough objections from both ends of the Republican conference. Leaders of top health-care committees wouldn\u2019t commit to the amendment when contacted Thursday morning.\n\nA spokesman for House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.) said only that \u201cChairman Walden continues to work with all parties to find a consensus approach for repealing and replacing Obamacare to lower costs and increase choices for patients and families across the country.\u201d\n\nEven if the GOP measure eventually passes the House, it\u2019s likely to run into big logistical and political problems in the Senate, where moderates have concerns about it and special budget reconciliation rules limit what it can contain.\n\nRobert Costa contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/04/20/the-furthest-place-on-earth-from-the-trump-brand-a-ghost-town-on-a-desert-island/", "text": "The sun never sets on the Donald Trump business empire.\n\nThere are Trump-branded properties \u2014 hotels and golf courses, mostly \u2014 on four of the seven continents. If you\u2019re in New York City, you can easily embark on a walking tour of nearly a dozen Trump-owned properties in one afternoon. If you\u2019re more adventurous, you could go around Trump\u2019s world in well under 80 days, heading up to Trump International Hotel and Tower in Toronto and then over to Trump International Hotel and Tower in Vancouver, swinging by Trump International Hotel and Tower in Waikiki and then to Trump Tower at Century City in the Philippines. From there, off to Trump Tower in Mumbai and over to Trump International Golf Club in Dubai, then up to Trump Towers in Istanbul \u2014 ending your trip at Trump International Hotel and Golf Links in Doonberg, Ireland. Even skipping a few destinations, those jaunts are well within the range of the private jet that I assume you\u2019d use on your journey.\n\nBut you may have a different goal in mind. Perhaps your life\u2019s dream is to put as much distance as possible between yourself and a property that bears the president\u2019s last name. If that\u2019s your goal, we have to do a little math.\n\nThere\u2019s a thing called a Voronoi diagram which, simplified for our purposes, defines regions based upon how far they are from other points. The upshot is that the boundaries of the regions define places that are the farthest distance between two or more points. Using the mapping program QGIS, we can create Voronoi regions around Trump\u2019s properties.\n\nIf you want to escape Trump\u2019s presence permanently, we\u2019ll look for a place where the Voronoi lines take you as far away as possible from Trump properties.\n\nBased on the map above, it may seem like the best place is somewhere in northern Russia, or, perhaps, in the outer regions of Australia. But it isn\u2019t. The best place on Earth, the place farthest from any of these properties, is right here:\n\n(This is excluding Antarctica, which we assume is not somewhere that you\u2019d like to live.)\n\nThe closest Trump property from that location is 4,100 miles away, the golf club in Dubai. (There are actually two golf clubs in Dubai; this is the more western one.)\n\nThere is, in fact, the perfect location for those adventurous enough to seek it out: a small island off the coast of Angola that the Voronoi passes directly through. It is called Baia dos Tigres, once a sandy spit of land near the Angola-Namibia border that became an island in the 1960s when a heavy storm washed away the connection to the shore. (The \u201cTigres\u201d refers to the striped pattern formed by darker and lighter sand.) The storm also washed away the pipeline that was providing the island with fresh water, leaving the small population in the town of S\u00e3o Martinho dos Tigres having to ship in water from the mainland. When civil war broke out in Angola in the 1970s, the town was abandoned.\n\nAnd now it awaits you.\n\nThe town comes complete with an abandoned hospital, abandoned church, abandoned housing, abandoned industry \u2014 mostly fishmeal and fish oil \u2014 and an abandoned movie theater. In his September 2014 look at the town, reporter Dolf Els explains that a lot of the buildings have peeling paint and holes in the walls, but his photographs of the area depict an eminently livable space, if you don\u2019t mind a lot of sand and having not-a-lot of potable water.\n\nGetting there is tricky. I reached out to three tourism companies, none of which provides packages taking people to Angola. Those answering my queries were generally gracious in explaining why they avoid the country, but all clearly were echoing a similar theme: You may not want to be a casual tourist in Angola. The State Department is blunt: \u201cMilitant groups have indicated their intention to continue to conduct attacks on foreigners and occasionally attack police and Angolan Armed Forces convoys and outposts.\u201d Also: \u201cArmed assailants have killed some victims of muggings, robberies, and carjackings, which occur frequently in all areas of the country.\u201d\n\nHappily, you\u2019ll be safely ensconced in your abandoned town on a desert island. The main street in the town doubles as an airstrip for a small plane, which is good news. But if you lack access to a small plane \u2014 a fair assumption, given that you\u2019ve made your way to southern Africa, you\u2019ll need to get there by land. One route, the one Els took, involves starting at the Flamingo Lodge outside of the town of Namibe on the southern Angolan coast. From there, you travel south along the coast, along a stretch of what\u2019s called the \u201cdoodsakker.\u201d That trip looks like this.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to bring a boat with you, of course.\n\nBut! Once you\u2019re there, you\u2019ve escaped. There\u2019s no cellular phone service in the area, according to OpenSignal, meaning that you\u2019re cut off from everything. No Internet. No communications. Just you, a lot of salt water and a lot of fish. And the nearest possible Trump-brand property is farther away than anywhere else on Earth.\n\nFor some, this truly describes paradise."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trump-starts-investigation-into-foreign-steel/2017/04/20/6f19e98e-25eb-11e7-928e-3624539060e8_video.html", "text": "- President Trump signed a memo on April 20, to launch a national security investigation into steel imports. \"Steel is critical to both our economy and our military,\" Trump said while surrounded by steel industry executives.

Only on the subject of Russia do more Americans disapprove of Trump\u2019s actions \u2014 thanks to softer support from Republicans.\n\nOn the most consequential action of Trump\u2019s term yet \u2014 the missile strikes on a Syrian air base in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack \u2014 Americans approve of the action by a nearly 2-to-1 margin.\n\nThe strikes in Syria are also about the only issue on which there is not a significant partisan split. That\u2019s the ongoing silver lining for Trump: His political base still approves of how he\u2019s performing. There are only two groups among which 50 percent or more think Trump is outperforming Obama on foreign policy. One is Republicans. The other is white Americans without college degrees \u2014 the group that was always Trump\u2019s most steadfast ally.\n\nFor a president who has mastered finding silver linings in dark, dark clouds, that will probably suffice."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/04/20/the-contested-georgia-congressional-seat-lies-in-the-middle-of-american-racial-politics/", "text": "\n\nGeorgia\u2019s 6th is located just above the small oval-shaped district in the north of the state, in the middle of three districts. (The Washington Post)\n\nOne of the ways that partisanship overlaps with American society is along racial lines. The Republican Party is mostly white, as Gallup polling makes clear; the Democratic Party is more diverse.\n\nThe vast majority of black Americans vote Democratic.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to wonder how that racial split is affected by \u2014 or affects \u2014 political polarization, but it has a tangible effect on American politics. The Democratic primaries in 2016 were heavily shaped by Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019s inability to persuade black Democrats to support his candidacy. Southern states with large black populations gave Hillary Clinton a substantial lead that she never lost.\n\nMore broadly, the overlap of race and politics can be seen clearly in the House. On average, seats held by Democrats are about half white (meaning, in this case, white non-Hispanic) and about half nonwhite. Seats held by Republicans are about three-quarters white.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot in that chart, so it\u2019s worth clicking on it to make it larger. (Note, by the way, that Sanders\u2019s former House seat \u2014 the at-large district in Vermont \u2014 is the whitest Democratic seat in the country.)\n\nOne thing to note is where the 6th District in Georgia falls \u2014 right at the midpoint between the average Democratic and average Republican seat. This is a bit misleading, because white Americans tend to vote more heavily than do nonwhites. (In 2016, 60 percent of voters in Georgia were white, while only 54 percent of the population is white non-Hispanic.) But the composition of the population offers some insight into why the district is currently contested.\n\nWhen we look at the 2016 results by congressional district (using data compiled by Daily Kos) and overlay the density of the white population in each district, there\u2019s a clear pattern of whiter districts more heavily favoring Donald Trump. Right at the center of that cloud? Georgia\u2019s 6th District.\n\nEight Democratic-held House districts (4 percent of them) backed Trump more heavily than the 6th District, and 26 Republican districts (10 percent) were more heavily supportive of Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe fight for the 6th District in Georgia is defined by far more than the racial composition of the constituents, of course, just as the partisan split nationally has broader causes and effects. But we will note, too, that the proportion of the population that\u2019s white in Kansas\u2019s 4th Congressional District is 74.6 percent, just a bit above average for the Republicans and well above average for the Democrats.\n\nThat\u2019s the seat that looked as if it might be close ahead of a special election last week.

(Photo by Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nWith Breanne Deppisch\n\nTHE BIG IDEA is by David Weigel. James will be back on Monday:\n\nA specter is haunting Republican candidates: The specter of Nancy Pelosi. Six-and-a-half years after the party wiped out the Democrats\u2019 House majority, the 77-year old Californian has become the only constant in Republican campaign ads. Last week, in Kansas, Democrats fell seven points short of an upset in a House race; this week, in Georgia, Democrats won the first round of a congressional race that they hoped to win outright.\n\nIn both cases, Republican voters were woken up with images of Pelosi the way a hero in a B-movie is woken up by a bucket of water being thrown at his face. The National Republican Congressional Committee\u2019s ads in Kansas tied Democrat James Thompson to Pelosi\u2019s agenda of \u201chigher taxes\u201d and \u201cObamacare.\u201d The Congressional Leadership Fund\u2019s ads in Georgia painted Democrat Jon Ossoff as a Pelosi enabler, too.\n\nAnd a mailer from the Georgia Republican Party slapped Pelosi on its mailers, next to Hillary Clinton, with the dark slogan \u201cThey\u2019re still looking for a win.\u201d\n\nVictory has a thousand fathers, and in their post-game analysis, Republicans say their strategies have been flawless. The CLF, said executive director Corry Bliss, will \u201ccontinue to make sure Georgia voters know that [Ossoff] is nothing more than a liberal rubber stamp for Nancy Pelosi\u2019s failed agenda.\u201d\n\nThere are a few ways to look at this:\n\nDemocrats, instead of giving their party a fresh start for 2018, re-elected a leader who remains deeply unpopular among Republicans. The potency of attacking Pelosi has been fading lately. Three: It\u2019s striking that the campaigns to bail out Republicans this year have focused so little on what Republicans would do in office, and so much on the tribalism of beating Democrats.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the Democrats. Pelosi had them over a barrel in November 2016. Having considered whether to retire after what she and almost every other Democrat expected to be Hillary Clinton\u2019s victory, she stuck around and easily defeated Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) for an eighth term as leader.\n\nIn the short run, this was obviously a boon for Republicans. Pelosi has been well-known since 2006 and unpopular since 2009. In the new Harvard/Harris poll, Pelosi is saddled with a net negative favorable rating of 17 points, or 31 to 48 favorable/unfavorable.\n\nDemocrats argue that the focus on Pelosi is missing something \u2013 the unpopularity of Republicans. In the same new poll, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, who has periodically received very favorable coverage, has a net negative favorable rating of 13 points, or 34 to 47.\n\n\u201cWhen they can\u2019t win the public argument on the strength of their positions, Washington Republicans make the same tired, personal attacks,\u201d said Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill. \u201cThey don\u2019t work, but they have nothing else to talk about since their President is such an epic disaster, their agenda is non-existent, and their internal dysfunction continues to cripple them.\u201d\n\nSure, \u201cour leader is about as unpopular as yours\u201d is not a gangbuster argument. But it\u2019s worth looking at how Republicans have politicked Pelosi. In a memo from three weeks ago, the CLF told donors that it had stopped Jon Ossoff cold by branding him a rubber stamp for Pelosi.\n\n\u201cIn just one week, Ossoff has stalled on the ballot, and most importantly, he is now underwater with more voters viewing him unfavorably (38% favorable, 47% unfavorable),\u201d wrote Bliss. Three weeks later, Ossoff won 48 percent of the vote.\n\nThat suggests that Pelosi, once an anchor for Democrats, may in 2017 be more of a deflated bike tire \u2013 not ideal, but something they can move with. And that raises the question of what else Republicans may run on. In Kansas and Georgia, as the party fought to get out its base vote, the messaging was heavily negative with no mention of the Republicans\u2019 Washington agenda.\n\nIn Kansas, Republican Ron Estes ran just one commercial touting his agenda, which he defined as \u201cbanning politicians from becoming lobbyists\u201d and \u201cending special perks for elected officials.\u201d Every other spot was negative; even a (much-derided) spot that portrayed him in waders, ready to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d focused on how he was facing \u201cliberal groups\u201d allied with Pelosi.\n\nIn Georgia, Republicans were just as blank about what they\u2019d do with power. Trump-backing GOP businessman Bob Gray said in his ads that voters needed \u201cto drain the swamp.\u201d Karen Handel, the Republican who made the run-off, mocked the glibness of that pitch with her own ad against \u201cgimmicks.\u201d But in it, she cited two accomplishments; when she balanced Fulton County\u2019s budget, and when she \u201ctook on the Obama administration and won\u201d on the state\u2019s voter ID law.\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been much about the Republican agenda in Congress. And that\u2019s telling. Estes, who did little public campaigning, said he was not inclined to support the version of Obamacare repeal that died in the House. Handel, at the final debate before the April 18 election, also rejected the repeal bill, saying she wanted a plan that more closely resembled former Rep. Tom Price\u2019s (R-Ga.) health care model, before he left to join the Trump administration.\n\nAccording to every poll, Republican voters remain broadly supportive of the president. Issue-to-issue, they\u2019re less supportive \u2013 and they have been flummoxed so far by the actions of the Republican Congress. No Republican has yet run and won as the candidate who\u2019ll come to D.C. and help the president and speaker get things done. They\u2019ve run harder on the promise never to let Pelosi back to power.\n\nCan that last for 19 more months?\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning newsletter.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nPolitical commentator/author Ann Coulter speaks onstage at The Comedy Central Roast of Rob Lowe at Sony Studios on August 27, 2016 in Los Angeles, California.

In the end, his downfall was both \u201cswift and steep,\u201d coming less than a month after a string of sexual harassment complaints against him were revealed. Paul Farhi reports: \u201cAfter a thorough and careful review of the allegations, the company and Bill O\u2019Reilly have agreed that Bill O\u2019Reilly will not be returning to the Fox News Channel,\u201d the network\u2019s parent company, 21st Century Fox, said in a statement. Tucker Carlson, who currently hosts a 9 p.m. discussion program, will move to take over O\u2019Reilly\u2019s 8 p.m. slot.\n\nO\u2019Reilly stood by his denial of the allegations Wednesday, saying in a statement that his ousting was provoked by \u201ccompletely unfounded claims.\u201d \u201cBut that is the unfortunate reality many of us in the public eye must live with today,\u201d he continued. \u201cI will always look back on my time at Fox with great pride in the unprecedented success we achieved and with my deepest gratitude to all my dedicated viewers. I wish only the best for Fox News Channel.\u201d Representatives for O\u2019Reilly said he received the news while awaiting his return flight from Italy, and, having monitored the failing negotiations during his trip, was \"resigned\" to the news. (Earlier, he spent the final moments of his vacation briefly meeting the pope in St. Peter\u2019s Square, shaking hands with the religious leader whom he once lectured on immigration, the New York Times reports.)\n\n-- \u201cThe reactions to the news of O'Reilly's departure were decidedly mixed in the newsroom,\u201d Vanity Fair's Sarah Ellison writes. \u201cSome staffers cried. Others were elated. And the day was filled with an ominous tension as the elder Murdoch, the network's C.E.O., moved from one closed-door meeting to another to inform on-air talent of their new jobs \u2026 The most unsettling feeling among some at Fox News, however, is that Wednesday's events are only the beginning[:] 'There's more to come,' [said] one Fox News insider \u2026suggesting that there are more women with stories of harassment who have not come forward publicly.\u201d\n\n-- O'Reilly \u201cwas the front-facing spokesman for the modern-day conservative movement, just as now-deposed Fox boss Roger Ailes was its behind-the-scenes architect,\u201d CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza writes. \u201cFor the generation of conservatives who came into their political prime from the late 1990s through, well, today, O'Reilly was a North Star of sorts. He was a clear break from the intellectual stuffiness of Irving Kristol or William F. Buckley. He was a tough-talking populist, willing to stare down the so-called \u2018mainstream media\u2019 and skewer political correctness. What O'Reilly and Ailes built was something that not only succeeded beyond their wildest dreams financially speaking but also had a profound impact on how conservatives thought of themselves. Democrats became the party of Hollywood and elites \u2026 [while] Republicans were the ones fighting for the little guy who felt left behind and scolded by those very people.\n\n\u201cTrump was the logical endpoint of what O'Reilly and Ailes had begun together almost two decades prior \u2026 That [he] has risen to the nation's highest office, even as O'Reilly and Ailes have fallen from grace, is the stuff of great fiction. But it should also serve as a reminder to detractors of the duo that their progeny is now the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nIt may not be over.

Representatives from ArcelorMittal, Nucor, U.S. Steel, AK Steel and Timken are expected, along with the president of the United Steelworkers union. China's excess capacity to produce steel is seen as a long-term threat to the U.S. steel industry's viability, but it's unclear if the order will single out any country or be global in scope. The proposed order would direct Ross to launch an investigation under a provision of U.S. trade law that requires the Commerce secretary to report to the president within 270 days whether a certain product is being imported in sufficient quantities or under such circumstances that it threatens to impair national security.\"\n\n-- As lawmakers prepare to return to Washington next week, Trump is facing a critical decision on the Affordable Care Act -- and must decide whether to throw the health-care law a line. Paige Winfield Cunningham reports: \u201cThe White House and Republican lawmakers are facing key decisions that could either improve the insurance marketplaces established by the ACA next year or prompt insurers to further hike rates or withdraw from those marketplaces entirely. Republicans had hoped to protect those with marketplace coverage while lawmakers replaced Obamacare. But with that effort hitting a wall, Trump and his health-care decision-makers are in a bind: They can either let the current system fail and risk raising the ire of 11 million Americans who use the marketplaces, or help stabilize Obamacare and potentially make it harder for Republicans in Congress to abandon the law itself. [And ] if the marketplaces further deteriorate, Republicans may take the fall \u2026 That reality is forcing Republicans, including Trump, to seriously consider a half-dozen actions that could help improve \u2014 or at least sustain \u2014 the marketplaces where Americans without employer-sponsored plans buy coverage.\u201d\n\nSheldon Adelson attends the final day of the Republican National Convention on July 21, 2016.

Rosalind S. Helderman and John Wagner report: \u201cThe filing showed that more than 1,500 people and companies gave money to the effort. But more than two-thirds of the money raised came from big-dollar donors who contributed at least $500,000 ... In all, more than 45 individuals and companies donated at least $1 million each to the effort as Trump broke with the practice of most recent inaugural committees and placed no limits on corporate or individual donors. The committee has said it would donate leftover funds to charities but has not identified which charities will receive money or how much ...

Griff Witte and James McAuley report: \u201c[A]ll was still in this one-boulangerie town in the French countryside when Marine Le Pen strode to the lectern and, with the unwavering force of a freight train, vowed to save the country on behalf of its forgotten young. \u2018Our youth are in despair,\u2019 [she] thundered. \u2018I will be the voice of the voiceless.\u2019\u201d Now, as the country hurtles toward an election that could alter the course of European history, Le Pen\u2019s once-longshot, now undeniably viable campaign rests heavily on an unlikely source of support \u2013 the young voter \u2013 whose votes could make her the next president of France.\n\n\u201cPopulist triumphs in Britain and the United States came last year despite young voters, not because of them. It was older voters who sought to overturn the existing order with nationalist answers to the problems of a globalized world. But France is a land of youthful revolts \u2026 And with youth unemployment stuck at 25 percent, Le Pen\u2019s reactionary call to return the country to an era of lost glory by closing borders, exiting the European Union and restoring the national currency has fired the passions of young voters craving radical change.

Mr. Tillerson during his time at Exxon forged a close working relationship with [Putin] and with Rosneft, a company that is critical to Russia\u2019s oil-reliant economy.

Although the statement did not mention North Korea explicitly, when asked about it, Pacom officials made a direct link between the carrier\u2019s re-routing and the North Korean threat. The decision to send the carrier north was a \u2018prudent\u2019 measure as North Korea posed \u2018the number one threat in the region,\u2019 one official said. Some officials suggested that U.S. Pacific Command was to blame for the way it communicated its unusual decision to telegraph the future movements of one of its ships, an announcement that appeared to have taken at least some officials by surprise \u2026\u201d\n\n-- Meanwhile, analysts tasked with examining satellite images of North Korea said they spotted some unexpected activity at Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear test site: volleyball games. The New York Times\u2019 William J. Broad reports: \u201cThe surprising images were taken on Sunday as tensions between the United States and North Korea seemed to spike. The Korean Peninsula pulsed with news that the North was preparing for its sixth atomic detonation and that American warships had been ordered into the Sea of Japan as a deterrent, even though the ships turned out to have sailed in the opposite direction. The volleyball games, played in the middle of that international crisis, were probably intended to send a message, analysts said, as the North Koreans are aware that the nuclear test site is under intense scrutiny. But what meaning the North wanted the games to convey is unclear.\u201d One veteran North Korean analyst emphasized the ambiguity of North Korean intentions. \u201cThey\u2019re either sending us a message that they\u2019ve put the facility on standby, or they\u2019re trying to deceive us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n-- And North Korea unveiled a new video simulating a missile attack on the U.S. and leaving the generic \u201ccity\u201d destroyed in a giant fireball.

Senior Trump aides have issued policy pronouncements at odds with one another. In other recent cases, White House statements conflicted with messages from government agencies -- even on the same day. \"Even when there is unanimity in the messaging \u2014 such as Trump\u2019s boast \u2026 that a U.S. Navy \u2018armada\u2019 was headed toward the Korean Peninsula \u2014 the administration was forced into the embarrassing admission a few days later \u2026 Although every administration experiences growing pains, the recent succession of mixed signals over key national security issues has stood out, painting a picture to some of an administration that has not fully developed its policies or a broader international agenda and whose key agencies are not communicating with one another \u2014 or the White House.\u201d\n\n\u201cFormer national security officials \u2026 emphasized that the Trump administration has been hampered by a president who has been slow to appoint hundreds of mid-level managers at Cabinet agencies \u2026 and who has at times expressed disdain for the traditional interagency decision-making process. The result is that the normally meticulous care that goes into formulating and coordinating U.S. government policy positions or even simple statements is often absent. Institutional memory is lacking, these former officials said, and mistakes and contradictions easily slip through the cracks.

So when he became a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign last year and gave a Russia-friendly speech at a prestigious Moscow institute, it soon caught the bureau\u2019s attention. That trip last July was a catalyst for the F.B.I. investigation into connections between Russia and [Trump\u2019s] campaign \u2026 Mr. Page\u2019s relationship with Mr. Trump appears to have been fleeting. But last spring, when Republican foreign policy experts were distancing themselves from Mr. Trump, Mr. Page served a purpose for the flailing Trump campaign. Dismissing the notion that his campaign was bereft of foreign policy expertise, the candidate read aloud a list of five people who had offered to advise him on world affairs \u2014 including \u2018Carter Page, Ph.D.\u2019 [Otherwise], Mr. Page\u2019s role in the Trump campaign appears to have been minimal.

In the early 1970s, Stone became a master of the darker political arts, meddling surreptitiously with the Democrats, as part of Nixon\u2019s Committee to Re-Elect the President, nicknamed CREEP. More than 4\u00bd decades later, Stone still likes to think of himself as a man who operates in the shadows.\n\n\"'P.S.: I have no boring clients,\u2019 he tantalizing says one evening, without naming names or explaining exactly what he does.

(John G. Mabanglo/European Pressphoto Agency)\n\nIn 2016, Colin Kaepernick, then the quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, was heavily criticized for kneeling instead of standing during the national anthem. The protest was on behalf of the Black Lives Matter movement. As Kaepernick put it, \u201cI am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.\u201d\n\nRecently, Kaepernick opted out of his contract with the 49ers. In announcing his free agency, Kaepernick declared that in the upcoming National Football League season he will no longer kneel during the national anthem. However, he has not yet been signed by an NFL team. Some say that\u2019s because his skills are declining. Others argue that quarterback-starved teams are avoiding him because of his protest.\n\nBut few disagree that Kaepernick was the target of a great deal of rage \u2014 as were the scores of African American high school, college and professional athletes who have engaged in similar protests. A 2016 Quinnipiac University Poll found that 54 percent of Americans say they disapprove of these protests. That number hides a divide by race: 74 percent of African Americans say they approve, while 63 percent of whites are opposed. We wondered whether that white opposition is related in part to racial attitudes.\n\n[Racial prejudice is driving opposition to paying college athletes. Here\u2019s the evidence.]\n\nHow we did our research\n\nDecades of research on public opinion has found that negative racial attitudes are strongly correlated with white public opinion, particularly when the perceived targets or beneficiaries of a policy change are African Americans (see here, here, and here). We wanted to find out whether white Americans support athletes\u2019 rights to protest the national anthem in the abstract, not just in Kaepernick\u2019s case.\n\nTo do this, we fielded a nationally representative online survey in October. We asked 2,000 respondents:\n\nRecently, a number of professional athletes have protested the treatment of African Americans by not standing during the singing of the national anthem. Do you support the right of these athletes to kneel during the singing of the national anthem?\n\nAs you can see in the graph below, 34 percent of all Americans say they support these athletes\u2019 rights to kneel during the anthem (30 percent oppose it strongly). But that divided profoundly by race. More than half of blacks were supportive, compared with about 1 in 4 whites.\n\nTo explore if racial attitudes were related to white opposition, we asked respondents to tell us to what extent African Americans fit different negative stereotypes. Specifically, we asked whether respondents thought African Americans were lazy (vs. hard-working), unintelligent (vs. intelligent) and violent (vs. peaceful). We also asked people in our survey to rate whites on these same traits. We then look at the difference between how white respondents rate whites on these scales to how they rate African Americans. When they rate African Americans as more lazy, unintelligent and violent than they rate whites, we take this as evidence of racial stereotyping.\n\n[Racism motivated Trump voters more than authoritarianism. By a lot.]\n\nWe also asked questions that examined partisanship, ideological attachments, patriotism, gender, age and education. This allows us to see whether opposition to the protests is related to racial stereotypes, even after controlling for other factors.\n\nThe big role of racial bias\n\n\n\nRacial attitudes had a notable relationship to white opposition to athletes\u2019 protests. The graph below shows precisely how strong the relationship is between holding negative stereotypes of blacks and strong opposition to the protests. Even after we account for all the factors we listed above, we still find that whites who hold the most negative stereotypes about blacks are about 25 points more likely to strongly oppose athletes kneeling during the anthem than whites who have positive views of blacks.\n\n\n\nIn short, race appears to matter \u2014 a lot \u2014 in understanding white opposition to these protests.\n\nTatishe M.

The Post's Fact Checker found that other presidents, most notably Franklin D. Roosevelt, accomplished more than he has so far. (The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cNo administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days.\u201d\n\n\u2014 President Trump, remarks in Kenosha, Wis., April 18, 2017\n\nThe first 100 days of a presidency mark a rather artificial milestone, but one by which all presidents have been measured since Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s whirlwind of action when he took office in the midst of the Great Depression. President Trump appears especially conscious of this marker. During the presidential campaign, he even issued a list of 60 promises that he said he would fulfill in his first 100 days.\n\nWe\u2019ve been tracking Trump\u2019s promises, and so far he has not even taken action on 60 percent of the promises \u2014 and he\u2019s broken five of them, such as his pledge to label China as a currency manipulator.\n\nYet here\u2019s the president declaring that he has accomplished more in his first 90 days than any previous president. So how does he stack up?\n\nThe Facts\n\nThere are various ways to measure presidential performance, such as number of laws passed. But of course not every law is created equally, so you have to parse the data. The same goes for executive orders and memorandums.\n\nWe sought an explanation from the White House for Trump\u2019s claim but did not get an answer. However, White House press secretary Sean Spicer on April 19 was asked what single piece of legislation the president was most proud of in his first 100 days.\n\nSpicer did not really answer the question but instead responded with a laundry list that he said demonstrated a \u201cvery robust agenda of activity,\u201d such as reversing a dozen regulations set by President Barack Obama and the Senate confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil M. Gorsuch. He also noted a drop in illegal immigration at the southern border and \u201ca lot of activity that we\u2019ve been very proud to see in America manufacturing and job creation\u201d \u2014 claims we have fact-checked in the past.\n\nFrankly, this is rather thin gruel if you are going to compare yourself to Roosevelt or other notable presidents. So let\u2019s go through the data.\n\nThere were 76 bills signed into law under Roosevelt in the first 100 days, compared with 28 (with a week to go) under Trump. \u201cThis is higher than any first-term 100 days since 1949 (55 bills signed), but less than all first terms from 1901-1949 except for 1909,\u201d said John Frendreis, a political science professor at Loyola University in Chicago who co-wrote a well-regarded study of legislative output in the first 100 days from 1897 to 1995.\n\nThirteen of the Trump bills disapprove of major regulations put in place by Obama, which signifies a reversal of action, not new action \u2014 though the agency is barred from ever repromulgating the rule in question or anything similar without congressional approval. Other bills include such actions \u2014 what Frendreis called \u201cminor or housekeeping bills\u201d \u2014 as naming a Veterans Affairs outpatient clinic in Pago Pago in American Samoa or creating a waiver to allow Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to be appointed even though he had recently served in the military.\n\nMoreover, none of Trump\u2019s bills can be considered \u201cmajor\u201d legislation according to political science standards, whereas at least nine of Roosevelt\u2019s bills met that standard. Historians H.W. Brands of the University of Texas at Austin and David M. Kennedy of Stanford University count 15 major bills in FDR\u2019s first 100 days, including some that remain in place.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, Trump\u2019s tenure has been less impressive, with no major pieces of legislation passed,\u201d Frendreis said. \u201cBy contrast, the stimulus package was passed during Obama\u2019s first 100 days\u201d \u2014 actually, within Obama\u2019s first 30 days.\n\nFrendreis noted that the 73rd Congress was highly unusual because of the crisis atmosphere and the huge Democratic majorities, giving Roosevelt an opportunity to make a quick impact.\n\n\u201cSome of FDR\u2019s initiatives were submitted to Congress in the morning and back on his desk that very same day for signatures,\u201d said Max J. Skidmore, a political science professor at the University of Missouri in Kansas City. \u201cHardly anything other than the most extreme of emergencies could bring that about.\u201d\n\n\u201cFDR\u2019s first session of Congress was a special session he himself had called,\u201d Brands said. \u201cHe also had the advantage of preparation, having been governor of New York for four years, three of them Depression years. So he knew what he wanted, what was popular and what might work. Trump is a novice.\u201d\n\nAs for executive actions, as of April 19 Trump had issued 24 executive orders, 22 presidential memorandums and 20 proclamations. One of his executive orders, imposing a travel ban from certain Muslim-majority countries, was a redo of an earlier executive order that had been blocked in the courts. But the new one has also been stymied by court challenges and thus has not been implemented.\n\nTo some extent, it\u2019s difficult to compare executive orders and memorandums among presidents, because only executive orders are numbered, but it\u2019s somewhat arbitrary how something is labeled. (We explored this at length in 2014.) In any case, Trump\u2019s first 90 days of executive actions do not stand out as especially unusual.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is woefully behind in presidential appointments, especially in naming people for Senate-confirmed posts.\n\nIn contrast to many other presidents, Trump has also not led on legislation but mostly taken his cue from Congress.\n\nAt this point, President George W. Bush was well ahead in ensuring passage of a major tax cut that he had pressed for in the election campaign. He proposed comprehensive tax legislation on Feb. 9, about three weeks after taking office, and a $1.35 trillion tax cut was passed by both houses of Congress by May 26, less than a month after Bush\u2019s first 100 days was completed. Trump has yet to release a tax plan \u2014 and his bid to repeal and replace Obama\u2019s signature health-care law was blocked in the House.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s \u2018skinny\u2019 budget is not a strong start on the budget issue, even for a first-term president,\u201d Frendreis said, adding that \u201cmy own professional judgment is that he is off to a slower-than-normal start.\u201d\n\nFew presidents achieve much on foreign policy in their first 100 days, and Trump is no exception. Trump has signaled a tougher posture toward North Korea and Iran and launched a volley of cruise missiles to punish Syria for a chemical-weapons attack. But it\u2019s too early to tell whether his policies will result in positive outcomes.\n\n\u201cTrump actually is unusual for his first 100 days, but for a reason opposite of what he said,\u201d said Skidmore, author of \u201cPresidential Performance: A Comprehensive Review.\u201d \u201cNot only has he accomplished almost nothing, but rather his initiatives (executive orders stayed by courts, a major legislative proposal failing even to come to a vote when his party controls both houses, etc.) have notoriously been unsuccessful.\u201d\n\n\u201cFDR definitely outclasses Trump,\u201d Brands said. \u201cFifteen major bills through Congress, to zero for Trump.\u201d\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nIt\u2019s rather silly for any president to suggest that his first 100 days somehow topped Roosevelt\u2019s achievement. Lyndon B. Johnson, Ronald Reagan and Obama are credited with significant legislative achievements early in their first terms, but much of their success generally came after the first 100 days. Trump would be well advised to not make such a big deal about this because the available evidence shows that he in no way comes close to matching FDR\u2019s record.\n\nFour Pinocchios\n\n\n\n\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\n1 of 94 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 See what President Trump has been doing since taking office View Photos The beginning of his term has featured controversial executive orders and frequent conflicts with the media.

(Think: threats against Israel, support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and harassment of U.S. naval vessels in the Persian Gulf.) In formal remarks to reporters, Tillerson suggested the United States was considering whether to punish the Islamic republic by reimposing sanctions that were lifted under the 2015 nuclear agreement.\n\nAs you might remember, President Trump is no fan of that nuclear agreement. On the 2016 campaign trail, he repeatedly criticized it as \u201cthe worst deal ever negotiated.\u201d But it\u2019s unclear whether his administration is prepared to violate its terms by reimposing sanctions. That could risk retaliation from Iran and lead it to resume development of its nuclear program.\n\n\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson speaks in Washington on March 22. (Cliff Owen/Associated Press)\n\nTillerson wasn\u2019t the only Trump administration official targeting Iran for criticism on Wednesday.\n\nSecretary of Defense Jim Mattis slammed Iran as a destabilizing influence, particularly in Yemen, during a visit to Saudi Arabia. \u201cEverywhere you look, if there\u2019s trouble in the region, you find Iran,\u201d Mattis told reporters.\n\nThis week, the Trump administration said it will undertake a comprehensive, 90-day review to judge whether lifting sanctions on Iran serves U.S. interests. So expect to hear more about this topic in the coming months.\n\nIn the meantime, amid all the criticism, here\u2019s a development worth noting: Iran has met all of its commitments under the nuclear deal so far, the administration officially told Congress this week.\n\nEXXON ASKS TO RESUME PROJECT WITH RUSSIAN PARTNER\n\nSpeaking of Tillerson, here\u2019s a situation that could get interesting.\n\nExxonMobil, where Tillerson served as chairman and chief executive before joining the Trump administration, is seeking permission from the U.S. government to resume oil drilling around the Black Sea in partnership with Rosneft, Russia\u2019s state-owned oil company.\n\nThe project was blocked in 2014 when the United States imposed sanctions on Russia to punish it for annexing Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula. ExxonMobil has estimated the sanctions caused it to lose up to $1 billion before taxes from ventures with Rosneft, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the company\u2019s request.\n\nThe news comes against the backdrop of investigations into Trump\u2019s ties to Russia and Russia\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTHE CASE OF THE MISSING AIRCRAFT CARRIER, PART TWO\n\nYesterday, we wrote about the \u201cnebulous \u2014 if not deliberately misleading\u201d comments from Trump administration officials about the location of the USS Carl Vinson.\n\nIn case you missed it, here\u2019s a quick recap.\n\nLast week, amid rising tensions with North Korea, U.S. officials suggested an aircraft carrier was headed toward the Korean Peninsula, ready to counter overt aggression from Pyongyang.\n\nIt turns out that carrier, the USS Carl Vinson, was thousands of miles away in the Indian Ocean at the time.\n\n\n\nThe aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson transits the Sunda Strait in Indonesia on April 14. (U.S. Navy via Getty Images)\n\nGovernment officials let the false narrative spread for a week, with some experts wondering, as our colleagues wrote, whether the Trump administration was \u201cusing deceptive means to send a message\u201d to North Korea.\n\nOn Wednesday, some of those officials sought to defend the administration\u2019s statements, while others struggled to explain why the government never corrected news reports that falsely stated the location of the carrier.\n\n\u201cWhat part is misleading? I\u2019m trying to figure that out,\u201d said White House press secretary Sean Spicer. \u201cWe were asked a question about what signal it sent. We answered the question on what signal it sent. I\u2019m not the one who commented on timing.\u201d\n\nEPA TO SHRINK STAFF WITH BUYOUTS\n\nForeshadowing what might soon take place in other parts of the government, the Environmental Protection Agency said this week it will begin to shrink its workforce through buyouts.\n\nEPA acting deputy administrator Mike Flynn said the White House asked agencies to take \u201cimmediate actions\u201d to shrink their staffs. Flynn said his goal was to complete the program by the end of the fiscal year.\n\nThe move comes in response to Trump\u2019s executive order last month aimed at reorganizing the executive branch and eliminating \u201cunnecessary agencies \u2026 components of agencies, and agency programs.\u201d\n\nFollow the author: @eliseviebeck."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/senator-tom-cotton-defends-trump-at-town-hall/2017/04/19/e55bd490-2532-11e7-928e-3624539060e8_video.html", "text": "- Sen.

(John Bazemore/Associated Press)\n\nCook Political Report\u2019s Dave Wasserman made an interesting observation on Twitter on Tuesday evening.\n\nIncreasing polarization of U.S. elections isn't just geographic; it's how we vote. Dems show up early, Republicans voting on Election Day. \u2014 Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) April 19, 2017\n\nHe was responding directly to the results of a special election in Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District. As expected, based on who\u2019d already returned ballots, Democrat Jon Ossoff jumped out to an early lead when the state published the results from early voting. But as votes from Election Day itself were counted, Ossoff\u2019s lead narrowed quickly. He went from having more than 70 percent of the vote to less than 50 percent as the night wore on \u2014 not enough to avoid a runoff race in June.\n\nWasserman was also referring, though, to any number of other recent, similar examples. Perhaps the most infamous recent example was in Florida in November. The campaign of Democrat Hillary Clinton came into Election Day confident that it would carry the Sunshine State, given the dominance her campaign had shown in early voting. But, again, the Election Day tally worked against her, as detailed in a new book assessing how her campaign stumbled. A Florida win meant the presidency. An Election Day surge for Republican Donald Trump ended that dream.\n\nThose two examples aside, it\u2019s worth considering Wasserman\u2019s assessment more broadly. Are Georgia and Florida simply outliers? Is it the case more broadly that early voting tends to favor the Democrat in a race more heavily?\n\nLooking at last year, the answer is clearly \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nNot every state publishes election results broken out by the type of vote cast. At least six states do, though, and in five of those six, Clinton fared better in early voting than she did in votes cast on Election Day.\n\nThe sole exception was Louisiana, but even there it was close. Clinton won 38.8 percent of the vote in early balloting, doing slightly better \u2014 40.2 percent \u2014 on Nov. 8. Everywhere else, her margins were better beforehand. In Maryland, she did 15 points better in early voting. In Iowa, 17. In North Carolina, almost 10. In Georgia? Just over a percentage point.\n\nIt can be hard to evaluate early voting compared to Election Day voting without specific numbers from the state, but we can estimate it. If we look at the number of early ballots returned by members of each party \u2014 data collected by Michael McDonald\u2019s U.S. Election Project \u2014 and compare it to the actual results in the state, a similar pattern emerges. Looking only at ballots cast by members of the Democratic or Republican parties and comparing those to the margins of the vote for Clinton and Trump, in nearly every case the percent of ballots returned by Democrats in early voting was larger than the actual Clinton vote on Election Day \u2014 suggesting heavier support for Trump in votes cast Nov. 8.\n\nThis is imprecise, of course. In West Virginia, for example, a lot of Democrats cast early ballots for Trump, which skews the results. And notice that this analysis would suggest that Clinton fared worse in early voting, while the actual state data shows that she didn\u2019t. Still, the pattern matches Wasserman\u2019s assumption. More Democrats voting early than the final results would indicate.\n\nThere are several implications to this. One is that we\u2019ll see a lot more election nights like the one in November and like Tuesday, with Democrats jumping out to an early lead, and Republicans eventually eating away at it. Humans are weird creatures, and we tend to view election night returns like a football game, in which one candidate or the other is waging a comeback. Of course, that\u2019s not the case; the actual football analogy would be if referees simply released the score of the game in random one-point increments after it had ended.\n\nThe more important implication is how it frames efforts to curtail early voting. If early voting is used more heavily by Democrats, it stands to reason that cutting early voting would reduce the number of Democrats who vote.\n\nWhich itself explains another manifestation of partisan polarization: opposition to early voting efforts by Republicans.\n\nElection results for each state: Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland and North Carolina."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/fla-state-senator-apologizes-for-using-n-word/2017/04/19/3ea97288-250a-11e7-928e-3624539060e8_video.html", "text": "Trump says the U.S. 'has enough roles' in the world"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/this-beltway-insider-is-in-charge-of-hiring-for-the-trump-administration-its-taking-awhile/2017/04/18/06febf20-1b08-11e7-bcc2-7d1a0973e7b2_story.html", "text": "John DeStefano, head of the office of presidential personnel, stands for a portrait in his office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nIf Johnny DeStefano applied for a job in the Trump administration, chances are pretty good that Johnny DeStefano wouldn\u2019t hire him.\n\nDeStefano is the president\u2019s official headhunter, responsible for filling up to 4,000 political jobs \u2014 about 500 of which are really important jobs \u2014 in a government that his boss promised to clear of the permanent class of capital insiders to drain the Washington swamp.\n\nSo the ideal applicant wouldn\u2019t have spent much of his career on Capitol Hill as DeStefano has, starting with a college internship. Or served as political director for former House speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), who embodies the GOP establishment. Or raised money for House Republicans, then built a data operation used by the Republican National Committee.\n\nAnd yet this didn\u2019t stop DeStefano, an amiable 38-year-old who grew up in Kansas City, Mo., from getting an under-the-radar role as someone to see in Trump world.\n\nIn an interview at his corner office next to the White House, the director of presidential personnel brushes off suggestions that his mainstream political pedigree is a liability. Before Trump, everyone started somewhere, he says, sitting easily in a navy blue suit at the conference table where he asks people why they want to work for President Trump. The spacious digs are appointed with white marble floors, a black limestone fireplace and coffered ceiling 18 feet above him.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m interested in now is, \u2018Why do you want the job, and more specifically, why do you want to work for this administration?\u2019 \u201d DeStefano says he asks candidates he interviews for jobs ranging from undersecretary of transportation to ambassador to the European Union.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your vision? I want to know that myself,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m the person who\u2019s vouching for them to the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also struggling to fill critical jobs across a government still missing most of its senior leaders, a personnel roadblock caused by a slow start, screening delays, candidates turned off by a post-government lobbying ban \u2014 and the possibility that Trump doesn\u2019t want to fill all of those posts.\n\nWhen the White House announced DeStefano\u2019s appointment, the far-right blogosphere lit up in anger. \u201cThose who hoisted the pirate flag and joined the Trump team when he was at 2 percent in the polls . . . must wonder what the devil is going on,\u201d longtime conservative activist Richard Viguerie wrote, calling the choice a \u201cmajor impediment\u201d to Trump\u2019s goals.\n\nAnd yet DeStefano has won over the \u201cpirate\u201d wing led by Stephen K. Bannon, Trump\u2019s combative chief strategist.\n\nBannon now calls DeStefano \u201cjust a huge piece of manpower\u201d with a \u201cvery good sense of who could be a change agent and what are the key positions you have to fill and get filled right away.\u201d\n\nDeStefano\u2019s new post and ornate office are a long way from the Data Trust in downtown Washington, the Republican voter-data firm where he could wear flip flops and jeans to work while overseeing the team of 24 technology geeks he built to modernize the GOP\u2019s voter files.\n\nHe climbed the ladder of Washington politics the traditional way. The summer of his junior year at Saint Louis University, his uncle, a longtime Capitol Hill chief of staff, helped get him an internship with then-Rep. J.C. Watts (R-Okla.). After graduation, DeStefano got a job serving as liaison to outside conservative groups for the House Republican Conference, and when Democrats targeted Rep. Deborah Pryce in 2006, he went to Ohio to run her reelection campaign.\n\nThe GOP lost the House \u2014 but Pryce squeaked by with a margin of 1,055 votes. Boehner took notice and hired DeStefano to help recruit Republicans to run for the House. Then as head of member services, DeStefano advised tea party members elected in 2010 on how to staff their offices.\n\nHis surroundings notwithstanding, he retains a sense of minimalism, with almost-empty bookcases and a bare desk except for some stray papers and an empty tube of Airborne, the immune-system booster. It looks as though he hasn\u2019t moved in. Friends say the sparse office shouldn\u2019t be confused with disengagement: DeStefano is a strategic thinker with a radar for assessing people\u2019s talents.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to see pictures of Johnny in the Oval with President Trump,\u201d says Brett Loper, the top policy aide to Boehner who is senior vice president of government affairs at American Express. \u201cYou might see a leftover dish that once contained ice cream. He\u2019s not a flashy, let-me-show-off-my-relationships-in-Washington kind of guy.\u201d\n\nBut there are some small signs of his new prominence. The regular guy who seems most at home talking about his beloved Kansas City Royals signs job offers with a more formal version of his name: \u201cJohn DeStefano.\u201d This has led to ribbing from friends, including Boehner, who know him only as Johnny.\n\nLeaving behind the nickname only serves to reinforce that DeStefano is a player with considerable stroke \u2014 part facilitator, part closer. He\u2019s the man bringing the president the names of candidates who must get Senate sign-off after Cabinet secretaries and a long line of senior White House aides have weighed in. The competing powers in the inner circle often can\u2019t agree, and DeStefano nudges them to consensus or starts over.\n\nIn a White House besieged by infighting, he tries to manage the chaos.\n\n\u201cJohnny takes a lot of heat,\u201d says Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, describing pressure that comes from above, below and from the calendar. \u201cHe\u2019s calm, he\u2019s patient and he has a good understanding of who\u2019s in charge, meaning the president.\u201d\n\nDeStefano finds himself firing back at naysayers who think that Trump is moving too slowly to staff the government. Bill Clinton had 100 people looking through r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and Trump has 36. So what? Back then, they came in on paper. Now they\u2019re emailed.\n\n\u201cI think that doing it right is more important than doing it fast,\u201d he says.\n\nWhich makes sense coming from someone who didn\u2019t aspire to the job he landed.\n\nPriebus, who got to know DeStefano when he was Republican National Committee chairman, called DeStefano two days before Christmas to ask him to come to New York the next day to meet the president-elect\u2019s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, at Trump Tower. DeStefano was getting ready to fly home to ask his girlfriend, Sarah Cascio, a property manager he met in Kansas City, to marry him.\n\nOne problem: DeStefano hadn\u2019t put on a suit in years. The ones in his closet were too snug. He squeezed into his best one, and has since seen a tailor.\n\n\u201cLiterally, this came out of the blue,\u201d Boehner says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to wonder what you\u2019re getting with Johnny. He brings stability.\u201d\n\nHe had no experience in executive searches before this. Most presidents have their personnel chiefs in place months before the election. He wasn\u2019t on board until late January, after Trump\u2019s transition team had dumped New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) and his lists of potential job candidates. The hiring operation was on life support.\n\nDeStefano and his team ensure that candidates pass the ultimate test in this administration: loyalty. (Never Trumpers or those who said something unflattering about the candidate on Twitter or Facebook are almost always disqualified.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my job if I see any daylight anywhere to make sure it\u2019s dealt with before it gets to the president,\u201d DeStefano says.\n\nHe and his team are also the gatekeepers, culling thousands of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s \u2014 the White House won\u2019t say how many \u2014 in the personnel office\u2019s database to create a list for lower-level posts that don\u2019t require Senate confirmation. Few of the top jobs are filled from that list; instead they emerge from a more chaotic process by which an adviser, family member, senator or the vice president will hand DeStefano a name and tell him to take a look. He has to tell Cabinet secretaries when their picks aren\u2019t going to fly with the White House.\n\nSo where do you begin to hire 4,000 people who want to upend the federal government as we know it?\n\nFor starters, this isn\u2019t a spoils system.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a huge campaign,\u201d DeStefano says. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a Republican administration that came with thousands and thousands of folks who are expecting jobs.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re looking instead for people who have \u201cdriven change\u201d in or out of government.\n\nHe acknowledges that finding outsiders involves \u201ca little bit more of a mix of recruitment and placement than I think most administrations have had,\u201d but he calls it an \u201copportunity.\u201d\n\nHiring in the Trump White House can take unpredictable turns. After fast-food executive Andrew Puzder withdrew his nomination to be labor secretary in February, DeStefano had met with the president about potential replacements when Bannon came into the Oval Office with two of his own picks \u2014 one of whom was a former U.S. attorney from Miami who had interviewed for an agency general counsel job. The team immediately met with him, shifted gears, and Trump nominated Alexander Acosta for labor secretary.\n\nWhen Priebus called, DeStefano had been running Data Trust for four years. His friends say he doesn\u2019t get enough credit for building up what was an anemic operation almost from scratch.\n\n\u201cIt was a place that was not functioning,\u201d said Guy Harrison, who ran the House Republican fundraising arm with DeStefano as second-in command. \u201cHe\u2019s really good at reforming from within.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/04/19/the-demos-went-down-to-georgia-what-the-special-election-says-about-donald-trump/", "text": "Jon Ossoff, a Democratic candidate in Georgia's 6th Congressional District, will face Republican Karen Handel in a June 20 runoff, after winning the most votes in the April 18 special election but failing to reach the 50 percent threshold. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nPresident Trump wasted no time in claiming credit for a win in the special election in Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District. Almost literally: Jon Ossoff, the Democrat who finished first in the contest, began speaking at his campaign event at 11:53 p.m. Eastern time. At 12:09 a.m., the president tweeted.\n\nDespite major outside money, FAKE media support and eleven Republican candidates, BIG \"R\" win with runoff in Georgia. Glad to be of help! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 19, 2017\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201chelp\u201d in the race consisted of six tweets (the first of which came this past weekend) and a robo-call in which he exhorted Republicans to \u201cstop the super liberal Democrats.\u201d At least, that\u2019s all of the help he provided to Republicans. Trump also helped Ossoff implicitly with fundraising: The race quickly earned national attention as a referendum on Trump\u2019s presidency, and Ossoff raised unheard-of sums of money as a result.\n\nIn the end, Ossoff earned far more votes than any other candidate \u2014 but not enough to earn an outright majority, forcing a runoff in June. For Republicans, this was a relief, given that there was some speculation that Ossoff would hit the 50 percent mark Tuesday. Trump cagily positioned anything less than an Ossoff majority as a win for Republicans \u2014 and himself \u2014 but it\u2019s safer to say that the party simply held off disaster.\n\n\n\nSupporters of Jon Ossoff wait for election returns Tuesday night in Atlanta. Ossoff is the Democratic candidate in the race for Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District in a special election to replace Tom Price, who is now health and human services secretary. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nIt\u2019s certainly true that Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District is more favorable territory than the Kansas 4th, where Democrats made a run at stealing a seat left vacant when Trump elevated Mike Pompeo to run the CIA. (The 6th is vacant because Trump tapped Tom Price to run the Department of Health and Human Services.) But it\u2019s still a Republican-leaning district, as made obvious by Price\u2019s 2016 victory \u2014 he won reelection by 23.2 percentage points \u2014 and the fact that Trump won the district, according to analysis from DailyKos. But Hillary Clinton, Trump\u2019s Democatic presidential rival, did much better there than one might have expected, trailing Trump by only 1.5 points. If we compare the Cook Political Report\u2019s Partisan Voting Index for the Georgia and Kansas seats with the 2016 results, the Kansas 4th is squarely in line with how you\u2019d have expected Trump to fare (as indicated by the dashed trend line). The Georgia 6th isn\u2019t; Clinton overperformed.\n\nThe easy way to read this is that Trump is less popular in the district than you may have expected. As The Washington Post\u2019s Robert Costa noted on Twitter, the Republican candidates who aligned themselves most closely with Trump fared poorly \u2014 and the eventual winner, Karen Handel, was \u201cmeh\u201d about the president when Costa spoke with her.\n\nThat played to Ossoff\u2019s advantage. According to data compiled by the New York Times, Ossoff outperformed Clinton\u2019s percentage of support in 159 of the 207 precincts in the district. The median margin by which he did better was 2.1 percentage points \u2014 in a lower-turnout election, but still. What\u2019s more, Ossoff got a higher percentage of the vote in 102 precincts than Trump did \u2014 almost half \u2014 and the median margin by which he trailed Trump in those precincts was only 0.2 points. Overall, Daily Kos estimates that Trump got 48.3 percent of the vote in the Georgia 6th. Ossoff got 48.1 percent. That means that Trump\u2019s trying to frame Ossoff\u2019s results as a loss even though he did just about as well.\n\nOf course, the runoff will not include a third party, as the Trump-Clinton contest did. As it stands, Ossoff\u2019s 48.1 percent is the vast majority of the vote for Democrats in the race, while Handel\u2019s 19.8 percent is less than half of all of the Republican votes. That\u2019s a big part of the reason that Democrats hoped for a knockout blow Tuesday. The consolidated GOP vote in the special election (among 11 candidates) was larger than the consolidated Democratic vote (among five). In total, Republicans won a majority of the votes cast.\n\nThe dynamics change now, and Trump\u2019s bravado will be put to the test. After all, Ossoff actually overperformed the polling, which had him at about 46 percent, according to FiveThirtyEight. An Emerson College poll from late last week put him at about 44 percent. This is a seat that Republicans should hold, if only because 80 percent of special elections don\u2019t change hands between parties. But Trump\u2019s relative unpopularity and the national focus on the seat make things complicated.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Trump called Handel to congratulate her. The question now is whether Trump will actually campaign for her, giving up a weekend at Mar-a-Lago to appear with her at a rally to encourage Republicans to turn out on her behalf. Or, really, the question is whether she\u2019d even want him to do that. Setting aside questions of how the parties will fare in 2018, the question of the moment is if a Republican president is an asset or a liability to a Republican candidate in a Republican district, three months into his presidency.\n\nThat, in a nutshell, answers one question about who won and who lost on Tuesday night."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/stone-who-would-engage-in-espionage-on-twitter-who-would-be-that-stupid-not-me/2017/04/19/90a99574-2503-11e7-928e-3624539060e8_video.html", "text": "- Former Trump advisor and longtime friend Roger Stone discusses his communication with Russian hacker Guccifer 2.0 and Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.

And when lawmakers return next week, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s first order of business will be to swear in the newest House Republican, Ron Estes, after his special election win in Kansas last week.\n\nBut both races gave Republicans a scare they never would have anticipated six months ago \u2014 and demonstrated that Democrats have galvanized the anti-Trump activism of the past three months into votes at the ballot box. Even though Democrats came up short in each race, these were seats way down the list of top Democratic targets. This was particularly true of the Estes race, in a district where Trump won by an overwhelming margin.\n\nFar richer targets await in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\n[Republicans avoid big loss by forcing runoff in Ga. House race]\n\n(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nAnd in the near term, Republicans find themselves facing the same task \u2014 figuring out how to fulfill President Trump\u2019s agenda \u2014 that rallied Democrats in the first place.\n\nDemocrats believe that Jon Ossoff\u2019s performance, less than two points shy of the 50 percent threshold he needed to win outright, validated their emerging strategy of focusing on dozens of GOP seats in diverse, well-educated suburbs across the country in advance of next year\u2019s elections. Price regularly won this seat north of Atlanta without breaking a sweat, but Trump won the region by just 1.5 percentage points last year.\n\n[For Republicans in Georgia\u2019s 6th District, a delicate dance with Trump]\n\nThat signaled a potential vulnerability for several dozen Republicans in similar suburban areas, many of whom, like Price, have regularly won reelection by wide margins. Almost all of these Republicans have never run for Congress with a Republican president in office.\n\nThey are Republicans such as Reps. Lee Zeldin from Long Island and Ryan Costello from Philadelphia\u2019s western suburbs, both elected in 2014, and Reps. Erik Paulsen from the Twin Cities suburbs and Leonard Lance of New Jersey, both elected in 2008. All four won reelection last November in a rout, with Lance\u2019s 11-percentage-point win being the smallest margin of the four.\n\nNow they are all Democratic targets next year because of the suburban makeup of their districts. Previously they ran as independent checks against a Democratic president whose popularity wavered in those regions, but now they must choose sides \u2014 defend or distance themselves from Trump.\n\n\u201cEven if he doesn\u2019t hit 50 tonight, Ossoff is showing us the path to retaking the House. It runs through the Panera Breads of America,\u201d Brian Fallon, a former adviser to Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), wrote Tuesday on Twitter.\n\nDemocrats need a net gain of 24 seats to reclaim the House majority, and Ossoff\u2019s strong showing will heighten the attention on every decision made by Republicans in potential swing districts over the next 18 months.\n\nHouse Republicans have already backed off one attempt to pass Ryan\u2019s plan to revise the 2010 Affordable Care Act, because of a revolt from conservatives and moderates. The House is midway through an 18-day break in which some Republicans have faced angry voters at town halls complaining that Ryan\u2019s health-care plan would leave millions uninsured.\n\nTrump has been pushing for more negotiating and for a vote later this spring. The task was already an uphill fight. Now, after Kansas and Georgia, House Republicans may be even more anxious about voting on the controversial plan.\n\nIf Republicans start believing their majority is imperiled, everything will grow more difficult. Each vote could bring more doubt from rank-and-file lawmakers wondering whether they are walking a plank toward defeat in the midterms.\n\nLegislative paralysis, in turn, could imperil Republican fortunes even more.\n\nTrump came into office with a sweeping prediction that he would win so much that the public would get tired of winning. Ryan spent last year waving his \u201cBetter Way\u201d policy prescriptions, which he promised would become a reality under a Republican Congress and president.\n\nIf Republicans don\u2019t push through some parts of Trump\u2019s agenda, they\u2019ll have very little to show voters next year in their reelection bids.\n\nThis is a new dilemma for Republicans. Since winning the House during the 2010 midterms, they have behaved as if their gerrymandered districts created a permanent majority. They pushed the U.S. treasury to the brink of default in 2011 yet lost only a few seats the following year; they forced a government shutdown in 2013, only to expand their majority in 2014 to its largest since the Great Depression.\n\nFast-forward to this year, when, in the span of one week, Republicans needed a last-minute infusion of cash from conservative groups in Washington to prop up Estes and saw a nearly $5 million barrage of ads against Ossoff do nothing more than keep him from winning outright in a district that has been held by Republicans since 1979. Those GOP groups will probably spend that much and more between now and the June 20 runoff.\n\nAli Lapp, president of a Democratic super PAC, the House Majority PAC, questioned whether, by the fall of 2018, the GOP would be \u201cprepared to spend that much money in all districts this Republican.\u201d\n\nOssoff\u2019s fate may not be the best determinant of whether they need to. Even if he loses in June, it might be a false positive.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened in June 2006, when Republicans poured all their resources into narrowly winning a special election to replace the imprisoned Randy \u201cDuke\u201d Cunningham. Democrats did the same in May 2010, eking out a win in a special election to replace the late John P. Murtha in western Pennsylvania.\n\nIn each instance, the majority party claimed that the race showed they were well positioned for the midterm elections. In each instance, they were wrong: Democrats proceeded to lose the majority in 2010, and Republicans lost in 2006.\n\nThe reality was that those special elections demonstrated only that the party in power had the wherewithal to win in a single head-to-head contest. When the general elections arrived, one side was trying to defend 60 or more vulnerable seats, while the minority had only a few at-risk districts to protect.\n\nNow, Republicans have to decide whether to keep pushing the big and bold plans on health care and an overhaul of the tax code \u2014 or whether to pull back the ambition in the hope for some narrower victories.\n\nEach path has its own level of vulnerability, as two straight close special elections have demonstrated.\n\nRead more from Paul Kane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/democrat-jon-ossoff-faces-runoff-in-ga-house-race/2017/04/19/8ee5760e-24c7-11e7-928e-3624539060e8_video.html", "text": "- Jon Ossoff, a Democratic candidate in Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District, will face Republican Karen Handel in a June 20 runoff, after winning the most votes in the April 18 special election but failing to reach the 50 percent threshold.

Instead, with 48.3 percent, Ossoff was headed to a runoff against Republican Karen Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state and the top GOP vote-getter in a special election to replace Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price in Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District.\n\nIn a statement early Wednesday, Ossoff acknowledged that he had fallen short.\n\n\u201cThis is already a remarkable victory,\u201d he said. \u201cWe defied the odds, shattered expectations, and now are ready to fight on and win in June.\u201d\n\nOssoff could find it difficult to sustain the momentum he witnessed this past week in a traditionally Republican district that has been in GOP hands since 1979. Although Handel had earned 19.7 percent of the vote with 88 percent of precincts reporting, in a runoff she is widely expected to rally Republican voters who had divided their votes among 11 GOP candidates in Tuesday\u2019s race.\n\nDemocratic candidate Jon Ossoff walks offstage after speaking to his supporters as votes continued to be counted in the House race for Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District on Tuesday in Atlanta. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nJust before midnight, at her election night party in Roswell, Handel thanked supporters and urged Republicans to unite. \u201cTomorrow we start the campaign anew,\u201d she said.\n\nOssoff took the stage at his own party, his voice hoarse. \u201cWe will be ready to fight on and win in June if it\u2019s necessary,\u201d Ossoff said. \u201cBring it on.\u201d\n\nHandel\u2019s showing was due to more than name recognition from her long tenure in state politics, which has included unsuccessful runs for governor and U.S. Senate. She also benefited from $1.3 million in support from Ending Spending, a conservative advocacy group aligned with the billionaire Ricketts family.\n\nNational GOP groups, meanwhile, are readying new waves of television advertising.\n\nDemocrats had hoped to upend the national political landscape with a stunning victory in this round of voting, rousing their demoralized party just five months after Trump won the White House and stoking a burgeoning anti-Trump movement across the country. Ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections, they saw an opportunity to raise expectations about possibly winning back majorities in Congress.\n\nOssoff\u2019s candidacy gave Democrats an exhilarating if brief taste of what it will be like to compete in a ruby-red district next year, when they have to win 24 seats to take back the House.\n\nRepublicans, at war with each other as much as with Democrats, were aiming to escape with a reprieve in the turbulent age of Trump. Facing more battles to come in 2018, the contest gave them little clarity about the party\u2019s ideological drift and how much it should be tethered to the president in the future.\n\nSupporters of Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff wait for election returns in the race for Georgia's 6th Congressional District in a special election to replace Tom Price, who is now the secretary of Health and Human Services on April 18, 2017 in Atlanta, Georgia.

Glad to be of help!\u201d\n\nMany Democrats moved quickly to frame the energy around Ossoff\u2019s bid as a damaging referendum on Trump as he nears the 100-day mark of a presidency so far defined by an early stumble on health-care legislation and a GOP split into bickering factions.\n\nEven as the campaigns waited for the count to finish, Ossoff\u2019s team cast the incomplete results in a glowing light.\n\n\"While we await the final election results this evening, our first-place finish is a remarkable achievement that many said would never even happen,\u201d said Ossoff campaign manager Keenan Pontoni. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Jon has incredible energy and support behind him that will only grow whether we win tonight or in June.\u201d\n\nPer Georgia law, a runoff ballot would feature the two top finishers from the crowded nonpartisan primary, which was called after Price, who had represented the district since 2005, vacated the seat to join Trump\u2019s Cabinet. The district is a bastion of white college-educated professionals and upscale shopping centers.\n\nOssoff, 30, a former congressional staffer and political novice who catapulted to national notice, raised more than $8 million and drew heavy support from prominent Democrats and liberal organizers. They saw his campaign, as well as a special House election last week in Kansas where a Democrat narrowly lost, as symbolic battlegrounds for their recovering party.\n\nTrump personally intervened in the final days, which risked becoming a political squall. On Tuesday, he tweeted that Republicans \u201cmust get out today and VOTE in Georgia 6\u201d and warned that \u201cDem Ossoff will raise your taxes\u201d and is \u201cvery bad on crime.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials, such as chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, paid close attention to the Georgia election, well aware of the implications for Trump\u2019s political capital as the president attempts to jolt his agenda in the coming months.\n\nTrump continued to weigh in on the race in the late afternoon, pointing out in a tweet that Ossoff \u201cdoesn\u2019t even live in the district.\u201d Republicans, he implored at 4:38 p.m. Eastern, \u201cget out and vote!\u201d\n\nOssoff acknowledged in a CNN interview that he lives with his girlfriend near Emory University, which is outside of the district.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been living with my girlfriend, Alisha, for 12 years now down by Emory University where she\u2019s a full-time medical student,\u201d Ossoff said. \u201cAs soon as she concludes her medical training, I\u2019ll be 10 minutes back up the street in the district where I grew up.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Alisyn Camerota, intrigued, then asked, \u201cSo when are you going to marry her?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to give anything away,\u201d Ossoff said. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a call when I have something to announce.\u201d\n\nThe clip was quickly picked up by news outlets. Looking ahead to a likely run-off, national Republicans seized on Ossoff\u2019s statement as another example of his lack of roots in the district, a critique that has been made repeatedly against the Democrat throughout the campaign. The Drudge Report, a driver of conservative Web traffic, made the story its banner, knocking the \u201cDem Trump slayer\u201d as an interloper.\n\nWhen asked Tuesday on Air Force One whether the Georgia race was a referendum on Trump\u2019s first 100 days, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t use the word referendum.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think [Trump] hopes to have a Republican elected to that seat, and hopefully it will be someone to follow in Tom Price\u2019s footsteps and be a leader from that district,\u201d Sanders told reporters.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, volunteers for Ossoff \u2014 mostly youthful, clad in blue T-shirts and carrying bundles of door-knocking materials \u2014 rushed excitedly around a low-slung campaign outpost in the Atlanta suburbs to stoke turnout.\n\nAt Ossoff\u2019s cramped phone bank in Chamblee, situated between dental offices and piled with doughnut boxes and campaign posters, his staffers joked that the tweets amounted to an in-kind contribution that would incite their party\u2019s base to show up. Trump\u2019s messages also reflected how this once sleepy race had landed at the center of the political universe.\n\n\u201cThe campaign has taken on a life of its own,\u201d said Ossoff aide Alyssa Castillo, 20, who works in public relations for a distribution center in DeKalb County. \u201cWhatever happens, this is the start of something bigger, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\nCelia Henson, a stay-at-home mother from Decatur who identifies as an independent Democrat, said Tuesday night that Trump retains his support \u201cfrom most people around here who like him since nothing he does seems to get him in trouble.\u201d\n\nBut more on-the-fence voters in the Atlanta suburbs, Henson said, have grown restless or uneasy about the president since his inauguration in January and since he has \u201ckept tweeting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a district where people care about respect, people being respected and they don\u2019t like how he acts,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the final, frantic hours of canvassing and phone calls, avoiding a runoff was the priority. \u201cNo run-off, vote for Ossoff,\u201d read one poster at the Chamblee office.\n\n\u201cLook at the map,\u201d Tish Naghise, an Ossoff field organizer, said as she pointed to a green layout of the district on the wall. \u201cHillary Clinton came close to winning here, but you have to do really well in Chamblee and Tucker, do well in diverse areas, if you\u2019re going to have a shot of competing throughout this whole area.\u201d\n\nThe Republican slate in the 6th District had been roiled in recent weeks by nerves about Trump and lingering internecine dramas over ideological purity and local loyalties. While some GOP candidates sought to align closely with Trump, others chose more cautious paths in an effort to navigate the president\u2019s mixed popularity here.\n\nRepublicans\u2019 failure to pass their plan to overhaul the nation\u2019s health-care system frustrated some suburban GOP voters about Trump\u2019s effectiveness in cutting deals with lawmakers in Washington, as well as about the party\u2019s promises.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee dispatched staffers to Georgia to boost turnout among core GOP voters amid those grumbles. The Congressional Leadership Fund, an outfit aligned with the House GOP, has spent more than $2 million on a spate of negative television spots about Ossoff.\n\nSeveral GOP candidates \u2014 Dan Moody, Bob Gray, Bruce LeVell, Amy Kremer \u2014 embraced Trump and cast themselves as his would-be allies in Washington. Others were supportive but not always enthusiastic, such as Handel and Judson Hill. One Republican, David Abroms, opposed the president. Most of the leading candidates bounced between those poles depending on the day or the latest controversy.\n\n[This cowboy-poet is trying to steal a Republican House seat in Montana]\n\nRepublicans veered between wanting a typical party man to preferring a Trump-style hard-liner. In interviews, some voters genteelly tried to sidestep questions about loyalty to Trump, and the varying levels of support the President has seen from Republican candidates here in the 6th.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t support Karen based on who she supported for President,\u201d said Allison Newman, a 42 year-old special education teacher, when asked why she and her husband supported Handel. \u201cWe supported Karen based on her track record, she\u2019s ethical and she\u2019s a good person.\u201d\n\nOthers said the Trump factor was paramount. \u201cIt\u2019s important that he agrees with Trump on issues of trade and certain platforms of Trump\u2019s campaign,\u201d said Brendan Foy, 36, a volunteer for Gray who also served as a North Carolina field director last year for Trump. \u201cI voted for him the same reasons Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania voted for him.\u201d\n\nLeVell, an African American jeweler and former Trump campaign adviser, as well as Trump-aligned conservative activist Kremer, never gained traction in a Republican district that is not dominated by grass-roots nationalism. Abroms, who campaigned with anti-Trump independent Evan McMullin, also failed to land on the political map.\n\nGray was seen by Republicans in recent days as having the best shot of outpacing Handel and making a runoff, since he began inching up in various eleventh-hour polls.\n\nAt Gray\u2019s campaign office in Johns Creek on Tuesday, his effort to tie himself to Trump was obvious. A massive poster of Vice President Pence greeted visitors at the office entrance. To the right, a yard sign from the Trump campaign was propped against a stack of \u201cGray for Congress\u201d signs. In a conference room, a photo of the president gave a big thumbs-up to phone-banking volunteers.\n\nBrittany Evrard, 27, a volunteer for the Gray campaign, said Gray\u2019s pro-Trump stance was \u201cvery much\u201d part of what made up her mind.\n\nBut by early Wednesday morning, Gray was stuck at 10 percent in the returns.\n\nJonathan Lee Krohn in Johns Creek, Ga., contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/for-republicans-in-georgias-6th-district-a-delicate-dance-with-trump/2017/04/19/f5cd98ce-2481-11e7-a1b3-faff0034e2de_story.html", "text": "In a tiny manager\u2019s office at the back of the kitchen of an Italian family restaurant here, Republican Bob Gray explained that he never would have run for Congress if it weren\u2019t for Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cIf this was any other year or we didn\u2019t have the kind of president that we have, I would not have run,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI recognized if Trump is one thing, he is a disrupter. And if you want significant change, you need a leader who is able to disrupt.\u201d\n\nLike Trump, Gray considers himself a disrupter. He\u2019s a businessman, he said, whose only prior elected office was to the City Council of the Atlanta suburb of Johns Creek. Like Trump, he added, he was an outsider who wasn\u2019t part of the establishment. Even his slogan was cribbed from Trump: \u201cAmerica First. Conservative Always.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t do much for Gray in Tuesday night\u2019s special election in Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District, however.\n\nIn a district Trump had carried by just 1.5 percentage points last year, Gray had banked on just enough pro-Trump Republicans to carry him into a runoff with Democrat Jon Ossoff. With the GOP vote split between 11 Republican candidates, it wasn\u2019t an entirely wild idea, but as midnight approached on Tuesday, it became clear that it was just a fantasy.\n\nKaren Handel, a Republican candidate for Georgia's 6th Congressional District, appeared headed for a June runoff against Democrat Jon Ossoff after a special election on Tuesday. (David Goldman/AP)\n\nInstead, the evening would go to Karen Handel, who appeared headed to a runoff with Ossoff early Wednesday.\n\nFor most Republican voters in the 6th District, Trump loyalty has become a matter of begrudging party loyalty. It\u2019s a delicate dance, and Handel found a way to do it best.\n\n[Democrat Jon Ossoff appears headed to runoff in Ga. House race]\n\nShe didn\u2019t ape Trump\u2019s slogan or paste photos of the president on her campaign headquarter walls or have supporters wave Trump signs at a campaign rally the way Gray did, but she paid lip service to the Trump agenda. She went so far as to list Trump\u2019s border wall on her website as a key policy proposal, but she did it without actually mentioning the president by name.\n\n\u201cDo I support the president? Absolutely,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cBut my job, if I have the privilege of being the next congressman, is not to be an extension of the White House. It is to be the best representative.\u201d\n\nWhen more than half of unofficial returns had come in, Gray\u2019s share of the vote was below 10 percent. Gray had been projected to get around 15 percent, within striking distance of Handel, the Republican front-runner. It didn\u2019t happen.\n\nBy then, Gray\u2019s campaign manager, Tyler Jacobs, had moved from the \u201cwar room\u201d\u2014 a single laptop surrounded by a black curtain \u2014 to the bar. Gray was preparing to make his remarks. His supporters seemed deflated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not ready to say it\u2019s over yet,\u201d Gray said, but he knew it was. And so did his supporters. So he implored them, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to rally behind Karen Handel.\u201d\n\nNo one cheered; there was no applause for party unity. And why should there be? For at least some of Gray\u2019s most hardcore supporters, they had supported him specifically because of his love for Trump.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s willing to support the president, and I voted for the president,\u201d said Brittany Evrard, a 27 year-old substitute teacher from Fulton County who volunteered for both Trump and Gray.\n\nHandel might like Trump fine, supporters like Evrard figured, but she wasn\u2019t like Gray. She wasn\u2019t, as he\u2019d say, a disrupter. But she was the choice of more 6th District Republicans than any other candidate.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/iranian-american-groups-testify-in-washington-seeking-new-ban-on-trump-travel-order/2017/04/18/65d31b20-23ca-11e7-bb9d-8cd6118e1409_story.html", "text": "Leaders of Iranian-American organizations asked a U.S. district court in Washington Tuesday to become the latest to order a nationwide halt to President Trump\u2019s executive order banning new visas and immigration from six Muslim-majority countries.\n\nTestimony came on behalf of the largest ethnic group directly affected by the March 6 order, and was entered in one of a half-dozen challenges to the White House action watched closely by legal analysts.\n\nThe lawsuit is unusual in that U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan of Washington allowed live testimony by individuals who allege they are harmed by the order, and because the case is on a fast-track, said Michigan University law professor Margo Schlanger, sponsor of the Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse that is tracking more than 80 related lawsuits.\n\nAn order by a third U.S. trial judge to freeze the ban, if granted, would take direct effect only if similar decisions made March 15 by federal district judges in Hawaii and Maryland were overturned. However, the legal arguments raised by American immigrants from the Middle East\u2019s most populous nation could play a role in a fight widely seen as destined for the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nMore Iranians received U.S. visas in 2015 than nationals from the other five countries on the list combined \u2014 Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Libya \u2014 or 57 percent of the total including Iraq, which was initially on the travel ban list but later dropped. Meanwhile, Iranian students accounted for about 80 percent of foreign students last year from the same countries, according to State Department data.\n\nLawyers for the four suing groups \u2014 Pars Equality Center, the Iranian American Bar Association, National Iranian American Council, and Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans \u2014 said the success of the Iranian-American community is a national security asset, not a threat, as the U.S. seeks a more moderate Iran.\n\nMigration policy groups cited U.S. population surveys showing half of the estimated 1 million Iranian-Americans living in the United States work as professionals, many arriving after the 1979 Islamic revolution topped the U.S.-backed shah of Iran.\n\nThe lawyers for the groups suing said they assembled 16 plaintiffs and statements from 25 people to show a range of people harmed by the White House ban and to overcome legal barriers to suing in federal court. They also asked the judge Tuesday to order a resumption of visa granting processes.\n\nThe statements come from individuals who told the court they face barriers to travel for business and investment opportunities, attending the wedding and births of children, and schooling. They included accounts by students on visas, U.S. permanent residents awaiting reunification with family members, dual citizens, U.N.-approved and vetted refu\u00adgee families and an Iranian resident with an approved nonimmigrant visa issued to researchers, professors and cultural exchange visitors.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of our resources\u201d have been diverted to educating the public \u201con this one issue, bar association president Babak Yousefzadeh, of San Francisco, testified during the two-hour hearing. \u201cIt frustrates the mission of the IABA,\u201d he said, which is to educate and increase civic participation by Iranian-Americans and to communicate their concerns to government.\n\nLeila Golestaneh Austin, executive director of the alliance, echoed those claims, adding its members see a chilling effect on finding talent for their businesses, and have had to respond to a rise in hate crimes and postpone efforts such as a sports diplomacy initiative.\n\nJustice Department civil division attorney Daniel Schwei said that travel by members of the groups who are U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents is not restricted, that many of the plaintiff declarations predate the latest version of the order, and that groups\u2019 assertions of \u201ccontinuous harm\u201d are inaccurate since the order has been stayed.\n\nThe White House issued its March order rescinding and replacing a broader January travel ban that courts had rejected. Trump\u2019s revised version suspended the U.S. refugee program for 120 days and halted for 90 days the issuance of new visas to people from the six countries.\n\n[Federal judges in Hawaii, Maryland, freeze President Trump\u2019s new entry ban]\n\nJudges in cases brought by the state of Hawaii and refu\u00adgee organizations based in Maryland who froze aspects of the most recent ban agreed the Trump order could be construed as unconstitutionally discriminating on religious grounds.\n\nBy comparison, the Iranian-American case, brought by Iranian-American civil rights lawyer Cyrus Mehri and the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, draws on civil rights precedents directed at bias based on ethnicity and national origin.\n\nThe case, which is being heard with another lawsuit brought by a Shi\u2019a Muslim group and two Yemeni individuals, has flown under the radar compared with the Hawaii and Maryland cases, which were the first to prompt nationwide injunctions. But like the others, it is moving at an expedited pace.\n\nJustice Department officials said the court rulings are flawed both in reasoning and scope, and promised to continue to defend the executive order and the president\u2019s lawful authority to protect the nation\u2019s security.\n\n\u201cFor the past 30 years, every President has invoked his power to protect the Nation by suspending entry of categories of aliens. As a legal matter, this Order is no different,\u201d department lawyers argued in the Washington case.\n\nDepartment lawyers unsuccessfully urged Chutkan not to allow Tuesday\u2019s live testimony or Friday\u2019s scheduled preliminary injunction hearing. The department lawyers told the court that they were not disputing the truthfulness and credibility of the plaintiff group\u2019s leaders, only their legal import."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-makes-rare-trip-outside-washington-to-sell-his-america-first-agenda/2017/04/18/c30dd4a8-2445-11e7-a1b3-faff0034e2de_story.html", "text": "An American flag made of wrenches is displayed as President Trump speaks during an event at Snap-on headquarters in Kenosha, Wis., on April 18. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News)\n\nPresident Trump on Tuesday traded the gold drapery of the Oval Office for a backdrop of glittering American-made tools at a manufacturing company here, promising \u201cbold new steps\u201d to boost American workers and companies.\n\nFor a president who has come to love the optics of an Oval Office signing ceremony and prefers to remain close to home, the event, held in a state he narrowly won in November, represented a change of scenery and strategy.\n\nBy hitting the road, White House officials are seeking to reassure the president\u2019s supporters that he will keep promises made during the campaign \u2014 following policy reversals that raised questions about whether the administration is moving away from its nationalistic agenda toward a more centrist approach.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do everything in our power to make sure more products are stamped with those wonderful words \u2018Made in the USA,\u2019 \u201d Trump told the employees of the Kenosha-based tool manufacturer Snap-on. \u201cWe\u2019re sending a powerful signal to the world. We\u2019re going to protect our workers, defend our jobs and finally put America first.\u201d\n\nShortly afterward, Trump signed an executive order that will attempt to limit foreign workers coming to the United States by cracking down on fraud and abuse in a high-skilled visa program, fully enforce rules barring foreign contractors from bidding on federal contracts, and ensure that steel used in federal projects is melted and poured in the United States.\n\nLeft unmentioned at Tuesday\u2019s event was Trump\u2019s history of manufacturing some of his company\u2019s products overseas and hiring foreign workers at his properties. Several of his businesses, including golf clubs and his modeling agency, have also sought to use the visa program targeted by the order.\n\nTrump has rarely ventured far from the White House or his private properties as president, even to boost his agenda. Allies said that approach is a mistake and one that has kept him from fully capitalizing on the political support that put him in office.\n\n\u201cTrump won because of states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania,\u201d said Stephen Moore, a strategic partner at 32 Advisors who advised Trump on economic issues during the campaign. \u201cThose voters took a gamble on him. If I were him, I\u2019d be going back to those neighborhoods and towns all the time, because you dance with the one who brung you.\u201d\n\nTrump won a narrow victory in Wisconsin \u2014 beating Hillary Clinton by 27,000 votes \u2014 in part by promising to bring back well-paying American jobs that had been leaving manufacturing states for decades. Experts warn many of those types of jobs will not return, but Trump\u2019s attention to the issue won over voters. His victories in the industrial Midwest punctured a decades-long history of these states remaining solidly in the Democratic column.\n\nBut even while Trump\u2019s aides have warned resistant lawmakers in both parties that he will travel to their districts and pressure them to support his agenda, the president has not followed through on the threat.\n\nEven Tuesday\u2019s event did not target any reticent congressional Republicans or Democrats \u2014 it was instead held in the district of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.).\n\nThe visit did mark an opportunity for Trump to return to campaign mode and reiterate the big promises he made on the trail but has not delivered on since taking office.\n\nAlthough the executive order Trump signed Tuesday included a modest provision calling for his administration to review trade agreements with an eye toward making them fairer for American workers, Trump, apparently ad-libbing during his speech, said he is going to make \u201cvery big changes\u201d to the North American Free Trade Agreement ,\u201cor we are going to get rid of NAFTA for once and for all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue like this,\u201d he added.\n\nBut last month, the Trump administration sent a draft letter to Congress that proposed making more-modest changes to the agreement than he promised during the campaign and on Tuesday.\n\nTrump also boasted that his administration has \u201caccomplished more in the first 90 days\u201d than any other in history, but much of his agenda has failed to advance in Congress and his proposed travel ban on six Muslim-majority countries has been blocked by the courts.\n\nThe hits have taken a toll. A new Gallup poll released this week found that just 45 percent of Americans believe Trump will keep his promises, compared with 62 percent who said the same in February.\n\nTrump\u2019s trip to Wisconsin was an attempt to maintain his appeal to the working-class voters who supported him in November.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of states that we want to visit and frankly to get outside of the Washington Beltway bubble to do some of these executive orders where we\u2019re talking about American jobs,\u201d said White House communications director Michael Dubke.\n\nThis year, Trump traveled to Michigan \u2014 another normally Democratic state that he narrowly won \u2014 to promote a review of environmental fuel standards, an action supported by automakers. But few of the president\u2019s trips have been dedicated to specific items on his agenda.\n\nInstead, Trump has participated in rallies that the White House has billed as \u201ccampaign events.\u201d\n\nEven during the push for the Republicans\u2019 health-care bill, Trump\u2019s travel outside Washington featured campaign rallies in solidly red states such as Tennessee and Kentucky, and even then the push for the bill received only a passing mention.\n\nDemocrats say that the trip to Wisconsin and the executive order Trump signed are window dressing for an administration that has otherwise done little to keep Trump\u2019s promise of bringing back American jobs.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve gotten a single job in America because of what the president has done \u2014 including today,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who urged Trump to support a bill backed by Democrats to use American steel and iron for infrastructure projects.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re giving him a path to actually produce jobs,\u201d he added.\n\nOn the normally quiet suburban streets on Kenosha, the fragility of Trump\u2019s victory was on display. Dozens of demonstrators for and against the president clashed outside over his rhetoric about immigrants, Muslims and women.\n\nHelen Powell, 67, took a bus to down the street to try to catch a glimpse of Trump and view the spectacle of protesters gathered at the site of the president\u2019s speech.\n\nShe named \u201cjobs\u201d as the reason she voted for Trump after previously casting a ballot for Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s got God in his life,\u201d she added. \u201cHillary Clinton wasn\u2019t going to help us at all.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cShe was going to get rid of all Christians, and she was going to bring in more Muslims.\u201d\n\nAcross the street, Dawn Wrath, who didn\u2019t vote for Trump, walked over to the crowd with her daughter after taking the day off from work.\n\nWrath, 41, said she has no problem with the president\u2019s jobs message, \u201cif it\u2019s true.\u201d But she said that isn\u2019t the reason Wisconsinites voted for him.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s mainly racism,\u201d she added."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trump-promises-bold-new-steps-for-american-workers/2017/04/18/96607d5c-246d-11e7-928e-3624539060e8_video.html", "text": "- President Trump signed his \"Buy American, Hire American\" executive order at a factory in Kenosha, Wis., on April 18.

(Kevin D. Liles/The Washington Post)\n\nWhen you think about it, it\u2019s not all that surprising that most special elections for House seats result in the party that originally held the seat retaining control. After all, the voters are the same; if they wanted a Republican in the previous election, it makes sense that they would want a Republican when voting on some random Tuesday 15 months later. Special elections are special, happening at weird times and generally seeing weird electorates. But they generally turn out the same way.\n\nSmart Politics\u2019s Eric Ostermeier looked at 378 special House elections that have been held since the 77th Congress in 1941. His analysis determined that 20.1 percent of those elections resulted in the seat changing hands between party. The other 79.9 percent of the time, the same party controlled the seat before and after the vote.\n\nOstermeier also determined that the current stretch of 19 straight special-election wins by the incumbent party is tied for the longest since 1941. (The other 19-election stretch was from November 1953 to May 1959.) If Democrat Jon Ossoff can prevail in the race in Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District on Tuesday, it would be the first seat to flip since a special election in November 2012.\n\nThe data Ostermeier used for his analysis is proprietary, and historic House special election results are tricky to come by. (The House Clerk didn\u2019t return our request for information by the time this article was published.) Wikipedia has a lengthy list of House special elections, though, allowing us to do some analysis.\n\nOf the 350 races since January 1917 on that list, slightly more seats were held by Democrats than Republicans \u2014 and Republicans were slightly more likely to flip the seat to their advantage.\n\nOverall, the seats changed hands at about the same rate as Ostermeier determined: 20.5 percent. There\u2019s no particular pattern to when it happens, though there are clear droughts over time when there were either no special elections or no seats that flipped. In only four years (indicated below with gray bars) were there no special elections.\n\nThe overall pattern? Twofold. Parties generally retain seats, but when they flip is fairly scattered.\n\nWhat does this tell us about Georgia? A Republican seat in a Republican district will usually be won by a Republican in a special election.

Some was returned to victims, and some went in the federal treasury.\n\nAdam Unikowsky, a Washington lawyer representing Charles R. Kokesh, who has been convicted of federal securities fraud, said the government was claiming an open-ended ability to impose punishments. This latitude, Unikowsky said, even exceeds that for punishing terrible violent crimes.\n\nIt seeks enforcement actions \u201cbased on conduct dating back forever, with no statute of limitations at all,\u201d he said.\n\nHe seemed to find a receptive audience, notably Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.\n\nRoberts quoted a predecessor, Chief Justice John Marshall, as saying it was \u201cutterly repugnant to the genius of our laws to have a penalty remedy without limit.\u201d Marshall was talking about a statute of limitations, Roberts said.\n\n\u201cThe concern, it seems to me, is multiplied when it\u2019s not only no limitation but it\u2019s something that the government kind of devised on its own,\u201d he said.\n\nJustice Department lawyer Elaine J. Goldenberg, representing the SEC, disputed Roberts\u2019s premise.\n\nDisgorgement is not a penalty, she said. \u201cIt remedies unjust enrichment and just takes the person back to where they would have been\u201d had they not acted illegally.\n\nKokesh is a Santa Fe, N.M., businessman who was convicted of misappropriating money from four investment companies he controlled from 1995 through 2006 and using the proceeds for a lavish lifestyle. A judge in 2015 ordered him to pay a $2.4 million civil penalty.\n\nBut because the SEC has interpreted disgorgement to have no time restraint, the judge said Kokesh must also pay $35 million, the calculated amount of illegal profits dating back to the initiation of his illegal behavior.\n\nFederal law establishes a five-year statute of limitations on \u201cenforcement of any civil fine, penalty or forfeiture.\u201d But that does not apply to disgorgements, the SEC says.\n\nFederal courts are split on that question. If the five-year limit applies, Kokesh\u2019s disgorgement would be reduced to about $5 million.\n\nUnikowsky said it was clear that the disgorgements were the same as a forfeiture \u2014 a turning over of ill-gotten gains \u2014 so the limitation applies.\n\nHe received some pushback from Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Ginsburg noted that the SEC has been pursuing disgorgements for decades, so Congress could have intervened if it thought the agency was doing something wrong.\n\nBut Unikowsky said it was only relatively recently that the commission had pursued profits from beyond the five-year limit.\n\nAnd when Goldenberg rose to defend the agency, Ginsburg said there was \u201ckind of an unreality\u201d to the government\u2019s argument in this case, since Kokesh\u2019s fine was relatively small compared with the amount of disgorgement.\n\nThe newest justice, Neil M. Gorsuch, noted there was no law governing disgorgements, only the SEC\u2019s regulations. Gorsuch, as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, expressed alarm about a growing administrative state and seemed to signal a belief that this was another example of an agency operating without congressional directive.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just making it up,\u201d he said.\n\nGoldenberg noted that it is not up to the SEC what wrongdoers pay. Judges decide the amounts and where the money goes, she said.\n\nBut Roberts said that was not enough.\n\n\u201cIt does seem to me that we kind of have a special obligation to be concerned about how far back the government can go when it\u2019s something that Congress did not address because it did not specify the remedy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe case is Kokesh v.

You also get some ancillary information: A photo, his height, a nickname that no one uses.\n\nAsk Google\u2019s artificially intelligent question-answering system, same deal. David Wright is 34.\n\nBut until Monday evening if you were to ask the same question of Alexa, the Amazon system that powers the company\u2019s Echo devices, you got a much different response. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nDavid Wright, according to Alexa/Echo, is 234 years old \u2014 by far the oldest person on the Mets roster or in professional baseball or in the recorded history of the human race. Wright may be injured a lot, but that\u2019s only because he\u2019s older than the Constitution of the United States.\n\nThe Alexa app suggests that maybe you\u2019d like to learn more about Wright at Microsoft\u2019s search engine Bing. If you do so, you learn that Wright is \u2026 34 years old.\n\nI first noticed this bug back when David Wright was only 233. At my sister\u2019s house, we were for some reason suddenly curious about how old the Mets all-star was, so we asked her Echo, which stands in the corner of her living room. \u201cAlexa,\u201d we said, triggering the device to listen, \u201chow old is David Wright?\u201d When we learned he was over two centuries old, we were obviously intrigued. Over time, we\u2019d ask the same question repeatedly, to see if the error was fixed. Repeatedly, it was not.\n\nIt is now, because, at long last, I reached out to Amazon to try to figure out where the problem was. Over email and on the phone, the company\u2019s Art Pettigrue explained how Alexa works \u2014 and why, in this case, it didn\u2019t.\n\nSo let\u2019s walk through what happened, step by step.\n\nWhen you make a request of an Echo device (I have the hockey-puck-sized Dot), you get it to listen by prefacing your request with a \u201cwake word,\u201d usually \u201cAlexa.\u201d (Recently, the company expanded the list of wake words it accepts to include \u201cEcho\u201d and \u201cComputer.\u201d) It\u2019s always listening to what you say, but it doesn\u2019t do anything until you say the wake word \u2014 which is why it\u2019s called a \u201cwake\u201d word.\n\nAt that point, the device begins recording what you are saying, isolating the request you\u2019ve made.\n\nThe Echo doesn\u2019t do anything with that question itself. It simply ships the question off to Amazon over the Internet in the form of an audio recording. Once it\u2019s at Amazon, the processing begins.\n\nFirst, Pettigrue explained, Alexa figures out what you\u2019re trying to ask. This is harder than it may sound, requiring the system to pick out a consistent phrase from background noise of conflicting speech patterns. If you\u2019re listening to music as you ask your question, for example, Alexa needs to understand that you\u2019re asking \u201chow old is David Wright\u201d not \u201chow old I shot the is David Wright sheriff but I.\u201d\n\nAmazon calls this \u201cautomatic speech recognition.\u201d\n\nThen once Alexa has your question, it figures out what exactly you\u2019re asking. In this case, the system needs to understand that I\u2019m looking for the age of someone named David Wright. The Amazon term here is \u201cnatural language understanding.\u201d\n\n\u201cA human being is very good at disambiguating multiple responses,\u201d Pettigrue explained, \u201cbut with a voice interface you want to try to make the one, right choice from the very beginning for them.\u201d\n\nSo now Alexa knows what we\u2019re looking for. At this point, the system dips into \u201ca variety of trusted sources\u201d (per Pettigrue) to figure out an answer, if possible.\n\nIn this case, it\u2019s clear that Alexa knew which David Wright I was referring to, given that the response was exactly 200 years off. (Pettigrue said that he\u2019d tried to track down other possible David Wrights with whom Alexa might be confusing the Met \u2014 without luck.) It\u2019s just that, in the database, Wright\u2019s year of birth was incorrect, apparently identifying him as having been born in 1782, at the tail end of the Revolutionary War.\n\nPettigrue said that this was a function of data being input incorrectly by a human user, but was \u201cnot able to share the exact source of the error.\u201d (It has, as noted above, already been corrected.)\n\nOnce Amazon has its answer \u2014 correct or not \u2014 it uses a text-to-speech tool called Alexa Voice Service to convert the answer into an audio file that gets passed back to your Echo.\n\nWhen it receives that audio file, your Echo plays it, informing you that David Wright is 234 years old, which he isn\u2019t.\n\nThere is a saying in the computing world: Garbage in, garbage out. Computers \u2014 even sophisticated artificial intelligence systems \u2014 are simply connections and calculators that manipulate raw data that they are given. Amazon\u2019s Alexa does a very good job of figuring out what you\u2019re asking it, analyzing English language speech patterns to pick out what particular (admittedly simple) question you\u2019re hoping it will answer. But if it\u2019s pulling information from a database that has a garbage birth date for the person you\u2019re wondering about, it will spit out a garbage answer.\n\nThe good news for Mets fans is that David Wright is not 234 years old. The bad news is that, once again, he\u2019s on the disabled list.\n\nIllustrations above are from The Noun Project, including illustrations from contributors anbileru adaleru, Thengakola, Javier Cabezas, Jony, Lluisa Iborra and Lorena Salagre.

Last July, he told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos that he \u201cbid out\u201d production for his ties, but you have \u201ccompanies over in different countries where they devalue their currency and they make it impossible for American companies to compete.\u201d Earlier this week, Trump decided against formally labeling China \u2014 where many of his ties were made \u2014 as a currency manipulator.\n\nHis daughter, now an unpaid White House staffer, continues to do so\n\nAn investigation by NBC News found that Ivanka Trump\u2019s clothing line continues to bring in products made overseas.\n\n\u201cSince Election Day,\u201d NBC reported, \u201cthe apparel brand run by Trump\u2019s daughter has imported 56 shipments of Ivanka Trump products from China and Singapore, part of a total of 215 shipments from Asia since Jan. 1, 2016.\u201d Trump last month announced that she\u2019d be taking a formal position with her father\u2019s administration.\n\nAfter she introduced her father at the Republican National Convention in July, her company\u2019s official Twitter account plugged the dress that she wore during that speech \u2014 a dress that was imported from an overseas manufacturer.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Associated Press reported that Trump\u2019s company had secured trademark protection from the Chinese government to sell products in that country. The trademarks were granted the same day that Trump and her father dined with the Chinese president.\n\nChina has given the initial green light to 38 trademarks linked to President Trump, which would help protect his brand if the Trump Organization expands there in the future. (Reuters)\n\nTrump buys foreign products for his hotels and properties\n\nThere are some occasions in which buying foreign-made products is difficult to avoid. For example: television sets.\n\n\u201cI buy television sets. I buy a tremendous amount of things there because we don\u2019t make television sets anymore, folks,\u201d Trump said during a speech in February 2016. \u201cWe\u2019d like to make them. We used to make them. You remember Sylvania, RCA. But those days are gone.\u201d\n\nPolitiFact looked at this claim and rated it true: There are televisions that are assembled in the United States from components made overseas, but none that are manufactured here.\n\nOn other occasions, though, Trump has less of an excuse.\n\nIn October, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump buildings frequently used imported steel in their manufacture. Trump\u2019s campaign blamed subcontractors for ordering cheaper foreign steel for the projects.\n\n(Trump has repeatedly trumpeted that his approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline shortly after taking office included a mandate that pipeline projects use only American-manufactured steel. However, since the steel for the pipeline already has been purchased, that won\u2019t apply to Keystone.)\n\nIt\u2019s not just the structure of Trump properties that use foreign-made products. Business Insider reported that the furnishings of the hotels \u2014 and even the toiletries \u2014 are also often sourced from foreign countries. Ice buckets from Thailand. Headboards from China. Slippers from Hong Kong. Shower gel from Italy.\n\nTrump and his family have consistently sought to hire foreign workers\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that even the \u201chire American\u201d part of Trump\u2019s executive order is hypocritical.\n\nWe looked at the reliance of Trump properties on guest-worker visas last year. Since 2013, Trump properties including Mar-a-Lago, Trump Vineyards and Trump National Golf Club have sought to fill more than 500 positions with foreign workers under the H-2A visa program. In total, those positions would have earned almost $1 million a month in salary over their durations.\n\nIn that same interview with ABC in July, Stephanopoulos questioned Trump\u2019s use of foreign workers at Mar-a-Lago \u2014 a practice that continued even up to the month before Trump was elected.\n\n\u201cWell, you know what? I don\u2019t hire the people,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cBut if you look at all the other places in Palm Beach, they\u2019re all doing exactly the same thing. And you know why they\u2019re doing that? You know why they\u2019re doing that?

Perhaps recognizing that Trump\u2019s threat was hollow, Meadows\u2019s opposition, paired with that of other conservatives, tanked Trump\u2019s legislation.\n\nSince that disaster for the administration, Trump has had two chances to flex his campaign muscles: a special House election in Kansas\u2019s 4th Congressional District and one on Tuesday in Georgia\u2019s 6th. Republican Ron Estes won the race in Kansas last week, replacing Mike Pompeo, whom Trump chose to run the CIA. In Georgia, Republicans are hoping simply to force a runoff race against Democrat Jon Ossoff, who has consolidated support from his party in a way that none of the numerous Republicans he faces has been able to do. That runoff, though, is likely to mean a contest between Ossoff and one of those Republicans \u2014 much more favorable turf for the party.\n\nThe tight special election in the historically Republican northern suburbs of Atlanta started on April 18. First-time Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff is aiming to capture Georgia's 6th District from Republicans for the first time in nearly four decades. (Reuters)\n\nSo what has Trump done to weigh in against Ossoff? Two of his favorite things: He has tweeted, and he has recorded his own voice.\n\nOver the past few days, Trump has tweeted five times about Ossoff\u2019s race. In the first tweet, he criticized the race for becoming a media event. Then, he disparaged the \u201csuper Liberal Democrat\u201d and declared that a runoff election \u201cwill be a win.\u201d Ossoff, he said Tuesday morning, would be \u201ca disaster in Congress\u201d who would \u201craise your taxes\u201d \u2014 by somehow overpowering the Republican majority.\n\nThose tweets have been retweeted about 51,000 times, combined. Twitter has proven to be an effective way for Trump to dominate media attention when he makes surprising pronouncements such as (falsely) accusing his predecessor of wiretapping his home. But these more anodyne political tweets don\u2019t gin up the same level of interest and, given that only 21 percent of the adult population in the United States uses Twitter \u2014 skewing heavily toward younger Americans who are also less likely to turn out to vote \u2014 the odds that these tweets are motivating much of a response seems low.\n\nTrump also recorded a robo-call in the race \u2014 one of those prerecorded messages that gets pushed to your answering machine. In it, Trump encourages Republicans to vote, but without identifying a candidate. Instead, he exhorts voters to \u201cstop the super liberal Democrats\u201d and keep Ossoff from \u201cflood[ing] our country with illegal immigrants.\u201d\n\nIn a race in which you\u2019d expect the focus to be on Ossoff running against Trump, instead, it\u2019s Trump running against Ossoff.\n\nWill it work? Robo-calls are cheap and easy, which is a key reason they\u2019re popular in political campaigns. But there\u2019s little evidence that they\u2019re terribly effective. In the book \u201cGet Out the Vote,\u201d researchers Donald Green and Alan Gerber detail the utility of various voter-turnout tools. They say that robo-calls \u201cmight help you to stretch your resources in ways that allow you to contact the maximum number of people, but don\u2019t expect to move them very much, if at all.\u201d Multiple studies cited by Green and Gerber showed statistically insignificant effects on turnout \u2014 even when celebrities or the leader of the party were the ones leaving the message.\n\nWhat might Trump have done instead? The Georgia election is a weird one, with no anointed candidate for Trump to stand next to. What\u2019s more, he won the district by only 1.5 points, according to Daily Kos \u2014 meaning that his popular appeal is limited. He certainly could have done an interview with a local television news station or approved a targeted piece of mail to conservative Republicans in the district. White House press secretary Sean Spicer could have invited a local reporter to ask a question remotely during a news briefing. There were ways for Trump to get involved without setting foot in Georgia that he appears not to have done, relying instead on his tweets and his voice.\n\nNot that he did anything more than that in Kansas either. Estes\u2019s victory was a welcome one for Republicans, but it was far closer than might have been expected several months ago. Estes won the district by about seven points \u2014 but Trump won by 27. That was a place where Trump could have helped bolster the Republican more directly, by showing up on the ground for Estes. He didn\u2019t. The weekend before the election, instead of heading to Kansas and holding a get-out-the-vote rally for his party\u2019s nominee, he was at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida \u2014 and his nearby golf course. All Trump did to persuade voters in Estes\u2019s district was to tweet \u2014 once \u2014 and record another robo-call.\n\nRon Estes is running TODAY for Congress in the Great State of Kansas. A wonderful guy, I need his help on Healthcare & Tax Cuts (Reform). \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 11, 2017\n\nEstes\u2019s victory was hardly the sort of thing for which Trump can take credit, given how little he did and how much worse Estes performed than he did. There\u2019s little evidence that Trump knows how to sell anyone politically except for himself \u2014 a challenge that his predecessor also faced. President Barack Obama repeatedly tried to leverage his own popularity on behalf of other candidates, with the net effect of losing the House in 2010 and suffering humiliating losses in 2014. Oh, and, of course, seeing his preferred successor lose in stunning fashion in November.\n\nThe difference between Obama and Trump in this regard seems simply to be that Obama was better at selling his candidacy than Trump was at selling Trump\u2019s. In many places, perhaps including that district in Georgia, Trump doesn\u2019t have popularity to leverage anyway. Meaning that if you\u2019re a candidate wondering if you should rely on Trump to push you over the finish line \u2014 or if you\u2019re wondering if he\u2019ll stand in your way \u2014 you\u2019d be forgiven for assuming that the president and his wan political outreach probably would be a non-factor."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/tom-perez-and-bernie-sanderss-maine-rally-in-three-minutes/2017/04/17/315bf150-23d9-11e7-928e-3624539060e8_video.html", "text": "- Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez and Sen.

What harm had it suffered, specifically, because of Trump\u2019s actions?\n\n(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nThe new plaintiffs are intended to offer an alternative answer to that question. Both say that, as direct competitors of Trump\u2019s restaurants and hotels, they may lose foreign clients, who may book with Trump properties to curry favor with the president.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s damage to our members, both employers\u2019 bottom lines, and workers\u2019 loss of income and tips,\u201d said Saru Jayaraman, co-director of Restaurant Opportunities Centers United.\n\nThat group \u2014 a nonprofit association that says its members include more than 25,000 restaurant workers, 200-plus restaurants and thousands of people who eat in restaurants \u2014 trains restaurant workers and advocates for higher wages.\n\nThe association was one of two plaintiffs added to the lawsuit Tuesday. Jayaraman could not cite a specific instance in which a member of the group had lost a client to a Trump business.\n\nBut she said the potential for such a development is clear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a free market, or a free country, when foreign governments feel like they have to eat and patronize Trump hotels and restaurants because he\u2019s the president of the United States,\u201d Jayaraman said. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s why the emoluments clause was written.\u201d\n\nThe other new plaintiff is Jill Phaneuf, who works for a hospitality company, booking events for two Washington hotels: the Carlyle Hotel near Dupont Circle and the Glover Park Hotel on Wisconsin Avenue NW.\n\nThe two hotels themselves are not joining the lawsuit, the watchdog group said. Jordan Libowitz, a CREW spokesman, said that Phaneuf is a contractor who is paid on commissions that are tied to the gross receipts of the events she books. She joined the suit as an individual.\n\n\u201cI joined this lawsuit because the president is taking business away from me and others with unfair business practices that violate the Constitution,\u201d Phaneuf said in a written statement. She declined to comment when asked if she could cite an example where a Trump hotel had taken her business away.\n\nWhen The Washington Post asked the White House for comment, a spokeswoman directed the question to the Trump Organization. A Trump Organization spokeswoman said she could not comment before she had seen a copy of the new filing.\n\nThe aim of the lawsuit is the same as before. The plaintiffs ask U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams in New York to order Trump to stop violating the emoluments clause, and to release financial records to prove it.\n\nThe Constitution says that no person holding a federal office shall \u201caccept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.\u201d It was inspired by fears that early American ambassadors might be corrupted by gifts from the countries where they were serving.\n\nThe plaintiffs in this case say that, by the same logic, Trump\u2019s loyalties might be bent by foreign governments paying for the hotel rooms and office space he owns.\n\n\u201cThis is \u2018MOAC.\u2019 The mother of all conflicts,\u201d said Norm Eisen, a former ethics official in the Obama administration and a board member of CREW. \u201cThis is the one thing that we have in our power to do\u201d to stop it, he said.\n\nIn the past, Trump\u2019s attorneys have said that the term \u201cemolument\u201d should not apply to transactions where foreign governments pay market rates for hotel rooms or banquet halls."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/sanders-vows-to-radically-transform-the-democratic-party/2017/04/17/9935fc44-23cf-11e7-928e-3624539060e8_video.html", "text": "Trump says the U.S. 'has enough roles' in the world"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/dnc-chair-tells-democrats-to-cause-good-trouble/2017/04/17/22594c6e-23cc-11e7-928e-3624539060e8_video.html", "text": "Trump says the U.S. 'has enough roles' in the world"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/hearing-first-arguments-as-member-of-the-supreme-court-gorsuch-jumps-right-in/2017/04/17/96856404-2392-11e7-a1b3-faff0034e2de_story.html", "text": "Neil M. Gorsuch, shown at a Senate confirmation hearing, was an active participant in his first session as a Supreme Court justice. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nNew Justice Neil M. Gorsuch was an active, aggressive and somewhat long-winded questioner in his debut Monday at the Supreme Court, making his presence known during a series of complicated cases about legal procedures.\n\nGorsuch waited barely 10 minutes into the first of three hour-long cases before kicking off what became a long chain of questions. There is no expectation at the high court that new justices are to be seen and not heard, but the 49-year-old rookie seemed to push the envelope a bit.\n\n[Neil Gorsuch sworn in as nation\u2019s 113th Supreme Court justice]\n\nGorsuch asked more questions at his first oral argument \u2014 22 \u2014 than did any of his fellow justices at their first appearances, according to Adam Feldman, a scholar who studies all things empirical about the Supreme Court. Before Monday, Justice Sonia Sotomayor had been the leader with 15 questions.\n\nAnd, according to Feldman\u2019s count, Gorsuch was wordier than all of his colleagues during their first time out, save for Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Elena Kagan, who had joined the court after representing the government there as its chief lawyer.\n\n(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nIn short order, Gorsuch showed he could be polite and still deliver a jab reminiscent of the justice he replaced, the late Antonin Scalia.\n\nAt one point, Christopher Landau, a Washington lawyer representing a former federal worker trying to navigate a complicated law governing grievance procedures, said, \u201cWe\u2019re not asking this court to break any new ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, just to continue to make it up,\u201d Gorsuch shot back with a grin, indicating he believed previous court decisions had strayed from the text of the law.\n\nAs Gorsuch first emerged from behind the court\u2019s maroon velvet curtains with his colleagues, he seemed to pause for a moment to take in the scene. His silver hair looking recently trimmed, and he wore a dark red tie under his black robe.\n\nHe shared a laugh with his seatmate, Sotomayor, and sat ramrod straight in his high-backed chair all the way to Roberts\u2019s left. He rarely stopped smiling.\n\nAt the start of the day\u2019s proceedings, the chief justice welcomed Gorsuch, nominated by President Trump to fill the seat left vacant by Scalia\u2019s death in February 2016. Senate Republicans had refused to hold hearings for President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee for the seat, Judge Merrick Garland.\n\nGorsuch returns the court to its previous composition of five generally conservative Republican-nominated justices and four consistent liberals nominated by Democrats.\n\n[President Trump made his choice, but it\u2019s still Kennedy\u2019s court]\n\n\u201cJustice Gorsuch, we wish you a long and happy career in our common calling,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nGorsuch responded: \u201cThank you very much, chief justice, and thank you to each of my new colleagues for the very warm welcome I\u2019ve received this last week. I appreciate it greatly.\u201d\n\nGorsuch skipped last week\u2019s private conference, where justices consider which cases to accept and reject, so he could bone up on the cases the court is hearing this week and next, its last oral arguments of the current term, which ends in June.\n\nThe second case of the day, Town of Chester, N.Y., v. Laroe Estates, was another complicated matter involving when a development company can intervene in a lawsuit brought by a landowner against a local government.\n\nLike a front-row law student, Gorsuch flaunted the details.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s his complaint, page 122 of the Joint Appendix,\u201d he told Washington lawyer Shay Dvoret\u00adzky, who represented Laroe. \u201cYour client, page 162, wants damages for itself.\u201d\n\nGorsuch was confident and seemed not the least bit self-conscious as he questioned attorneys. He stressed, as he had at his confirmation hearings, that the text of the law would matter more to him than whether it resulted in outcomes that might not be what Congress had intended.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be a lot easier if we just followed the plain text of the statute?\u201d he asked Brian H. Fletcher, the Justice Department lawyer representing the government in the civil service case Perry v. Merit Systems Protection Board. \u201cWhat am I missing?\u201d\n\nHis new colleagues partly provided the answer.\n\nJustice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said the case was \u201cunbelievably complicated\u201d and drew laughter from the courtroom spectators when he speculated that the person who wrote the law must be \u201csomebody who takes pleasure out of pulling the wings off flies.\u201d\n\nAlito added; \u201cThe one thing about this case that seems perfectly clear to me is that nobody who is not a lawyer, and no ordinary lawyer, could read these statutes and figure out what they are supposed to do.\u201d\n\nOne lawyer Gorsuch listened to but did not question was the attorney representing the town of Chester, Neal K. Katyal, a former acting solicitor general in the Obama administration. Katyal, who has an active practice before the Supreme Court, testified on Gorsuch\u2019s behalf at the judge\u2019s Senate confirmation hearing and was frequently invoked by Gorsuch\u2019s supporters because of a New York Times op-ed he wrote titled \u201cWhy Liberals Should Back Neil Gorsuch.\u201d\n\n[Lawyer introducing Gorsuch at hearing is suing Trump over travel ban]\n\nSome were watching to see if Gorsuch might recuse himself; he had routinely done so as a member of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit when his former law firm had a case there or a controversy involved someone he knew.\n\nBut in the appeals courts, another judge can take the place of a recused colleague. There can be no replacement at the Supreme Court. And justices routinely hear cases involving lawyers with whom they once worked or are friends. Katyal, for instance, was deputy solicitor general when Kagan ran the office under Obama.\n\nGorsuch at times seemed sensitive about asking so many questions on his first outing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for taking up so much time, I apologize,\u201d he said. \u201cMy last question.\u201d\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/georgia-house-race-stokes-gop-identity-crisis--and-opportunity-for-democrats/2017/04/17/c65ba43a-23b6-11e7-a1b3-faff0034e2de_story.html", "text": "Democrat Jon Ossoff speaks to volunteers and supporters at a campaign office in suburban Atlanta. He leads some polls in the special election to replace former congressman Tom Price, who is now secretary of health and human services. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nRepublicans had hoped Tuesday\u2019s special election in Georgia\u2019s wealthy and sleepy 6th Congressional District would be just like every other House race here since 1978: the mostly painless elevation of a rock-ribbed and polished conservative.\n\nThose hopes have died. Now, this suburban swath north of Atlanta resembles the cracked mirror of the GOP\u2019s national identity crisis, with 11 candidates bitterly feuding over what it means to be a Republican in the age of President Trump.\n\nThat crowded field is roiled by nerves about Trump and lingering internecine dramas over ideological purity. And with next year\u2019s midterm elections beginning to take shape, the race\u2019s currents could reverberate far beyond the white college-educated professionals along Interstate 285, regardless of which candidate emerges from the scrum Tuesday.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a miniature civil war going on there,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), an ally of House GOP leaders. \u201cWe\u2019re all paying attention, since anything can happen in a special.\u201d\n\nThe splintered GOP has raised the possibility that the leading Democratic candidate, 30-year-old former congressional staffer Jon Ossoff, could win Tuesday\u2019s election outright with more than 50 percent of the vote, thus claiming an open House seat previously held by Trump\u2019s health and human services secretary, Tom Price.\n\nTrump \u2014 who barely won this district last year and tweeted Monday that the media coverage of the race was a \u201cgame\u201d and \u201cBAD!\u201d \u2014 is eager to stave off a Republican stumble that could become an ominous bellwether of his standing as he attempts to build support in the coming weeks for the big-ticket legislative items that have eluded him in the GOP-controlled Congress during the early months of his presidency.\n\n[Two Republican lawmakers face anger, from their own voters, on health care]\n\nIf Ossoff places first or second with support in the mid-40 percent range among the 18 total candidates \u2014 surveys show that scenario as most likely \u2014 he will face a tougher matchup this summer, when many of the warring Republicans would almost certainly coalesce to save the seat.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s election law initially piles candidates of all stripes onto a single ballot. If no one wins a majority, the two top finishers move on to a head-to-head contest months later.\n\n\u201cHaving 11 people on our side is like eating our young,\u201d Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), a friend of Trump, said in an interview Monday. He compared the infighting to the \u201cnightmare\u201d of his own 2014 statewide primary and added: \u201cYou risk letting the Democrat slide through without a runoff. But I don\u2019t think that will happen if we get the turnout.\u201d\n\nDemocratic congressional leaders and liberals from around the country have rallied for Ossoff as Republicans have clawed at one another, contributing millions to his insurgent bid and watching him soar to the top of several polls \u2014 and salivating at the prospect of picking up a seat that hasn\u2019t gone blue since Georgia\u2019s own Jimmy Carter occupied the Oval Office.\n\nTrump has become a complicated figure in establishment Republican enclaves such as Chamblee, which boasts a tony shopping center with a gourmet doughnut shop and a sleek Mexican restaurant whose patio is packed in the evenings with 30-something couples. Passing through the leafy neighborhood on a warm Monday afternoon, one sees a slew of navy-blue Ossoff signs dotting sidewalks and apartment windows.\n\nRepublicans\u2019 failure to pass their plan to overhaul the nation\u2019s health-care system has sown doubts among some suburban GOP voters about Trump\u2019s effectiveness in cutting deals with lawmakers in Washington, as well as the party\u2019s promises. The health-care episode has particular resonance in this district since Price, a physician, was its representative from 2005 until February, when he joined the Cabinet.\n\nCole said the National Republican Congressional Committee, which he formerly chaired, has dispatched staffers to Georgia to stoke turnout among core GOP voters amid those grumbles. The Congressional Leadership Fund, an outfit aligned with the House GOP, has spent more than $2 million on a spate of negative television spots about Ossoff.\n\n[This cowboy-poet is trying to steal a Republican House seat in Montana]\n\nAt the White House, an official said, the president is paying close attention and has been briefed by aides about the race. Political director Bill Stepien is working with the state party and the congressional committees. Chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon is involved in discussions about how to encourage Republican turnout.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s pugilism and lack of a cohesive conservative worldview on fiscal and foreign policy have confounded Republicans here. Previous holders of the seat have included a mainstream, business-friendly Republican, Sen. Johnny Isakson, and a stridently ideological conservative, former House speaker Newt Gingrich.\n\nThe district is \u201ca little bit of an oddity,\u201d said Ralph Reed, a conservative leader and longtime strategist in both Georgia and national Republican circles. \u201cJust in its socioeconomic profile, it doesn\u2019t really lay out as Trump country. It\u2019s highly educated, upscale, suburban, and Trump country tends to be more rural to exurban, more high school or only some college.\u201d\n\nThe way the Republican contenders are handling Trump and the concurrent rise of populism and moderate angst in the wake of his victory is revealing, even though the names of the near-dozen candidates are unfamiliar. Everyone seems to be laboring, with varying success, to figure out a pitch that pulls together the fractured GOP ranks.\n\nInteractions with Trump\u2019s political brand have veered from hearty embrace (Dan Moody, Bob Gray, Bruce LeVell, Amy Kremer) to support but not always rah-rah (Karen Handel, Judson Hill) to flat-out defiance (David Abroms). Most of the leading candidates have bounced between those poles depending on the day or the latest controversy.\n\nHandel, a favorite of antiabortion activists who has the highest name recognition and once served as Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, said in an interview Monday that she is concentrating on doing her \u201clevel best to represent the interests of the 6th District\u201d in her positions rather than linking arms with Trump.\n\n\u201cObviously I\u2019m a Republican and support the president,\u201d Handel said. \u201cBut being in Congress is not the same as being an extension of the White House. I\u2019m more than willing to step up and speak out when the circumstances demand that. . . . People want a doer \u2014 someone they trust who can move our party from vocal opposition to governing.\u201d\n\nEndorsements from prominent Republican players have been scattered to the point of muddying the field. Perdue has backed Moody. Gingrich supports Hill, as does Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.). Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski endorsed LeVell. Former senator Saxby Chambliss is for Handel. But the conservative Club for Growth has opposed Handel and boosted Gray. To counter the club, the Ending Spending advocacy group, which is backed by the billionaire Ricketts family, has poured millions behind Handel\u2019s candidacy.\n\nIt goes on and on like that further down the line in the state. One group or officeholder goes for Handel, another goes for Gray, another jumps in for Moody or Hill, and Trump supporters of different degrees poke and prod one another on social media.\n\nUnsurprisingly, no one has caught fire, and constant squabbling has remained the thrust of the GOP race. As Ossoff\u2019s candidacy has exploded on the left \u2014 landing on the cover of New York magazine, raising more than $8 million, and attracting the support of actors such as Samuel L. Jackson and bloggers at \u00adMoveOn.org and Daily Kos \u2014 the Republicans have hovered below 20 percent in most polls.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a shot at an upset,\u201d Rep. Charlie Crist (D-Fla.) said. \u201cIt\u2019s like what we\u2019re seeing all around, this backlash. The protests, the marches. Democrats want to make a statement.\u201d\n\nAs they did in a special House election last week in Kansas, where Republicans narrowly won a seat that has long been safely GOP, Democrats see, if not a chance at victory, at least a chance to rattle Trump and Republicans as they look toward 2018 and the possibility of winning back the chamber. The surge in early voting here has only raised expectations that Ossoff could hit 50 percent Tuesday or do well in a runoff, which would be held June 20 if needed.\n\nTrump signaled in a tweet Monday how Republicans would define Ossoff in a runoff election: \u201cThe super Liberal Democrat in the Georgia Congressioal [sic] race tomorrow wants to protect criminals, allow illegal immigration and raise taxes!\u201d\n\nOssoff replied in a statement: \u201cWhile I\u2019m glad the president is interested in the race, he is misinformed.\u201d\n\nAn Emerson College survey released late last week showed Ossoff with 43 percent. Handel garnered 17 percent, Gray \u2014 a former local councilman and businessman \u2014 15 percent and Moody \u2014 a former state senator \u2014 9 percent. Hill, another former state senator, was at 6 percent.\n\nLeVell, an African American jeweler and former Trump campaign adviser, as well as Trump-aligned conservative activist Kremer, have struggled, perhaps showing the difficulty of being a die-hard Trump supporter in a Republican district that\u2019s not dominated by grass-roots nationalism. Abroms, who has campaigned with anti-Trump independent Evan McMullin, has also found it hard to get on the political map.\n\nPerdue, who has worked closely with the Trump White House, said he is confident that despite the bloodletting among Republicans, a runoff election would end favorably since this \u201cdistrict is a traditionally 60-40 Republican district, and we really don\u2019t want to give a vote to Nancy Pelosi,\u201d the House Democratic leader.\n\nBut Perdue acknowledged that his party is still figuring things out. \u201cIt\u2019s a democracy,\u201d he said wryly of the clashing Republicans.

Americans, it seems, have responded to the increased threat of nuclear war by heading to Google to see what exactly such a conflict would mean.\n\nOr, put more tersely, Americans are suddenly Googling \u201cWorld War 3\u201d far more than they used to. Using data from Google Trends, we can see how interest in the term has spiked.\n\nBut that search includes only searches for \u201cWorld War 3\u201d \u2014 not searches for \u201cWorld War III\u201d or \u201cWorld War Three.\u201d Searches for that latter term look different, peaking in July 2006.\n\n(Why did searches for the term peak that summer? Because Newt Gingrich declared that the fight against terrorism constituted the Third World War.)\n\nWhat\u2019s more, this includes results for the entire phrase. If you search for World War Three, without quotes, the results are cyclical, peaking every spring at about this time.\n\nThe reason for that is simple: It\u2019s when kids in school take up the subject of the world wars in history class.\n\nIf we consider searches for the Second World War, we see the same pattern. Over the course of the school year, those searches increase, generally peaking in the spring.\n\nWe notice something else, too. While \u201cWorld War II\u201d and \u201cWorld War 2\u201d used to be searched with about the same regularity, since 2009 or so, people look up \u201cWorld War 2\u201d much more than they do \u201cWorld War II.\u201d\n\nThat carries over into those searches about the new world war. Over the past month, when interest in the term spiked, the number of searches for \u201cWorld War 3\u201d far outpaced searches for \u201cWorld War Three\u201d or \u201cWorld War III.\u201d\n\nHowever, those searches demand additional context. Compared with searches for one of the most popular search terms on Google \u2014 \u201cDonald Trump\u201d \u2014 searches about \u201cWorld War 3\u201d are relatively small.\n\nIncidentally, not all of the searches about \u201cWorld War 3\u201d are a function of Trump. You may notice a spike in late 2015, as well. That\u2019s when the hip-hop artist Gucci Mane released the album \u201cWorld War 3,\u201d which continues to work its way into searches for the term.\n\nPeople are certainly more worried about the threat of nuclear war than they were when that album came out. But it\u2019s certainly worth remembering that what people search for doesn\u2019t always tell us everything about what they\u2019re thinking."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trump-signs-hat-throws-it-back-into-crowd-at-easter-egg-roll/2017/04/17/70fa266e-2394-11e7-928e-3624539060e8_video.html", "text": "- President Trump signed a fan's hat, then threw it back into the crowd, joking with onlookers at the 2017 White House Easter Egg Roll on April 17 at the White House.

Ryan (R-Wis.). (Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nTheoretically, the Republican Party has free rein to do what it wants in Washington. With a strong majority in the House, a majority in the Senate (plus a willingness to reconsider the filibuster) and control of the White House, this should be a moment in which the GOP can reshape the country.\n\nWhen the party tried to follow through on a long-standing commitment to that end, though, it failed. The GOP\u2019s effort to replace the Affordable Care Act was undercut by a split in the party, with hard-right conservatives opposing the replacement bill for one reason and moderate Republicans opposing it for another. That rift helped doom the measure, which has been tabled for nearly a month.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) spoke about the decision to withdraw the GOP health-care plan on March 24. \"We're going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future,\" he said. (The Washington Post)\n\nDuring the 2016 election, there was a lot of opining on the extent to which either party would be able to heal its internal rifts in the aftermath of the fiercely contested primaries. The gap between Democrats who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders and those who backed Hillary Clinton seemed, especially after Clinton\u2019s election loss, as if it might be a more significant long-term problem than a Republican Party that stood behind Donald Trump to push him over the finish line in November.\n\nNow, though, Americans see the split in the GOP as much more significant than that on the left.\n\nNew polling from the Pew Research Center shows that Americans are about as likely to say that the Democratic Party is mostly united in its vision for the future and on the issues as they are to say that the party is mostly divided. Two-thirds, though, say the Republican Party is mostly divided.\n\nRepublicans generally see both parties as about equally divided. Democrats, though, see their own party as generally united, with 58 percent saying so. Fully 80 percent of Democrats say the Republican Party is mostly divided.\n\nInterestingly, there\u2019s no significant difference between Democrats who identify as liberal and those who identify as moderate in how unified they think their party is. But among Republicans, moderates are far more likely to say their party is divided, while conservatives are about split on the question.\n\nPart of this probably stems from the Democrats\u2019 position as the party out of power. Nothing unifies a political group like having to fight to reclaim lost ground. But part of it certainly follows from the very real split in the Republican Party that has been apparent since the tea party revolution early in President Barack Obama\u2019s first term. The conservative bloc in the House has been giving the party\u2019s leadership aneurysms since well before the vote to replace Obamacare, and, now that the party is in power in both the executive and legislative branches, that rift will become that much more important.\n\nA final note to Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez: You probably shouldn\u2019t rest on your laurels. Nearly 4 in 10 Democrats think their party is divided, almost certainly driven heavily by the same split that was obvious in the Sanders-Clinton fight. The party viewing itself as unified is one thing. The party actually regaining power is another."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/president-trump-and-first-lady-kick-off-the-easter-egg-roll/2017/04/17/315df8a0-238f-11e7-928e-3624539060e8_video.html", "text": "- President Trump and first lady Melania Trump spoke at the annual White House Easter Egg Roll on April 17. \"We will be stronger and bigger and better as a nation than ever before,\" Trump said to the families gathered on the White House lawn. \"We are right on track.\" ()"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/04/17/trump-has-spent-one-out-of-every-five-minutes-of-his-presidency-in-palm-beach/", "text": "\n\nPresident Trump and first lady Melania Trump welcome Chinese President Xi Jinping and first lady Peng Liyuan at Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., on April 6. (Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nBefore hosting the annual Easter Egg Roll on the South Lawn of the White House on Monday, President Trump had another traditional Easter event to attend: the annual Easter egg hunt at Mar-a-Lago, his resort in Palm Beach, Fla. On Sunday, the president and first lady Melania Trump attended the private event at the club while the reporter assigned to cover the president for the White House press corps waited in the parking lot. (The only indication of who attended was offered by the cars that arrived for the event: \u201ca cavalcade of luxury vehicles, including Rolls Royce, Bentley, Ferrari, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, BMW, Porsche, Land Rover, Jaguar, Tesla, and Cadillac,\u201d according to the pool reporter.)\n\nStephanie Grisham of the first lady\u2019s office tweeted a photo of the Mar-a-Lago grounds \u2014 one of the few looks the public might get at the event (though the Palm Beach Post has a few others).\n\nWhy was Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday? Quite simply, because he\u2019s usually there on the weekend. On seven of the 13 weekends he has been president, he has spent time at the resort, usually slipping away from Mar-a-Lago to head to one of his nearby golf courses to play a round. That includes each of the past two weekends, when he arrived on Thursday and stayed through most of Sunday.\n\nNote that this doesn\u2019t include the time spent on Air Force One getting to Palm Beach: This is solely time once the plane lands in Palm Beach or departs from there. (We did, however, include Trump\u2019s visit to his golf club in Jupiter, Fla. on Feb. 11.)\n\nTrump\u2019s taken to calling Mar-a-Lago the \u201cwinter White House\u201d or \u201csouthern White House,\u201d clearly in part to give the impression that his time at the facility is spent on presidential business. Often, his time there is spent on leisure, of course \u2014 but also occasionally on bolstering the commercial value of the property, however indirectly. There\u2019s no discernible presidential value in attending the annual Easter egg hunt, of course, much less any of the various events he has been photographed popping into over the past few months. There is a clear value to Mar-a-Lago, though.\n\nThe Washington Post's Jenna Johnson and Aaron Blake explain why President Trump spends so much time at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, and how he uses it as a second White House. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nIf we tally the time spent in Palm Beach (at Mar-a-Lago and his golf clubs nearby) rounded to the half-hour since he was inaugurated and through noon on Monday, Trump has spent about one out of every five minutes of his presidency at the \u201cwinter White House\u201d \u2014 424.5 hours there and 1,663.5 hours everywhere else, including on Air Force One headed to Mar-a-Lago. (That trip takes about an hour-and-a-half, so that\u2019s an additional 21 hours spent flying there and back.)\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s a very real sense in which Trump is splitting his time between two jobs: serving as president of the United States and acting as owner/host of Mar-a-Lago. In some cases, those roles overlap, such as when he introduced Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to a couple having their wedding at the resort. Of course, the attention that follows the president also now encompasses Trump\u2019s property. Not just from the media: After all, a staffer for the first lady tweeted a photo of a private Mar-a-Lago event.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear whether Trump plans to travel to Palm Beach again this week. But if the existing pattern holds, he\u2019ll go on any two of the next four days."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/rep-markwayne-mullin-faces-angry-constituents-at-town-hall/2017/04/17/f617f0a6-2380-11e7-928e-3624539060e8_video.html", "text": "- Congressman Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) faced a backlash from constituents at a town hall April 10 when he said they don't pay his salary.

(John Bazemore/AP)\n\nIt was always fairly obvious that much of President Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric was composed on the fly, often in real-time focus-grouping before enthusiastic audiences. The progressive website ThinkProgress tallied 663 distinct campaign pledges ranging from the familiar \u2014 build the wall \u2014 to the esoteric: \u201cI will do a better job with the military, I will do a better job with jobs.\u201d\n\nOverlaid with Trump\u2019s famous apathy toward doing his homework, those ad hoc commitments are starting to crumble in the face of political realities. He\u2019s recently abandoned a number of his consistent campaign pledges, such as his insistence that China should be labeled a currency manipulator. The lucky thing for Trump is that his supporters were never rallying to his cause as a function of their strong views on currency manipulation, suggesting that such wavering may not cost Trump politically. New polling from Gallup, though, paints a more complex picture.\n\nThe polling firm has asked respondents regularly about their views of Trump\u2019s personal characteristics. On no measure has Trump seen a steeper decline than on the question of whether he\u2019s someone who keeps his campaign promises.\n\nAs Gallup notes, that\u2019s probably in part a function of when the polling was conducted. The February poll that set the benchmark came after Trump\u2019s initial executive orders pledging \u2014 however effectively \u2014 to enact his big-ticket priorities like the ban on immigration and expulsion of those here illegally.\n\nBut that decline is weighted heavily to those who already generally disliked Trump. If we compare the decline among groups to exit polling from the 2016 election, there\u2019s a clear link: Those more likely to have voted for Hillary Clinton also saw bigger dips in how much they thought Trump upheld his promises.\n\n(Since Gallup approval polling and exit polls conducted by Edison Media Research use different age groupings than this Gallup poll, we\u2019re comparing 18-to-34-year-olds in the personality trait polling with 18-to-29-year-olds in exit polling. Likewise, we\u2019re comparing the 55-plus age bracket with those 65-plus in exit polls.)\n\nBear in mind that, by itself, \u201cTrump keeps his promises\u201d is fairly politically neutral: If you hate his promised policy moves, you can still think he will actually uphold them. The decline in the number of liberals who think Trump will keep his promises would probably be relieved to say so.\n\nWhat I\u2019d like you to pay attention to, though, is closer to the middle of that graph: the independents.\n\nNo group that backed Trump in the 2016 election saw a bigger dip in confidence that Trump would enact his promises than independents. As we\u2019ve noted many times before, the group that identifies as \u201cindependents\u201d is often made up of people who still generally align with one party or the other, which is one reason they fall in the middle on many polling issues. This is also why men and women are closer to the middle than other groups, since partisan identity is split among the genders more evenly than it is among, say, age groups. But independents have lost confidence in Trump far more than men have.\n\nIf we compare the decline in Trump\u2019s overall approval rating with declines in the percent of people who think Trump doesn\u2019t keep his promises, those independents stand out again. While the drop in approval rating among liberals (from very low to slightly lower) and conservatives (from very high to slightly lower) is about the same, the drop among independents since January has been steep.\n\nThis matters because Trump\u2019s 2016 coalition was mostly made up of fervent supporters, skeptical Republicans and independents who preferred him over Clinton. (While Trump was generally not trusted, he won easily among the large percentage of Americans who trusted neither him or Clinton.) Trump\u2019s mandate is far smaller than most new presidents and any hope he might have to use his popularity as a cudgel was already weakened by his low approval ratings. If his base of support is reduced to hard-partisan Republicans, his ability to keep his party in line is probably reduced.\n\nNotice that to some extent the drop in the percentage saying Trump keeps his promises is a reversion to the mean: On nearly every other metric he was already in the 40s. Now he\u2019s there on promise-keeping, too.\n\nAmericans believed that, all else aside, he was at least leading in the way that he said he would on the campaign trail. They no longer grant him that."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/pence-the-era-of-strategic-patience-is-over/2017/04/17/e4deb3ee-236a-11e7-928e-3624539060e8_video.html", "text": "- Vice President Pence warned North Korea not to test President Trump during a press conference in South Korea on April 17, citing \"the strength and resolve of our new president in actions taken in Syria and Afghanistan,\u201d as examples.

The friction is evident at town hall meetings across the country during the current congressional recess.\n\nOne lifelong Republican attending Coffman\u2019s town hall in Colorado exclaimed that he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the congressman\u2019s support for the health-care bill, which both Trump and Ryan backed. At Yoho\u2019s event, an attendee pressed the congressman on his role in the Freedom Caucus.\n\n(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nThe open warfare threatens the president and the GOP agenda, but is also dampening enthusiasm with Republican voters who can no longer blame Democrats or divided government for the dysfunction.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just tough working with our conference,\u201d Coffman said in an interview, referring to the fact that House Republicans find it almost impossible to agree.\n\nThe frustration is visible in both purple areas such as Coffman\u2019s district, which will factor heavily into the battle for Congress in 2018; and ruby-red regions, such as Yoho\u2019s seat, which voted strongly for Trump and could be crucial in 2020. It is present in districts represented by members who supported the bill like Coffman, as well as those who opposed it like Yoho.\n\nBob White, a Republican who attended Yoho\u2019s town hall here Tuesday, raised a worrisome question for GOP lawmakers on the ballot next year.\n\n\u201cIf there was another election I\u2019d still vote for Ted Yoho,\u201d he said in an interview the next day. But a few moments later, White abruptly raised a different possibility:\n\n\u201cOr maybe I would just skip over his name.\u201d\n\n\u2018We yield a pretty big stick\u2019\n\nWhite asked Yoho about his place in the small but powerful group of hard-line conservatives to which he belongs \u2014 the House Freedom Caucus. The group has been a thorn in the side of House leaders since many of its members were elected in the 2010 tea-party wave, promising to slash their way to smaller government.\n\nMaggie MacDonald, 72, reacts to an answer from Rep. Ted Yoho about Planned Parenthood during a town hall meeting in Gainesville, Fla. (Phelan Ebenhack/Reuters)\n\n\u201cHow big of a stick do you carry with the Freedom Caucus? Is there any influence there?\u201d asked White, 74, who voted for Yoho and Trump.\n\n\u201cYeah, I think we yield a pretty big stick,\u201d Yoho boasted, giving his own spin \u2014 intentionally or not \u2014 to the often-used phrase about quiet power than includes \u201ccarry\u201d a big stick.\n\nMany in the group refused to support the American Health Care Act (AHCA) \u2014 crafted by Ryan (R-Wis.) and his leadership lieutenants \u2014 because it didn\u2019t go far enough to repeal the law known as Obamacare and wouldn\u2019t, they argued, bring down insurance costs sufficiently.\n\nYoho, 62, a veterinarian who once mounted an unsuccessful run against John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) for speaker, argued that the Freedom Caucus received disproportionate blame for the bill\u2019s failure and pointed to resistance from GOP \u201cmoderates.\u201d\n\nWhite, a retired truck driver and volunteer teacher, said in an interview that he wants Obamacare repealed \u201cbeyond a shadow of a doubt.\u201d But he seemed less sure the Freedom Caucus could make that happen.\n\n\u201cThe question for me is what clout he had within the Freedom Caucus and did he see any light at the end of the tunnel?\u201d he said, adding, \u201cBecause I don\u2019t remember the Freedom Caucus being on the ballot.\u201d\n\nIn this part of Florida, there was strong support for Trump, who defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in the district to the south and west of Jacksonville by 16 percentage points, post-\n\nelection analyses show.\n\nAfter his town hall, Yoho told reporters that it was ultimately Ryan\u2019s fault that Republicans weren\u2019t able to repeal the ACA before leaving for the recess. \u201cIt\u2019s a function of leadership,\u201d he said, before specifically naming the speaker.\n\nIn the audience at the town hall, some Republican voters seemed to blame the speaker too.\n\n\u201cUhhhhh,\u201d responded Mark Fisher, 67, who said he voted for Yoho and Trump, when asked whether he thought Ryan was doing a good job. He deferred to his wife, Joanne, 62.\n\n\u201cI know he\u2019s a good person and everything. . . . I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said.\n\nYoho was far less critical of Trump than of Ryan, saying he thinks the president was \u201cmisled\u201d on health care by House GOP leaders. But Trump spent weeks pushing the measure, holding photo-ops and meeting with its GOP architects. After the health-care bill collapsed, Trump lashed out against the Freedom Caucus for its failure.\n\nRyan\u2019s team does not believe that there is a widespread movement against him among GOP members. Some other members of the Freedom Caucus have not blamed Ryan the way Yoho did.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s not who we are here\u2019\n\nCoffman, 62, is one of just 23 House Republicans who represent districts won by Clinton in 2016. His suburban Denver seat is a diverse mix of Democrats, Republicans and independents. That demographic split drove Coffman last summer to run an ad promising to stand up to Trump when they disagree.\n\nMany members of the moderate Tuesday Group to which Coffman belongs opposed the House GOP plan. But Coffman said he supported it because every major policy move has to start somewhere. He was quick to blame the Freedom Caucus for the bill\u2019s failure.\n\n\u201cI think the Freedom Caucus was completely unrealistic in terms of their expectations,\u201d Coffman said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be a legislator, you\u2019ve got to legislate and compromise is not a pejorative.\u201d\n\nMost of the roughly 200 people who showed up at the University of Colorado Anschutz Campus in Aurora on Wednesday were Democrats who angrily demanded that Coffman make good on his pledge to confront Trump.\n\nBut they weren\u2019t alone. Steven Haas, 68, stood up to say he was a lifelong Republican upset that Coffman and his fellow Republicans failed to listen when voters made clear that their plan was unsound.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say I was shocked that you declared your intention to vote for so-called Trumpcare,\u201d Haas said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way we do things in Colorado. The ACA is the law of the land now.\u201d\n\nHaas later said he usually votes for Republicans but doesn\u2019t plan to back Coffman next year, because he doesn\u2019t trust him to live up to his moderate reputation in the face of Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u201cWhen he gets to Washington, he votes 96 percent of the time with the far-right wing,\u201d Haas said. \u201cThat\u2019s not who we are here. Republicans like me don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nIn Florida, Yoho faced a different kind of anger \u2014 some people in his district were upset that he didn\u2019t back Trump in the health-care fight. Yoho explained that the majority of the calls his office received opposed the measure.\n\nAs they have at many GOP town halls this year, Democrats made their presence felt in Florida. Although they disagree with Yoho on most everything, some are pleased that he didn\u2019t back the GOP proposal \u2014 albeit not for the same reasons.\n\n\u201cDifferent ends \u2014 same result,\u201d said Joy Pitts, a local activist with Indivisible, a national organization formed to oppose Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u2018Got to start somewhere\u2019\n\nColorado opted to expand Medicaid under the ACA while Florida did not. The House bill would have rolled back Medicaid expansion, causing many Democrats and Republicans to worry about those who obtained coverage as a result of it.\n\nCoffman said he has only heard rumors of revived negotiations on the health-care bill \u2014 but he worried that Ryan and Trump might try to resurrect the legislation by making it more palatable to conservatives.\n\nCoffman is in a tough spot \u2014 forced to decide between supporting Trump\u2019s agenda, much of which appeals to the conservative element of his base, and following through on his own promise to independents, centrist Republicans and Democrats that he would stand up for their needs.\n\nAt the town hall, he was steadily attacked by Democrats and independents who wanted to know when he\u2019d stand up to Trump.\n\n\u201cWhen I disagree with him,\u201d Coffman insisted after an hour of pointed questions. \u201cWhen I disagree with him, I will.\u201d\n\nThat kind of answer wasn\u2019t good enough for people like David Leach, a software engineer and registered Democrat who said he had only supported a Republican once in his life when he voted last year for Coffman.\n\n\u201cYou position yourself as someone who would vote your conscience and work in a bipartisan manner in Congress,\u201d Leach said. \u201cI voted for you because I thought you could be a leader in that regard and I\u2019m not seeing anything.\u201d\n\nPam Cirbo, a GOP volunteer from Littleton, Colo., said she\u2019s generally happy with Trump and is growing tired of people pushing Coffman to resist.

Korea didn\u2019t test a nuclear weapon, but it did try to launch another missile]\n\nIn addition to Mattis\u2019s terse statement, the vice president \u2014 who arrived in Seoul for a 10-day trip through Asia shortly after the failed launch \u2014 briefly addressed North Korea\u2019s latest action at a dinner for U.S. troops and their family members. A White House foreign policy adviser on the trip briefed reporters traveling with Pence as well.\n\n\u201cThis morning\u2019s provocation from the north is just the latest reminder of the risks each one of you face each and every day in the defense of the freedom of the people of South Korea and the defense of America in this part of the world,\u201d Pence said. \u201cYour willingness to step forward, to serve, to stand firm without fear, inspires.\u201d\n\nMattis\u2019s statement, as well as Trump\u2019s lack of comment Saturday night, stood in stark contrast with the president\u2019s behavior just two months ago, when North Korea claimed in mid-February that it had successfully tested a new type of missile with nuclear capabilities.\n\nIn response then, Trump \u2014 who was again at Mar-a-Lago for a visit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe \u2014 scrambled his traveling press corps to deliver an in-person statement that evening after he and his aides seemed to pore over the latest developments in full view of his club members.\n\nBut as tensions mounted earlier in the week between the United States and North Korea \u2014 which is forging ahead with its nuclear weapons program and is eager to build a missile that can reach the United States \u2014 the president departed the White House on Thursday for what he seemed to hope would be a quiet Easter weekend holiday.\n\nHe brought with him only three junior staffers and K.T. McFarland, a deputy national security adviser who Trump aides said may soon be nominated as ambassador to Singapore in a move many view as a demotion.\n\n1 of 94 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 See what President Trump has been doing since taking office View Photos The beginning of his term has featured controversial executive orders and frequent conflicts with the media.

McMaster, to outline the administration\u2019s approach on the Sunday talk shows.\n\nMcMaster and McFarland offered a notable contrast to Trump\u2019s previously bellicose statements. Both seemed to be calling for patience and tamped down the possibility of imminent military intervention.\n\nMcMaster, appearing on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d said that the United States is exploring \u201ca range of options\u201d to respond to an increasingly provocative North Korea but that the administration would like \u201cto take action short of armed conflict, so we can avoid the worst.\u201d\n\nMcFarland, meanwhile, played down the significance of yet another failed North Korean missile launch, saying that the test early Sunday was \u201cnot a surprise.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven in the last year, President Kim of North Korea has launched over 30 missiles,\u201d McFarland said during an appearance on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cMost of them have failed. So it didn\u2019t come as a surprise to us. We were expecting something surrounding the birthday of his grandfather.\u201d\n\nSaturday was the anniversary of the 1912 birth of Kim Il Sung, North Korea\u2019s founder and the current leader\u2019s grandfather.\n\nMcMaster and McFarland also talked up the role China could play in bringing North Korea to heel \u2014 and urged some patience on that front. About 80 percent of North Korea\u2019s trade is with neighboring China, giving the country a good deal of leverage, they suggested.\n\nMcFarland said an array of strategies were discussed when Chinese President Xi Jinping recently visited Trump at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like your kids in the back of the car on a long trip saying, \u2018When are we going to get there?\u2019\u201d McFarland said. \u201cWell, in this case, I think we should give the Chinese president some opportunities and some time, as well as pursuing the economic and diplomatic pressures that we have and that our allies have that we can bring to bear on North Korea.\u201d\n\nTrump, who save for muscling Justice Neil M. Gorsuch onto the Supreme Court has no real achievements on Capitol Hill of which to boast, has weathered several national security and military crises fewer than 100 days into his presidency, and seems to enjoy both the process and the projection of strength such crises involve.\n\nAfter Syrian President Bashar al-Assad deployed chemical weapons against his own people, Trump worked with his military advisers and responded swiftly, firing 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian airfield.\n\nAides to the president said he enjoyed the orderly process, overseen by McMaster, which resembled the streamlined operations of a more traditional White House, with Trump requesting a range of responses and each adviser weighing in with their expertise before the president made a final decision.\n\nBut Trump seemed determined to avoid conflict of just about any sort this weekend \u2014 North Korea or otherwise. He spent his three days in Palm Beach shuttling between Mar-a-Lago and Trump International Golf Club, spending almost no time outside the cocoon of his two palm-tree-lined properties.\n\nOn Saturday, after golf, the president\u2019s motorcade took a different, longer route than usual to return to his private club, coming back from the north and along the coast. The circuitous trip allowed Trump to avoid the protesters who had gathered along the main thoroughfare just west of Mar-a-Lago to call on him to release his tax returns.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer said the route was determined by the Secret Service.\n\nTrump, a normally prolific \u2014 and brash \u2014 user of Twitter, also spent the weekend largely quiet on social media; his last tweet heading into the weekend concerned his enthusiasm about the White House Easter Egg Roll on Monday.\n\nOn Sunday morning, Trump briefly took to Twitter, boasting about his electoral college victory in the 2016 presidential election and asking why his tax returns mattered in light of his win. He also extolled his efforts to rebuild the military.\n\n[Trump asks why people are still talking about his taxes a day after protesters asked for his returns]\n\nHe also seemed to admit he was using the Treasury Department\u2019s currency report \u2014 which did not label China a currency manipulator \u2014 as a political bargaining weapon.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump repeatedly said he would brand China a currency manipulator on Day One of his administration. On Day 83, he officially backed off that course.\n\n\u201cWhy would I call China a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the North Korea problem?\u201d he wrote on Twitter on Sunday. \u201cWe will see what happens!\u201d\n\nBut then the president retreated back into his calm Palm Beach world. He attended Easter services at Bethesda-by-the-Sea church here with his wife, Melania, son Barron, and daughter from his second marriage, \u00adTiffany, before returning to Mar-a-Lago for an annual brunch and Easter egg hunt with his eldest sons, Don Jr. and Eric, and their families, according to an aide.\n\nOne intrusion from the outside world came from Don Jr., who over the weekend was sporting a green T-shirt that read \u201cVery Fake News\u201d in block white letters \u2014 a reminder of all those who, the president believes, have treated him so unfairly."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/administration-officials-lawmakers-react-after-failed-north-korean-missile-launch/2017/04/16/338ce33e-22c2-11e7-928e-3624539060e8_video.html", "text": "Please enable flash to watch this video.\n\nSorry, this video is not available."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/tax-march-protesters-call-on-trump-to-release-his-tax-returns/2017/04/15/e8893c26-221b-11e7-bb59-a74ccaf1d02f_video.html", "text": "- Protesters in more than a dozen cities nationwide participated in so-called Tax March demonstrations to demand that President Trump release his personal tax returns.

(Bobby Caina Calvan/AP)\n\nRob Quist, the Democratic candidate for Montana\u2019s sole U.S. House seat, had a problem. Big Sky Rising, the local progressive group \u2014 one of many that grew out of the National Women\u2019s March \u2014 had filled a room for his speech.\n\nBut the room didn\u2019t have a sound system for Quist, a 69-year-old folk musician, to strum and sing his campaign theme song.\n\n\u201cLet me just recite a poem for you about how I feel about our public lands,\u201d Quist said. \u201cHer gown is luscious green when she attends the annual springtime ball. And she fancies orange and gold and harvest moon in the fall. Her wild and natural beauty \u2014 it will take away your breath. Oh, but take her for granted? It could easily mean your death.\u201d\n\nIt had been just 48 hours since a surprisingly close special election in Kansas kicked off Republican hand-wringing about forfeiting Montana\u2019s May 25 special election to replace Ryan Zinke (R), now President Trump\u2019s interior secretary.\n\nThe Democratic candidate in Montana is a mustachioed 6-foot-3 poet who appears everywhere \u2014 churches, fundraisers, and television interviews \u2014 in a white cowboy hat and black Ariat boots.\n\nGreg Gianforte, right, is congratulated by a supporter in Helena, Mont., after winning the Republican nomination for Montana's special election for the U.S. House. (Matt Volz/AP)\n\nThat cowboy-poet has raised $1.3 million so far and was competitive with a self-funding Republican contender, Greg Gianforte, who jumped into the race after a near miss 2016 gubernatorial run. Trump easily won Montana, but Democrats still compete strongly for statewide offices.\n\nRepublicans, flush with cash but facing unbridled Democratic enthusiasm, are taking Quist a bit more seriously. On Thursday, the National Republican Congressional Committee began a $273,000 digital and TV ad buy, accusing Quist of singing in \u201charmony\u201d with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). The GOP-allied Congressional Leadership Fund is committing at least $1 million to the race, though Executive Director Corey Bliss said last week that Quist had no chance to win.\n\n\u201cRob Quist is such a pathetic candidate that we almost feel bad running ads against him,\u201d Bliss said. \u201cAt the end of the day he\u2019ll lose by double-digits.\u201d\n\nMontana is one of five special elections this year for open House seats \u2014 four of them vacated when Trump plucked Republican lawmakers to become part of his administration. So far, Democrats are doing better than anticipated in conservative areas \u2014 including Kansas, where the Democrat came within seven points last Tuesday of winning a district that Trump nabbed by 27 points.\n\nBut while the Georgia race is seen as a test for the \u201crising electorate\u201d of minority voters and highly educated white voters, the Montana race is a test for populism. Quist, who backed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for president, portrays Gianforte as a plutocrat who will work only for his class. It\u2019s the argument Democrats failed to stick to Trump, and one they want to see working in the places where working-class white voters bolted their party.\n\nGianforte, who has been criticized for holding few public events, plans to welcome Donald Trump Jr. \u2014 an avid hunter who argued for Zinke at Interior \u2014 to the state next week. The first son will swing into Montana for rallies and fundraisers, $25 a pop.\n\nQuist, who won the Democratic nomination at a January convention, professes to be thrilled with the GOP attention. On Thursday, at two public events in Billings, he told Big Sky Rising and a separate room of union members that he could \u201csmell the fear\u201d coming from the right.\n\n\u201cOne of my top priorities in Congress will be to stop these corporate interests from dictating policy,\u201d Quist told pipe fitters at their Billings union hall. \u201cWhen I was younger, there was a graph that showed the distribution of wealth across the classes. Now, if you look at the same graph, it\u2019s flat across the bottom, and when you get to the super-rich, they have so much of the wealth that it flies off the page.\u201d\n\nSoft-spoken left-wing populism like that helped Quist become the nominee. Our Revolution, the group founded by Sanders, has endorsed Quist. In an interview last week, Sanders said he was looking for an opportunity to stump for him.\n\n\u201cIf you look up Montana in the dictionary, you see a picture of Rob Quist,\u201d said Rep. Denny Heck (D-Wash.), who chairs the Democratic Congressional Committee\u2019s recruitment program.\n\n\u201cRob Quist\u2019s as Montana as Montana can get,\u201d said the state\u2019s governor, Steve Bullock (D), who defeated Gianforte, Quist\u2019s opponent, just five months ago. \u201cHe\u2019s been in all these small communities. He\u2019s working hard. He reflects our values.\u201d\n\nThe implication is that none of those kinds of words apply to Gianforte. Crisp and confident, the Republican moved to Montana 24 years ago and grew a software company, RightNow Technologies, out of Bozeman. (He was 33, having sold his first company for $10 million.) In Quist\u2019s TV ads, he argues that \u201cthere are enough millionaires in Congress\u201d and brands Gianforte as an East Coast arriviste.\n\nAt the same time, Montanans elected a New York real estate businessman to the presidency \u2014 a leap of faith that informs how Gianforte now campaigns. In his TV ads, he promises to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d and stick it to political elites.\n\nOn Thursday, as Quist stumped in Billings, Gianforte met with local business and political leaders seven hours away in Kalispell in conservative Flathead County.\n\nGianforte, wearing a flag-pinned blazer over a checked shirt, shared the gospel of free markets. \u201cWe got here with a series of steps over a period of time, and I think that\u2019s how we dig ourselves out,\u201d he said. \u201cI am encouraged that we have President Trump in the White House because for the first time we have an opportunity to effect change. And I want to be a part of it because I don\u2019t want to see our country squander it.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Gianforte paused when asked why outside groups were investing in the race. \u201cI do believe \u2014 and we saw this recently with the health-care conversation that went on \u2014 for the administration to advance their agenda, they need the votes in the House,\u201d he said. \u201cNational groups have gotten involved because they want to help. I\u2019ll always be on Montana\u2019s side, but I\u2019m going to help Donald Trump advance his agenda.\u201d\n\nAt a Quist fundraiser last week, attendees grabbed lawn signs using the same stylized signature as his album cover as they left. They said there was energy they didn\u2019t feel when Hillary Clinton was running for president.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to kick the Republicans in the butt,\u201d said Steve Griswold, 67, a retiree from Wisconsin.\n\nBecky Weed, a 57-year-old sheep rancher, pointed out that the event was less than a mile from Gianforte\u2019s home. Democrats cut into the Republican\u2019s support by publicizing his 2009 legal battle to stop public access to the part of a stream that ran through his property.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m immersed in the ranch culture, and people I know generally vote Republican,\u201d Weed said. \u201cBut they\u2019re willing to go for something different, especially when you\u2019ve got public lands at stake.\u201d\n\nThe Republican plan is to brand Quist as a liberal in cowboy clothing, more Willie Nelson than Hank Williams Jr. Its doomsday weapon is an interview Quist gave to the Bozeman Daily Chronicle. After talking about his guns and his luck as a hunter, he mused that \u201cassault\u201d weapons, no good for hunting, might need to be registered.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re only meant to kill people,\u201d he said, \u201cso maybe there should be some legislation to register those types of things. You register your car to drive, why not register guns?\u201d\n\nIt was the gaffe of a novice candidate, and Republicans pounced. The NRCC\u2019s first ad tells voters that Quist wants a \u201cnational gun registry.\u201d The National Rifle Association is expected to swing into the race with the same message. On the stump, Gianforte never misses a swing at the gun issue. \u201cI\u2019m a strong supporter of the Second Amendment \u2014 he believes in gun registration,\u201d he said in Kalispell. The next day, he warned a Republican crowd in Missoula that \u201cregistration is the first step toward confiscation.\u201d\n\nQuist said in an interview that he\u2019d been ripped out of context.\n\n\u201cI was talking about fully automatic assault rifles,\u201d he said. \u201cI was taught that if it takes you more than one shot to bring big game down, you shouldn\u2019t be in the woods.\u201d\n\nQuist advised anyone campaigning for him to point out the gun attack was coming from special interests. There were guns in the Quist home, he said, that had been there longer than Gianforte had been in Montana.\n\n\u201cAll these sports groups know this is a smokescreen,\u201d Quist said. \u201cThe number one reason that people no longer hunt or fish is loss of access to public lands.\u201d\n\nQuist was more relaxed when it came to attacks on his finances. It was true, he said, that he\u2019d faced $15,000 tax liens and settled in 2016. But he has a multimillionaire to defeat.\n\n\u201cI probably should have declared bankruptcy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the Montana way.\u201d\n\nMargaret Grayson in Missoula contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gop-leaders-urge-patience--not-panic--amid-trumps-early-stumbles/2017/04/15/29bb05d8-213d-11e7-ad74-3a742a6e93a7_story.html", "text": "More Americans disapprove than approve of President Trump\u2019s job performance. His White House is in a perpetual state of turmoil. Fellow Republicans control Congress, but no signature legislation has passed. And in ruby-red Kansas last week, the Republican candidate in a special election got a scare from a turbocharged Democratic base, winning a House seat by a far slimmer margin than expected.\n\nFor a Republican Party already starting to strategize ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections, the turbulent, inchoate environment as the Trump presidency nears its 100th-day mark could be a cause for concern or even alarm.\n\nYet party leaders and strategists are preaching patience, not panic.\n\nThese Republicans \u2014 who acknowledge that their political brand will be shaped by the 45th president as long as he holds office \u2014 say their political fortunes will be told over the next year and a half in the answers to two overriding questions: Does Trump project strength? And does he achieve progress that amounts to more jobs and higher wages?\n\n\u201cWhat matters is a record of accomplishment,\u201d said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster who has been conducting focus groups of Trump supporters. \u201cPeople can disagree over the details or the significance of the change, but if you have a record of accomplishment, that fixes everything. . . . If you don\u2019t, no rhetoric will fix it.\u201d\n\n(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nThat view contrasts sharply with the conservative ideological projects inspired by some past Republican presidents, including Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, and is part of an emerging recognition for the Grand Old Party that doctrines may not drive voters as much as selling changes Trump has made.\n\n[Trump as a \u2018conventional Republican\u2019? That\u2019s what some in GOP establishment say they see.]\n\nThough Trump\u2019s first three months in office have seen a flurry of activity, including adding conservative Justice Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, he has no major legislative victory. Trump\u2019s push to change the Affordable Care Act \u2014 the health-care law Republicans have derided as Obamacare and campaigned to repeal and replace \u2014 collapsed in a humiliating defeat for Trump and the GOP leadership.\n\nThe president who campaigned on his decades of real estate dealmaking and his vow that nobody could execute more \u201cbeautiful\u201d deals in Washington is anxious to achieve, well, deals.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s realizing that the party will hang with him, but there are no guarantees and no easy paths forward,\u201d said Ed Rollins, a longtime GOP strategist. \u201cIt\u2019s got to kill them that they have the whole thing \u2014 the White House and Congress \u2014 and they can\u2019t seem to get it together.\u201d\n\nRep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) was blunt: \u201cWe can\u2019t blame this on Barack Obama. We have to look in the mirror.\u201d\n\nFor congressional Republicans, the challenges are not necessarily overcoming a policy divide with Trump, but getting clear direction from the White House about the shape and scope of the agenda for the remainder of the year.\n\n(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nOn health care, there is a lingering concern that the conservative House Freedom Caucus remains a conundrum without an answer. On taxes, too, Republicans on Capitol Hill say they are perplexed by a lack of consensus on rates and how to address various deductions. It is not even clear to them who in the Trump administration \u2014 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin or National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn \u2014 is taking the lead, or whether House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) will eventually be called upon to craft a compromise.\n\nThe ability of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) to guide Trump on policy is another unknown. With Ryan\u2019s hand burned by the health-care defeat, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who has an easy rapport with Trump, is rising as a potential new power broker.\n\n[The \u2018closer\u2019? The inside story of how Trump tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to make a deal on health care.]\n\nWhat worries Republican leaders is the potent Trump resistance movement activated on the left. Consider last week\u2019s results in Kansas. Trump carried the 4th Congressional District last fall by 27 percentage points, yet Republican Ron Estes won the special election for the open House seat by just seven percentage points over Democrat James Thompson, who was buoyed by a surge in his party\u2019s turnout.\n\nAnother special election this Tuesday presents a second test, this time in a suburban Atlanta district that is expected to be more competitive for Democrats than the one in Kansas.\n\n\u201cTheir base is whipped up and going,\u201d Cole said of the Democrats. \u201cNothing we can do is going to change that. So you better have your own base equally charged up, and to do that you have to convince them that you\u2019re getting things done \u2014 that the fact that they gave you the Senate, the House and the White House means something.\u201d\n\nIn his quest for legislative wins on such issues as tax reform and infrastructure spending, Trump is signaling a desire to broker with Democrats, although outreach has been scattered and no bipartisan alliance has emerged.\n\nIn the past week alone, Trump reversed several positions in conflict with his campaign promises. He said that he now supports NATO and the Export-Import Bank, and that he no longer believes China is manipulating its currency.\n\nTrump\u2019s new stances reflect the rising influence of a bloc of business-friendly, global-oriented advisers at the expense of Stephen K. Bannon, the chief White House strategist and champion of Trump\u2019s nationalist ideas and pugilistic tactics. The shifts have fueled the perception that the president is evolving into a more traditional Republican.\n\n\u201cThe question is: Will he continue to engage his populism and his outsider status?\u201d asked Patrick J. Caddell, a political consultant and Bannon friend. \u201cWhat is his organizing principle? It has long been overthrowing and changing the system, protecting people and taking on institutions. If he abandons those kinds of ideas, then what is he all about?\u201d\n\n[Inside Bannon\u2019s struggle: From \u2018shadow president\u2019 to Trump\u2019s marked man]\n\nStrategists who are counseling Republican leaders and candidates in the 2018 midterms said most voters may not care, for instance, whether Trump labels China a currency manipulator. What matters, they said, is whether the Republicans in charge can work together to get results.\n\n\u201cPeople were voting for change,\u201d said David Winston, a GOP pollster. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be everything all the time, but there has to be a sense of forward progress. They\u2019re looking for two basic outcomes: more jobs and higher wages. It\u2019s pretty straightforward.\u201d\n\nAustin Barbour, a Republican strategist based in Mississippi, said, \u201cTrump voters see him not for the policy stances that he takes. It has to be a really big single issue to get their attention. Most of them think, he\u2019s not Barack Obama and he\u2019s a straight shooter who will always say what\u2019s on his mind and he says he\u2019ll make the country a better place.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s first three months in office have not been without action. He has signed a slew of executive orders. His Cabinet is working to loosen regulations throughout the bureaucracy. He has pressured business leaders and sought to take credit for thousands of new manufacturing jobs, although most were already in the works.\n\nTrump also has reimagined America\u2019s posture in the world. He has won accolades from many Republicans and some Democrats for a bombing strike in Syria, dropping the \u201cmother of all bombs\u201d on Islamic State forces in Afghanistan, toughening his administration\u2019s approach to Russia and cultivating a rapport with the leaders of China and Japan amid rising tensions with North Korea.\n\nSome Trump allies say he must stay true to his promise of wholesale change to maintain his political currency.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in power because people reacted to the options that were presented and went with the party that seemed to be more like change,\u201d Caddell said. \u201cThere is no deep support for the GOP. They remain an unpopular party, and people are very dissatisfied, which is why Trump is sitting in the White House. If the Republicans don\u2019t recognize that, our politics will move on from them.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/republicans-may-be-making-a-mistake-by-swinging-only-for-the-fences/2017/04/15/b82da176-21e8-11e7-a0a7-8b2a45e3dc84_story.html", "text": "President Trump, flanked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), left,and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), speaks during a meeting with House and Senate leadership in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. Trump and his Republican-led Congress have swung for the fences early and, so far, have struck out. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nA couple of weeks after the 2008 election, Rahm Emanuel, the incoming White House chief of staff, and Phil Schiliro, the incoming White House director of legislative affairs, huddled with the Democratic congressional leadership to talk strategy.\n\nEveryone knows the big agenda they pursued \u2014 an $800 billion economic stimulus, a sweeping health-care law and an overhaul of Wall Street regulations \u2014 but the leaders also agreed on a parallel strategy that was almost as critical. That effort became a steady supply of smaller bills, more niche in focus but also bipartisan in support, ranging from enhancing consumer protections in the credit-card industry to making it easier to stop children from smoking.\n\n\u201cThe singles,\u201d Emanuel, now the mayor of Chicago, called those efforts in an interview last week while visiting Washington. These smaller measures filled the House and Senate floor throughout early 2009 as committee chairmen battled behind the scenes on the finer print of the much bigger legislation to come.\n\nEight years later, President Trump and his Republican-led Congress have swung for the fences early and, so far, have struck out. As Republicans again try to craft a repeal plan for the 2010 Affordable Care Act and continue shooting for a massive tax cut, Emanuel wonders from where the GOP will get its momentum.\n\n\u201cThe bunt singles,\u201d he said, motioning his arms like a ballplayer trying to get the smallest of hits, \u201cthey don\u2019t even have them.\u201d\n\nSome GOP lawmakers\u2019 block-everything mentality could imperil big-picture plans\n\nA quarter of the way through Trump\u2019s first year in office, Republicans\u2019 only legislative successes have come on small bills that wiped out regulations from the last weeks President Barack Obama was in office. Lawmakers are using the obscure Congressional Review Act of 1996 to do so on party-line votes.\n\nThose dozens of nixed regulations do represent a win for Trump, and Republican leaders are aware of the need to demonstrate some wins. In an interview before Congress left for its two-week spring break, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) noted that undoing regulations \u201cunfortunately doesn\u2019t make a lot of news\u201d and said his office was going to compile a report on the sweep and impact of those moves.\n\nBut Congress\u2019s authority to undo a previous administration\u2019s regulations through the CRA process expires early next month. Confirming Justice Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, only after blowing up Senate rules to do so on a simple majority, is the only other solid victory the GOP can so far claim.\n\n\u201cThe only reason that we were able to do them is they were 51-vote situations,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nMcConnell has made clear that the overhaul of the tax code is the only other big piece of legislation that would fall under special budgetary rules allowing for a simple majority in the Senate.\n\nEverything else will require a minimum of eight Senate Democrats, and all 52 Republicans, to overcome a filibuster in that chamber. That makes it much more difficult for Republicans to get things done than those early regulatory repeals and confirming members of Trump\u2019s cabinet.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what Republicans will do while leaders and committee chairmen continue haggling behind closed doors over the big battles on health and tax policy.\n\nTheir agenda is starting to look pretty barren.\n\nAfter they figure out a way to keep government agencies funded by April 28, Republicans do not have much lined up to push onto center stage on the House and Senate floors.\n\nThey\u2019ve got some bills waiting to reauthorize the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s collection of user fees on the makers of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, along with legislation to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration and the state-based Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\n\nIf they\u2019re not careful, Republicans could head into the long August recess without adding anything more to their win list than the already-repealed regulations and Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation.\n\nThat\u2019s not exactly the sort of vision that Trump cited in his January inaugural address when he vowed: \u201cThe forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.\u201d\n\nSixteen years ago, the George W. Bush administration operated with amazing early efficiency. By mid-June 2001, Bush had signed into law a $1.3 trillion tax cut and the House and Senate had approved their versions of the No Child Left Behind education legislation \u2014 each passing with significant Democratic support.\n\nIn 2009, Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), then the Senate majority leader, and Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), then the House speaker, set out to get some early \u201csingles\u201d by approving a large expansion of the CHIP and a pay-equity bill.\n\nBefore Memorial Day in 2009, Obama enacted legislation giving consumers more rights against credit-card companies, with the support of 113 House Republicans. A month later, he signed a bill to allow the FDA to more forcefully regulate tobacco marketing to prevent children from taking up smoking \u2014 with the support of 70 House Republicans.\n\n\u201cWe all agreed on the need to hit some singles and doubles,\u201d Jim Manley, a senior Reid aide, recalled of the strategy session with Emanuel and congressional leaders.\n\nThose early wins helped teach everyone how things are supposed to work, building up confidence at the White House and Congress. Eventually, Democrats passed most of their big-agenda items, and voters recoiled, leading to devastating losses in the 2010 midterm elections for Obama\u2019s party.\n\nBut Democrats had succeeded on one level \u2014 passing some progressive laws and giving their supporters something to show for the losses they suffered politically. Now, Republicans are struggling to enact their overarching agenda, and their counterparts think that it\u2019s because the GOP never learned how to do the basics as an opposition party. Instead, maybe Republicans should be seeking a few smaller pieces of legislation.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons they are in the mess they are is that they didn\u2019t do that,\u201d Manley said. \u201cThey swung for the fences immediately with batters who didn\u2019t have a lot of batting practice and weren\u2019t used to hitting at all.\u201d\n\nRead more from Paul Kane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/after-20-years-inmate-apologizes-for-school-shooting/2017/04/14/547c6c30-215b-11e7-ad74-3a742a6e93a7_story.html", "text": "FILE - In this Aug. 25, 1997 file photo, Barry Loukaitis listens to his defense attorney make a motion during Loukaitis\u2019 murder trial Monday, Aug. 25, 1997 in Seattle.

Stewart, chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors, was the most aggressive during the hour-long event at Liberty University Thursday night, taking aim at political strategist Ed Gillespie, the perceived front-runner because he has led in fundraising and endorsements.\n\nStewart accused Gillespie of supporting amnesty for illegal immigrants and of endorsing, in his 2006 memoir, the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d for health insurance \u2014 akin to a requirement under the Affordable Care Act. Gillespie said neither was true.\n\n\u201cGoogle \u2018Corey Stewart lies\u2019 and you\u2019ll be amazed at all that pops up,\u201d Gillespie said.\n\nStewart dug in.\n\n\u201cPage 245 of your book, Ed,\u201d he said, referring to the passage in Gillespie\u2019s \u201cWinning Right\u201d that he said endorsed the insurance mandate. \u201cIf you really want to find the truth, go to Establishment Ed,\u201d he added, referring to a Web site that mocks the former Republican National Committee chairman.\n\nDespite those jabs and others, the debate among Gillespie, Stewart and state Sen. Frank W. Wagner (Virginia Beach) was heavy on substance, with moderators delving into matters as wonky as Virginia\u2019s Certificate of Public Need program, which gives the state a say in whether certain medical facilities may be built. There were no obvious gaffes nor any of the Confederate flag-draped theatrics Stewart has relied on to draw attention to his bid.\n\n[Did a Republican running for Va. governor really dress up like a Confederate gent? ]\n\nThe moderators \u2014 Liberty spokesman Len Stevens and WSET-TV news anchor Mark Spain \u2014 did not touch on abortion, religious liberty or other matters of particular interest to evangelicals, a surprise given that the debate took place at the world\u2019s largest Christian university.\n\nGillespie shoehorned the lone religious reference into his closing statement, as he wished the crowd \u201ca blessed Good Friday . . . and Easter.\u201d\n\n[Gillespie at Liberty U: My setbacks were part of God\u2019s plan]\n\nLiberty President Jerry Falwell Jr. attended the event but said through a spokesman earlier in the week that he was not following the race closely.\n\nThe moderators\u2019 all-business approach seemed to help the often-overshadowed Wagner grab more of the spotlight. Playing up his quarter-century in Richmond, much of it devoted to securing funds for transportation projects, Wagner ridiculed his rivals as they weighed in on issues that he had already worked on as a legislator.\n\n[Liberty U is the setting for televised debate among GOP candidates for Va. governor]\n\n\u201cI missed both of these people when we actually debated and killed Medicaid\u201d expansion, he said at one point. And later: \u201cI missed both of these candidates when we were fighting the [federal] Clean Power Plan in Richmond.\u201d\n\nWagner, who says the state needs more tax revenue for transportation, also criticized the tax cuts Gillespie and Stewart have proposed. After Gillespie promised to cut income taxes by 10 percent and ticked off plans to improve schools, transportation and drug treatment, Wagner said that would put the state\u2019s AAA bond-rating at risk.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to cut taxes and spend more money on this, this, this and this,\u201d said Wagner, a Naval Academy graduate and former shipyard owner, summarizing Gillespie\u2019s promises. \u201cAt the Naval Academy, you learned you had to be honest. As a Navy diver, you don\u2019t make statements like that or people die.\u201d\n\nStewart has called for an even larger income tax cut: a 17.4 percent reduction in the first year and a full phase-out for localities bordering Tennessee, which has no income tax. He also has called for eliminating the tax statewide in \u201cthe next several years\u201d under what he calls \u201cCorey\u2019s Big Bold Virginia Tax Cut.\u201d\n\nStewart questioned if Gillespie\u2019s more detailed tax plan adds up, asking Gillespie, \u201cIs there a single identified cut in your tax plan?\u201d\n\nThe debate took place just days ahead of Sunday\u2019s 10th anniversary of the Virginia Tech massacre, when Seung Hui Cho, a Tech senior with a history of mental health problems, killed 32 people before taking his own life. In light of the anniversary, Spain asked if the candidates favored closing the \u201cgun-show loophole\u201d that allows people to bypass background checks when buying guns from sellers who are not licensed dealers.\n\nAll three oppose new restrictions on guns, but their responses highlighted stark differences in style.\n\nWagner was characteristically direct: \u201cThe [current] rules and laws are totally adequate.\u201d Stewart was combative, claiming \u201cthe gun-show loophole is a myth\u201d (because licensed dealers who sell as shows must conduct the checks), and accusing Gillespie of skipping a rally with the Virginia Citizens Defense League in January to hang out with lobbyists.\n\nAnd Gillespie sounded like a general-election candidate trying to appeal to both sides of the contentious issue. He offered his \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d to Tech families, affirmed his support for the Second Amendment and sought to put the heat on the two Democrats running to succeed term-limited Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam and former congressman Tom Perriello. He said Northam and Perriello would seek to limit gun rights.\n\nGillespie even explained his absence from the gun rally in a way that could play well with general-election voters: He was serving meals to needy families at an African-American church that day, which was Martin Luther King Day.\n\nThe three Republicans followed a similar pattern when asked about illegal immigration. \u201cWhat part of \u2018illegal\u2019 don\u2019t they understand?\u201d said Wagner, who promised to turn any illegal immigrants arrested in Virginia over to federal immigration officials. Stewart spelled out horrifying details of a recent killing in nearby Bedford County. Three Salvadoran MS-13 gang members in the country illegally have been charged in the abduction and murder of 17-year-old Raymond Wood.\n\n\u201cThree criminal illegal immigrants cut off his feet, cut off his hands and they nearly beheaded him, and they dumped his body in Bedford,\u201d said Stewart, who drew national attention a decade ago with a crackdown on illegal immigrants in Prince William. \u201cIf they\u2019re here illegally, you boot them out of the country.\u201d\n\nGillespie, in turn, offered his \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d to Wood\u2019s family. Then he turned his attention to Northam and Perriello, criticizing their support for issuing driver\u2019s licenses to illegal immigrants. Gillespie added that he opposed offering in-state tuition to students brought to the country illegally as children but said nothing about any deportation goals.\n\nThe three Republicans are scheduled to square off again April 22 at a Goochland debate"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/republicans-may-not-want-trump-to-end-obamacare-payments/2017/04/14/f85409ea-214b-11e7-be2a-3a1fb24d4671_story.html", "text": "Some influential Republicans in Congress don\u2019t want a fight President Trump is threatening to pick over extra Obamacare payments to insurers.\n\nTrump suggested this week that as Congress seeks to fund the government beyond April, Republicans should refuse to pay for cost-sharing subsidies provided through the Affordable Care Act to low-income Americans. There\u2019s widespread agreement that without the subsidies, insurers would be forced to hike premiums next year, worsening conditions in the Obamacare insurance marketplaces.\n\nThe president told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that not only would such a move cause Obamacare to \u201cdie,\u201d it could also be used to force Democrats to negotiate on repealing the health-care law altogether. \u201cWithout the payments, Obamacare is gone, just gone,\u201d Trump said.\n\n[Trump\u2019s threat prompts Democrats to play hardball over Obamacare payments]\n\nMany Republicans are well aware that the public is likely to blame them for premium increases, now that they control both Congress and the White House and have so far failed to agree on a health-care replacement plan. And Democrats are keenly aware of the shifting dynamics, seizing every opportunity they can to insist Republicans now own the health-care law.\n\nThe Democratic leadership in Congress says it will hold up the government funding bill that expires on April 28 in order to secure the payments if Trump decides to withhold them. But Republicans are unlikely to want to shut down the government \u2014 or for Trump to withhold the payments in the first place.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Democrats will let this happen, but I frankly don\u2019t think the Republicans want it to happen either,\u201d said Timothy Jost, a health-law professor at Washington and Lee University.\n\nRep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), who, as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, helped craft the GOP health-care plan, told constituents this week that the subsidies need to be funded, period.\n\n\u201cIt was a commitment made by the government to the insurers and the people,\u201d Walden said Wednesday at a town hall in his district. \u201cThat needs to happen.\u201d\n\nRep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), who chairs the powerful Appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over health care, has also said it\u2019s important to fund the payments for insurers, although he stressed it\u2019s a decision that the House leadership would have to make.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably the right thing to do, I think,\u201d Cole told The Washington Post last month. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019re going to have insurance companies exiting the market.\u201d\n\nOther top Republicans are remaining quiet about how to handle the subsidies, letting the White House lead the way. Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) isn\u2019t taking a position. A \u00adBrady spokeswoman said Friday that the congressman \u201cbelieves the administration is taking important steps to stabilize Obamacare\u2019s collapsing marketplace.\u201d\n\n(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Trump administration must decide whether it will continue pursuing a GOP lawsuit to block the subsidies. The House sued the Obama administration for awarding the subsidies without a clear congressional appropriation and won in federal court last year. The Obama administration appealed the decision.\n\nNow the GOP has the White House on its side \u2014 and a new concern that Republicans will bear the public blame for problems with Obamacare. Trump\u2019s victory created a tricky new situation that House Republicans surely didn\u2019t envision when they filed the lawsuit, said Bill Pierce, a \u00adhealth policy expert at APCO Worldwide.\n\n\u201cIt is a situation entirely of their own doing,\u201d Pierce said.\n\nRepublicans have said they were fighting the awarding of insurer payments without permission from Congress \u2014 not the subsidies themselves. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) hasn\u2019t said whether he wants to fund the subsidies in a spending bill later this month, and his office didn\u2019t respond Friday to a query about the issue.\n\n\u201cWe believe in Congress retaining its lawmaking power, but this lawsuit hasn\u2019t run its course,\u201d Ryan said late last month. \u201cWhile the lawsuit is running its course, the administration is exercising their discretion with respect to the [cost-sharing reductions].\u201d\n\nThe health-care law requires marketplace insurers to discount extra insurance costs beyond the monthly premium \u2014 such as deductibles and co-payments \u2014 for people earning less than 250 percent of the poverty level. Without federal payments to cover those discounts, it\u2019s estimated that insurers would hike premiums by an average of 19 percent.\n\nThat reality is leading law\u00admakers such as Walden and Cole to back the subsidies, even if they want to get rid of the underlying law. The cost-sharing reductions would cost an estimated $7 billion or $8 billion in the next year, but with that cost already built in, Congress wouldn\u2019t have to come up with extra money to fund them.\n\nIf Trump pushes for withholding the payments, it could fuel a clash between these lawmakers and conservatives who want to damage Obamacare in any way they can.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not alone in my party in [wanting to fund the cost-sharing reductions], but there are a lot in my party that don\u2019t think that,\u201d Walden said.\n\nInsurers are watching the situation with trepidation, with rapidly approaching deadlines for announcing whether they will continue selling plans on the insurance marketplaces next year. Kristine Grow, a spokeswoman for the trade association America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, said more plans will likely exit without the cost-sharing reductions.\n\n\u201cA lot of plans are very likely to drop out of the market because of continued instability,\u201d Grow said.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trump-will-keep-list-of-white-house-visitors-secret/2017/04/14/64a5713a-214f-11e7-bb59-a74ccaf1d02f_video.html", "text": "- The Trump administration announced on April 14, that it won't voluntarily disclose the names of visitors to the White House complex, breaking from former president Barack Obama's policy.

The provision prohibits tax-exempt organizations, including houses of worship, from endorsing or opposing political candidates.\n\nRepeal of the amendment has been sought primarily by conservative Christian leaders, who argue that it is used selectively to keep them from speaking out freely in church.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump spoke out in favor of ending the prohibition, and he strongly reiterated his support during the National Prayer Breakfast shortly after taking office.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Natalie Strom said Trump still supports repeal, but she would not comment on whether he backs the approach advocated by Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\nRalph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, which counts repeal of the Johnson amendment as a top priority, said he is not as concerned with how the repeal happens as he is that Trump and other Republican leaders keep their promise.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) opposes moves to lift restrictions on tax-exempt groups backing political candidates. (Jahi Chikwendiu/Washington Post)\n\n\u201cThat would be fine with us, if it were to become law as part of a tax package,\u201d Reed said. \u201cWe\u2019d like to have an up-or-down vote, but this might make it easier to pass.\u201d\n\nHouses of worship make up just a fraction of the universe of 501(c)(3) organizations, named for a portion of the tax code.\n\nLast week, nearly 4,500 such organizations signed onto a letter to congressional leaders, urging them not to weaken or repeal the amendment. It also argued that allowing nonprofit organizations to support candidates would create a loophole in campaign disclosure laws because contributions to many such groups are not made public and are tax deductible.\n\n\u201cNonpartisanship is a cornerstone principle that has strengthened the public\u2019s trust of the charitable community,\u201d the letter said.\n\nFred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, one of the groups that signed the letter, criticized any attempt by House leaders to attach repeal of the Johnson amendment to broader tax legislation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simply an effort to ram it through without getting a vote on it,\u201d Wertheimer said.\n\nThe aim of repealing the Johnson amendment is also not universally embraced by all religious groups. A coalition of 99 organizations, including many Jewish and Baptist groups, sent a separate letter to Congress last week, urging that the ban stay in place.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, spoke out against efforts to eliminate the Johnson amendment.\n\n\u201cA repeal would undermine the sanctity of our religious institutions, increase the flow of dark money in politics and force taxpayers to foot the bill for special interests,\u201d Wyden said.\n\nBut Jerry Falwell Jr., an evangelical Christian leader and president of Liberty University, said that such concerns are overblown, saying a repeal could be \u201ccarefully crafted\u201d to ensure that churches and other tax-exempt organizations are permitted to spend only a small percentage of their funds on support of candidates.\n\n\u201cThat just needs to be worked out,\u201d he said.\n\nFalwell said religious leaders are mostly concerned about the ability to speak freely and not risk losing their institution\u2019s tax-exempt status with the Internal Revenue Service. Most are not interested in turning their churches into super PACs, he said.\n\nUnder current law, churches are free to engage in political activity; the restrictions under the Johnson Amendment are triggered by their acceptance of tax-exempt status.\n\nAs a candidate, Trump voiced his opposition to the Johnson Amendment during a speech in June to a group of hundreds of conservative Christian faith leaders who met with him in New York. He also pressed the issue in smaller settings, including in a meeting with faith leaders before a rally in North Carolina shortly before the election, said Tami Fitzgerald, executive director of the NC Values Coalition, who was one of the participants.\n\nAnd during his appearance at the National Prayer Breakfast in February, Trump vowed to \u201cget rid of and totally destroy the Johnson amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-said-there-was-never-a-better-time-to-be-alive-trump-thinks-a-nasty-world-offers-nothing-but-problems/2017/04/13/59c9c65e-2090-11e7-be2a-3a1fb24d4671_story.html", "text": "President Trump listens as he and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg participate in a news conference in the East Room of the White House on April 12. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nAddressing the United Nations last fall, President Barack Obama took a moment to highlight for fellow world leaders what he called \u201cthe most important fact\u201d about the state of global affairs: Human existence on planet Earth is good \u2014 and getting better.\n\nWar is down, he said, while life expectancy is up. Democracy is on the march, and science has beaten back infectious diseases. A girl in a remote village can download the \u201centirety of human knowledge\u201d on a smartphone.\n\nA person born today, Obama concluded, is more likely to be safer, healthier, wealthier and better-educated \u2014 and to see a path to prosperity \u2014 than at \u201cany time in human history.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump does not inhabit this world.\n\nTo Trump, the world is \u201ca mess,\u201d as he said during a White House news conference this week with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.\n\n(Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)\n\nIn recent days, Trump authorized missile strikes on Syria, shifted rapidly to a tougher tone with Russia, and negotiated with China\u2019s authoritarian leader over what to do about North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy what\u2019s going on,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the Middle East or you look at \u2014 no matter where \u2014 Ukraine \u2014 whatever you look at, it\u2019s got problems, so many problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now,\u201d he concluded, \u201cit\u2019s nasty.\u201d\n\nWhat a time to be alive.\n\nTo ordinary Americans, the gulf between the worldviews of the United States\u2019 two most recent leaders could not be more vast.\n\nBut historians and foreign affairs analysts said that, despite their apparent contradictions, both things can be true. The world is always a mess. Bad things happen. There are crises. People die.\n\nThe question, they said, is how a president responds to the mess and how he frames the threat and the response to the public \u2014 a challenge made more difficult in an age of immediate and nonstop news from across the world.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama constantly reminded us that our own times are not uniquely oppressive,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian and author at Rice University. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling due to the 24-7 news cycle that everything is a crisis mode, when the fact of the matter is, Americans have it better now than ever before.\u201d\n\nThroughout his campaign, Trump railed about the dangers and threats to Americans: inside the country in the form of undocumented immigrants and violent inner cities, and abroad in the form of Islamic State terrorists, swarms of refugees and rapacious U.S. trading partners.\n\nTime and again, Obama sought to counter Trump\u2019s apocalyptic rhetoric by putting the purported threats in broader context and cautioning Americans not to succumb to fear or anger.\n\nThe Islamic State does not represent an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the country, Obama said in November 2015, just a few days after Islamic State terrorists killed 130 people in Paris. Rather, he said, they were nothing more than \u201ca bunch of killers with good social media.\u201d\n\nObama characterized most undocumented immigrants as hard-working strivers. Globalization caused discomfort for some workers, Obama acknowledged, but he was quick to emphasize the opportunities it provided for American ingenuity in new markets overseas.\n\n\u201cYes, we\u2019re going through large, structural changes . . . [and] all these things are creating a new politics for the world,\u201d said Simon Rosenberg, founder of NDN, a liberal think tank in Washington. \u201cThe challenge is not to be overwhelmed but to manage them for one\u2019s own benefit. That\u2019s where Trump is so flummoxed. He is more fearful of the changes than he is understanding the goal of the president is to manage them for the benefit of the United States.\u201d\n\nThat might have been Obama\u2019s goal, but the president recognized during his final year in office that his optimistic message to Americans was at risk of being overtaken by the chaotic images from abroad.\n\nDuring a town hall-style event with young people in Malaysia in September, Obama said that the flow of information bombarding news consumers on televisions, computers and smartphones makes it appear \u201cas if the world is falling apart.\u201d\n\nA war here, an environmental disaster there, and suddenly \u201ceverybody is shouting and everybody hates each other,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd you get kind of depressed. You think, \u2018Goodness, what\u2019s happening?\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut, Obama emphasized, \u201cif you had a choice of when to be born and you didn\u2019t know ahead of time who you were going to be \u2014 what nationality, whether you were male or female, what religion \u2014 but you had said, \u2018When in human history would be the best time to be born?\u2019 \u2014 the time would be now.\u201d\n\nSteven Pinker, a psychology professor at Harvard University, has written that voluminous data back up Obama\u2019s argument. But he acknowledged that the former president\u2019s message did \u201cfail to resonate\u201d during a rapid-fire campaign news cycle.\n\n\u201cHe has the facts behind him, but to get those facts, you can\u2019t read the daily news,\u201d Pinker said. \u201cIf you only look at bad things, there are always bad things. Trump is right that there is a lot of nasty stuff going on. There always is, and unfortunately there probably always will be. The question is, is there more nasty stuff? The answer is no.\u201d\n\nUnlike Obama, Trump is a voracious consumer of breathless, hyperbolic cable news programming. In the White House, he has continued to react, on Twitter, to the partisan debate and unfolding horrors on his television screen.\n\nHis message has consistently been that America is being taken advantage of because of Obama\u2019s weakness. China and Mexico are beating the United States on trade. Middle Eastern refugees are flowing across borders, causing chaos and crime. Immigrants are taking American jobs. \u201cWe don\u2019t win anymore,\u201d Trump said repeatedly.\n\nIn his inaugural address, Trump described in stark terms problems he saw across the country as he began his presidency and said, \u201cThis American carnage stops right here and stops right now.\u201d\n\nTo historian Rick Shenkman, author of \u201cPolitical Animals: How Our Stone-Age Brain Gets in the Way of Smart Politics,\u201d Trump\u2019s rhetoric appeals to base human instincts, hard-wired from prehistoric times, to be on guard for constant threats.\n\nWhile some critics have suggested Trump exploits public fears, Shenkman believes he more effectively leverages public anger.\n\n\u201cPeople who are in an angry mood want change,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will take risks for change . . . Modern political parties, and Trump in particular, have learned that if you keep people in a state of nonstop anger, they stand by you.\u201d\n\nYet historians said Trump, like other presidents, would have to shift to a more upbeat message as his presidency matures. \u201cA presidency can\u2019t feed on failure,\u201d Brinkley said.\n\nOthers suggested that Trump\u2019s recent pivot away from some of his foreign policy positions from the campaign \u2014 such as calling NATO \u201cobsolete\u201d and threatening to label China a \u201ccurrency manipulator\u201d \u2014 reflects a leader coming to terms with how complicated the world is and how difficult it will be to address the global challenges without allies and partners now that he is in charge.\n\n\u201cRight now, there is a fear, and there are problems \u2014 there are certainly problems,\u201d Trump said at the White House. \u201cBut ultimately, I hope that there won\u2019t be a fear and there won\u2019t be problems, and the world can get along. That would be the ideal situation.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/republican-house-leader-avoids-selling-gop-health-care-plan-at-home/2017/04/13/199bc5a4-2046-11e7-a0a7-8b2a45e3dc84_story.html", "text": "People listen as Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) speaks during a town hall at Fort Dalles Readiness Center on Wednesday in The Dalles, Ore. (Raelynn Ricarte/AP)\n\nRep. Greg Walden is one of the Republican House leaders who crafted the measure to overhaul the health-care system that dramatically imploded before lawmakers went home for a two-week recess.\n\nBut when faced with a large crowd of angry constituents in his district this week, the Oregon Republican seemed reluctant to claim the legislation as his own. Instead, Walden stressed the parts of President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act that he wants to keep.\n\nThat did not stop about 1,500 of his constituents who packed this liberal area at two town halls on Wednesday from slamming the congressman for wanting to overhaul Obamacare in a state that heavily relies on it.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back to Washington, [and] in the spirit of bipartisanship, grow a pair, sit down with [House Democratic leader] Nancy Pelosi and say, \u2018Let\u2019s fix Obamacare,\u2019 \u201d said one middle-aged man at Columbia Gorge Community College, where about 500 people gathered.\n\nA few in the rowdy crowd at the next town hall seemed to know that Walden, as the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, played a pivotal role in crafting the GOP\u2019s American Health Care Act, which would have rolled back Obamacare\u2019s system of subsidies and phased out that law\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n\n(Reuters)\n\n\u201cIt was an embarrassment and a disaster,\u201d said one attendee at Hood River Middle School, where 1,000 people showed up, prompting applause across the auditorium. \u201cYou don\u2019t make the plan better by taking away insurance for 24 million people across the nation.\u201d\n\nLike many House Republicans, Walden has spent the past seven years attacking Obamacare and promising to repeal and replace it if the GOP secured one-party rule in Washington. But now that Walden has his wish, eliminating Obamacare is proving extremely difficult and politically dangerous.\n\nThat was certainly the case at home this week in his sprawling eastern Oregon 2nd District, which he won with a comfortable 72 percent of the vote in November. Walden held events in Hood River and Wasco counties, the least conservative areas that he represents \u2014 winning in Hood by just five votes in the last election. When he asked participants at the community college whether they voted for Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders in the presidential election, the vast majority raised their hands.\n\nBut President Trump won Walden\u2019s district by nearly 20 points \u2014 a fact Walden pointed out at one particularly heated point on Wednesday.\n\nYet not even Trump\u2019s role in pushing the GOP health-care plan prompted Walden \u2014 an ally of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) \u2014 to embrace it. He responded to most health-care questions by touting the popular portions of Obamacare the GOP plan would retain, including preventing insurers from denying coverage to those with pre-existing conditions and allowing young people to stay on their parents\u2019 plans.\n\nWalden insisted that Republicans will work with Democrats on future health-care issues, although their presence has so far been conspicuously absent in negotiations around the GOP plan.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of reform with health care that is being done on a bipartisan basis and will be done on a bipartisan basis,\u201d was all Walden told one attendee at the community college, before moving on to another question.\n\nRep. Greg Walden speaks during a town hall on Wednesday in The Dalles, Ore. (Stephanie Yao Long/AP)\n\nThe only GOP lawmaker from Oregon, Walden finds himself in the same tricky position as several other House Republicans who have pledged to get rid of Obamacare but whose constituents heavily rely on it. Oregon expanded Medicaid as part of the law, and it now covers about one-fourth of all residents. It has also sought to innovate when it comes to that program.\n\nExperts said that the GOP health plan would stem federal funding to states such as Oregon. It would replace Obamacare\u2019s income-based subsidies with age-based ones and phase out the Medicaid expansion, as well as limit the amount the federal government pays states for the program for low-income Americans. The GOP plan would largely scrap the law\u2019s taxes and requirements to buy insurance.\n\n[Affordable Care Act revision would reduce insured numbers by 24 million, CBO projects]\n\nThe proposed changes to Medicaid would be pronounced in states such as Oregon, which is already struggling to fund its program after greatly expanding eligibility. The state has tried to lower overall Medicaid costs by employing a dozen or so Cooperative Care Organizations, which contract with the state to insure enrollees. These groups are tasked with improving patients\u2019 overall health.\n\nBut those efforts have not been enough, and the state in January announced a $882 million shortfall in its Medicaid program.\n\n\u201cOregon would have been clobbered by repeal and replace\u201d in the AHCA, said Jeff Goldsmith, a Portland native and health-policy expert who writes for the nonpartisan journal Health Affairs. \u201cMany billions lost, and for a relatively poor state with limited fiscal capacity.\u201d\n\nWalden was most deeply involved in drafting the Medicaid portion of the GOP plan, but he was quick to explain at the town halls how he would have done things differently. The measure should have allowed states to continue expanding their Medicaid programs through 2020 instead of cutting off that opportunity right away, he said.\n\n.\n\nThe issue is becoming increasingly toxic for lawmakers such as Walden, as liberal groups run ads against him and other Republicans supporting the effort. Walden did not refer to the AHCA by name during either of his town halls, nor did he lay out a timeline for when it might eventually get passed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no value in me coming to a bad plan that hurts people,\u201d he said, prompting cries of \u201cBut you did!\u201d from members of the audience.\n\nAttendees came armed with bright green, orange and yellow signs that read \u201cAgree,\u201d \u201cDisagree\u201d and \u201cAnswer the Question.\u201d But they also expressed their feelings out loud throughout both meetings, which erupted frequently with boos and shouts, particularly when Walden appeared to support something Trump has said or done.\n\nHe won applause only a few times, chiefly when several constituents thanked him for supporting the military. Many heatedly asked Walden to respond to Trump\u2019s calls for building a wall along the Mexico border, his push for reducing science funding, his moves to ban refugees from majority-Muslim countries and his skepticism of climate change.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t like climate-change deniers. We need your word you will not desert us on this,\u201d said a woman named Connie.\n\nWalden noted several areas where he\u2019s bucked Trump \u2014 including opposing the refugee ban and some elements of Trump\u2019s proposed budget \u2014 but he was careful not to directly criticize the president\u2019s style or approach. When he seemed to give Trump a pass on refusing to release his tax returns, people booed loudly.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me [that] candidates are better-served when they do make their returns public, but that\u2019s all protected by privacy laws,\u201d Walden said.\n\nThe restive crowds did not seem to ruffle Walden, who extended each session to two hours instead of the single hour they were originally scheduled to run.\n\n\u201cCome on, let\u2019s do this the Oregon way \u2014 let\u2019s be respectful of each other,\u201d Walden said when interrupted by attendees.\n\nAt another point, Walden even succeeded in making the crowd laugh, after a woman with several children asked why he did not criticize Trump more publicly for making derogatory statements about women.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t speak out every time he says stuff because I don\u2019t have time for that, frankly,\u201d Walden responded.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/prediction-professor-publishes-book-arguing-that-president-trump-could-be-impeached/2017/04/14/a97690f6-2086-11e7-bb59-a74ccaf1d02f_video.html", "text": "- Professor Allan J.

Powell Jr. U.S. Courthouse in Richmond. (U.S. General Services Administration)\n\nA portfolio of Southern cases, genteel courtroom traditions and years of forceful conservative rulings shape the enduring image of the federal appeals court in Richmond.\n\nBut the bench has shed its conservative label, undergoing a sea change in the past decade, and is poised to have an immediate impact on the fledgling Trump administration.\n\nStarting next month, the full court will take up the president\u2019s entry ban for immigrants from some countries, followed by the case of a transgender teen whose battle to use a boy\u2019s bathroom challenges the president\u2019s new policy.\n\nSince taking office, President Trump has harshly criticized federal judges, specifically deriding the San Francisco-based appeals court \u2014 which put the first version of his travel ban on hold \u2014 as in \u201cchaos\u201d and \u201cturmoil.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, a Richmond-based venue the administration might once have found reliably hospitable, now has a higher proportion of judges tapped by Democrats than most of the nation\u2019s 13 circuit courts. That includes the pan-Western 9th Circuit with its long-standing reputation among conservatives as the \u201cnutty 9th.\u201d\n\nRoger Gregory, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, is interviewed in 2016 in his office in Richmond. (Steve Helber/Associated Press)\n\nA test of how far the 4th Circuit bench has tilted left will come May 8. The court announced this week that it would bypass the traditional three-judge panel and gather that day as a full complement to review Trump\u2019s entry ban.\n\nWithin the past year, judges at the historic Italianate courthouse, who descend from the bench to shake hands with the attorneys who have argued before them, have issued major opinions that would have been unimaginable two decades ago.\n\nThe court said Republican lawmakers in North Carolina deliberately undercut the political power of African American voters through targeted voting restrictions. Judges sided with the Virginia transgender teen in the first round of his fight. And in a gun decision that went further than other appeals courts, the Richmond-based circuit ruled that the Second Amendment does not protect what it called \u201cweapons of war\u201d in a case trying to undo a Maryland ban on semiautomatic, military-style firearms.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a persistent impression that\u2019s long been out of date that this is a very conservative court,\u201d said Steven Goldblatt, who directs the appellate litigation program at Georgetown University\u2019s law school and regularly appears before the court. \u201cIt\u2019s a different court, with many new judges who cannot be measured by decisions reached many years ago.\u201d\n\n[Second federal judge blocks revised Trump travel ban]\n\nThe court\u2019s caseload consists of appeals from Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia and the Carolinas.\n\nAfter federal judges in Maryland and Hawaii blocked critical sections of the president\u2019s revised travel order in March, the Justice Department appealed. The administration also asked the 4th Circuit to put the Maryland judge\u2019s opinion on hold and allow the ban to take effect immediately ahead of oral arguments next month.\n\nThe first-floor library at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond. (U.S. General Services Administration)\n\nThe Maryland case applies only to the provision of Trump\u2019s order that would have stopped new visas for travelers from six Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.\n\nThe court also has been asked to rule again in the case of Gavin Grimm, the transgender teen challenging his school\u2019s requirement that students use a bathroom that corresponds to their \u201cbiological sex.\u201d\n\nThe case returned to Richmond after the Supreme Court decided in March to put off a ruling on transgender rights and referred it back to the 4th Circuit to possibly look at broader constitutional questions.\n\nWhen it ruled in Grimm\u2019s favor initially, the 4th Circuit cited the Obama administration\u2019s position on transgender student rights. The Trump administration since has revoked federal guidelines that directed schools to allow transgender students to use a bathroom consistent with their gender identity.\n\nLast week, Senior Judge Andre M. Davis and Judge Henry F. Floyd \u2014 both nominated by President Barack Obama \u2014 took the unusual step of issuing a passionate statement placing Grimm among the pantheon of human rights leaders who confronted inequities through the courts. Grimm\u2019s case will likely be heard in September.\n\n[Supreme Court sends transgender case back to lower court]\n\nFor years, attorneys pursuing liberal-leaning policies viewed the 4th Circuit as hostile territory for civil rights and for criminal defendants, and as a reliable backstop on national security policies.\n\nBut that is changing.\n\nSeveral national legal organizations that have the flexibility to choose where to wage their legal battles are deliberately turning to the 4th Circuit.\n\nThe national groups that filed the most recent challenge to Trump\u2019s entry ban in Maryland \u2014 the National Immigration Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union \u2014 could have gone to other venues.\n\n\u201cThe court has become a much friendlier forum in civil rights cases, and it appears that criminal defendants have found a more open ear,\u201d said Charlotte attorney Jake Sussman, who has defended inmates on death row and successfully challenged North Carolina\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage.\n\nThe 15-judge court looks very different today than it did two decades ago.\n\nIn 1993, the bench had only one woman and no minorities. Three-quarters of the judges were nominated by Republican presidents, including leading conservative voices J. Michael Luttig and J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who in later years were on George W. Bush\u2019s shortlist for the Supreme Court.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the court issued opinions upholding restrictions on abortions and striking down a law allowing rape victims to sue their attackers in federal court. The court in 1999 overturned the requirement that police read suspects their rights, known as Miranda rights, before interrogating them. The Supreme Court later reaffirmed Miranda rights.\n\nOn national security matters, the court often upheld the post-9/11 policies of the Bush administration, supporting the detention of enemy combatants. In death penalty cases, the Supreme Court reversed a number of 4th Circuit rulings in the early 2000s, leading to a measure of relief for inmates on death row.\n\nConservatives were stunned in 2006 when Luttig announced his retirement to become general counsel for Boeing. At the time Obama took office, the split on the court still favored Republican nominees, 6 to 5. But with four vacancies, the administration saw an opportunity to remake the court \u2014 as it did on other circuit courts \u2014 and diversify the bench to better reflect the demographics of the country.\n\nRakesh Kilaru, who worked in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office during Obama\u2019s tenure, clerked for Wilkinson in 2010, the year that three new judges joined the court.\n\n\u201cThe picture I have that is signed by all of the judges looks quite different than the picture you would have seen a few years before, and I think that\u2019s something the president is quite proud of,\u201d Kilaru said, referring to Obama.\n\nAmong the 15 active judges on the court, there are five women, of whom one is African American, one Latino judge and two African American men, including Roger Gregory, the chief judge. Gregory was initially appointed by President Bill Clinton during a congressional recess and later was nominated by Bush at the urging of Virginia\u2019s two senators.\n\nJudge Diana Gribbon Motz, a Clinton nominee, was for years on the losing side, particularly on national security cases. Motz wrote the recent opinion striking down North Carolina\u2019s voting restrictions that she said \u201ctarget African Americans with almost surgical precision.\u201d The court now has a handful of Obama nominees on the bench to the left of her.\n\nA total of 10 of the active judges were nominated by Democrats.\n\nThat leaves the 4th Circuit \u2014 along with three other circuits \u2014 with 67 percent of judges nominated by Democrats, ranking at the top, with the Boston-based 1st Circuit, the Atlanta-based 11th Circuit and the Federal Circuit in Washington, according to an analysis by Russell Wheeler, an expert on judicial nominations at the Brookings Institution.\n\nWheeler cautioned that there is a spectrum of views and approaches even among judges nominated by the same president, but that the party of the president who chose a judge is not a bad predictor of a judge\u2019s perspective.\n\n[Trump to inherit more than 100 court vacancies, plans to reshape the judiciary]\n\nThe 4th Circuit judges and their stable of clerks assemble in Richmond about every six weeks for \u201ccourt week\u201d in the downtown courthouse that provided offices for Confederate President Jefferson Davis during the Civil War.\n\nCases are argued before randomly assigned panels, and it is still possible to draw a panel of three judges all nominated by Republican presidents. But the odds have shifted, and, when the court agrees to a redo and reviews a case en banc, the balance tips decidedly left.\n\nIn March, a full panel convened to revisit a 2-to-1 decision in favor of North Carolina county commissioners sued by the American Civil Liberties Union for opening their meetings with mostly Christian prayers.\n\nThe court did not explain its highly unusual decision this week to skip the three-judge panel in the challenge to Trump\u2019s revised entry ban. But the move initiated by the court suggests the judges recognize the need to move quickly on a contentious issue with national significance that appears destined to end up at the Supreme Court.\n\nAllison Orr Larsen, a William & Mary Law School professor who also clerked for Wilkinson, said the court may have lost its conservative label but not its sense of collegiality.\n\n\u201cEven for those difficult, politically charged cases, I\u2019m sure they will be thoughtfully deliberated by everyone regardless of the political affiliation,\u201d she said. The court, she added, \u201cputs a premium on collaboration.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/manafort-is-expected-to-register-as-a-foreign-agent/2017/04/12/6c7cdd58-1fb0-11e7-ad74-3a742a6e93a7_story.html", "text": "Paul Manafort on the floor of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland last July. (Matt Rourke/Associated Press)\n\nPaul Manafort, the former campaign chair for Donald Trump, has signaled that he plans to register as a foreign agent for his past work on behalf of political figures in Ukraine.\n\nIf he files, Manafort would become the second former senior Trump adviser in recent weeks to retroactively acknowledge the need to disclose foreign work. Gen. Michael Flynn, the former White House national security adviser, filed a disclosure last month saying he had done work on behalf of Turkish interests.\n\nA spokesman for Manafort said Wednesday that the longtime political consultant considered a new filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) after receiving \u201cformal guidance recently from the authorities\u201d regarding work he and a colleague had performed on behalf of Ukrainian political interests.\n\nManafort\u2019s spokesman, Jason Maloni, said that \u201cthe work in question was widely known\u201d and ended before Manafort began working with the Trump campaign, while emphasizing that the work \u201cwas not conducted on behalf of the Russian government.\u201d\n\nManafort\u2019s ties to Ukraine have been controversial because he worked for a political figure, \u00adViktor Yanukovych, who became aligned with Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin.\n\n(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nFor nearly a decade, Manafort advised Yanukovych, who was elected president in 2010 but fled to Moscow four years later after demonstrations demanding his ouster.\n\nManafort has done work advising political leaders around the globe, including some troubled figures, such as former Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos. Manafort expects to file any additional FARA disclosure amendments within the next 30 days. It was not clear Wednesday whether Manafort was considering filing reports based on foreign work he did outside of Ukraine.\n\nManafort\u2019s acknowledgment of the foreign registration issue came Wednesday afternoon, hours after a detailed statement was issued by the Podesta Group, which, along with another firm, helped Manafort with a campaign to improve Ukraine\u2019s image in the United States between 2012 and 2014.\n\nThe Podesta Group is led by Tony Podesta, the brother of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign adviser, John Podesta.\n\nIn filing the FARA report, Podesta\u2019s firm disclosed that it was paid more than $1.2 million by a Brussels-based group advocating for Ukraine. The Podesta Group statement, from chief executive Kimberley Fritts, said the consulting group received legal counsel at the time that foreign agent registration was not required. Instead, Podesta disclosed its lobbying activities only as part of a standard congressional lobbying disclosure for work done in the United States.\n\n\u201cBut information brought to light in recent months prompted us to review our original registration determination,\u201d Fritts said in the statement.\n\nFARA registration is required if funding comes from a foreign government or political party. Registration is required as a result of legislation passed in 1938 to counter German propagandists operating in the United States before the start of World War II.\n\nInitially, Podesta officials said they were advised that the Brussels group was a nonprofit that was not financed directly by Yanukovych or his political party.\n\nLast summer, the Associated Press reported that Manafort and business colleague Rick Gates had overseen the lobbying effort in Washington on behalf of Ukraine\u2019s Party of Regions, which was being criticized in Congress for jailing a prominent political opponent. Gates joined Manafort in working for the Trump campaign and stayed on after Manafort resigned in August.\n\nThat resignation followed the report from the AP and another from the New York Times that discussed payments Manafort allegedly received from the Party of Regions. Manafort has consistently denied any wrongdoing and said that reports of his receiving funds improperly are false.\n\nThe involvement of the Justice Department creates a reminder of potential pitfalls for Manafort and others associated with the campaign who did work overseas. Flynn\u2019s work for Turkey has received scrutiny as had Manafort\u2019s work for the now controversial Ukrainian leader. It is a felony to fail to register under FARA. But legal experts said individuals typically avoid prosecution by cooperating with Justice Department recommendations."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/with-his-presidency-in-turmoil-trump-keeps-returning-to-past-victories--and-old-foes/2017/04/12/1fa2e496-1fb5-11e7-ad74-3a742a6e93a7_story.html", "text": "President Trump, shown here in November 2016 with then-president Barack Obama, has made Obama and Hillary Clinton regular foils during his early months in office.

Years after the worst of the economic recession had passed, Obama frequently castigated Republicans for driving the economy \u201cinto the ditch.\u201d But even with that well-worn line, Obama rarely criticized former president George W. Bush by name.\n\nAnd former Obama aides note that he did, in fact, inherit an economy in a tailspin in early 2009, compared with the steady job growth and low unemployment rate inherited by Trump.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, Obama was accurate in his descriptions and Trump is most decidedly not,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, who was a former senior adviser to Obama. \u201cThere is an important tradition of presidents\u2019 trying to pull the country together after elections, and Trump has tried to do the opposite by continuing to re-litigate the election.\u201d\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, few issues would rouse Trump\u2019s supporters like Clinton and Obama. In front of a screaming mass of thousands, he criticized Obama for being weak on the world stage and regularly accused Clinton of breaking the law with her use of a private email server, prompting chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d from the crowd.\n\nAs president, Trump has changed little in that regard.\n\n\u201cShe was guilty on every charge,\u201d Trump said of Clinton in the Fox Business interview. \u201c[FBI Director James] Comey was very, very good to Hillary Clinton, that I can tell you. If he weren\u2019t, she would be, right now, going to trial.\u201d\n\nTrump has also pointed the finger at Obama, his aides and government staffers held over from the previous administration for damaging leaks and delays in moving his agenda forward. Most recently he has had former Obama national security adviser Susan E. Rice in his crosshairs, accusing her of using surveillance tools for political purposes; she has adamantly denied the allegation.\n\n[President Trump\u2019s thoroughly confusing Fox Business interview, annotated]\n\nFor a president who counts winning among the most important and constant things in his life, his unexpected electoral college win over Clinton has become a high-water mark for his political career \u2014 especially with few clear victories during the early months of his presidency.\n\n\u201cThe electoral college is very, very hard, they say almost impossible for a Republican to win. The odds are stacked,\u201d Trump told union members at a conference in Washington last week. \u201cThey\u2019re saying there\u2019s no way to 270. Well, but there was a way to 306.\u201d\n\nTrump often pitches the American people on his policies by framing them in opposition to those of his predecessor. At a recent meeting of CEOs in the White House, Trump contrasted his goal of implementing ready-to-go projects with infrastructure spending in Obama\u2019s stimulus bill.\n\n\u201cYou know, there was a very large infrastructure bill that was approved during the Obama administration, a trillion dollars,\u201d Trump said at a CEO town hall this month. \u201cNobody ever saw anything being built. I mean, to this day, I haven\u2019t heard of anything that\u2019s been built.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump claimed Obama spent infrastructure funds on \u201csocial programs,\u201d the largest chunk of spending dedicated to infrastructure in Obama\u2019s 2009 stimulus package \u2014 more than $26 billion \u2014 went to highway infrastructure programs.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments reflect a backward-looking approach to establishing Trump\u2019s presidential legacy, Hess said.\n\n\u201cIs your legacy defined by your predecessor? By your enemies?\u201d Hess noted. \u201cPresidents look ahead. Why would a president spend so much time looking back?\u201d\n\nNowhere has Trump\u2019s focus on Obama been more acute than on Syria. In recent days, Trump has pointed to Obama\u2019s failure to enforce his \u201cred line\u201d against the use of chemical weapons by Assad.\n\nYet in June 2013 \u2014 after a deadly chemical weapons attack in the Damascus suburbs \u2014 Trump repeatedly praised Obama for not taking military action. In a tweet on June 15, 2013, Trump wrote: \u201cWe should stay the hell out of Syria, the \u2018rebels\u2019 are just as bad as the current regime. WHAT WILL WE GET FOR OUR LIVES AND $ BILLIONS? ZERO.\u201d\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump continued to oppose any involvement in Syria and accused Clinton and some of his Republican opponents of wanting to start World War III.\n\nEven among Obama critics in the Republican Party, Trump\u2019s focus on the past has little sway.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a secret that I disagreed with many of the decisions made by the Obama administration on foreign policy, but that presidency\u2019s over,\u201d Sen.

Kelly has said DHS is not pursuing mass deportations, Trump\u2019s executive orders broadly expanded the pool of undocumented immigrants who are deemed a priority for removal.\n\n\u201cThis is an administration that very much is interested in setting up that mass deportation infrastructure and creating the levers of a police state,\u201d said Marielena Hincapi\u00e9, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. \u201cIn these documents, you have more proof and evidence that they\u2019re planning to carry it out.\u201d\n\nCongressional Democrats, who have opposed Trump\u2019s immigration agenda, have expressed skepticism that Congress would agree to approve funding for many of the expensive initiatives.\n\nFor example, Trump has called for CBP to hire 5,000 new agents and Immigration and Customs Enforcement an additional 10,000. The DHS assessment said the cost of hiring just 500 agents would reach $100 million.\n\nRepublican leaders have proposed delaying a decision on Trump\u2019s initial request of $1.5 billion for the wall and an additional $2.6 billion for more border security next year until after a new spending bill is approved this month in the hope of averting a government shutdown.\n\n(Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cWe believe it would be inappropriate to insist on the inclusion of such funding in a must-pass appropriations bill,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and four Democratic colleagues wrote of the wall in a recent letter to the Senate\u2019s Republican leadership.\n\nBut the DHS assessment states that Border Patrol is moving forward with the construction of a border wall prototype with $20 million that lawmakers reappropriated in March, with completion of the prototype to be completed July 22.\n\nIf Congress were to allocate more funds, the next step for CBP, according to the documents, would be to begin work with the Army Corps of Engineers to launch construction of 34 miles of levee wall or a border barrier in the Rio Grande Valley sector, which the agency calls the \u201chighest-priority area,\u201d as well as 14 additional miles of a border barrier in the San Diego sector.\n\nCost concerns are peppered throughout the DHS assessment documents. Although ICE has identified 27 potential locations that could increase its detention space by 21,000 beds, that agency \u201cwill be unable to secure additional detention capability until funding has been identified,\u201d according to the documents.\n\nIn addition, CBP has made contingencies to expand its own detention capacity by 12,500 spaces, but the agency does not spell out whether funding is available for those slots.\n\nCBP also is laying the groundwork to potentially hold immigration-court hearings through video conferences at or near U.S. ports of entry if the government of Mexico agrees to house third-country immigrants awaiting adjudication in the U.S. legal system, the documents show.\n\nThe Mexican government has balked at such a procedure, which would raise significant jurisdictional concerns. But if such a procedure were established, it would cost $50,000 per location for the video equipment, the DHS documents state.\n\nAlternative plans to send U.S. judges to the \u201cport courts\u201d are also being considered, although such a procedure would cost $400,000 per location.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re throwing a lot of public resources at a problem that should not be a priority, especially since the number of [border] crossers is down considerably,\u201d said J. Kevin Appleby, a senior director at the Center for Migration Studies.\n\nGovernment figures show the number of people illegally crossing the border from Mexico has dropped sharply in the first two months of Trump\u2019s administration. The DHS assessment states that 2,100 detention spaces previously reserved by CBP and ICE during an immigration surge late last year are unused.\n\n\u201cOverall, it\u2019s a wasted use of resources that could be used more efficiently,\u201d Appleby said.\n\nOne area in which the Trump administration could potentially increase its deportation capacity at relatively lower costs is expanding a program in which ICE grants local law enforcement agencies immigration enforcement powers traditionally reserved for the federal government.\n\nThe program \u2014 known as 287(g), which is the federal code that established it in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1996 \u2014 grew to encompass more than 70 local jurisdictions at its peak. But immigrant-rights groups charged that the program has resulted in civil rights abuses and racial profiling by poorly trained local police and lax supervision by ICE.\n\nThe program fell out of favor in the latter years of President Obama\u2019s administration, and there are now 37 jurisdictions participating at a cost of $24 million, according to the American Immigration Council.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive orders instruct ICE to expand the program and allow CBP, which did not previously participate, to launch its own version \u2014 in hopes of creating a \u201cforce multiplier.\u201d\n\nThe DHS assessment states that the ICE review board is considering applications from 18 new jurisdictions and has identified 50 more that are interested in participating.\n\nYet the documents again raise a cautionary flag about funding, stating that ICE probably will be unable to add more than 20 new 287(g) partnerships this year because of limited resources.\n\n\u201cUp to now, they have really been using scare tactics to put on a show, to demonstrate to supporters they are tough on immigration,\u201d Appleby said. \u201cEventually, they really have to produce results. Without congressional approval [for funding], they will not reach the deportation numbers under Obama. That will be the test. If in the first year, if there are not a significant number deported, how will they distinguish themselves from the previous administration?\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/trump-says-good-trade-with-china-hinges-on-help-with-north-korea/2017/04/12/c442857a-1fbe-11e7-bb59-a74ccaf1d02f_video.html", "text": "- President Trump spoke highly of Chinese President Xi during a press conference at the White House on April 12, but avoided commenting directly on the decision not to label China a currency manipulator. \"We're going to see,\" he said when asked if a deal was struck.

It didn\u2019t even make the overly ambitious list of 60 Republican seats that were dubbed \u201cinitial targets\u201d that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee released Jan. 30. Instead, Democratic operatives just hope that Republican Ron Estes\u2019s seven-point victory, in a district that Trump won by 27 points last year, is a sign of energy among liberal voters.\n\nNext week\u2019s initial round of voting in Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District, vacated by the new health secretary, Tom Price, is much more critical for understanding the political landscape ahead.\n\nThis wealthy, well-educated area north of Atlanta has effectively become ground zero for the Democratic effort to reclaim relevance on Capitol Hill. Of those initial targets, Democratic leaders have homed in on about 35 or so House seats in largely suburban areas they believe are home to the party\u2019s future: elite professionals who were turned off by Trump\u2019s behavior during the 2016 campaign and can be permanently forged into a new and winning Democratic coalition.\n\n(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nPrice\u2019s seat, held by Republicans since 1978, is effectively serving as a beta test for the Democratic theory of the case for 2018 and beyond. Each side is pouring money into northern Georgia, with one estimate that nearly $20 million will have been spent by the time ballots are counted Tuesday.\n\nIf, as expected, Democrat Jon Ossoff does not get 50 percent of the vote next Tuesday, he will head into a runoff against the top Republican two months later, and millions more will be spent. By contrast, total spending in the Kansas race will not come close to $1 million.\n\nDemocrats began talking up Ossoff\u2019s prospects more than two months ago at their issues retreat in Baltimore. \u201cWatch the special election for Tom Price\u2019s seat in suburban Atlanta,\u201d Rep. Sean Maloney (D-N.Y.) said in an interview there.\n\nMaloney oversaw a review of what went wrong in 2016, when the six-seat gain for House Democrats well underperformed expectations. His advice is that the DCCC\u2019s analytics and recruiting team should mostly focus on education levels and how rural versus suburban the district is to determine whether they should invest there.\n\nShould House Democrats write off rural congressional districts?\n\nPrice\u2019s seat is a case in point. Median household income is $83,000, according to census data, and almost 60 percent of residents have a college degree. The district went from delivering a nearly 24-point victory for Republican Mitt Romney in 2012, to a bare victory of 1 percent by Trump last fall.\n\nRepublicans are betting that Trump\u2019s performance in the Price district, along with dozens of others that were previously GOP strongholds in presidential elections, is an outlier and that voter behavior there will revert to traditional norms without Trump on the ballot.\n\nAll of which makes it very difficult, for both parties, to nail down precisely which set of House seats are truly competitive with 2018 on the horizon.\n\nThis Trump-driven volatility became clear in last week\u2019s release of the Cook Political Report\u2019s Partisan Voter Index, a data-driven look at all 435 House districts that is the equivalent of the political Bible for many Washington insiders.\n\nHow Donald Trump redrew the political map\n\nThe top-line figures reinforce the steady trend of fewer and fewer competitive districts as most voters continue to pull the lever for one party and not split their tickets. There are now 72 House districts where the average presidential performance swings between both parties with a margin of 5 percent, down from 90 seats four years ago. That\u2019s less than half as many competitive seats as there were 20 years ago.\n\nTrump won 230 House districts, while Mitt Romney won 226 of them as the Republican nominee in 2012.\n\nBut beneath the surface, Trump\u2019s nationalist, \u201cAmerica first\u201d campaign scrambled coalitions and busted up the electorate.\n\nTake Price\u2019s seat. After the 2012 elections, Price was considered to hold the 77th most Republican district in the nation, placing him in the top third of most conservative-leaning seats among Republican House members. After the 2016 results, taking Trump\u2019s performance there into account and averaging it with Romney\u2019s, Georgia\u2019s 4th District is now the 165th most Republican seat, the Cook report estimates. That puts it in the bottom third, conservatively speaking, of the House GOP conference \u2014 quite a switch.\n\nFurther, the Cook analysis found that 36 House districts switched their partisan preference for presidential candidates, including 21 that previously voted for Barack Obama in 2012 and switched to Trump four years later.\n\nOne of those seats belongs to Rep. Cheri Bustos (D), whose western Illinois district went overwhelmingly for Obama, by almost 16 percentage points, in 2012. Four years later, those voters responded to Trump\u2019s message, delivering him a narrow victory in that district.\n\nIt\u2019s a district that is dramatically different from Price\u2019s old seat in the Atlanta suburbs. Bustos\u2019s territory contains voters with a median household income of $45,000, and less than 19 percent of residents have a college degree.\n\nTrump created volatility all across the map.\n\nAccording to a study by Daily Kos Elections, 119 of the 435 House districts saw a swing of at least 10 percent from the 2012 presidential race to the 2016 contest, a dramatic change over four years.\n\nIn Southern California, Reps. Mimi Walters (R) and Dana Rohrabacher (R) have never faced a difficult reelection contest. In the 2012 presidential race, Romney won their districts by the same big margin, 55 percent to 43 percent. Yet Trump lost both of those districts four years later.\n\nIf the electorate looks next year as it used to look, these two Republicans will again cruise to reelection \u2014 and Republicans will win the Georgia special election.\n\nBut if 2016 was a true turning point, there\u2019s a whole new slate of seats that will see competitive races next year.\n\nRead more from Paul Kane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/04/12/if-the-kansas-shift-happened-nationally-democrats-would-have-a-stranglehold-on-the-house/", "text": "Republican Ron Estes won a closely-watched congressional race in Kansas on April 11, marking the first special election for a House seat vacated by a Republican since Trump took office. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s enthusiastic tweet about the results of the special election in Kansas\u2019s 4th Congressional District on Tuesday \u2014 a \u201cgreat win\u201d that was accomplished \u201ceasily\u201d \u2014 ignored the reality of the situation. In a district that now-CIA Director Mike Pompeo won by more than 30 points last year and which Trump himself won by 27 points, the Republican winner, Ron Estes, was victorious by less than seven percentage points.\n\nThat\u2019s a significant shift, that can be attributed to a lot of factors. But with other special elections looming, it\u2019s worth reinforcing how dramatically bad such a shift would be for Republicans nationally. If, for example, that shift from Pompeo\u2019s vote were applied to the 2016 House election results, the national map would move from a sea of dark red to something more like this:\n\nThe math here isn\u2019t complicated. The 2016 House results were distributed like this, according to data from the Associated Press. (In a number of districts, candidates ran unopposed; they\u2019re marked in lighter color.)\n\nThat gives us the current Republican majority in the House.\n\nIf we were to shift the margin in each of those contested races in favor of the Democrats by the 25.2-point margin by which Pompeo outperformed Estes, the House suddenly becomes very, very Democratic.\n\n(We left the uncontested contests unchanged, for obvious reasons.)\n\nOf course, Pompeo was an incumbent, so we would expect him to do better than a less well-known Republican. We do have data on a political neophyte\u2019s performance in that district recently, though: Donald Trump. According to the Daily Kos\u2019 breakdown of the 2016 presidential results by congressional district, Pompeo did several percentage points better than Trump. (Trump did worse than the Republican candidate in nearly two-thirds of the 435 House districts. In 214 districts with Republican incumbents, Trump outperformed the incumbent in only 27, according to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Harry Enten.)\n\nIt\u2019s tricky to extrapolate outward from Trump\u2019s margins in each district to House results, since Trump won some congressional districts that were held by Democrats. If we simply treat the presidential results as eliminating Pompeo\u2019s incumbency, and assume that a non-Pompeo would have done about as well as Trump \u2014 certainly not a perfectly fair assumption \u2014 then we\u2019d expect Estes to have done about 20.4 points better than he did.\n\nIf we apply that shift to the House results? A smaller Democratic dominance.\n\nThis thought experiment will not come to fruition for a variety of reasons: Special elections are weird things, and individual races are colored by a lot of things beyond national temperament. (The race in Kansas was also affected by complex politics at the state level.) Whether or not this holds nationally will be tested next week in Georgia\u2019s 6th District, where there\u2019s another special election. It\u2019s safe to assume that the margins will be less dramatic.\n\nBut a sharp shift to the left in even deep-red parts of the country has obvious implications for the GOP that this experiment simply lays bare: the potential for a electoral disaster.\n\nWhich, in a nutshell, is why the victory in Kansas was not, for Republicans, \u201cgreat.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/conway-critiques-the-press-on-twitter-use-and-selectivity-in-reporting/2017/04/12/eb46b41e-1f93-11e7-bb59-a74ccaf1d02f_video.html", "text": "- Kellyanne Conway attacked the press coverage of President Trump during an event at the Newseum on April 12, saying that, \"people will go find the news if they can't find it in the news.\" ()"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/trump-tells-fox-how-he-ordered-strikes-on-syria-over-dessert-with-xi/2017/04/12/bcec620e-1f8d-11e7-bb59-a74ccaf1d02f_video.html", "text": "- President Trump told Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo on April 12, that his order to send airstrikes against a Syrian airfield took place during dessert with Chinese President Xi at Mar-a-Lago, as Xi ate, \"the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you've ever seen.\" ()"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/how-trumps-federal-hiring-freeze-works/2017/01/24/bada553a-e265-11e6-a419-eefe8eff0835_video.html", "text": "- A federal hiring freeze that President Trump implemented as one of his first acts in office is being lifted.

In a victory speech, Estes told voters he\u2019d \u201crepeal and replace Obamacare\u201d and fight for a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution.\n\n\u201cRepublicans emerged victorious in the first contested special election of the 2018 cycle,\u201d said National Republican Congressional Committee chairman Steve Stivers, a congressman from Ohio.\n\nWith 99 percent of ballots counted, Estes led Democrat James Thompson, a lawyer making his first bid for office, by 8 points. Last year, Pompeo won reelection by 31 points in a race Democrats did not seriously contest.\n\n\u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t say this, Mr. Estes did not beat us,\u201d said Thompson at his election-night party. \u201cIt took a president of the United States, the vice president, the speaker of the House, a senator coming into our state, and a bunch of lies to try and drum up a vote.\u201d\n\nDemocrat James Thompson, a candidate for Kansas' 4th Congressional District, speaks during a debate in Wichita, Kan. (Bo Rader/AP)\n\nKansas Republicans\u2019 resilience dashed Democratic hopes \u2014 which surged over the weekend \u2014 of slicing into the majority of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.). It also may dampen that party\u2019s hopes of performing well in the three House seats vacated by Republicans who joined the Trump administration \u2014 most significantly in Georgia, where Democrat Jon Ossoff is leading in the April 18 contest to replace Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price against a crowded field of GOP candidates.\n\nYet holding the 4th Congressional District \u2014 which Trump captured by 27 points in November, and is the home to Koch Industries \u2014 took more work, and money, than Republicans had expected. Thompson easily won voters who cast their ballots early and was poised to carry Wichita\u2019s Sedgwick County, which Trump won by 18 points.\n\nIn the campaign\u2019s final weekend, the NRCC spent close to $100,000 on the race, and the GOP-allied Congressional Leadership Fund super PAC paid for tens of thousands of get-out-the-vote phone calls. President Trump even recorded a call for the Republican and sent an Election Day tweet calling Estes a \u201cwonderful guy\u201d who would help him on \u201cHealthcare & Tax Cuts (Reform).\u201d\n\nThe victory helped House Republicans retain a 23-seat advantage over Democrats, despite entering the two-week recess short on their major legislative goals. Estes did not focus on Trump in his race, and though he is expected to be a reliable vote for Republicans in the House \u2014 he said on Monday he would not join either right-wing or moderate caucuses \u2014 he had criticized the GOP health-care bill that was pulled before the congressional recess.\n\nThompson, a 46-year-old U.S. Army veteran who had caucused for Bernie Sanders, fought a stronger-than-expected race that Democrats said would put more races on the map in 2018.\n\nBut progressives were critical of the party for letting the race play out without a major investment. \u201cWe lose when we don\u2019t fight, period,\u201d said Neil Sroka, a spokesman for the progressive group Democracy for America, in a tweet.\n\nWithout the boogeyman of the Obama administration, and without the threat of Hillary Clinton picking a judge to fill an open Supreme Court seat, Republicans resorted to arguing that Thompson would use constituents\u2019 tax money to fund abortions. Until it finally spent some money on get-out-the-vote calls, the DCCC stayed away for fear that it would nationalize the race.\n\nThe contest began with Pompeo\u2019s Jan. 23 departure from Congress, which attracted little national attention until the start of April. The Cook Political Report marked the race as \u201csafe\u201d for Republicans, downgrading the party\u2019s chances only after the final weekend\u2019s scramble.\n\nInside the district, however, both parties saw early potential for an upset. Estes, a businessman who entered politics in 2004, had only ever won landslides in the 4th District for state office.\n\nBut in Topeka, the state capital, he became associated with a Republican governing team that has presided over a weak economic recovery and a series of budget deficits. Democrats \u2014 and increasingly, voters \u2014 came to blame Gov. Sam Brownback\u2019s supply-side tax cuts, which ate into the state\u2019s revenue.\n\nIn 2016, as Republicans won across the country, the party lost ground in Kansas. Democrats gained 12 seats in the state House and one seat in the state Senate, after moderate anti-Brownback Republicans defeated conservatives in a series of primaries. On Election Day, Trump carried the 4th District easily \u2014 but Republicans lost three of their party\u2019s state House seats.\n\nThe Democratic Party, meanwhile, underwent an evolution of its own. Sanders crushed Hillary Clinton here in the 2016 caucuses, and many Sanders activists stayed inside the party to win leadership positions. When Pompeo\u2019s seat opened, former state treasurer Dennis McKinney \u2014 who was defeated in 2010 by Estes \u2014 was initially seen as the Democratic front-runner. But the antiabortion McKinney lost a tight party contest to the pro-abortion rights, economically populist Thompson.\n\nWhile Estes was tied up in Topeka working on the controversial state budget, Thompson barnstormed the district.\n\nIn the final 24 hours of the race, the Democrat attended a Seder with Jewish voters, recorded a \u201cthank you\u201d video for volunteers, shook hands at a breakfast for Learjet retirees, and (through a translator) sat for an interview with Wichita\u2019s Spanish-language radio station. Estes rallied with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and the national political director of the Chamber of Commerce, then cast his vote.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/crowd-shouts-you-lie-at-rep-wilson-who-shouted-same-words-at-obama-in-2009/2017/04/11/aa1e10dc-1f1a-11e7-bb59-a74ccaf1d02f_video.html", "text": "- At Rep.

He called the restructuring \u2014 laid out in a 14-page memo \u2014 a \u201csmarter plan, a more strategic plan, a more surgical plan\u201d to rein in a bureaucracy that President Trump has called too big and bloated.\n\nBy following a budget the president proposed in March that calls for drastic cuts across most of the government, Mulvaney said some agencies such as the Defense Department and Veterans Affairs will add staff, while others, like the Environmental Protection Agency, will \u201cend up paring\u201d full-time employees \u201ceven greater than they would have . . . during the hiring freeze.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe executive branch of government has never been rebuilt,\u201d Mulvaney said, claiming this effort will be more far-reaching than those of previous administrations.\n\n(Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post)\n\nBut lawmakers have a significant say in how much money is provided to federal agencies and many \u2014 including Republicans \u2014 object to Trump\u2019s proposed budget cuts. Many large-scale changes to the government \u2014 for example, a consolidation of offices with similar missions \u2014 would have to be approved by Congress.\n\nTrump has asked the White House to \u201cstart from scratch\u201d and intends to solicit ideas not just from business leaders but also from the public, Mulvaney said.\n\nThe White House is requiring agencies to improve the effectiveness and accountability of their employees, by rewarding high performers and clearing a straighter path to take action against poor ones.\n\nMulvaney was careful not to specify how much the White House wants to cut the workforce of 2.1 million civil servants, saying it will be up to agencies to determine where they find duplicative or \u201cnonessential\u201d programs or services that can be provided instead by state or local governments or private companies. He also declined to specify whether layoffs, buyouts or early retirement offers would be on the table. Personnel and budget experts say these are inevitable and will be costly to put in place.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be some places where they have the ability to reduce size immediately and they may be called upon to do that in order to line up with the president\u2019s priorities,\u201d Mulvaney said of agency leaders. \u201cThere may be other places where they don\u2019t have that flexibility, and they\u2019ll have to figure out a way over the course of time to, through ordinary attrition, to get to where they need to be.\u201d\n\nBased on Trump\u2019s spending plan, some agencies would see cuts of more than 20 percent \u2014 and the State Department would be 29 percent; EPA, 31 percent \u2014 in hits that would fundamentally alter their missions.\n\nWhite House officials have said that more should be done to shift operations to private-sector companies.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many new hires were halted by the freeze, which over the two-and-half months it was in effect exempted bigger swaths of the government as lawmakers complained and agency heads became concerned about hurting their day-to-day operations without replacing departing staff.\n\nDemocrats oppose the proposed cuts and have pushed back against Trump\u2019s calls for reducing the federal workforce. Many Republicans have said there should be major budget cuts, but others oppose the across-the-board reductions. For example, a number of Republicans have opposed big cuts at the State Department and agencies that deliver foreign aid, saying this will hurt national security.\n\nThe federal government is expected to spend $4.091 trillion in the year that begins Oct. 1, but around 70 percent of that will go toward Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, interest on the debt and other programs that must be funded.\n\nThe remaining funds \u2014 roughly half of which go to the military \u2014 must be approved by Congress each year. The federal workforce is largely funded through these appropriations, and congressional approval for any plan is likely necessary before the major changes by the Trump administration.\n\nThe White House push comes during a delicate point in negotiations on Capitol Hill. Congressional leaders are trying to reach an agreement to fund the government after the end of April.\n\nIf Democrats believe the Trump administration will seek a major cut in the federal workforce, they could harden their stance with Republicans seeking other cuts. Likewise, many Republicans may be torn between backing the White House plan, which outlines the leaner government for which GOP rhetoric has long called. The support of several dozen Democrats will likely be necessary for the short-term spending bill to pass the House later this month.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-administration-suspends-public-disclosures-of-sanctuary-cities/2017/04/11/7ea7f078-1ec8-11e7-ad74-3a742a6e93a7_story.html", "text": "The Trump administration has temporarily suspended the publication of weekly reports detailing cities and counties that refuse to honor federal immigration detainers over concerns about the accuracy of those lists.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which began making the lists public last month, is reviewing its reporting methodology after several law enforcement agencies complained that they were erroneously included in the report.\n\n\u201cWhile this analysis is ongoing, the publication of [the report] will be temporarily suspended,\u201d said Sarah Rodriguez, a deputy press secretary at ICE. She added that the agency expects to resume publication after the review is completed, but she did not specify a time frame.\n\n\u201cICE remains committed to publishing the most accurate information available regarding declined detainers across the country,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nICE began publicizing the list of jurisdictions after President Trump signed a pair of executive orders in January to ramp up immigration arrests and deportations at the southern U.S. border and inside the country.\n\nTo that end, Trump directed federal officials to publish a weekly list of declined detainers and the immigrants who were released by so-called sanctuary cities. He also threatened to block some federal grant funding to those cities that fail to comply with federal detainer notices for immigrants subject to deportation. Administration officials have said immigrants who commit crimes but are released pose a serious threat.\n\nBut the weekly lists included in the Declined Detainer Outcome Report contained several errors that rankled local law enforcement officials. For instance, one report incorrectly claimed that Franklin County in Iowa, Franklin County in New York, Franklin County in Pennsylvania and Montgomery County in Iowa had ignored immigration detainers they had never received.\n\nWilliamson and Bastrop counties in Texas, Chester County in Pennsylvania and Richmond County in North Carolina were also incorrectly included in the list.\n\nOn Tuesday, an official said the errors were a main reason they suspended the report.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve identified that there have been some data-processing errors,\u201d said David Lapan, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE. \u201cThat\u2019s why the decision was made: Let\u2019s take a pause and make sure that we look at this holistically and make sure that we\u2019re getting it as accurate as possible.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the report\u2019s suspension would not affect the Justice Department\u2019s plans to withhold federal grant money from sanctuary cities.\n\nBut that timeline is unclear, Lapan said, because the agencies have not agreed on a definition of the term \u201csanctuary.\u201d\n\nMark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors restrictions on immigration, said the report could be a valuable tool for Trump.\n\n\u201cI think they got out of the gate quicker and they weren\u2019t quite ready yet,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to go back and set up a more systematic way of gathering the information. I don\u2019t have any doubt they will. It just will take a while.\u201d\n\nBut the American Civil Liberties Union, which considers immigration detainers unconstitutional, said it hoped that ICE would not issue the report again.\n\n\u201cThe ACLU is pleased the administration has halted these deeply flawed and misleading reports,\u201d staff attorney Cody Wofsy said in a statement. \u201cIt should reconsider its entire campaign of bullying localities for their lawful and responsible choices.\u201d\n\nSome cities have passed laws that restrict the collection of citizenship status by local law enforcement, citing concerns that immigrants who have committed relatively minor infractions, such as traffic violations, could be harassed or deported.\n\nThe Trump administration has listed scores of jurisdictions \u2014 including in Virginia, Maryland, California and Texas \u2014 that have allegedly not cooperated with federal authorities.\n\nBut last month, Seattle sued the administration over Trump\u2019s executive order on sanctuary cities, calling it unconstitutional.\n\nRodriguez said the publication of weekly lists \u201chas already sparked important conversations between ICE and law enforcement agencies across the nation, and the revised report will add to this discussion.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/partisan-battles-over-nominees-pose-real-danger-for-supreme-court-chief-justice-says/2017/04/11/62e89c2c-1ee9-11e7-a0a7-8b2a45e3dc84_story.html", "text": "Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said Tuesday that the Supreme Court has gone about its work in a \u201ccompletely nonpartisan way\u201d since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, but that the bitter political battle waged over confirming Scalia\u2019s replacement poses a \u201creal danger\u201d for the court.\n\nAt a question-and-answer session at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, university President Shirley Ann Jackson asked Roberts about the \u201cextremely partisan confirmation process\u201d that saw Senate Republicans refuse to consider President Barack Obama\u2019s choice of Judge Merrick Garland, and Democrats\u2019 attempt to block President Trump\u2019s choice of newly confirmed Justice Neil M. Gorsuch.\n\n\u201cI want to point out one thing \u2014 that throughout this whole process, the Supreme Court has been quietly going about its business of deciding the cases before it, according to the Constitution, in a completely nonpartisan way,\u201d Robert said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it for the past 14 months with one vacancy, and we\u2019ll do it going in the future now that we have a full complement.\u201d\n\nBut he added: \u201cIt is a real danger that the partisan hostility that people see in the political branches will affect the nonpartisan activity of the judicial branch. It is very difficult I think for a member of the public to look at what goes on in confirmation hearings these days, which is a very sharp conflict in political terms between Democrats and Republicans, and not think that the person who comes out of that process must similarly share that partisan view of public issues and public life.\u201d\n\nIt is a familiar stance for Roberts, but one he has had to repeat more often as Supreme Court confirmation votes for his new colleagues follow party lines. It is also one for which he is criticized by some.\n\nThe court\u2019s rulings on major issues often conclude with the five members appointed by Republican presidents on one side, and the four nominated by Democrats on the other. The same is true on high-profile cases in federal courts around the country, where judges routinely divide along the lines of the party of the president who nominated them.\n\nBut Roberts insisted that judges shed political leanings when they join the bench.\n\n\u201cThe new justice is not a Republican, not a Democrat, he is a member of the Supreme Court,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cBut it is hard for people to understand that when they see the process that leads up to it.\u201d\n\nOn other issues, Roberts repeated that he opposed allowing televised coverage of the Supreme Court and that having life tenure for federal judges is \u201cincredibly important for what we do.\u201d\n\nOne suggestion about reducing the political importance of Supreme Court nominations is having justices serve for a set number of years. Roberts was not asked specifically about that. But he said not having to worry about public approval was essential for judges to protect constitutional rights.\n\nHe mentioned a case involving the Westboro Baptist Church, the group that protests military funerals and blames natural disasters on society\u2019s tolerance of gay rights. Roberts said the group\u2019s speech is \u201cabsolutely hateful,\u201d but also protected by the Constitution, which is what he wrote for a nearly unanimous court in 2011.\n\n\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t had life tenure and had to stand for election the next year, I wouldn\u2019t vote for me,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked about cameras in the courtroom, Roberts agreed that televised coverage of the court would lead to a greater understanding of how it operates. \u201cOur job, however, is not to educate the public,\u201d but to decide cases, he said.\n\nOral arguments are free-flowing affairs where justices \u201cfollow along with the dynamic,\u201d not worrying about how a hypothetical or sharp question will sound. If the justices had to think about how the public might judge a sound bite, he said, \u201cwe might end up talking like they do in Congress.\u201d\n\nRoberts noted that it was unusual for him to be making an appearance at a college like Rensselaer, dedicated to instruction on technology, science, engineering and mathematics. The link is that Jackson serves on the Smithsonian\u2019s board of regents, which Roberts heads because of his position as chief justice.\n\nTo prepare, he said, he looked for connections to science among his 16 predecessors as chief justice. \u201cAs it turns out, there are very few,\u201d he said. His own contribution, he said, will be giving this speech."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-promised-an-unpredictable-foreign-policy-to-allies-it-looks-incoherent/2017/04/11/21acde5e-1a3d-11e7-9887-1a5314b56a08_story.html", "text": "President Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel participate in a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House on March. 17.

But in some cases, those sessions have only heightened doubts that Trump has a clear sense of what direction he intends to take U.S. foreign policy.\n\nFew if any world leaders, for example, have had as much experience in dealing with U.S. presidents as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is on her third.\n\nDuring their White House meeting last month, Merkel tried to pin down Trump on one of the top concerns of U.S. trading partners: a proposed \u201cborder adjustment tax\u201d to be imposed on imported goods. Publicly, Trump has signaled an openness to the idea, but he also said it has drawbacks.\n\nPresident Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping walk at the Mar-a-Lago estate in West Palm Beach, Fla., on April 7.

But Trump adds to that a freestyle approach to international relations. He has a disregard for norms and protocol, an impulsive nature and a tendency toward making contradictory statements.\n\nCompounding the chaos is the fact that those who claim to speak for Trump \u2014 Cabinet officials and top White House advisers \u2014 also have offered conflicting pronouncements on basic questions about the direction of U.S. policy.\n\n[With both the U.S. and North Korea saber rattling, is conflict imminent?]\n\nPresident Trump and Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II hold a news conference in the Rose Garden of the White House on April 5.

And by Tuesday, Trump was engaging in diplomacy via Twitter.\n\n\u201cI explained to the President of China that a trade deal with the U.S. will be far better for them if they solve the North Korean problem!\u201d he tweeted, suggesting that national security concerns might override his long-standing promise to crack down on Chinese trade practices.\n\nFour minutes later, Trump followed with another tweet suggesting he might be leaning toward unilateral action: \u201cNorth Korea is looking for trouble. If China decides to help, that would be great. If not, we will solve the problem without them! U.S.A.\u201d\n\nIn interviews over the past few weeks with a half-dozen foreign ambassadors based in Washington, most complained \u2014 diplomatically, of course \u2014 that thin lines of communication have made it difficult for them to explain U.S. intentions to officials in their home capitals. That is creating strain on traditionally solid alliances, they said.\n\n\u201cNobody can tell us on Russia what the American policy is, on Syria what the American policy is, on China what the American policy is,\u201d one ambassador said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure there is a policy. They will listen to me and tell me, \u2018We will get back to you when there is a policy.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe ambassadors spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid straining relations with the new administration. Or as one put it: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be too hard on them at the very beginning.\u201d\n\nThe diplomats said the problem was partly caused by a new administration still in transition and focused on health care, tax reform and other domestic issues. But as the weeks have passed, allies are growing more concerned that limited communication could lead to misunderstandings if a diplomatic or security crisis erupted somewhere in the world.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen,\u201d one said. \u201cYou had a president who took three months to take a decision, and now you have one who takes three seconds. It\u2019s very worrying.\u201d\n\n[Trump confronts the contradictions of his foreign policy rhetoric]\n\nSeveral diplomats said that early Trump meetings with Merkel, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and British Prime Minister Theresa May also raised concerns over Trump\u2019s unorthodox style of working largely without detailed notes and speaking off the cuff.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a paper in front of him. . . . It\u2019s up to the visitor to declare the agenda,\u201d one said. \u201cHe just sits there. It\u2019s like you are in a bar, and you just start talking to him.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials insist that the president has been fully briefed before his meetings with foreign leaders, and that adequate advance work has been done in bilateral sessions that precede them.\n\nBut they also note that the specifics of Trump administration policy are still a work in progress.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the early days. A lot of this stuff hasn\u2019t been worked through,\u201d said Michael Anton, who runs communications for the National Security Council.\n\nTrump\u2019s priority in these early meetings with foreign leaders, Anton added, is \u201crelationship-building, airing the issues.\u201d\n\nWhile some diplomats and leaders puzzle over how to decode an opaque and often contradictory presidency, they have figured out one language to which Trump responds: flattery.\n\nIn his joint appearance with Trump, Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II lathered the president with praise for a \u201cholistic approach\u201d to the Middle East, which he said is \u201ca move in the right direction.\u201d\n\nIt was their second meeting since Trump\u2019s election, and Trump returned the compliments, calling Abdullah a \u201cwarrior.\u201d Their joint news conference was the first of Trump\u2019s presidency to be held in the Rose Garden.\n\n[Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spends his first weeks isolated from an anxious bureaucracy]\n\nOutside of choreographed photo ops, the day-to-day situation is far different.\n\nSeveral envoys described frustration at the slow pace of appointments to critical jobs, especially in the State Department, which has sometimes left them struggling to get even the most basic information.\n\n\u201cWhen you reach out to them, it\u2019s like you are reaching out to a body that has a head and legs but no torso. The blood is not flowing from above to below,\u201d one said.\n\nState Department spokesman R.C. Hammond said that a transition is underway that will \u201ccontinue on for many months.\u201d He added that both Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson are determined to find a new way of conducting international relations because the old one was not working.\n\n\u201cPeople are starting to learn the new language,\u201d Hammond said of foreign diplomats who deal with the State Department. \u201cThey should be encouraged, because there\u2019s great opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe ambassadors said communication with the Pentagon and the National Security Council is better, and they uniformly expressed respect for national security adviser H.R. McMaster and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. But even at those agencies, they said, information on U.S. economic, trade and security policy is often hard to get.\n\nAnother channel is Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, to whom diplomats are turning for information on economic policy, including the border adjustment tax.\n\nCohn has been responsive and seems to have the president\u2019s ear, one diplomat said. \u201cFor us, he\u2019s been the guy.\u201d\n\nIf a foreign policy crisis were to flare, perhaps over North Korea or Iran, several ambassadors expressed worry that the lack of the usual contacts at many levels of government could keep them from being able to fully explain Trump\u2019s actions to their leaders back home.\n\n[Trump talked tough about China but is now struggling to deliver on his trade promises]\n\nOne ambassador said that when he approached the State Department and the White House recently, he was told to come back if he has an emergency to discuss.\n\nSeveral added that they have tried to be creative in their approaches to the Trump administration, increasingly going outside the normal channels. Some said they have tried to leverage friendships with people in business who have ties to Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner or daughter Ivanka Trump to get access to those key members of Trump\u2019s inner circle.\n\nWhat entree exists is generally limited to ambassadors talking to top White House officials, without the traditional bureaucrat-to-bureaucrat relations at lower levels where work is usually conducted.\n\n\u201cI have never had trouble getting access,\u201d one ambassador said. \u201cBut when we have visitors below the top levels, like members of parliament, we can\u2019t find interlocutors for them.\u201d\n\nThe envoys said Trump has made efforts to create ties with the foreign diplomatic corps, including many at the Mar-a-Lago for the Red Cross Ball on Feb. 4.\n\nBut they said the transition period had been unlike any they had ever seen.\n\n\u201cThe question is: Will the close allies maintain that same natural cooperation that we have had for 70 years?\u201d one ambassador said. \u201cThe leaders of those allies want to maintain a relationship of trust with the traditional leader of the Western world. But today we have the impression that the chair of the leader of the Western world is a little bit empty.

Gorsuch took his oaths to be the Supreme Court\u2019s 113th justice Monday morning, first in a private ceremony at the court and later at a Rose Garden ceremony with the man who nominated him, President Trump.\n\nAt the first event, in a grand room inside the Supreme Court, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. administered the oath that all federal employees take. The other justices and most of their spouses were on hand, as well as Maureen Scalia and Eugene Scalia, the widow and son of the justice Gorsuch is replacing, Antonin Scalia.\n\nGorsuch\u2019s wife, Louise, held a family Bible, and his daughters, Emma and Belinda, looked on.\n\nOn a sunny spring day in the White House Rose Garden, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, for whom the 49-year-old Gorsuch once served as a clerk, led him through a second oath that justices take to impartially interpret the laws \u201cand do equal right to the poor and to the rich.\u201d\n\nGorsuch\u2019s swearing-in is the conclusion of a nearly 14-month process to fill Scalia\u2019s seat, with Republicans winning a bitter battle to ensure that his replacement was a like-minded disciple who would restore a conservative majority on the court for years to come.\n\n(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\n[Gorsuch confirmed to Supreme Court]\n\nA Marine Corps string quartet played softly in the Rose Garden as the Trump West Wing poured in to watch history.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a privilege to have you here to join in this historic moment on this very beautiful spring day,\u201d Trump said to Gorsuch. \u201cSpring is really the perfect backdrop for this joyful gathering of friends because together we are in a process of reviewing and renewing and also rebuilding our country.\u201d\n\nTrump, whose young White House has been roiled by turmoil and infighting, seemed eager to celebrate Gorsuch\u2019s appointment \u2014 one of his first clear victories, and one of particular importance to his base and the Republican establishment generally.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always heard that the most important thing that a president of the United States does is appoint people, hopefully great people like this appointment, to the United States Supreme Court, and I can say this is a great honor,\u201d the president said, before straying from his teleprompter remarks and ad-libbing a bit of praise for himself.\n\n\u201cAnd I got it done in the first 100 days,\u201d he said, to laughter. \u201cYou think that\u2019s easy?\u201d\n\nBoth Trump and Gorsuch, in their remarks, noted the historic nature of Kennedy swearing in his former law clerk. \u201cThat\u2019s sort of a big deal, isn\u2019t it?\u201d the president said. \u201cThat\u2019s sort of good.\u201d\n\n1 of 0 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Photos: Gorsuch takes oath as Supreme Court justice View Photos Neil M.

The Republican-controlled Senate did away with the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees to confirm Gorsuch. Democrats said they consider the seat \u201cstolen\u201d because Republicans had refused to act on President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee for the court, Judge Merrick Garland.\n\nGorsuch will be put to work immediately. The court meets privately Thursday to consider cases for the next term. On the list is a plea that the court decide whether the Second Amendment grants a right to carry firearms outside the home. Another case asks whether businesses may refuse to provide wedding services to same-sex couples.\n\nNext week, the court begins its last round of oral arguments for the term. Gorsuch, who in the past has defended the rights of religious objectors to laws they say violate their beliefs, could be the deciding vote in a major \u201cseparation of church and state\u201d case from Missouri.\n\n[Gorsuch could have an immediate impact on Supreme Court]\n\nIt is possible the court may reveal that it is deadlocked on several cases it has heard this term. The court, with four liberals nominated by Democratic presidents and four mostly conservative justices picked by Republicans, would schedule rehearings in those cases so Gorsuch could break the ties.\n\nAnd in a matter of weeks, the court might be called upon to get involved in Trump\u2019s second travel ban targeting refugees and people entering the United States from certain countries.\n\nIn some ways, Gorsuch is the prototypical justice. He is the 109th man among the 113 justices in the court\u2019s history. All but two of the men were white. He is a favorite of the conservative legal establishment and has family roots in Republican politics.\n\nLike five of his colleagues, Gorsuch attended Harvard Law School; the others went to Yale. He was hired as a Supreme Court clerk by fellow Coloradan Justice Byron White. Because White had retired by then, Gorsuch was loaned to Kennedy for the 1993-94 term.\n\nHe becomes the first former clerk to serve on the court alongside his boss.\n\n[Gorsuch clerked for Kennedy, but hearings show he\u2019s more like Scalia]\n\nGorsuch is different in other ways. Coming from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, he is the court\u2019s only Westerner. Kennedy and Justice Stephen G. Breyer are native Californians, but as Scalia once wrote in an opinion listing the court\u2019s lack of geographic diversity, \u201cCalifornia does not count.\u201d\n\nHe also provides the court with something it has lacked since 2010: a Protestant. Gorsuch was raised as a Catholic, but he and his family attend an Episcopal church in Boulder. He joins five Catholics and three Jews on the court.\n\nTrump is anxious to celebrate Gorsuch\u2019s success because it is one of the few clear accomplishments of his administration so far, uniting Republicans. But the work was mostly done by outside groups and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\n\nGorsuch was identified as a candidate for the court on a list supplied to the Trump campaign by the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, conservative organizations. Trump promised during the presidential campaign to choose Scalia\u2019s successor from the 21 names on the list, in an effort to convince conservatives of the kind of Supreme Court nominations he would make \u2014 an issue of utmost importance to them.\n\nDuring the confirmation process, Gorsuch said he was first contacted about his candidacy not by the White House but by Leonard Leo, a high-ranking Federalist Society official.\n\nIn the months since Trump chose him after a private interview, Gorsuch has been introduced on Capitol Hill by Kelly Ayotte, the onetime senator from New Hampshire who lost her reelection bid in November.\n\nHis consideration by the Senate was aided by a $10 million campaign by the Judicial Crisis Network, a group closely aligned with other conservative organizations that defended Gorsuch\u2019s record and targeted Democratic senators in states won by Trump. The group does not disclose its donors, and Democrats during the hearing decried the \u201cdark money\u201d being used to promote Gorsuch."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/how-a-scandal-brought-down-the-alabama-governor/2017/04/10/407f51de-1e4f-11e7-bb59-a74ccaf1d02f_video.html", "text": "Trump says the U.S. 'has enough roles' in the world"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/in-kansas-a-close-congressional-race-surprises-republicans/2017/04/10/8f0085e8-1e05-11e7-ad74-3a742a6e93a7_story.html", "text": "As James Thompson worked his way through a coffee shop, the Democratic candidate for Congress said something that got people to look up from their laptops.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lead right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d said Marla Flentje, a Republican who said she\u2019d voted for him in early balloting.\n\nA trio of Democrats walked over to meet Thompson and tell him they\u2019d vote Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI hope you do, because right now, we\u2019re winning,\u201d said Thompson.\n\nRepublican Ron Estes, left, Kansas state treasurer, and Democrat James Thompson, a civil rights lawyer, are competing to replace Rep. Mike Pompeo in a special election in Kansas. Pompeo is now CIA director. (Wichita Eagle via AP)\n\nThompson was not supposed to win \u2014 or even come close \u2014 in this largely rural 4th District, which picked Donald Trump for president by 27 points. Rep. Mike Pompeo (R) vacated the seat to lead the CIA, and Republicans expected to hold it easily.\n\nBut in the final days before Tuesday\u2019s special election, Republicans reacted to weak polling and turnout data by rushing resources to southern Kansas. A GOP super PAC rolled out robo-calls over the weekend from Vice President Pence, and on Monday from President Trump, in support of candidate Ron Estes.\n\n\u201cRon Estes needs your vote and needs it badly,\u201d Trump said on the call. \u201cRon is going to be helping us, big league.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Republicans also dispatched Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) for a fly-in, where he urged Kansans to vote \u201cif you\u2019re fed up with the stagnation under the Obama economy.\u201d\n\nLate Monday, the national House Democratic campaign arm announced that it was calling 25,000 households to counter the GOP influx. Readers of the liberal Daily Kos donated a total of $149,000 to Thompson over the final weekend.\n\nThis \u2014 the home town of Koch Industries \u2014 is the last place the GOP expected to have to undertake a rescue mission. The Kansas seat is one of the reddest of the five House seats vacated in the Trump era, four of them by Republicans who joined the new administration. If Thompson ends up winning here, the national Democratic Party will claim the victory as a portent of bad things to come for Republicans in the 2018 midterms with Trump in the White House.\n\nDemocrats also have an opportunity in Georgia\u2019s 6th District, where Jon Ossoff is surging in the race to replace former congressman Tom Price (R), who is now health and human services secretary.\n\n[GOP begins to fret about holding on to Tom Price\u2019s district]\n\nIn Kansas, Thompson, a civil rights lawyer who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the 2016 presidential caucuses, flew under the radar for weeks. Meanwhile, Estes, the state treasurer, got bogged down as his party staged an unsuccessful rebellion against deeply unpopular Gov. Sam Brownback (R). Estes rarely mentions Trump, but he did reference \u201cfair trade\u201d at the Cruz rally, smoothing over an issue that divides Kansans.\n\nAs the race has tightened, Republicans, who are still favored to win Tuesday, have strained to make the election a referendum on liberalism. Brownback, invisible on the trail, didn\u2019t help matters by vetoing a bipartisan Medicaid expansion bill last month; his most favorable polling puts his job-approval rating below 25 percent, even in the 4th District.\n\nIn November, as Republicans were scoring upsets around the country, they lost three state House seats in the Wichita area. Several more-conservative Republicans lost primaries to moderate candidates.\n\n\u201cPeople here still like Trump,\u201d said Thompson, whose campaign signs identify him not as a Democrat but as an Army veteran. \u201cIt\u2019s not been a referendum on him. It\u2019s a referendum on the failed Republican leadership in the state. People don\u2019t want these policies taken to the national level.\u201d\n\nIn Wichita, where turnout in early voting has been high, Brownback\u2019s name has the force of an epithet. As she settled in for lunch at the Anchor, a downtown gastropub where Thompson stopped to shake hands, Kayla Marshall said she didn\u2019t vote in the 2016 election. She would, she said, vote for Thompson \u2014 and to explain why, she talked about teachers buying pencils with their own money because Brownback had cut the education budget.\n\nLynn Jones, who opened his door to Thompson canvassers Monday morning, was quick to say he\u2019d voted for George W. Bush. Brownback, he said, was nothing like Bush.\n\n\u201cOkay, he was trying something new with his tax cuts, but the experiment didn\u2019t work,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWhen the laboratory explodes, you probably ought to try a different formula.\u201d\n\nThompson, a first-time candidate, was generally ignored by both parties for most of the race. When his campaign asked the state Democratic Party to fund a mailer, it was turned down, later investing just $3,000. In an interview last week, Democratic National Committee Chairman Thomas Perez said the national party would not be transferring any late money.\n\n\u201cWe can make progress in Kansas,\u201d Perez said. \u201cThere are thousands of elections every year, though. Can we invest in all of them? That would require a major increase in funds.\u201d\n\nThompson spoke before Sanders at a February rally and has been endorsed by Sanders\u2019s group, Our Revolution. According to recent fundraising reports, Estes has raised $459,000 to Thompson\u2019s $292,000. Outside groups, which are pouring money into Georgia ahead of the April 18 contest there, have left Kansas alone.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats think so much of their candidate there that they\u2019ve spent zero dollars,\u201d said Corry Bliss, executive director of the Republican-allied Congressional Leadership Fund. \u201cWe\u2019ll win the Kansas election by double digits.\u201d\n\nHis group is now funding robo-calls targeting local Republicans, who outnumber Democrats but have been sluggish to turn out. The National Republican Congressional Committee has spent close to $100,000, multiplying Estes\u2019s presence on the airwaves.\n\nThompson\u2019s campaign reacted with delight to the robo-calls, viewing them as not just ineffective but as sign of his viability.\n\nBecause he\u2019s getting so little attention \u2014 no trackers from the other party were following him Monday \u2014 Thompson talked freely with a voter concerned about abortion, agreeing that society should do more to lower abortion rates. He dismissed a last-minute TV ad accusing him of favoring abortions for sex selection as representing his views to a \u201cludicrous and false extreme.\u201d His final TV spot featured him shooting an AR-15 as a narrator called him a \u201cfighter who grew up in poverty,\u201d but the National Rifle Association was not on the air to contradict him.\n\nWhat was on the air for Estes was rote \u2014 and telling of how Republicans have struggled to find a pro-Trump rallying cry. One of Estes\u2019s first commercials featured him in waders, joking that \u201cafter eight years of Obama, America is weaker and the swamp is deeper than we thought,\u201d as an alligator poked its head up for emphasis.\n\nDemocrats haven\u2019t won here since the early 1990s; then-Rep. Dan Glickman (D) was swept out by a Republican wave in 1994. Glickman vastly outspent his opponent, but the Republicans made up for it with a grass-roots surge of antiabortion activists. In 2014, when Bliss helped Sen. Pat Roberts (R) secure victory, he got a similar late-game boost from social conservatives.\n\nThose wins came when Democrats controlled the White House. On Monday, when more than 150 Republican voters piled into the Estes-Cruz rally, some wore anti-Hillary Clinton merchandise; all cheered when Cruz recalled how his \u201clips curled into a smile\u201d when he saw a Democratic colleague mourn Clinton\u2019s defeat.\n\nThe cheering was quieter when Cruz and Estes described the stakes of the election. They spoke generally about repealing the Affordable Care Act, though Estes said he opposed the GOP replacement bill that fizzled last month. Cruz talked up tax reform by staging a contrast: \u201cUnlike Obamacare, I\u2019m convinced we can get it done.\u201d\n\nEstes, meanwhile, packaged himself as an agent of common sense and disruption, without mentioning the work he\u2019d done with Brownback. \u201cI\u2019m going to Washington to change Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I go to Washington, I want to get to a balanced budget.\u201d\n\nThe Republican majority that Estes would join does not have a balanced-budget plan.\n\nIn interviews at the rally, Estes\u2019s voters said they were thrilled that Neil M. Gorsuch had been confirmed to the Supreme Court, but they had little else to say about Congress. Asked what he thought of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), John Bernhardt, who sported an early-voting sticker on a red-white-and-blue polo shirt, answered with a grimace.\n\n\u201cCan I plead the fifth?\u201d he said.\n\nJoyce Wallace, who got a plum position near the rally stage, said she had no qualms about sending a Trump ally to Washington.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all for Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he\u2019s fulfilling his campaign promises.\u201d\n\nNot every Republican at the event agreed. Cathy Dowell, who like Wallace had caucused for Cruz in 2016, worried that Trump went back on a campaign pledge by attacking a Syrian airfield.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little worried about Trump,\u201d Dowell said. \u201cI know he\u2019s not a conservative, and I think he\u2019s making a mistake in Syria.\u201d\n\nBut the two Republicans found something to agree on: Both would be happy if Carl Brewer, the Democrat who just finished two terms as mayor of Wichita, replaced Brownback in the governor\u2019s office.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/who-is-jon-ossoff/2017/04/10/66dba9c0-1e42-11e7-bb59-a74ccaf1d02f_video.html", "text": "- Jon Ossoff, a former congressional aide, is running for the seat of former Republican congressman Tom Price in Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District.

(J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nTheoretically, a bill or nomination could pass out of the Senate with the support of senators representing only 16.2 percent of the population. If the two senators from the 25 smallest states agreed to support a bill \u2014 and Vice President Pence concurred \u2014 the senators from the other 25 states and the 270 million people they represent are out of luck. (Residents of D.C., of course, are always out of luck.)\n\nGenerally speaking, though, that\u2019s not how it works. Big states and small states come from both sides of the political aisle and can vary widely in constitution, meaning that Wyoming and Rhode Island don\u2019t often land on the same side of political issues. What\u2019s more, the nature of the Senate is that its members generally pride themselves on the comity of their body. For a long time, that comity has been powered in part by the filibuster, providing a way for any senator to hold up legislation \u2014 and requiring a supermajority to get that member to be quiet.\n\nWith criticism flying about the electoral college, here's what you need to know about our system for electing the president and why the \"Hamilton electors\" don't like it. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nBut the times are changing. Last week, the Republican majority changed the rules of the filibuster to allow confirmation of Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, several years after Democrats, frustrated at not being able to approve judges of their own, changed the rules on Republicans. Those moves, coupled with the fervently partisan moment on Capitol Hill, has meant a much-less-congenial Senate \u2014 and a Senate that, by one metric, is closer to allowing outright minority rule.\n\nThis is tricky to measure, in part since the two senators from a state don\u2019t always concur. If, for example, we say that the population of a state stands in support of a bill or a nomination if either one of their senators supports it, the percentage of the U.S. population supporting each bill in every such vote since 1991 looks like this. (Data for these visualizations are from GovTrack.us and the Census Bureau.)\n\n\n\nData from GovTrack.us and the Census Bureau. (The Washington Post)\n\n(This tally starts at the outset of the 102nd Congress in 1991.)\n\nIn none of those votes did less than half of the U.S. population approve. You\u2019ll notice, though, that the results of late have often been closer to that line. (Again, because of D.C., the figure can never hit 100 percent.)\n\nThis misses a component of the vote, though: What about the senator from a state that may oppose? If we instead count a state\u2019s full population if both senators back the bill or nomination and half the population if only one does, the pattern looks like this.\n\n\n\nData from GovTrack.us and the Census Bureau. (The Washington Post)\n\nUsing this metric, there have been a number of approved bills and nominations in this Congress that have had the support of less than half the country.\n\nOn average, bills and nominations that have passed so far in 2017 (the first year of the 115th Congress) have had the support from senators representing far less of the American population than normal.\n\n\n\nData from GovTrack.us and the Census Bureau. (The Washington Post)\n\nIn 2016, an average of 95.6 percent of the population lived in a state with a senator voting for passing legislation. On the relative metric \u2014 one senator supporting equals half the population \u2014 votes were approved by senators representing 83.6 percent of the population. This year those figures are 76.3 percent and 66 percent.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason those averages are as low as they are right now. Most of the votes taken in the Senate in 2017 have been on President Trump\u2019s nominees to the Cabinet or the Supreme Court \u2014 fights that have been deeply contentious thanks to the combination of an increase in \u201cno\u201d votes on nominees and thanks to the fervent opposition from rank-and-file Democrats to the Trump administration.\n\nThat means that, as a percentage of all passing votes taken so far this year, far more have been approved by less than half the country\u2019s population (on our relative metric) than in any year prior.\n\n\n\nData from GovTrack.us and the Census Bureau. (The Washington Post)\n\nThe percentage of passing votes that get support from senators representing the vast majority of the population on our relative metric was far higher 20 years ago than in recent years.\n\n\n\nData from GovTrack.us and the Census Bureau. (The Washington Post)\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the Gorsuch nomination had support of senators representing 56.5 percent of the population, counting either senator\u2019s support as reflecting the entire population of the state \u2014 or 44.4 percent of the population on our relative metric. If you consider that latter metric a better reflection of reality, it puts Gorsuch into an unusual position: Earning a successful nomination to the bench despite his earning less than half of the support of the country \u2014 and appointed by a president who was similarly successful, thanks to the electoral college.\n\nOver the rest of the 115th Congress, it\u2019s likely that the Senate will find more votes on which it agrees, and the percentage of the population represented by passing votes will tick upward.

Some past and present government officials have argued that White House officials should be permitted to conduct meetings outside the public eye.\n\n\u201cI tend to feel it\u2019s the prerogative of the White House to have people come visit, and the public doesn\u2019t need to know who they are,\u201d said Andrew H. Card Jr., chief of staff under President George W. Bush. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a log on everybody who visits Congress, and they\u2019re a coequal branch of government.\u201d\n\nPublic access to the logs can serve as a deterrent to some \u201cprominent people\u201d who might otherwise be inclined to counsel the president, Card said. \u201cThey\u2019ll say, \u2018I\u2019d love to meet with the president, but I don\u2019t want my name to appear in a log.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNews organizations routinely used the logs, which are generated by the Secret Service, to shed light on the Obama administration. In 2012, for example, The Washington Post reported on a single day in January of that year when a steady stream of lobbyists were among the thousands of visitors to the White House and surrounding executive buildings.\n\nThe logs\u2019 existence burst back into the news last month when House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) went to the White House grounds to review intelligence reports on which he later briefed the president. Both Nunes and White House officials initially declined to say whom Nunes had visited and who had cleared him onto the grounds, information that is typically contained in the logs, along with the length of the stay.\n\nThe 2009 agreement permitted some exceptions to disclosure, including purely private visits to the Obama family, such as friends arriving for sleepovers with the president\u2019s school-age daughters. The Obama White House also maintained the prerogative not to release records of particularly \u201csensitive\u201d meetings, such as interviews with potential Supreme Court nominees.\n\nThere were also reports of attempts to get around the disclosure requirements. In 2010, for example, the New York Times reported that a Caribou Coffee location just outside the White House grounds had become a popular destination for meetings with lobbyists that wouldn\u2019t show up in the official logs.\n\nBut by and large, advocates for making the logs public say they were pleased with the Obama administration\u2019s practices.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only asking for the same Secret Service data that Obama published routinely,\u201d said Thomas S. Blanton, director of the National Security Archive, another plaintiff in the lawsuit against the government.\n\nBlanton\u2019s organization is an independent nonprofit group that collects and publishes U.S. government documents. Also joining the lawsuit is the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, a new entity that seeks to preserve and expand freedom of the press.\n\nAmong the legal questions at issue is whether White House visitor logs are controlled by the White House or the Secret Service. The distinction matters because White House records are not subject to freedom of information requests and can be shielded from public view. Executive agencies, including the Secret Service, on the other hand, are subject to the disclosure law.\n\nThe most recent court decision on the subject came in 2013, in a case in which Judicial Watch, a conservative group, sought visitor logs from the Obama administration. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the records are controlled by the White House.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason plaintiffs in the new action have chosen a different venue for their lawsuit, which is being filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The lawsuit lists the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Secret Service, as the defendant.\n\nA spokesman for the department declined to comment Sunday.\n\nThe plaintiffs say their interest in Trump visitor records extends far beyond the White House complex, given that the president often holds meetings at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and other properties he owns in the New York and Washington areas.\n\nIt is unclear what kind of records the Secret Service generates regarding members and guests at Mar-a-Lago, which is a private club, when Trump is on the property. Blanton said the agency should have a similar logging system in place there.\n\n\u201cEither they have one or they should have one,\u201d Blanton said. \u201cMaybe this lawsuit will speed up the process of getting such a system in place.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/conservatives-hope-that-trump-victory-on-gorsuch-will-breed-other-successes/2017/04/09/a63067e6-1c49-11e7-bcc2-7d1a0973e7b2_story.html", "text": "Last month, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch smiles in reaction to a question as he testifies during the third day of his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill. (Jim Bourg/Reuters)\n\nJudge Neil M. Gorsuch will return to the White House on Monday for a swearing-in ceremony as Supreme Court justice in the Rose Garden that President Trump and his allies hope will resonate well beyond his ugly confirmation battle.\n\nThe event marks a big win for Trump and conservatives \u2014 both on and off Capitol Hill \u2014 who have struggled desperately to produce significant victories despite pledges of sweeping change in Washington that one-party rule would bring.\n\nSince he was inaugurated 80 days ago, Trump has failed to advance much of the ambitious legislative agenda he said would happen quickly if he was elected \u2014 rolling back the Affordable Care Act, rewriting the tax code and injecting big spending into the country\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nBut the confirmation of Gorsuch on Friday \u2014 despite the change to Senate rules that preceded it \u2014 broke this pattern, at least in a singular instance. Trump allies in the conservative movement, and in Congress, hope that it will serve as a springboard for other triumphs and something of a reboot of his presidency.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a big shot in the arm,\u201d Trump ally Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, said of Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation. \u201cIt gives Republicans a taste of victory and reminds them we can have many more.\u201d\n\n(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nTrump also garnered measured praise on Capitol Hill last week for his decision to strike a Syrian airfield after that country\u2019s government launched a chemical weapons attack that killed scores of civilians. Although Republican leaders welcomed the assault as long overdue, some conservatives \u2014 including Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) \u2014 decried it. And many lawmakers say that the president must get approval from them if he wants to expand military action in Syria.\n\n[Congress greets Syria strike with mix of applause and anger]\n\nMany conservative activists and lawmakers noted that the key to Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation was GOP unity from the beginning. Trump drew Gorsuch\u2019s name from a list of 21 candidates that he released during the campaign, and announced his pick in a prime-time address from the White House\u2019s East Room.\n\nConservatives expressed enthusiasm for the pick \u2014 as he was seen in the mold of the late Justice Antonin Scalia \u2014 and celebrated that Gorsuch would maintain the high court\u2019s ideological balance, pouring millions of dollars into advertising benefiting him.\n\n[Senate Democrats vastly outspent by right in Gorsuch fight]\n\n\u201cHopefully, we\u2019ve learned some lessons from the health-care challenge,\u201d said veteran GOP operative Ed Rollins, the senior strategist for the pro-Trump Great America PAC. \u201cWe weren\u2019t in that one as much as we were in this one,\u201d he added, referring to the Gorsuch fight.\n\nBut the momentum generated by the Gorsuch win may be hard to capi\u00adtal\u00adize on. The reality waiting for Trump when lawmakers return at the end of April from a two-week recess is not especially rosy. Even some Republicans on Capitol Hill question whether a nomination muscled through the Senate through an extraordinary rules change has much meaning for more difficult battles ahead.\n\n1 of 91 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 See what President Trump has been doing since taking office View Photos The beginning of his term has featured controversial executive orders and frequent conflicts with the media.

Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), for instance.\n\nDeep divisions remain on health care as House Republican infighting felled a compromise on a marquee campaign promise for both Trump and GOP lawmakers, despite claims of progress before lawmakers left town last week.\n\nThere are still major disagreements over how to proceed both within the White House and between House and Senate leaders on a tax code revamp, a key conservative priority \u2014 a task further complicated by warring interest groups.\n\nAnd on issues where Trump will need Democratic cooperation \u2014 such as a promised $1 trillion dollar investment in infrastructure \u2014 it\u2019s not clear that Senate Republicans did him any favors by blowing up a long-standing Senate rule that helped the minority party block the confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee.\n\nThat move is likely to further poison relations in a chamber where Democrats will maintain the power to block Trump legislative initiatives unless there are further rule changes, which Republican leaders say they\u2019re not interested in pursuing at this point.\n\n\u201cActually, the process that we went through, which was purely partisan, is not the way, generally speaking, to get things done,\u201d Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said. But he added of Trump, \u201cI think he deserves some credit for getting this done.\u201d\n\nJim Manley, a lobbyist and longtime aide to former Senate minority leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), said he doubts that the \u201cmoral victory\u201d of the Gorsuch confirmation will affect other Trump priorities on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re going to claim momentum out of this, but I think their legislative agenda is going to continue to be stalled,\u201d Manley said. \u201cThe House is in chaos. That\u2019s not going to change. There are still significant differences among Republicans on health care and tax reform, and as far as the president\u2019s budget, it\u2019s dead on arrival.\u201d\n\nTrump allies, however, contend that the combination of Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation and the leadership Trump showed on Syria presents an opportunity for him to appear more in command of a presidency that has so far been marked by chaos and unpredictability.\n\nStephen Moore of the Heritage Foundation, who advised Trump on tax policy during the campaign, said that the Gorsuch win is well-timed for a president whose sagging popularity is threatening to undermine his effectiveness.\n\n\u201cPolitics creates its own momentum,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIf you\u2019re seen as unable to get things done, it emboldens your enemies.\u201d\n\nConversely, he said, \u201cIf [Trump] gets more victories, he gets more popular. If he gets more popular, he\u2019ll get more legislative victories.\u201d\n\nFor the short-term, the decision to level airstrikes at Syria has engendered goodwill from McCain and other hawks in the Republican Party, which could help Trump on other fronts.\n\nWhite House aides and Trump boosters say there were several lessons to be learned from the Gorsuch fight, which, if successfully replicated, could help going forward.\n\nWhite House spokesman Steven Cheung said that the \u201csuccessful nomination process \u2014 which includes unprecedented public transparency, coalition outreach, and working with congressional leaders \u2014 will help further upcoming legislative priorities.\u201d\n\nFrom the outset, there was widespread buy-in on Gorsuch among GOP senators. At the time he was selected, some Republicans even said that picking Gorsuch helped heal some of the anger caused by Trump\u2019s controversial travel ban, which caught much of Congress off-guard.\n\nTrump also won high marks for relying on popular former senator Kelly Ayotte (R) of New Hampshire to serve as Gorsuch\u2019s lead \u201csherpa\u201d on Capitol Hill, a role that involved making introductions to individual senators.\n\nRepublicans say the White House benefited from the engagement of an array of GOP and other conservative advocacy groups pulling publicly for Gorsuch, a campaign that involved pouring millions of dollars into mailers and radio and television advertising touting the judge\u2019s character and credentials.\n\nThe effort stood in stark contrast to a comparatively anemic push to pass the House leadership\u2019s health-care bill that Trump embraced.\n\nOn other Trump priorities, however, conservative groups aren\u2019t currently rowing in the same direction. Last week, for instance, Freedom Partners released a new study as part of a campaign to undermine a proposed \u201cborder adjustment tax,\u201d which is a key component of the vision for a tax code rewrite advanced by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.).\n\nAnd this week, another conservative group, Club for Growth, is planning to launch TV advertising to push the House health-care bill in a more conservative direction.\n\nThe group\u2019s president, David McIntosh, blasted what he called \u201cthe left wing among House Republicans\u201d for failing to sign on to a compromise that would have pushed along the measure.\n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) noted that Republicans were far more unified when it came to Gorsuch, summing up the lesson for other battles this way: \u201cBe prepared, consult and teamwork.\u201d\n\nAs a candidate, Trump released a \u201cContract With the American Voter\u201d promising that he would introduce and \u201cfight for\u201d 10 pieces of legislation in his first 100 days. To date, only the health-care bill has been introduced.\n\nOther promised priorities include legislation that would dramatically cut taxes, spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investments, significantly expand school choice and make it easier to afford child care.\n\nThe White House\u2019s desire for legislative wins was underscored last week by a briefing for reporters to tout how Trump has been working with lawmakers in an \u201cunprecedented\u201d way to make use of a little-known law known as the Congressional Review Act.\n\nThe law allows Congress a limited window to repeal regulations put in place by the president\u2019s administration. As of Wednesday, Trump and lawmakers worked together to repeal 11 such regulations issued in the waning days of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. By contrast, Trump aides said, the law was used only once before by other presidents.\n\nOne repealed regulation, involving privacy rules imposed on Internet providers, garnered attention. But most have not, including one that affected hunting on federal land in Alaska.\n\n\u201cI confess that any one of these is not really going to drive a news story,\u201d Trump\u2019s legislative director Marc Short told reporters. But, he said, \u201cthis is an important story that has not been told.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the White House was concerned about scoring insufficient victories so far, Short said, \u201cI think when you look back and you say in the first 100 days we will confirm a Supreme Court justice, I consider that a pretty significant achievement.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/with-a-deadline-looming-nobody-is-threatening-to-shut-down-the-government/2017/04/09/d68789ee-1a17-11e7-bcc2-7d1a0973e7b2_story.html", "text": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, leaving the floor ahead of the vote to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, expresses optimism that a stopgap funding measure will have bipartisan support. (Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters)\n\nCongress is off for two weeks, and when lawmakers return, they will quickly face a critical deadline to keep the government open. But in an unusual development on Capitol Hill, where budget brinkmanship has become a reliable expression of political dysfunction, nobody is threatening to shut the government down.\n\nInstead, Republicans and Democrats appear to be working together to keep the lights on in Washington. Aides in both parties said negotiations are underway on a stopgap funding measure that both sides could support, one that sidesteps such political land mines as President Trump\u2019s request for new funding to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nEven Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) sounded a note of optimism as his chamber adjourned for its Easter break. He told reporters that bipartisan support would be needed not only for the stopgap measure, which would fund the government through September, but also for the fiscal 2018 spending bills needed to fund government operations in the months beyond.\n\n(Video: Jenny Starrs/Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nNone of those bills \u201ccan be done one party only,\u201d McConnell (R-Ky.) said. \u201cAll of that will have to be done on a bipartisan basis. And I think \u2014 the Democratic leader can speak for himself \u2014 but I\u2019m confident he looks at it the same way.\u201d\n\nThe bipartisan bonhomie marks a refreshing break from the dark days of spending fights that descended on the Capitol after the 2010 elections swept a wave of hard-line conservative tea party candidates into office.\n\nSince then, the GOP\u2019s right flank has taken an aggressive stance on cutting federal spending, threatening repeatedly to shut down the government or even default on the nation\u2019s debts in hopes of securing an agreement to slash spending. That has forced Republican House leaders to turn to Democrats for the votes to push must-pass measures over the finish line to raise the federal debt limit and finance the government.\n\nThe difference this time is that Republican leaders are turning to Democrats from the get-go, a decision that will produce less drama in the halls of Congress but is likely to make it much harder to craft a budget that matches Trump\u2019s ambitions on an array of fronts, from the border wall to a big increase in defense spending.\n\nIn an interview Friday, McConnell told The Washington Post that he is unsure how to square that circle. But he was insistent that Democrats need to play a part in the negotiations.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me that neither side benefits from sort of a government-shutdown scenario again in September,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cExactly how we get from here to there, I couldn\u2019t tell you today.\u201d\n\nThe spending measure expires April 28 \u2014 just four days after lawmakers return from their Easter break.\n\nHouse Republicans are bitterly divided and aimless after the collapse of a plan by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) to rewrite the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare. Still angry over that grueling battle, the right wing of Ryan\u2019s caucus is not expected to support a measure to keep the government open past the April deadline, though that is far from settled.\n\nSo Ryan has turned for help to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). Last week, Pelosi said lawmakers from both parties were working well together to craft a stopgap spending measure. But she predicted that the measure\u2019s fate would ultimately be in Trump\u2019s hands.\n\nTrump, for example, could refuse to sign a funding measure that doesn\u2019t include money to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Such funding is a non-starter with Democrats, as are any other policy changes that could be construed as a win for the president.\n\n\u201cMembers of Congress know what they can pass. Maybe the White House doesn\u2019t,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s \u2014 that line of communication is where you might see some \u2014 more difference of opinion than even between Democrats and Republicans in the Congress.\u201d\n\n[Democrats have a new and surprising weapon on Capitol Hill: Power]\n\nIf they clear the April 28 hurdle, Republican lawmakers and aides are already worrying privately that a larger spending battle looms over Trump\u2019s budget request for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.\n\nMost Democrats and many Republicans have roundly criticized Trump\u2019s plan to increase the defense budget by $54 billion \u2014 money that would be carved directly out of the budgets of domestic agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the State Department and the Agriculture Department.\n\nRep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) said Trump\u2019s request has put Republicans in a difficult situation. Trump has promised voters that Republicans will expand the military, regain control of government spending and overhaul the federal government without cutting safety-net programs for older and poorer Americans \u2014 a promise many lawmakers see as mathematically impossible.\n\nConservatives like Sanford say Washington will never get its fiscal house in order without reining in spending on such popular programs as Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid, which together make up about half of federal spending.\n\n\u201cWhat you have is a mousetrap,\u201d Sanford said. \u201cBack home, you\u2019ve got the mayor of North Charleston riding around in a Meals on Wheels truck saying, \u2018I don\u2019t think we should cut this\u2019 \u2014 and he was an early Trump supporter.\u201d\n\nThe White House has been closely monitoring preliminary talks about fiscal 2018 spending bills, according to Republican aides who were granted anonymity to discuss private negotiations.\n\nLast week, Ryan said he is optimistic about budget deals because there is a Republican in the White House.\n\n\u201cThe good news is we don\u2019t have to deal with the Obama administration,\u201d Ryan told reporters at his weekly news conference. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to fight an administration that we disagree with on so many issues. We are now working with an administration we agree with.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s far from clear that Ryan\u2019s rank-and-file will line up behind him. Conservatives are still angry that Ryan persuaded them to try to roll back the Affordable Care Act by using a special budget procedure known as \u201creconciliation\u201d that would have made it easier to push a bill through the Senate.\n\nThe repeal effort unraveled when Ryan could not build a coalition of moderates and conservatives large enough to approve a rewrite of the health-care law. Many conservatives are wary of making the same mistake in the 2018 spending measure.\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) \u2014 one of the holdouts on health care \u2014 was among several conservatives who warned recently that they wouldn\u2019t support a spending bill just to avert a shutdown. Meadows said conservatives are particularly concerned about where any budget bill sets overall spending levels for government agencies.\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019re going to be setting top-line numbers, which you appropriate to,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cThat will have a unique dynamic, let\u2019s put it that way.\u201d\n\nHard-liners are also expected to balk at efforts to use reconciliation procedures to advance a comprehensive rewrite of the tax code, another top priority for Ryan and Trump. These lawmakers say they will not necessarily support a tax overhaul if it is accompanied by higher spending.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s more important that we take a look at the budget and make sure that it meets the principles we\u2019re trying to move forward,\u201d said Freedom Caucus member H. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.).\n\nGriffith said any spending increases must be paired with cuts elsewhere or with policies to rein in spending on Social Security and Medicare, which is rising rapidly as the baby-boom generation retires.\n\nA large number of conservatives voted against each of the last three spending measures over those same concerns. The most consequential fight came in 2015, when Republican leaders were forced to turn to Democrats to avert a government shutdown. The result was a two-year compromise that increased spending across the board and ensured equal funding for domestic and military programs.\n\nThat agreement is set to expire at the end of September, and GOP leaders have begun to fret quietly over what will happen.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats are eagerly laying plans to swoop in with a budget compromise if Ryan cannot solve the problems that have riven the lower chamber for the past six years.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who serves on the Senate Budget Committee, said last week that Democrats would offer a spending blueprint to counter Trump\u2019s budget request.\n\n\u201cIt has to be defeated and we will come up with alternatives.\u201d Sanders said. Democrats will not support \u201ctax breaks for millionaires . . . and cuts to programs that people desperately need.\u201d\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/what-does-the-junior-supreme-court-justice-do-kagan-tells-gorsuch-it-starts-in-the-kitchen/2017/04/09/9297ef4c-1bbd-11e7-9887-1a5314b56a08_story.html", "text": "No one could have known it at the time, but at the end of last summer, Justice Elena Kagan gave Neil M. Gorsuch a face-to-face tutorial on what it means to be the Supreme Court\u2019s newest justice.\n\nIt starts in the kitchen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on the cafeteria committee for six years. (Justice) Steve Breyer was on the cafeteria committee for 13 years,\u201d Kagan said at a Colorado event where she was being interviewed by Gorsuch and Timothy M. Tymkovich, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit.\n\n[Trump picks Colorado appeals court judge for Supreme Court]\n\nGorsuch and Tymkovich both were on President Trump\u2019s list of potential Supreme Court nominees at the time, and it just so happened that they asked what it was like to be the most junior justice.\n\nKagan is a storyteller, and knows this is a topic that audiences usually eat up, so she played it for all it was worth.\n\nThe junior justice has three unique responsibilities, she said. But in recounting them, she always starts with the fact that the newest justice is assigned to cafeteria duty and keeps it until the next justice is confirmed.\n\n[Gorsuch\u2019s impact might be felt immediately]\n\n\u201cI think this is a way to kind of humble people,\u201d she said during the \u201cfireside chat\u201d at the elegant Broadmoor resort in Colorado Springs. \u201cYou think you\u2019re kind of hot stuff. You\u2019re an important person. You\u2019ve just been confirmed to the United States Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cAnd now you are going to monthly cafeteria committee meetings where literally the agenda is what happened to the good recipe for the chocolate chip cookies.\u201d\n\nThe justices eat lunch together on the days when they hear oral arguments, Kagan explained.\n\n\u201cSomebody will say, \u2018Who\u2019s our representative to the cafeteria committee again?\u2019 Like they don\u2019t know, right? And then they\u2019ll say, \u2018This soup is very salty.\u2019 And I\u2019m like supposed to go fix it myself?\u201d\n\nYou might guess it was not the first time Kagan has told the story. But, as she says, she\u2019s worried about the cookies and the soup since 2010--her biggest contribution has been to install a frozen yogurt machine--so who would begrudge her?\n\nThe Supreme Court is a place that runs on seniority. When Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg gets questions from feminists about why the opera written about her relationship with the late Justice Antonin Scalia is called Scalia/Ginsburg--and not the other way around--she tells them to remain calm.\n\nScalia got to the Supreme Court before she did, she says. He gets top billing.\n\nThe junior justice\u2019s other responsibilities involve the private conference, when the justices meet alone--no clerks, no assistants--to decide which cases they will take and vote on the cases in which they\u2019ve heard oral arguments.\n\nIt\u2019s another event at which seniority rules. The chief justice speaks first, and then each justice speaks in order of longevity on the court. The junior justice speaks last and takes notes of the proceeding.\n\nKagan likes that duty. \u201cI pay attention, I don\u2019t lose focus and I communicate all our decisions,\u201d she said.

So, that\u2019s what I do, I open the door.

She and Gorsuch, also known for his legal prose, formed a bit of a mutual admiration society.\n\n\u201cJustice, you\u2019re such a very fine writer,\u201d Gorsuch enthused.\n\n\u201cThank you!\u201d Kagan responded. \u201cAnd coming from you, I mean that\u2019s a great compliment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would you attribute your success as a writer to?\u201d Gorsuch asked.\n\nKagan answered that it began with her schoolteacher mother, who \u201cbasically approached the fifth grade curriculum as if it were a PhD dissertation. She brought that attitude home with her . . . I really do feel like she taught me to write.\u201d\n\nGorsuch asked if she went back and reread her opinions.\n\n\u201cYeah, sometimes,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes I read them and say, \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s all right.\u2019\u201d\n\nThen she turned the tables: \u201cAre you always critical of yourself?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I can\u2019t read anything I\u2019ve written,\u201d Gorsuch replied.\n\n\u201cBut everybody loves it!\u201d Kagan said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m interviewing you!\u201d Gorsuch protested.\n\nAfter Monday, the Supreme Court\u2019s two youngest justices--Kagan turns 57 this month, Gorsuch is just 49--will take their places at opposite ends of the court\u2019s mahogany bench--and its ideological spectrum.

Ossoff, a Democrat, is leading polls for Georgia's 6th Congressional District\u2019s special election to replace Tom Price, now the secretary of the Health and Human Services Department. (Kevin D. Liles/For The Washington Post)\n\nRepublicans are becoming increasingly concerned about their ability to hang on to former Republican congressman Tom Price\u2019s seat here in a wealthy, suburban district where restive Democratic energy has been surging since November\u2019s election.\n\nDemocratic hopes rest on Jon Ossoff, a 30-year-old former congressional staffer and preternaturally on-message candidate. He has raised a whopping $8.3 million for the special election to replace Price in Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District \u2014 more than anyone has ever collected to win this seat, which has not been represented by a Democrat for nearly four decades.\n\nOssoff is a first-time candidate who is leading the field of five Democrats and 11 Republicans in the April 18 special election. If he does not receive more than 50 percent of the vote in that race, the top two vote-getters will move on to a runoff on June 20.\n\nThe progressive and anti-Trump groups founded through the nonprofit Indivisible project after November\u2019s election are plunging in to help him, and the liberal blog Daily Kos is channeling donors Ossoff\u2019s way. Most of Ossoff\u2019s money, $7.7 million, came though the progressive donation hub ActBlue. Republicans have tried to toxify him by raising the specter of meddling out-of-state liberals \u2014 only 6 percent of the money is from Georgia \u2014 but Ossoff points to his volunteers.\n\n\u201cThe atmosphere in Georgia is electric right now,\u201d Ossoff said in a short interview at his parents\u2019 home. \u201cThousands of folks, many of whom have never been engaged in politics before, working together to make the statement that we think the country can only become stronger and more prosperous and more secure if we stick to our core values.\u201d\n\n(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nRepublicans, however, are fighting back, unwilling to easily cede a district that Trump won by 1.5 percentage points in 2016 \u2014 albeit down from the 23.3-point margin enjoyed by 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney.\n\nOutside groups and the national Republican Party are spending millions on television ads that paint the Democrats as the hope of window-smashing anarchists who want Ossoff in Congress. Georgia Republican Party mailers darkly warn about Ossoff\u2019s work for the Qatar-funded Al Jazeera TV network. (The mailers print the network\u2019s Arabic name on a black background, resembling the flag of ISIS.) The National Rifle Association warns, in drawling radio ads, that Democrats want to \u201csteal this election and your freedom.\u201d\n\nAsked about the attacks Friday, Ossoff paused, then rattled off adjectives.\n\n\u201cPredictable, cynical, partisan, negative politics, with a whiff of desperation,\u201d he said.\n\nOssoff\u2019s lead might also be artificially inflated. The number of Republicans running here means that the GOP vote is split, and no contender is likely to win the more than 50 percent of the vote needed to avoid a runoff. It\u2019s possible that Republicans will unite around whoever emerges from their field.\n\nIt is also possible that the progressive energy kicked up because of Trump\u2019s presidency could see its first real victory here in Georgia in the campaign to \u201cflip the 6th.\u201d The race will test Democrats\u2019 strength in the kind of districts they need to win if they hope to retake the House in 2018 \u2014 mainly suburban areas that have become more demographically diverse.\n\n[Should House Democrats write off rural congressional districts?]\n\nFive special elections are underway in congressional districts where Trump pulled Republicans out of Congress to join his administration. All came from safely red districts or states; in three of them, small donors and political groups are churning up competitive races. On Friday, Republicans announced new spending in Kansas\u2019s much more Republican 4th District, which votes Tuesday \u2014 Sen. Ted Cruz announced that he would fly from Texas to campaign there.\n\nBut the Georgia race has attracted more money and volunteers. No open House district swung harder away from Republicans in 2016. The district is diverse, rich and highly educated, a microcosm of the \u201crising American electorate\u201d that Democrats hoped to ride to victory last year.\n\nOssoff paints himself as a pragmatist, willing to work with both sides of the aisle. But he has also taken on Trump, running a campaign ad that shows him tweeting that he will \u201cstand up to Donald Trump because anyone can send a tweet.\u201d\n\nSitting silently on a desk in a suit with a blue tie, the only sound is of the Democrat typing on his smartphone. His words run across the screen as though they were being posted to Twitter. \u201cHe should act like a president,\u201d the ad ends.\n\nRepublicans and their allied groups are fighting the money and the messenger.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee is running ads invoking House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). The Congressional Leadership Fund super PAC, closely allied with House GOP leaders, debuted a widely panned ad that used old footage of Ossoff in a Han Solo costume to portray him as immature.\n\nSince then, the super PAC has attacked Ossoff for contracting with Al Jazeera on a documentary film \u2014 about the Islamic State \u2014 and tied him to the anarchists who disrupted Trump\u2019s inauguration. In a memo to donors, the CLF credits its ads with giving Ossoff a net negative favorable rating \u2014 with 60 percent of voters viewing him as liberal \u2014 and with keeping him far from the 50 percent threshold needed to avoid a runoff.\n\n\u201cThe only thing he\u2019s ever accomplished in his life is having the fortune to be born to rich parents who will spend millions of dollars on him,\u201d said Corry Bliss, the CLF\u2019s executive director, who plans to spend at least $2.2 million in Georgia. \u201cYou could go down to Georgia, give anyone $8 million, and they\u2019d get 40 percent of the vote.\u201d\n\nIn the first 10 days of early voting, 17,871 ballots have been cast and self-identified Democrats have outnumbered Republicans by a 19-point margin. On Friday, however, the Democratic margin was just five points. By Sunday, the CLF was up with its third commercial branding Ossoff a \u201crubber stamp\u201d for Pelosi, ending with the plea \u201cvote Republican.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t very happy about it, but we\u2019re also like: Hey, they\u2019re feeling threatened,\u201d said Amy Nosek, 42, of the district\u2019s Indivisible Georgia chapter. \u201cThey\u2019re fighting back, because we\u2019re fighting.\u201d\n\nThe reasons for that confidence were on display at this week\u2019s candidate debate, held at the Atlanta Press Club. Ossoff had ready (and sometimes wooden) answers to questions about his resume. He responded with flawless Hill-speak to ads accusing him of inflating his experience working for Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.): \u201cFor two annual fiscal authorizations for the Department of Defense, I contributed language to the National Defense Authorization Act.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ossoff\u2019s rivals had their arms full defending the Republican record in the Trump era. Karen Handel, a near-miss candidate in two statewide races \u2014 currently polling highest to make the runoff\u2019s second spot \u2014 repeatedly rejected the House GOP\u2019s health-care proposal and the negotiations to strip \u201cessential health benefits\u201d from the current system.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not Tom Price\u2019s plan,\u201d said Handel. \u201cNot every single time do we have a mandate that is horrible.\u201d Moments later, longtime tea party activist and candidate Amy Kremer said that she, too, opposed the bill; Ossoff deflected one of her attacks by praising her \u201cbipartisanship\u201d for criticizing both parties.\n\n\u201cThe people in that district are educated, and they\u2019re tired of the mudslinging they saw in the presidential campaign, so it doesn\u2019t work like it used to,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking at issues. They were promised a bill of goods that was not delivered.\u201d\n\nRepublicans hope that in a runoff, with Ossoff facing just one Republican, he won\u2019t be able to zoom around the partisan differences. But every Ossoff event, or interview, offers more evidence of how he is already effectively smoothing away those rifts. On Friday night, speaking to a house party of about 50, the Democrat fielded questions on health care, infrastructure and partisanship itself.\n\n\u201cThe only test to policy that I\u2019ll supply is, is it in the interest of this community?\u201d Ossoff said. \u201cIf it is, I\u2019ll support it. If it\u2019s not, I won\u2019t. I\u2019ll work with anyone who wants to help us here and help the country, and I\u2019ll stand up to anyone who doesn\u2019t, regardless of party.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Ossoff\u2019s style helped him evade the sort of issue that can swerve a campaign off-course \u2014 Trump\u2019s missile strikes on Syria. Ossoff\u2019s ads portray the president as reckless and in need of congressional checks.\n\n\u201cCongress has an important role to play in ensuring the conduct of U.S. foreign policy is the interest of the American people, but so too does the commander in chief have significant discretion to act where appropriate,\u201d Ossoff said.\n\nGeorgia Democrats have long memories about moderate-looking candidates getting whipsawed by international events. In 2002, then-Sen. Max Cleland, a Democrat who lost his legs and one arm in Vietnam, was defeated after an ad shamed him for votes against the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 and illustrated it with images of Osama bin Laden. The new ads, from both the CLF and the Georgia Republican Party, also try to blur a strength \u2014 Ossoff\u2019s documentary company that reported on the Islamic State \u2014 into a question-raising weakness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting, and it\u2019s eerily reminiscent of what they did against me in 2002,\u201d Cleland said. \u201cBut people are sick and tired of that kind of stuff.\u201d\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/tillerson-senators-weigh-in-on-syria-strategy/2017/04/09/41307570-1d48-11e7-bb59-a74ccaf1d02f_video.html", "text": "- Trump administration officials, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and senators of both parties on April 9 discussed the U.S. strategy in Syria.

(Charles Reed/U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement via AP)\n\nYintang Cao, a Chinese national who served time for hawking counterfeit designer purses, was freed from immigration detention March 31 after the United States failed to win permission from China to deport him. Emil Al Seryani, a Jordanian citizen convicted of burglary and drug dealing, was released March 7, again after deportation efforts failed.\n\nTheir quiet return to their lives in the United States contradicts one of President Trump\u2019s signature campaign promises: to deport criminals who are not U.S. citizens, even to countries that do not want them back.\n\nAs a candidate, Trump excoriated the Obama administration and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton for releasing thousands of criminals who he said might have been deported had the United States imposed sanctions on their uncooperative homelands.\n\n\u201cDay One, my first hour in office, those people are gone,\u201d Trump said last year in Arizona.\n\nBut as president, Trump is confronting the same diplomatic and legal challenges as his predecessors, including whether to jeopardize national security and economic interests so that a nation such as China will accept all Chinese citizens that U.S. authorities want to deport.\n\n(Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)\n\nA former immigration official said it is ironic that Trump and his GOP supporters are stymied by the same issues they insisted could be solved quickly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult when you have recalcitrant countries that typically will not take those individuals back,\u201d said John Sandweg, a lawyer who during the Obama administration served as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which oversees deportations. \u201cI\u2019m not at all surprised to see that the Trump administration is having to release people.\u201d\n\nThe White House said Trump is doing what he can, including signing an executive order in January that instructed the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department to deny visas to nations that do not cooperate with deportations.\n\n\u201cThe ball is in their court,\u201d said Michael Short, a White House spokesman.\n\nBut the State Department said it has not acted on that part of the executive order.\n\nDenying visas to another country \u201cis a powerful tool that we have, that is usually not something that we would jump to very quickly,\u201d said Will Cocks, a spokesman for the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs. \u201cThere are other tools that we have that we can use to try to get countries to issue travel documents and accept their nationals back.\u201d\n\nWashington has only imposed visa sanctions twice, preferring to negotiate with countries to persuade them to accept deportees. In 2001, the Bush administration restricted visas for Guyana, which then agreed to take back Guyanese being deported. Last year, Obama denied visas to Gambian government officials and their families, a sanction that remains in effect.\n\nThe Obama administration successfully removed tens of thousands of noncitizens with criminal records during Obama\u2019s eight years in office, but it also released more than 86,000 criminals in the United States from fiscal 2013 to 2015. After their release, some committed violent crimes, reports of which infuriated Obama\u2019s critics in Congress.\n\nSome detainees were freed because of a 2001 Supreme Court ruling that bars ICE from jailing immigrants indefinitely. If their home countries will not take them back, the court said, U.S. officials have to release them. Other criminals were released on bond or for discretionary reasons.\n\nICE would not say how many criminals have been freed since Trump took office, and because immigration records are secret, it is difficult to know how his administration has handled those cases.\n\nBut it is possible to track some cases through federal lawsuits that immigrants have filed asking judges to order ICE to release them because their homelands won\u2019t take them back.\n\nBoth Cao and Seryani filed such lawsuits, and ICE freed them before court rulings were handed down. Others who have sued for their release, according to court records, include Osarhieme Obayagbona, a Nigerian convicted of wire fraud and tampering with government documents, and Krunal Patel, from India, who has burglary, marijuana and drunken-driving convictions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things Trump thinks he can do because he\u2019s Trump,\u201d said Jay Stansell, a retired assistant federal public defender in Seattle who has filed federal lawsuits on behalf of immigrants. \u201cBut it turns out that, no, we have a judiciary, and you can\u2019t legislate immigration law from the White House.\u201d\n\nDeporting someone can take years, and this applies especially to those who no longer have up-to-date citizenship papers from their home countries. Under international law, countries are supposed to accept their citizens, but they have to issue travel documents, such as passports, before the United States can put deportees on airplanes.\n\nSome countries cannot find the records. Other countries, such as the Soviet Union, no longer exist. And some drag their feet on cases involving individuals with criminal records or otherwise troubling pasts.\n\nICE spokeswoman Sarah Rodriguez would not release the administration\u2019s latest list of countries that refuse to accept deportees; in 2016, there were 23.\n\nTrump supporters say they did not expect the shift in deportations to be as swift as the president promised on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cFrom our perspective it\u2019s early on in the process,\u201d said Chris Crane, president of the pro-Trump ICE union. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty unrealistic to think that the administration can get all of these things taken care of in the first month or first 100 days. They\u2019ve got a million priorities, and this is just one.\u201d\n\nSeryani, 39, was freed after Jordan twice refused to accept him. \u201cGiven that the agency had no significant likelihood of removing Mr. Al Seryani in the near future, he was released,\u201d Rodriguez said, adding that ICE will keep trying to deport him.\n\nSeryani\u2019s criminal defense attorney, Glen T. Jonas, described his client as a \u201ccomputer dork\u201d who has lived in the United States for so long he speaks English without a foreign accent.\n\nIn his federal lawsuit, Jonas said, Seryani said he was wrongly convicted of drug possession with intent to sell and is seeking a new trial. Jonas also said ICE failed to transport Seryani to hearings in connection with his request for a new trial while he was in the agency\u2019s custody.\n\nSome countries have responded to Trump\u2019s pressure to take back their citizens. In March, Trump said that Iraq agreed to accept people with final deportation orders. Later that month, officials in India said the Trump administration was pressing their government to resolve more than 270 outstanding deportation cases, a sign that the administration was using behind-the-scenes diplomacy, for now, to try to achieve its goals.\n\nMariam Masumi, an immigration lawyer in Arlington, said the administration\u2019s threat to deny visas may be having some effect.\n\nOne of her clients, a Jamaican citizen who also had filed a federal lawsuit to get out of immigration detention, was deported in February after Jamaica produced his passport number, which the U.S. government had been seeking for years.\n\n\u201cSomehow, magically, after some time, they ended up issuing a travel document,\u201d Masumi said. \u201cAt that point, I couldn\u2019t do much to fight it.\u201d\n\nBut other observers say that unless the Trump administration intensifies pressure on countries to take back their citizens, ICE agents will have no choice but to release more criminals in the United States.\n\n\u201cThreats may work. But they\u2019re not going to work on everybody, because some countries are going to refuse to do it,\u201d said Ames Holbrook, a former immigration agent who wrote a book about the release of foreign criminals in the United States.\n\n\u201cAnd then if we don\u2019t answer those countries that still refuse, then the countries that bought the threat are going to realize that it\u2019s not a threat.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/republicans-on-capitol-hill-leave-town-with-most-of-their-agenda-stuck-in-limbo/2017/04/08/e6f97b16-1b25-11e7-bcc2-7d1a0973e7b2_story.html", "text": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell(R-Ky.) leaves the chamber after the vote to confirm Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court on April 7 in Washington. (Bill O\u2019Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nCongress limped into its spring break with little to demonstrate that much has changed from its previous dysfunctional gridlock \u2014 despite Republicans\u2019 control of both Capitol Hill and the White House.\n\nThere were vows at the start of the year of a rapid-fire offense, but Republican leaders ended the first three months of 2017 with only one major accomplishment: the confirmation of Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Even that came with a high price \u2014 changing the Senate rules in such a way as to permanently decrease the influence of the minority.\n\nEvery big GOP initiative has hit a dead end or remains stuck at the starting line: Plans to rapidly repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act have stalled amid House Republican infighting. Senate Republicans have largely rejected the centerpiece of an emerging overhaul of the tax code that is backed by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.). And an infrastructure package, often touted by President Trump, has been relegated to the back of the line. Some Republicans are wondering whether they should move that up to try for a much-needed bipartisan win.\n\nBut grand ambitions for big changes with Trump in the White House and a GOP majority on Capitol Hill have quickly slammed into political reality: Republicans just can\u2019t seem to get along, especially in the House. And Trump is a political neophyte who is unfamiliar with the legislative wrangling and compromises needed to score a big win in Washington.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was being realistic when he said this week that the bulk of the legislative agenda for the rest of this year would require Democratic support, given the tight margins in the Senate and GOP infighting in the House. Now out of session until late April, McConnell says he hopes cooler heads will soon prevail.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that, after this two-week break, people are going to be in a more friendly mood,\u201d he said in an interview Friday, noting that Democrats used fewer delay tactics on Gorsuch than some Cabinet selections early this year. \u201cMost of the things that we\u2019ll be doing the rest of the year, they\u2019ll have to play a major role.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats are willing to cross the aisle, particularly several up for reelection that hail from states where Trump won by wide margins.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to find a pathway forward,\u201d Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) said after Friday\u2019s Gorsuch confirmation vote. Yet Manchin found McConnell\u2019s move to end 60-vote filibusters on Supreme Court nominees to be \u201cun-American\u201d and said he\u2019s still waiting for real outreach on more legislation to bring together a bipartisan coalition.\n\n\u201cWell, we had the opportunity this time,\u201d he said of the Supreme Court fight, \u201cand it didn\u2019t work too well.\u201d\n\n[Immediate impact: Gorsuch could begin playing pivotal role on Supreme Court starting next week]\n\nThat effort didn\u2019t get any easier late Thursday when Trump ordered a Tomahawk missile strike on Syrian airfield in response to a chemical weapon attack against Syrian rebels \u2014 a move that won bipartisan support but also renewed calls from both parties for Congress to debate and approve a new war resolution.\n\nEarlier this decade, Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) and John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) made a basic calculation: A Congress that struggled to pay its debts and to keep the government lights on was never going to craft a bipartisan deal governing the prosecution of America\u2019s wars.\n\nSo the Democratic Senate majority leader and the Republican House speaker, both of whom are now retired, stymied attempts at drawing up a new measure to guide the military in carrying out its expanding operations fighting terrorists.\n\nMcConnell adopted that same attitude after the strike in Syria, suggesting Trump had the constitutional latitude to act and that Republicans and Democrats were too far apart to agree on a new authorization for the use of military force.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t envision us agreeing on what an AUMF ought to be,\u201d he said.\n\n[Congress greets Syria strike with mix of applause and anger]\n\nAnd lawmakers face more immediate problems. Within 72 hours of lawmakers\u2019 return later this month is the April 28 deadline for funding the federal agencies to avert a government shutdown. McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) had a long meeting this week about that funding plan and not once did they discuss the bitter taste of the Gorsuch confirmation fight.\n\nLeft to their own devices, the two leaders appear ready to craft a deal. That\u2019s because McConnell knows that, the more things change in the era of Trump, the more some things stay very much the same on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn the House, that means that there\u2019s a bloc of several dozen conservatives who hate spending deals and will almost certainly vote against whatever Ryan puts before them, while in the Senate they will need at least eight Democrats to clear the 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster.\n\n[Republicans try to revive health-care effort as leaders seek to temper expectations]\n\nWhile Trump advisers and some House Republicans spent the past week haggling over an effort to revive the health-care overhaul, McConnell never once mentioned that legislation as a focus for the remainder of this year.\n\nHe noted that the only achievements in the first quarter of 2017 \u2014 Gorsuch, confirming Trump\u2019s Cabinet and overturning more than a dozen agency regulations \u2014 happened because they faced 51-vote thresholds in the Senate. The only simple-majority arrow left in their quiver is the tax overhaul if Republicans can agree on a new, massive budget resolution.\n\nBut that decision is up in the air amid House-Senate battles over a proposed tax on goods coming across the U.S. border.\n\n\u201cNow we pivot into a period where, with the exception of whatever we\u2019re going to do on tax reform, Democrats will be full partners,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nThe window for finding Democratic collaborators is not permanently open. If Republicans keep pushing legislation with parliamentary rules allowing votes from just their side of the aisle, it requires them to resolve long-standing GOP feuds.\n\nIf Republicans keep running into dead ends, with no success, the impetus for Democrats to want to work with an unpopular Congress and unpopular president will fade.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) gave a one-word answer to what Trump should do next: \u201cInfrastructure.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed they didn\u2019t go with that first,\u201d she added.\n\nBack in January, at the Republican issues retreat in Philadelphia, Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said an infrastructure package is something that might happen later, behind the health and tax packages.

(Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nThis article has been updated.\n\nFor the 10th weekend in a row, President Trump is visiting a Trump-branded property \u2014 every weekend except the first two after his inauguration.\n\nFor the sixth weekend in a row, he\u2019s golfing at one of those properties; he\u2019s golfed on nine of those 10 weekends.\n\nIn total, Trump has spent time at one or more Trump-branded properties on 28 of the days he\u2019s been president \u2014 meaning that he visits a property that\u2019s part of his private business empire more than one-third of the days he\u2019s been in office, or once every 2.8 days. The frequency at which he golfs is lower: He\u2019s golfed on 17.9 percent of the days he\u2019s been president, or about once every 5.6 days.\n\nBy comparison, Barack Obama golfed once every 8.8 days over the eight years that he was president. And he was excoriated by his political opponents for doing so \u2014 including, as is now well-known, by Trump.\n\nCan you believe that,with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf.Worse than Carter \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2014\n\nMost of the visits Trump has made to Trump-branded properties were to Mar-a-Lago, where Trump this week hosted the president of China, Xi Jinping. He\u2019ll stay at the resort through Sunday, and he may (as he did Saturday) head to Trump International Golf Course in Palm Beach, Fla. Trump\u2019s team is cagey about when he actually plays golf, probably precisely because of the conflict between his words on the campaign trail and his behavior in office.\n\nUpdate: He headed to the golf course on Sunday, too.\n\nMar-a-Lago is a members-only facility, with those who pay the steep initiation fee suddenly gaining occasional proximity to the president and, at times, his Cabinet and senior staff. This week, ProPublica reported that the wall that Trump insisted would be built between himself and his business interests is fairly porous, with Trump able to receive money from the Trump Organization as he wishes. The free advertising his properties have received from his visit \u2014 his golf club in Virginia, his hotel in downtown Washington \u2014 probably help boost those businesses\u2019 bottom lines, and, ultimately, his own.\n\nPresident Trump was met by protesters and supporters as his motorcade made its way to a golf course at Trump International Golf Club in Palm Beach, Fla. (Reuters)\n\nThese trips aren\u2019t free, of course. Each weekend trip to Mar-a-Lago costs taxpayers an estimated $2 million. The extended trip this week for the Xi visit certainly cost more, particularly given the added security concerns.\n\nIf Trump does play golf Sunday, he will have played once every 5.3 days of his presidency. If he keeps up that pace, he will have golfed 261 times by the end of his first term. (Obama golfed 333 times over his two terms.) Update: With his Sunday outing, Trump is on pace to pass Obama\u2019s in only five years, compared to Obama\u2019s eight.\n\nIf he continues to visit Trump properties at his current pace, he will have done so on 524 days of the 1,461 days between his inauguration and Jan. 20, 2021. That\u2019s a lot of free advertising."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/horrible-pictures-of-suffering-moved-trump-to-action-on-syria/2017/04/07/9aa9fcc8-1bce-11e7-8003-f55b4c1cfae2_story.html", "text": "The USS Porter launches a Tomahawk missile in the Mediterranean Sea.

Ford Williams/U.S. Navy via Associated Press\n\nU.S. forces launched more than 50 cruise missiles at a Syrian military airfield in the first direct assault on Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government.\n\nU.S. forces launched more than 50 cruise missiles at a Syrian military airfield in the first direct assault on Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government.\n\nWhen President Trump began receiving his intelligence briefings in January, his team made a request: The president, they said, was a visual and auditory learner. Would the briefers please cut down on the number of words in the daily briefing book and instead use more graphics and pictures?\n\nSimilarly, after Trump entered office, his staff took President Barack Obama\u2019s Syria contingency plans and broke the intelligence down into more-digestible bites, complete with photos, according to current and former U.S. officials with knowledge of the request.\n\nThis week, it was the images \u2014 gruesome photos of a chemical weapons attack on Syrian civilians \u2014 that moved Trump, pushing the president, who ran on an \u201cAmerica first\u201d platform of nonintervention, to authorize the launch of 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Syrian targets Thursday night.\n\nSenior administration officials and members of Congress who spoke with Trump said the president was especially struck by two images: young, listless children being splashed with water in a frantic attempt to cleanse them of the nerve agent; and an anguished father holding his twin babies, swathed in soft white fabric, poisoned to death.\n\nAs the carnage unfolded on cable news, which the president watches throughout the day and deep into the night, Trump turned to his senior staff, talking about how \u201chorrible\u201d and \u201cawful\u201d the footage out of Syria was, said one top adviser.\n\n(Associated Press)\n\n\u201cWhat the world saw last night was the United States commander in chief, and also a father and grandfather,\u201d Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, said Friday. \u201cThe world recoiled in horror at babies writhing and struggling to live. And who could avert their gaze \u2014 and that includes our very tough, very resolute, very decisive president.\u201d\n\n\n\nHorrific images were not the only reason military action made sense for Trump. Whatever his concern for the people of Syria \u2014 a country whose refugees would not be able to enter the United States for 120 days under Trump\u2019s latest travel ban proposal \u2014 he has been eager to show a clear victory more than two months into his tumultuous young presidency.\n\nA strike against Syria could help him demonstrate independence from Russia and its president, Vladi\u00admir Putin, whose alleged efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential race have proved a major distraction. And Trump wants to show that he is a tougher and stronger leader than Obama, who received scathing criticism when he drew a \u201cred line\u201d with Syria over its use of chemical weapons and then declined to act when President Bashar al-Assad bounded over it.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Friday questioned Trump\u2019s \u201c24-hour pivot on Syria policy,\u201d noting that until Assad\u2019s regime launched its chemical attack, Trump had not made Syria a priority. White House press secretary Sean Spicer had told reporters last week that the United States had to accept the \u201cpolitical reality\u201d of Assad\u2019s grip on power.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is no strategy on Syria,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cHe clearly made this decision based off an emotional reaction to the images on TV, and it should worry everyone about the quixotic nature of this administration\u2019s foreign policy and their potential disdain for the warmaking authority of the United States Congress.\u201d\n\nThroughout the week, Trump\u2019s public remarks placed a special emphasis on the youngest victims. \u201cWhen you kill innocent children, innocent babies, babies, little babies, with a chemical gas that is so lethal \u2014 people were shocked to hear what gas it was,\u201d Trump said Wednesday afternoon in the Rose Garden, where he appeared at a news conference with King Abdullah II of Jordan. \u201cThat crosses many, many lines, beyond a red line \u2014 many, many lines.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, when a subdued Trump addressed the nation, he spoke of \u201cbeautiful babies\u201d cruelly murdered, declaring, \u201cNo child of God should ever suffer such horror.\u201d\n\n(The Washington Post)\n\nAbout 54 hours after receiving news of the attacks in his daily briefing Tuesday morning, Trump \u2014 by then at his private Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida for a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping \u2014 gave the order to target Shayrat air base.\n\nAt 7:40 p.m. Thursday, as Trump and Xi were midway through a meal of pan-seared Dover sole with champagne sauce and dry-aged prime New York strip steak (a Trump favorite), a naval destroyer launched the first of nearly five dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles, lighting up the sky in eastern Syria.\n\nWhite House aides and Trump deputies said that while the photos clearly affected Trump, he made his final decision after consulting with his advisers in a process they described as deliberative and thorough.\n\nOver an intensive 2\u00bd days, the president\u2019s national security team convened several high-level meetings with representatives from the Pentagon, the State Department, intelligence agencies and the National Security Council.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it was an emotional reaction at all,\u201d said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who was involved in the discussions. \u201cPresident Trump evaluated the facts, that the attacks occurred on his watch, and [as he] reflected upon prior responses or lack of responses, he came to the conclusion that we cannot yet again turn away, turn a blind eye from what\u2019s happened.\u201d\n\nBut the process was especially \u2014 and perhaps intentionally \u2014 quick, in contrast to the style of Obama, who prided himself on making decisions based on information, not emotions, a manner his critics derided as \u201cdithering,\u201d as former vice president Richard B. Cheney put it early in Obama\u2019s first term.\n\nTrump learned of the chemical attack Tuesday morning, asked for options on how to respond Wednesday and received them Thursday, the day he authorized the strike.\n\nHe asked the Defense Department to prepare potential responses after the Pentagon assessed that the Syrian military was responsible for Tuesday\u2019s chemical strike and for chemical attacks March 25 and March 30 against civilians near Hama air base, U.S. military officials said.\n\nU.S. Central Command has had plans for striking the Syrian government for years and has significant assets in the region, enabling a quick response once a decision was made.\n\nThe National Security Council deliberated Wednesday night, and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and other senior officials discussed the possibilities, senior military officials said. Ultimately, aides presented Trump with three options, but the president narrowed them to two and asked aides to flesh out more details.\n\nSenior military and White House officials said Trump selected the \u201cproportional\u201d choice among the options available.\n\nRichard Fontaine, president of the Center for a New American Security, where Mattis was recently a member of the board, said the options probably included doing nothing and launching more comprehensive airstrikes involving bombers and jets.\n\n\u201cI suspect that they said if you are going to do something, they need to do it quickly,\u201d Fontaine said. \u201cYou need to not hand-wring about this for weeks.\u201d\n\nThursday, Trump held another meeting aboard Air Force One as he flew to Palm Beach, Fla. Some officials \u2014 including national security adviser H.R. McMaster, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon \u2014 joined him in the plane\u2019s wood-paneled conference room, with others piped in via secure videoconference from Washington as the presidential jet streaked southward.\n\nOnce on the ground in Florida, aides said, Trump gave Mattis the order to move forward. The defense secretary passed it along to Marine Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Army Gen. Joseph L. Votel, chief of U.S. Central Command.\n\nThe missiles were launched about three hours later, at 3:40 a.m. local time, to minimize civilian casualties.\n\nIn the process, the president \u2014 who had championed an \u201cAmerica first\u201d worldview rooted in the belief that U.S. foreign policy had become too interventionist \u2014 appeared to swing sharply in the other direction.\n\nThursday\u2019s strike also raised several uncomfortable, still-unanswered questions: Was Trump motivated to attack Syria in part because Obama never did? Was he driven by a need for a political victory, at home and abroad? And what is the administration\u2019s long-term strategy and goal in Syria?\n\nIt was unclear as well whether Trump fully considered the ramifications of his decision. Russia, whose president has supported Assad and whose troops operate inside Syria, reacted initially with pique, canceling a key air agreement designed to avoid military confrontations with U.S. forces in the skies, before later agreeing to restore the deal.\n\nAnd even as the White House touted support for the decision in Congress and foreign capitals, administration officials acknowledged that the attack, which they described as commensurate with Assad\u2019s violation of \u201cinternational norms,\u201d would not eliminate his ability to do it again.\n\nThough Trump had often seemed to blame Obama for the situation in Syria, his remarks Thursday night from Mar-a-Lago were nonpartisan and intentionally so, a senior adviser said.\n\nThe president, this adviser added, was sending a message not only to Syria and Russia but also to China, whose president was in Palm Beach for their summit, and to North Korea that Trump and the United States will not \u201cshirk or shrink\u201d from conflict.\n\nOn Friday, Spicer, the press secretary, initially told reporters at Mar-a-Lago that he would offer an update on Syria in front of the news cameras. But just before he was to begin his briefing, he reversed himself: He wanted images of the president, both from the night before on Syria and the China summit Friday, to carry the day.\n\nMike DeBonis, Adam Entous, Greg Jaffe and Abby Phillip contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-officials-defend-syria-airstrikes-say-they-were-in-vital-national-interest/2017/04/07/b65ef65c-1ba7-11e7-855e-4824bbb5d748_story.html", "text": "The Trump administration on Friday defended its strikes against Syrian military targets overnight, while Russia and Syria slammed the attacks and warned they would provoke more terrorism and instability in the region.\n\nFrom the United Nations to Capitol Hill to the Pentagon, U.S. officials said the attacks were justified in targeting the Shayrat air base that was used to launch a chemical weapons attack that killed scores of men, women and children in Syria\u2019s Idlib province Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt is in our vital national interest to prevent the use and spread of chemical weapons,\u201d Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told the U.N.

Now, however, the prospects for the meeting have been overshadowed by the fallout from the strikes, which Russia\u2019s U.N. envoy called an \u201cillegitimate action by the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe consequences of this for regional and international stability could be extremely serious,\u201d Deputy Ambassador Vladimir Safronkov said during the U.N. Security Council debate.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has often talked about the need to combat international terrorism,\u201d Safronkov added, yet it attacked the Syrian air force, which he claimed is leading that fight in Syria.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not difficult to imagine how much the spirits of terrorists have been raised by this action from the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd Syria\u2019s representative, Deputy Ambassador Mounzer Mounzer, called the United States and its allies, Britain and France, \u201cthe three colonialists\u201d who, he said, pursue hypocritical ends in the Middle East.\n\nThe Russian government and some critics in the United States have questioned whether it is clear that the Syrians launched chemical weapons, rather than the suspected nerve agent being dispersed by other means such as a conventional bomb hitting a chemical storage facility on the ground. But U.S. military officials said they have high confidence that they know what happened.\n\n\u201cWe know the routes that the aircraft took, and we know these aircraft were overhead at the time of the attack,\u201d one senior U.S. military official said of the chemical weapons strike Tuesday.\n\nThe Pentagon released images Friday that it said showed the blast site where the Syrian bomb carrying a chemical weapon, likely sarin, detonated on Tuesday. Military officials said the staining on the road around the blast site crater is indicative of a chemical weapons attack. It was launched about 6:50 a.m., and a Russian-made aircraft piloted either by Syrians or Russians carried out an airstrike later in the day on a nearby hospital where many of the victims were taken for treatment, military officials said.\n\nSenior U.S. military officials said they are investigating whether the Russian military participated in any recent chemical weapons strikes against civilians in Syria. But the officials said they do not yet have any information suggesting that the Russians did so.\n\nThe Syrian regime has increasingly faced pressure from opposition forces and was in danger of losing control of Hama air base in northwestern Syria, the officials said. The installation is believed to be used as both a base for Syrian helicopters and as a manufacturing facility for barrel bombs.\n\nOn March 25, a chlorine attack was launched in Hama, and a second chemical weapons attack of an undisclosed kind of gas was launched March 30, one senior U.S. military official said. That escalated to the attack Tuesday, in which the Syrians launched their largest chemical weapons attack since 2013, he said.\n\n[Which chemical weapon was used in Syria? ]\n\n\u201cThis escalatory pattern of using industrial chemicals, to using suspected chemical munitions, to verified chemical munitions, caused us obviously great concern about the direction this was going,\u201d the official said.\n\nIn Congress, lawmakers called for a response to the chemical weapons attack that could include punitive measures against Russia, Assad\u2019s chief sponsor in his war effort.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) suggested Friday that he would look favorably on a proposal to step up sanctions against Russia, Iran and others who support the Assad regime\u2019s war effort in Syria \u2014 a measure that passed in the House last year but was never taken up in the Senate.\n\nPutin has been supplying Assad\u2019s army with warplanes and other reinforcements that the United States believes have been used in attacks on Syrian civilians.\n\nBut McConnell deferred to the Trump administration as to whether those sanctions would be necessary \u2014 unless bipartisan support for such a move in the Senate is considerable.\n\n\u201cIf they [the administration] feel they need additional sanctions, or we can come up with something that seems to enjoy bipartisan support, I\u2019d be open to it,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cThe Russians are not out friend.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nImages show aftermath of U.S. strikes on Syrian airfield\n\nU.S. strikes on Syria unsettle Europe\u2019s attitudes toward Trump\n\nWhy these missiles were the weapon of choice in strikes in Syria"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-confronts-the-contradictions-of-his-foreign-policy-rhetoric/2017/04/07/c1a32dfe-1bc4-11e7-855e-4824bbb5d748_story.html", "text": "President Trump found himself in unfamiliar territory Friday, generally praised by members of the political and foreign policy establishments but attacked from some quarters of Trump nation for seeming to betray the \u201cAmerica First\u201d pledges that carried him to the White House.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to fire cruise missiles at a Syrian air base in response to Tuesday\u2019s chemical weapons attack against civilians won support from some people he had routinely disparaged over the past year, among them Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). Hours before the U.S. attacks, Hillary Clinton had urged just such a response.\n\nBut some Trump loyalists saw the president as taking a potentially fateful turn away from what had made him so attractive to his anti-establishment, anti-globalist supporters. Radio talk show host Laura Ingraham tweeted, \u201cMissiles flying. [Florida Sen. Marco] Rubio\u2019s happy. McCain\u2019s ecstatic. Hillary\u2019s on board. A complete policy change in 48 hours.\u201d Farther out on the nationalist fringe, Paul Joseph Watson, an editor at Infowars.com, tweeted, \u201cIt\u2019s been fun, lads, but the fun is over.\u201d Watson clarified that he was not turning on Trump completely but was off the train with regard to Syria.\n\nThere was always a contradiction in Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric on foreign policy. He was the get-tough leader who would \u201cbomb the hell out of ISIS\u201d and portrayed himself as a dramatic contrast to what he called the weak and ineffective leadership of Barack Obama. But he was also the reluctant interventionist and criticized rivals who advocated deeper military involvement in Syria.\n\nIn his speech to a joint session of Congress, Trump promised to be president of this country, not the rest of the world. On Thursday night, Trump ended his address announcing the missile strike with the traditional \u201cGod bless America,\u201d and then, after a brief pause, \u201cand the entire world.\u201d\n\n(Louisa Loveluck, Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)\n\nWhat the U.S. strike reveals about the president\u2019s foreign policy remains unclear. Was this a one-off action, meant only to tell Syrian President Bashar \u00ad\n\nal-Assad not to use chemical weapons again? Or could the strike lead to deeper U.S. involvement in Syria, depending on reactions by the Syrian regime, Russia, Iran or Islamic State forces?\n\nTrump\u2019s sharp turn in a matter of days was so dramatic and unexpected that it produced whiplash among many foreign policy experts. That he could pivot so quickly is a reminder that Trump is a president without a deeply rooted national security philosophy or worldview, someone who was decisively swayed by the terrible images of dead and dying children that were broadcast around the world after the chemical attack.\n\n[Trump officials say strikes were in national interest]\n\nObama had drawn a famous \u201cred line\u201d in Syria in 2012, warning Assad against the use of chemical weapons. His failure to take military action after Syria launched a chemical attack in the summer of 2013 marked one of his greatest foreign policy failures and became a symbol of presidential equivocation and weakness.\n\nNotably, Trump was not among those criticizing Obama at the time. Instead, he warned Obama not to take military action, even when chemical weapons had been used. This week, the chemical attack gave Trump an early opportunity to draw a distinction from his predecessor, even if it contradicted the view he stated in 2013.\n\nAmong Trump loyalists who had been sharply critical of Obama on this and other issues, the new president\u2019s decision to attack was welcomed as a sign of how significantly things have changed. Conservative talk show host Bill Mitchell tweeted that Trump\u2019s action \u201cobliterated Obama\u2019s eight years of [weakness] in one bold stroke.\u201d\n\n(Jayne Orenstein/The Washington Post)\n\nBut the nervousness within Trump\u2019s coalition was also evident, even among those who did not offer outright criticism. Nigel Farage, the former leader of Britain\u2019s UK Independence Party and a Trump ally, expressed qualms about what the missile strikes might foretell. \u201cMany Trump voters will be worried about this intervention,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWhere will it end?\u201d\n\nTom Donilon, who was national security adviser in the Obama administration, described the retaliatory strike as \u201climited and appropriate\u201d and said Trump and his advisers should make it clear that this was about the use of chemical weapons only and not a broader indication of U.S. policy. But he also said Trump\u2019s team must now decide on concrete goals for their Syrian policy. \u201cThat\u2019s up to the president to make that clear to his military leaders,\u201d he said.\n\nJake Sullivan, an Obama administration official who was Clinton\u2019s policy adviser during the campaign, said he was struck that Trump, in his statement Thursday night, went beyond the issue of chemical weapons and called on other nations to join the United States to help end \u201cthe slaughter and bloodshed in Syria.\u201d That, too, marked a big departure from the campaign.\n\n\u201cThose are big questions that require thoughtful and considered responses, and I\u2019m hopeful that the team around him will deliver those,\u201d Sullivan said, agreeing that the United States should help lead that effort. \u201cSo far, we just haven\u2019t seen or heard from Trump anything to suggest how the United States could get involved.\u201d\n\n[Questions left in the wake of Trump\u2019s decision to hit Syria]\n\nThe president is shaped and influenced by what he sees on television. After viewing the horrendous images of suffering and death from the chemical attack, Trump said he had changed his view of Assad \u2014 even though similar images existed from the Syrian regime\u2019s chemical attack in 2013. It seemed as if the reality of being president had settled in on him in unexpected ways. How might he react if confronted by other horrible cases of non-chemical civilian casualties inflicted by Assad?\n\nGeoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, said short-term reactions to the president\u2019s action are likely to focus on his decisiveness rather than the implications for his Syria policy. \u201cBut those reactions will be good for about a week, and then after that it really depends on how events unfold in Syria,\u201d Garin said. \u201cVoters generally and Trump voters specifically are not eager for a sustained military engagement in Syria. And if the bombing turns out to have produced no apparent result, or draws the U.S. into a more complicated situation, the possibility for blowback against Trump is significant.\u201d\n\nWhit Ayres, a Republican pollster, said Trump might be able to bring along his loyalists, even if he takes additional military steps in the Middle East. \u201cIf he frames it as a clear effort to promote and protect American interests in a compelling way, then I think a lot of his supporters will follow along,\u201d Ayres said. \u201cBut he needs to have a compelling rationale and explain it clearly.\u201d\n\nAmid the statements of support Friday, some members of Congress asked Trump to seek new congressional authority for use of military force in the Middle East, though when Obama sought that in 2013, he met strong resistance on Capitol Hill.\n\nThere was no sign that Trump is prepared to do that, but U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said the United States was \u201cprepared to do more\u201d in Syria, leaving open the question of a future role for Congress.

(Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nThe United States and China wrapped up a two-day presidential summit here by announcing a 100-day plan to improve strained trade ties and boost cooperation between the rival nations.\n\nBut they appeared to reach no clear path forward on North Korea, and the Trump administration\u2019s unexpected military strike in Syria \u2014 launched on the summit\u2019s first day \u2014 highlighted an area where President Trump and counterpart Xi Jinping differ sharply.\n\nTrump aides who participated in the talks described a productive first meeting between the leaders, saying they exhibited \u201cpositive\u201d chemistry. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the two sides agreed to speed up trade talks to help close a lopsided imbalance in China\u2019s favor, a common campaign-trail complaint of Trump\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThis may be ambitious, but it\u2019s a big sea change in the pace of discussions,\u201d Ross said. \u201cIt\u2019s important symbolism of the growing rapport between the two countries.\u201d\n\nTrump advisers said the goal, at least from the U.S. side, was to increase American exports to China. But they offered no details about how they planned to achieve that.\n\n(The Washington Post)\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said there was \u201cacknowledgment\u201d from the Chinese side \u201cthat we do need to get to a more balanced trade environment.\u201d\n\nBut the surprise U.S. military response to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s apparent chemical weapons attack on civilians threw a wild card into the summit. U.S. warships fired 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at a military airfield in Syria during Trump\u2019s Thursday night dinner with Xi at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTrump told Xi about the attack \u201cand explained the rationale behind it,\u201d Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said.\n\nTillerson insisted that Xi was not rattled by Trump\u2019s decision: \u201cPresident Xi expressed an appreciation for the president letting him know and providing the rationale and said, as it was told to me, he understood that such a response is necessary when people are killing children.\u201d\n\nChina has long objected to the idea of unilateral U.S. military action in Syria. Beijing has said it prefers a multilateral approach, although over the course of six brutal years of war it has repeatedly used its veto power to vote with Russia against U.N. Security Council resolutions on Syria, including a December 2016 plan for a seven-day cease-fire in Aleppo and, more recently, a call for sanctions over the use of chemical weapons.\n\nAt a daily news briefing Friday, Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, reiterated China\u2019s support for a \u201cpolitical settlement\u201d and said it was urgent to prevent any further deterioration of the situation in Syria.\n\n\u201cChina has issued its own statements. . . . I have read them on the wire service,\u201d Tillerson told reporters Friday afternoon.\n\n(The Washington Post)\n\nXi does not like surprises, and the fact that he was photographed shaking Trump\u2019s hand and smiling at his declaration of \u201cfriendship\u201d while the United States made a surprise military move was not going to be popular in China.\n\nTop Chinese leaders exist in a world where public appearances are tightly choreographed, the news media are controlled and protocol is paramount.\n\nOn Thursday night, conservative U.S. news media painted the Syria hit as a bold but calculated warning to China. \u201cHe\u2019s sending a message to the Chinese,\u201d retired Army Gen. Jack Keane told Sean Hannity on Fox News. \u201cHe\u2019s telling the Chinese that, \u2018Listen, the North Koreans are trying to weaponize intercontinental ballistic missiles, and the rhetoric is they will use them against my country and my people. Don\u2019t push me into a corner where I have to use a military option to deal with them. That would be horrific. That would mean war on the Korean Peninsula.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe Global Times, a Communist Party-controlled newspaper known for its nationalist tone, viewed the missile strike as a projection of strength. In an editorial, the paper said Trump launched the strike \u201cto establish his authority as the U.S. president.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wants to prove that he dares to do whatever Obama didn\u2019t dare to do,\u201d the newspaper said. \u201cHe also wants to prove to the world that he\u2019s not a president-businessman and he will use U.S. military force without any hesitation when he thinks it is necessary.\u201d\n\nOn North Korea, Tillerson said the Chinese agreed that the mounting threat of Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons program had \u201creached a very serious stage,\u201d but he said there was no discussion of any \u201cpackage deal\u201d in which Beijing would increase pressure on Pyongyang in exchange for the United States\u2019 curbing military drills with South Korea.\n\nThe two sides had \u201ca real commitment to work together to see if this can be resolved in a peaceful way,\u201d Tillerson said. But he warned that Pyongyang must halt its provocative nuclear and ballistic-missile testing before diplomatic talks can begin.\n\n\u201cIn order for that to happen, North Korea has to change its posture,\u201d Tillerson said.\n\nRauhala reported from Beijing.

Once again, Trump is receiving blowback from his right flank while Democrats seek ways to capi\u00adtal\u00adize on the Republican infighting and maintain pressure on an unpopular president.\n\nDemocrats on Friday criticized Trump, who has long opposed military intervention against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, for suddenly changing his mind after a deadly chemical attack on civilians this week.\n\n(Erin Patrick O'Connor/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cThree days ago he was effectively giving Syria back to Assad,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said of Trump. \u201cTwo days later, admittedly after a serious chemical weapons attack, we\u2019re launching unauthorized military strikes. . . . There is no strategy on Syria.\u201d\n\nMurphy also called for Congress to debate an AUMF that would govern U.S. actions against the Islamic State and any further intervention against Assad.\n\n\u201cIf Mitch McConnell really is an institutionalist, then he shouldn\u2019t be so willing to cede war-making authority to the executive,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nThe strongest support for the airstrikes came Friday from Republican leaders, who praised Trump\u2019s decisiveness and said he was well within his powers.\n\n\u201cThe chemical weapons attack committed by the Assad regime was a flagrant violation of international standards, and preventing a deepening of the humanitarian crisis and instability in Syria is clearly in the United States\u2019 national interest,\u201d said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.).\n\n\u201cAs such, last night\u2019s response was fully within the president\u2019s authority,\u201d she said.\n\nThe question of what new AUMF , if any, is necessary for U.S. military operations in the region has been debated for years.\n\nThe Obama and Trump administrations have carried out strikes against the Islamic State under AUMFs adopted in the early 2000s for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, though many lawmakers are skeptical about that argument. Neither of the current authorizations address potential hostilities against the Syrian government.\n\nRank-and-file Republicans and Democrats were eager Friday to assert lawmakers\u2019 constitutional ability to authorize force, though few are in agreement about what a new proposal should cover.\n\nIn the House, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) promised to reintroduce an AUMF proposal against the Islamic State and al-Qaeda, while Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.) are renegotiating a proposal to address such extremists within and outside of Syria. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is working on an even broader proposal that he said would be more of a \u201cpolicy\u201d than an authorization \u201con [a] specific issue.\u201d\n\n[Syria strike adds awkward twist to high-stakes China-U. S. summit]\n\nAsked if the AUMF would be global in breadth, McCain said, \u201cIt applies to everything.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans were less convinced a new AUMF is necessary.\n\nMcConnell said he would be interested in taking a look at a proposal \u201cif the president feels like he needs it.\u201d Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said that the Constitution \u201cdoes not require the president to get congressional approval to use military force.\u201d And Corker said that an AUMF might be necessary only if Trump decides to launch several more airstrikes against the Syrian regime.\n\nConservatives like Paul argue that Congress should be able to consider whether to authorize force.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there will be ongoing discussions with the administration and Congress concerning last night\u2019s attack, the legal justification, and any proposed military action going forward,\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) said. \u201cI\u2019ll wait to assess the administration\u2019s argument.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the United States is to increase our use of military force in Syria, we should follow the Constitution and seek the proper authorization from Congress,\u201d Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) said.\n\nSenators huddled Friday afternoon with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph F. Dunford Jr. for a briefing on Syria and what might come next. Murphy, who was in the room, said Dunford \u201cessentially punted\u201d on the question of whether the administration needs congressional authorization for strikes against Syrian military targets.\n\nPaul, who said he has not been contacted by anyone at the White House about the airstrikes, called the briefing \u201ca day late and a dollar short.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unconstitutional,\u201d he said of the airstrikes. \u201cIt might work, but it\u2019s not constitutional to do it the way we have done it.\u201d\n\nThe two-week spring recess will prevent Congress from immediate action, and Republican leaders showed no sign they planned to call lawmakers back to Washington because of the airstrikes.\n\nNonetheless, a bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation Friday designed to increase pressure on Assad by tracking war crimes in Syria and supporting \u201cinvestigations and other credible transitional justice efforts,\u201d such as an international tribunal, to hold the regime accountable.\n\nSome lawmakers also called for further action to punish Russia, Assad\u2019s chief ally.\n\nMcConnell on Friday suggested that he would look favorably on a proposal to step up sanctions against Russia, Iran and others who support the regime in Syria.

Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) listens during a hearing of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on July 29, 2015, in Washington. (Astrid Riecken/Getty Images)\n\nSen. Tammy Baldwin, a progressive Democrat seeking reelection next year in a Rust Belt state won by President Trump, knows what she is up against. Republicans hold their strongest statehouse majority in decades here, and hundreds of small communities flipped to Trump after voting for Barack Obama in 2012.\n\nThen there\u2019s Gov. Scott Walker (R), who fires volleys of accusatory tweets at Baldwin and appears likely to seek a third term, putting polar opposites on the same ballot in November 2018.\n\nBaldwin\u2019s answer is to echo the hard-luck economic message that propelled the candidacies of Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), assert a Democratic vision that takes account of the little guy \u2014 and outwork all prospective challengers.\n\n\u201cThe common thread is economic populism and how we get ahead,\u201d Baldwin said here after a public discussion of prescription drug pricing. \u201cIt\u2019s just that Walker and Trump pit one group of Americans against another, rather than taking on the real villains.\u201d\n\nBaldwin is one of 10 Democrats defending Senate seats next year in states won by Trump. Their races are critical to the party\u2019s hopes of overcoming a 52-48 GOP Senate majority in a year when only nine Republican-held seats are in play. They are betting on Trump\u2019s unpopularity and the midterm bounce that typically goes to the party out of power in the White House.\n\nSens. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), left, Lindsey O.

(Ron Sachs/Picture-alliance/Deutsche Presse-Agentur/Associated Press)\n\nRaces in Wisconsin and across the country will test Democratic messaging and the party\u2019s ability to harness anti-Trump energy evident in the Jan. 21 women\u2019s marches, as well as protests at Republican town hall meetings and opposition to GOP efforts to eliminate the Affordable Care Act and social programs that help blue-collar Americans.\n\nBaldwin, for one, is also learning from mistakes that helped make Hillary Clinton the first Democratic presidential nominee to lose Wisconsin in 32 years. She aims to rebuild the 2012 coalition that first got her elected to the Senate, including farmers and working-class voters who turned to Trump. No prominent Republican has yet entered the Senate race to challenge her.\n\n\u201cThe intensity flipped on Nov. 9. The light switch went on our side,\u201d said Rep. Ron Kind, a moderate Democrat whose western Wisconsin district includes Eau Claire. \u201cThe best thing that happened to Tammy\u2019s reelect was Trump winning the White House. All the focus is on them now, and their agenda and how bad it is and what a rough start they\u2019re off to.\u201d\n\nElection Day is still 19 months away in an administration where \u201ca week is a lifetime,\u201d said Wisconsin Conservative Digest editor and Trump supporter Bob Dohnal.\n\n\u201cIf the economy is doing well, that will help Republicans across the board,\u201d said GOP political consultant Bill McCoshen, ex-chief of staff to former governor Tommy Thompson, who lost to Baldwin in 2012.\n\nYet Republicans must live up to their promises and show they can govern, McCoshen added. \u201cIf they can\u2019t get things done, they\u2019re probably going to be sent home.\u201d\n\nBaldwin, 55, covered more than 1,300 miles on Wisconsin roadways in the past three weekends, holding events in 13 towns. A veteran of almost 20 years in Washington and six years in the state legislature, she emphasizes themes familiar to many working-class voters who supported Trump and gave Sanders a 13-point victory over Clinton in the April 2016 primary.\n\nShe talks of a policy of \u201cbuy American\u201d when it comes to purchasing such goods as steel and paper. She calls for improvements in trade deals and advocates measures to make prescription drugs less expensive. Voters, she said in an interview, \u201cneed me standing up to [corporations], not allowing them to rig the rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fighting for a whole series of policies that would make a true difference and a direct difference in people\u2019s lives,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t just assume people know that.\u201d\n\nAt a recent White House reception, Baldwin told Trump she wants to work with him on a buy American policy. His answer? \u201cI know he said the word \u2018great\u2019 several times,\u201d she laughed. \u201cIt was encouraging.\u201d\n\nAfter losing the 2016 primary, Clinton did not return to Wisconsin. In November, she received 238,449 fewer votes than Obama did four years earlier. Trump received about 3,000 fewer votes than Mitt Romney did in 2012, but defeated Clinton by 22,748 votes.\n\nCompounding the Democrats\u2019 dismay, Sen. Ron Johnson, a conservative GOP incumbent seen as vulnerable, beat former senator Russ Feingold (D) by 100,000 votes, and Republicans achieved historic dominance in the state legislature. Walker, meanwhile, has won three consecutive statewide elections.\n\nThe reeling state party held an 11-stop listening tour and added seven staffers. Five are regional organizers, one is a statewide organizing coordinator and one is a staff member assigned to connect with communities of color. They will listen to voters, support fledgling grass-roots groups, argue an affirmative case for Democrats and help recruit down-ballot candidates.\n\nBeyond wooing voters who voted Republican, Democrats are seeking to channel the anti-Trump energy of Eau Claire residents like Bill Hogseth, who knocked on hundreds of doors for Obama in 2008, but felt \u201cvery uninspired\u201d by Clinton and sat on the sidelines in 2016.\n\nAfter Trump won, Hogseth concluded that he needed to act. He looked ahead 15 years and imagined how he would answer questions from his children, now 5 and 3.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell my kids, \u2018Well, I was busy,\u2019 \u201d said Hogseth, a wildlife biologist for the state of Wisconsin. \u201cI wanted to say I carved out time in my life to be part of the resistance.\u201d\n\nHogseth read \u201cfrom front to back\u201d a political manual written by a group of former congressional aides called the Indivisible, and he started a Facebook group. \u201cIn a few weeks, it went from me to 1,500 people,\u201d he said.\n\nThe group started monitoring Wisconsin\u2019s federal lawmakers, including Baldwin. They hand-wrote and delivered 80 letters to Johnson demanding the release of Trump\u2019s tax returns, and they\u2019re planning a three-hour training session on political organizing.\n\n\u201cNot just to move the needle on the Trump administration, but this is an opportunity to pull more people into political engagement because they\u2019re terrified. Show them what citizenship means,\u201d said Hogseth, who calls the effort \u201ccoordinated citizenship.\u201d\n\nHogseth joined a meeting with Baldwin arranged by Becca Cooke, a former Democratic fundraiser who recently opened an Eau Claire shop called Red\u2019s Mercantile. Cooke created the 715 Group, named for the local area code, to push progressive policies, in part by pooling donations from young voters.\n\nThe 35 members of Cooke\u2019s group, who range in age from \u201c21 to 40-ish,\u201d pledge to contribute $75, $125 or $250 per quarter for two years. The beneficiary of the first $6,000 was Baldwin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that we keep her there,\u201d Cooke explained. \u201cIn a big city this might be small beans, but it\u2019s an approachable way for people to pledge. And committing for the two-year cycle keeps people engaged.\u201d\n\nAt the annual Eau Claire Democratic Party dinner, Kind said Democrats must find a candidate to beat Walker and make sure that Baldwin wins, because \u201cthey will be gunning for her.\u201d\n\nWhen it was Baldwin\u2019s turn, she spoke about the \u201cdignity of work\u201d and offered details of her economic agenda. She said she takes heart from Progressive Party leader Robert M. La Follette\u2019s defiance of the robber barons a century ago. La Follette was a Wisconsinite, and when Baldwin reached the Senate, she requested his old desk.\n\nMindful that political energy waxes and wanes, Baldwin asked the 180 people in the audience not to treat their activist vows like a New Year\u2019s resolution, where you pledge to run five days a week and by April 1 can\u2019t even find your running shoes.\n\n\u201cYou have to see it through. This is not something you can participate in only occasionally,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cStick with it.\u201d\n\nThey gave her a standing ovation.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/spicer-demands-cameras-be-turned-off-at-white-house-briefing/2017/04/07/feb0207e-1bc1-11e7-8598-9a99da559f9e_video.html", "text": "- White House press secretary Sean Spicer demanded that cameras be turned off at his daily briefing on April 7 at President Trump's Mar-a-Lago property in West Palm Beach, Fla.

Gorsuch to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, capping more than a year of bitter partisan bickering over the ideological balance of the nation\u2019s highest court.\n\nOn a vote of 54 to 45, senators confirmed Gorsuch, 49, a Denver-based judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. He will become the 113th person to serve on the Supreme Court and is scheduled to be sworn in Monday.\n\nGorsuch replaces former justice Antonin Scalia, whose sudden death in February 2016 sparked a year-long partisan fight over the ideological balance of the court. Gorsuch will be thrust into the final weeks of the Supreme Court\u2019s term. The last round of oral arguments for the term is scheduled to begin April 17, and the term ends in June.\n\nGorsuch\u2019s confirmation is a marquee accomplishment for President Trump and his young administration, capping a momentous week for the White House that included the first military airstrikes authorized by the president.\n\nIn a statement, Trump called Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation \u201cone of the most transparent and accessible in history, and his judicial temperament, exceptional intellect, unparalleled integrity, and record of independence makes him the perfect choice to serve on the Nation\u2019s highest court.\u201d Trump added later that Gorsuch \u201cwill serve the American people with distinction as he continues to faithfully and vigorously defend our Constitution.\n\n(Bastien Inzaurralde,Jayne Orenstein,Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post)\n\nTrump also thanked Scalia and his wife, Maureen, \u201cfor their immeasurable service to this country.\u201d\n\nThe vote also is a significant legislative win for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who refused to even consider President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee after Scalia died, leaving the seat open for Trump to fill.\n\nBefore the vote, McConnell said that as he reflected on his career, \u201cthe most consequential decision I\u2019ve ever been involved in was the decision to let the president being elected last year pick the Supreme Court nominee.\u201d\n\nGorsuch will be sworn in Monday by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who will administer the constitutional oath in a private ceremony at 9 a.m. at the Supreme Court. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy will administer the judicial oath at a public ceremony at the White House later that day.\n\nJustice Samuel A. Alito Jr. is the most recent justice to have been confirmed during a Supreme Court term. He was sworn in the same day as his confirmation, and a ceremonial event with President George W. Bush was held the next day.\n\nOn the Supreme Court, Gorsuch could hold the deciding vote on several important issues.\n\nThe justices will meet privately Thursday to accept or reject cases for next term. Among them: a petition from gun rights activists asking the court to find for the first time that the Second Amendment right to keep a gun for self-defense extends to carrying firearms outside the home. There is also a plea on behalf of business owners who want to be able to refuse their wedding services to same-sex couples.\n\nView Graphic Vote count: How the Senate changed its rules and confirmed Gorsuch\n\nIn the coming weeks, the court is likely to decide whether to intervene in a lower court\u2019s decision that voting-law changes in North Carolina were passed by the Republican-controlled legislature to diminish the influence of minority voters.\n\nAnd when the justices gather for their last round of oral arguments this month, Gorsuch stands to hold the deciding vote in the term\u2019s major case involving the separation of church and state.

But his repeated refusal to engage on specific Supreme Court cases or policy issues frustrated Democrats concerned that his lighter judicial record on matters, ranging from abortion rights to environmental protection and campaign finance law, coupled with his refusal to denounce Trump personally for his attacks on federal judges, made it difficult to determine his judicial philosophy and potential to be an independent check on the White House.\n\n[The Daily 202: The legislative filibuster will be at risk now that the Senate has gone nuclear]\n\nRepublicans, determined to restore the conservative tilt of the Supreme Court since Scalia\u2019s unexpected death, worked in lockstep throughout the months-long fight.

This is such a well-known feature of our culture by now that the use of \u201c555\u201d to start phone numbers in television shows and movies has itself been an inside joke multiple times, in the movie \u201cThe Adventures of Ford Fairlane,\u201d for example, and on \u201cFamily Guy.\u201d Why 555 serves this purpose is equally well known: Giving out numbers using other sets of numbers runs the risk of random people suddenly being called by people looking to speak with someone they saw on TV. (Ask anyone whose number is 867-5309.)\n\nBut then you come across a tweet that illustrates an interesting twist to this idea.\n\nMr. Plow and Southpaw Regional Wrestling have the same phone number. pic.twitter.com/WbnCoSu1fy \u2014 Jesse Spector (@jessespector) March 31, 2017\n\nTheoretically, there is a unified universe that relies on 555 for all of its phone numbers \u2014 meaning that, in this universe, the number that was once affiliated with Homer Simpson\u2019s snowplowing service is now the number for the fictional Southpaw Regional Wrestling.\n\nThis conundrum \u2014 a boundless universe constrained by limited phone numbers \u2014 was itself lampooned in the movie \u201cLast Action Hero.\u201d\n\nDanny Madigan: I will bet that everyone has a 555 number. Jack Slater: So? Madigan: So? There can only be 9,999 numbers that start with 555! How many people live in L.A.? Jack Slater: Eight or nine million. Madigan: Aha! Jack Slater: That is why we have area codes.\n\nAs it turns out, the former governor of California is sort of right and his companion wrong \u2014 and not only about there being 9,999 numbers. (Including 555-0000 and 555-9999, there are 10,000.)\n\nScouring movie and television script sites, I put together a directory of as many 555 numbers as I could find. This is an incomplete list; additions are very welcome. Below, the first interactive directory of the 555 exchange.\n\n(Citations for each number are linked in the name of the movie or television show.)\n\nPhilip Bump/The Washington Post\n\nMany of these numbers are actually \u201cKL5\u2033 numbers \u2014 that is, Klondike-5 numbers. What we traditionally have thought of as the first three numbers of a phone number \u2014 especially those of us who lived in a time when area codes weren\u2019t commonly included when numbers were shared \u2014 was once the indicator of the local exchange that number used. For example, in a 1932 Manhattan phone directory, you can see the numbers listed by exchange. CH-elsea. ST-uyvesant. This was before direct dial, so there was no need to figure out what CH or ST converted to as numbers on your rotary dial; you\u2019d simply ask the operator to connect you. Once people dialed directly, the first two letters became the first two numbers of the exchange. In that 1932 phone book, the number for the store Bergdorf Goodman, located near the Plaza Hotel, is given as Plaza 3-7300. That translates to 753-7300, which is still the store\u2019s phone number today.\n\nKL \u2014 as in Klondike \u2014 translated to \u201c55.\u201d And so: 555. How this tradition of using that exchange for fictional numbers began isn\u2019t really clear, it seems. (Mental Floss looked at this a while ago.) You may not be aware, though, that the 555 exchange isn\u2019t actually reserved exclusively for fictional numbers. Only numbers in the 555-0100 to 555-0199 range are actually reserved. Which is one reason why, when I grouped the numbers I found, there were far more 555 numbers in the 0100 region than anywhere else.\n\nOkay, but back to Arnold being right.\n\nOf the numbers that I identified, a third were in use by more than one different fictional user \u2014 like the Mr. Plow/wrestling conflict above. Ernie Douglas from \u201cCable Guy\u201d and Paul Buchanan\u2019s mother from \u201cMad About You\u201d are both at 555-4329, for example. But the Cigarette Smoking Man from the \u201cX-Files\u201d is not the same as Michael Rivkin from \u201cNCIS\u201d \u2014 because the former\u2019s office is 202-555-0130 and the latter\u2019s home is in the 310 area code. When you account for area codes, the number of duplicates falls to only about a fifth.\n\nSome of those conflicts are internal to television shows. 555-8383, for example, is both Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s car phone number (in the episode where his car is stolen) and the number George Costanza gives for Vandelay Industries \u2014 meaning that it\u2019s Jerry\u2019s apartment phone number, too. But Jerry\u2019s number is also given as 555-2390 when Elaine Benes wants to avoid talking to the man at the pen store.\n\nIn other cases, it seems only right that a number should be consistent between two fictional universes. On \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d 555-LOVE is an escort service. It\u2019s also the number used in \u201cDo the Right Thing\u201d \u2014 set in a very different part of New York City \u2014 for Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy\u2019s cash giveaway during his radio show. One can easily imagine a scenario in which that number never really changed hands.\n\nThe most popular number I found? 555-0199. It\u2019s the Syracuse Police Department on \u201cHomeland,\u201d with an 800 area code. It was also the Pacific Bay Police Department on \u201cNo Ordinary Family.\u201d It is the number for a producer on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d for a \u201chow am I driving\u201d call center, for Dr. Becker\u2019s office on \u201cBecker,\u201d and, most prominently, for one Fox Mulder on \u201cThe X-Files.\u201d\n\nOne can envision a universe in which all of those numbers correctly point to the same receiver as well. You simply need to be willing to suspend your disbelief."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/at-mar-a-lago-trump-to-welcome-chinas-xi-for-high-stakes-inaugural-summit/2017/04/06/0235cdd0-1ac2-11e7-bcc2-7d1a0973e7b2_story.html", "text": "President Trump welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping here Thursday at his Mar-a-Lago estate, kicking off a two-day summit that U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said would include \u201cvery frank discussions\u201d over North Korea and trade.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after greeting Xi at the airport, Tillerson said the U.S. side would press the Chinese delegation to \u201cfind ways to exercise influence on North Korea\u2019s actions to dismantle their nuclear weapons and their missile technology program.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina can be part of a new strategy to end North Korea\u2019s reckless behavior and ensure security, stability and economic prosperity in Northeast Asia,\u201d Tillerson added.\n\nTrump, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, greeted Xi with a handshake as the Chinese leader and his wife, Peng Liyuan, arrived at the resort for a series of bilateral talks, and a fancy opening night dinner with Trump and his top aides.\n\nTrump arrived aboard Air Force One shortly after Xi.

Security Council resolutions.

Hours later, North Korea executed another ballistic missile test that prompted a curt response from Tillerson, who said in a statement that the United States had spoken enough about North Korea and would have no further comment about its provocations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an urgent and global threat, and we see the North Korean weapons programs as increasingly destabilizing, both for Northeast Asia and for the globe,\u201d Susan Thornton, the acting assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, told reporters Wednesday.\n\nAmong the administration\u2019s options, experts said, are sanctions on Chinese banks that do business with Pyongyang in a bid to restrict the flow of capital to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly going to come up,\u201d said a senior administration official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity to preview the discussions. \u201cNinety percent of North Korea\u2019s external trade is with China. Even though we heard that China\u2019s political influence may have diminished with North Korea, certainly its economic leverage has not. It is considerable.\u201d\n\nOn trade, Trump elevated grievances over China\u2019s trade surplus to a centerpiece of his campaign, accusing Beijing repeatedly of devaluing its currency, even though economists have said the country has in recent years artificially inflated its value.\n\nAs a candidate, Trump threatened to slap large tariffs on Chinese goods, though he has tempered such rhetoric since taking office, as more moderate views of his chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and senior adviser Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, have balanced the harder-line nationalist views of senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon and Peter Navarro, director of the National Trade Council.\n\nAt their dinner, Trump joked that Xi had yet to make any concessions in their early talks, but he added that the two \u201chave developed a friendship.\u201d Several hours later, Chinese state media reported that Trump had accepted Xi\u2019s invitation to visit China, though no time or place was announced.\n\nSome U.S. foreign policy analysts cautioned that the summit is premature, given that Trump has yet to fill hundreds of higher-level staff positions at government agencies, including the Pentagon and State Department, and the administration\u2019s China policy has not yet been clearly developed.\n\nThe more informal setting at Mar-a-Lago also represents a risk, some analysts said. Trump entertained Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at his estate in February, but only after the leaders of the two allied nations had first met at the White House. They then flew to Mar-a-Lago and played 27 holes of golf at two nearby Trump-branded golf courses.\n\nUnlike Abe, Xi did not stop at the White House, nor will he and Trump hit the links. Xi banned party leaders from playing golf and shut down scores of courses in China in a crackdown on corruption.\n\nIn 2013, President Barack Obama invited Xi to Sunnylands, a lush estate in Southern California, for a first summit in an attempt to break the ice. The meeting had mixed success, helping lead to later breakthroughs on climate efforts and a reduction of Chinese cybertheft against U.S. businesses. In other areas, however, including maritime security and human rights, relations between Obama and Xi soured.\n\n\u201cOur presidents should stop trying to use a personal touch with Chinese leaders. It doesn\u2019t work,\u201d said Michael Auslin, an Asia expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u201cThey have their interests, we have our interests.

They remained remarkably united on the three votes needed to set Gorsuch on a glide path to confirmation.\n\nBy 1 p.m. on Thursday, most of the drama was over. On a vote of 55 to 45, all Republicans and three Democrats voted to proceed to final debate on Gorsuch, 49, a Denver-based judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. Senators at that point had the option of using as many as 30 hours for debate.\n\nThursday was the second time in less than four years that senators voted to reshape the way they offer advice and consent to a president on executive branch and judicial nominees. In 2013, Democrats \u2014 angered by years of Republican blockades on Obama\u2019s nominees \u2014 pushed through a rules change that allowed all executive branch nominees and lower-court picks to be confirmed with a simple majority vote. But Democrats did not include Supreme Court nominees as part of the changes, believing that lifetime appointments to the nation\u2019s highest court should be handled differently.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), a past critic of invoking the nuclear option, said negotiations to prevent the rules change failed this time because of what the Senate has become.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s such a profound lack of trust, and that\u2019s what many of us are committed to trying to rebuild,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to make very clear to the leaders on both sides that there\u2019s no support for curtailing our existing ability to filibuster legislation.\u201d\n\nSen. Angus King (I-Maine) agreed that the clash was \u201chard to avoid\u201d because Republicans saw Gorsuch as such an indisputably qualified nominee and Democrats had deep concerns about him.\n\nAs it had for much of the past few weeks, Garland\u2019s name hovered over the proceedings in a way that was impossible to miss.\n\nSen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) stridently faulted McConnell for blocking Garland, saying that \u201cthe senator from Kentucky has made history. . . . He made history in denying a presidential nominee the opportunity for a hearing and a vote which had never, never happened before.\u201d\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) conceded that Democrats \u201care still bitter about Merrick Garland and, you know, I can\u2019t blame them for that.\u201d But he added, \u201cIf the roles were reversed they would have just tromped all over us. I mean, you know, they\u2019d have done the same thing.\u201d\n\nThe carefully staged deconstruction of the Senate tradition began Thursday with a \u201ccloture vote\u201d \u2014 a special feature of Senate procedure that ends debate on a bill or nomination, allowing the process to move to a final vote. Schumer and McConnell looked on from their desks at the front of the Senate chamber just a few feet apart as the voting began. Schumer took gulps of water between conversations with Durbin, his top deputy, and aides. McConnell sat calmly at his desk with a solemn expression.\n\nOther senators sat patiently reading, checking their smartphones or filing in and out of the Senate cloakrooms as the clerk called the roll.\n\n\u201cIt was very sanitary. Unemotional. Telegraphed in advance. Planned in advance,\u201d said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.).\n\n[Here\u2019s your guide for dummies to Neil Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court]\n\nAfter about 30 minutes, McConnell stood and switched his vote on advancing Gorsuch from \u201cyes\u201d to \u201cno\u201d \u2014 a parliamentary tactic allowing him to bring up the nomination again and to begin moves aimed at changing the rules.\n\nThe two Senate leaders then launched a series of procedural maneuvers that culminated with the rules change. McConnell first raised a \u201cpoint of order\u201d to suggest that Gorsuch\u2019s nomination could be advanced with a simple majority rather than the usual 60 votes. Schumer responded by unsuccessfully moving to delay Gorsuch\u2019s nomination and to adjourn the Senate. Then senators voted, with Republicans prevailing.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s move was the culmination of nearly 14 months of work by the majority leader, who insisted just hours after Scalia died in February 2016 that his seat would remain open for the next president to fill. Since the start of this year, Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation has sat atop his to-do list.\n\nHis gloating \u2014 reserved as it was \u2014 was criticized by wary Democrats.\n\n\u201cMy GOP colleagues high fived each other after voting to damage pillars of our democracy. This is no cause for celebration,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said on Twitter.\n\nBut Republicans remained cheery. Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), casting his first vote on a nomination to the high court, paused before heading to the Senate floor to record a message using Snapchat. He adjusted the camera to make sure the shot included a statue of Benjamin Franklin behind him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be great to have a fellow Westerner on the court!\u201d he said of Gorsuch, who is from Colorado.\n\nNo Supreme Court nominee has ever been blocked by a single-party filibuster. Abe Fortas, nominated to be chief justice in 1968, was the only nominee to get blocked on the cloture vote, by a bipartisan coalition that had enough votes to defeat his nomination outright.\n\nGorsuch\u2019s nomination was announced in late January, and three days of confirmation hearings began on March 20 in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Formal debate on his nomination officially began Tuesday and was dominated into Wednesday by Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), one of the Senate\u2019s most liberal members, who spoke overnight for more than 15 hours against Gorsuch.\n\nMerkley, among other Democrats, signaled on Thursday that beyond concerns with Gorsuch, they would not necessarily support restoring Senate traditions if they retake control of the chamber.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t unilaterally disarm,\u201d Merkley said.\n\nBut Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) warned that the change to Senate rules \u201cmakes it less likely you\u2019re going to have centrist, moderate nominees on the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), who grilled Gorsuch on campaign finance laws during the confirmation hearings, argued that no deal between the parties to maintain a filibuster would prevent Republicans from jamming through a future nominee if the court\u2019s balance was at stake.\n\nAsked what he was thinking as he walked to the Senate floor to vote on Gorsuch, Whitehouse said one word: \u201cInevitability.\u201d\n\nDavid Weigel and Kelsey Snell contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-intelligence-chairman-devin-nunes-recuses-himself-from-russia-probe/2017/04/06/8122b5bc-1ad2-11e7-855e-4824bbb5d748_story.html", "text": "House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) temporarily stepped aside Thursday from the committee\u2019s probe into Russian interference in the presidential election, as House investigators look into ethics charges against him.\n\nThe House Ethics Committee released a statement Thursday saying it had \u201cdetermined to investigate\u201d allegations that \u201cNunes may have made unauthorized disclosures of classified information, in violation of House Rules, law, regulations, or other standards of conduct.\u201d\n\nNunes has come under fire in recent weeks for speaking publicly about classified foreign surveillance reports he viewed on White House grounds. Nunes suggested that those reports identified President Trump and members of his transition team, whose names may have been mentioned by individuals under surveillance \u2014 or whose conversations with those individuals may have been incidentally picked up.\n\nOn Thursday, Nunes dismissed the suggestion that he violated ethics laws as \u201centirely false and politically motivated,\u201d blaming \u201cseveral left-wing activist groups\u201d for filing complaints with the Office of Congressional Ethics. He noted that he asked to speak with the Ethics Committee \u201cat the earliest possible opportunity in order to expedite the dismissal of these false claims,\u201d and said his recusal \u2014 which applies only to the committee\u2019s Russia investigation \u2014 would be in effect while the committee looks into the matter.\n\nNunes for weeks has resisted calls from Democrats to step aside. It was not clear Thursday whether his reversal was prompted by the Ethics Committee\u2019s investigation \u2014 which was revealed just moments after Nunes made his announcement \u2014 or resulted from pressure from House leaders.\n\n(Reuters)\n\nIn the meantime, Rep. K. Michael Conaway (R-Tex.) will take the lead on the Russia investigation, Nunes said, with assistance from Reps. Thomas J. Rooney (R-Fla.) and Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.). Gowdy also sits on the Ethics Committee. Nunes also pledged in his statement to \u201ccontinue to fulfill all my other responsibilities as Committee Chairman\u201d in matters unrelated to the Russia probe.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said Thursday that he does not think Nunes did anything wrong, but he \u201cfully support[s] his decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cChairman Nunes wants to make sure he is not a distraction to this very important investigation,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee\u2019s Russia investigation all but ran aground last week, after Nunes went to the media \u2014 and Trump \u2014 with information about the surveillance reports before informing committee Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe biggest mistake was not consulting with the Democrats,\u201d said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has previously criticized Nunes\u2019s actions, and who applauded his decision to step down. \u201cYou have to do that if you\u2019re going to be successful around here, especially on national security issues.\u201d\n\nDemocrats accused Nunes, who served on Trump\u2019s transition team, of coordinating the disclosure with the White House, where at least three officials were tied to the files Nunes viewed. Democrats have also accused Nunes of working with the Trump administration to keep former acting attorney general Sally Yates from testifying publicly before the committee.\n\nOn March 28, the heads of advocacy groups Democracy 21 and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington sent a letter to the Office of Congressional Ethics asking investigators to look into whether Nunes disclosed classified information. It is not clear whether that letter inspired an inquiry.\n\nBut the House Ethics Committee cited \u201cpublic allegations\u201d Thursday in announcing its probe just over two weeks after Nunes\u2019s controversial visit to White House grounds and 10 days after the advocacy groups sent their letter. That is an uncommonly quick turnaround for the committee, which often waits until it receives a formal referral and report from the Office of Congressional Ethics before taking up an inquiry.\n\nThe nature of the allegations against Nunes \u2014 that he potentially disclosed classified information \u2014 are rare, and oblige the committee to look into the matter, under House rules. In its statement, the committee cited an \u201cinstitutional obligation\u201d to investigate \u201cunauthorized disclosures of classified information.\u201d\n\nExperts said the committee\u2019s quick turnaround also suggests that they may have stepped forward to keep the independent Office of Congressional Ethics at bay \u2014 potentially injecting partisanship into the probe by giving it over to an evenly divided panel of lawmakers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way of taking control,\u201d said Bryson B. Morgan, a former investigative counsel with the Office of Congressional Ethics, who explained that the House Ethics Committee can tell the OCE to stand down if it launches an investigation first. He also noted that because the Ethics Committee did not appoint a special panel to conduct the probe, there was no telling how seriously or quickly members planned to dig into the allegations against Nunes.\n\n\u201cIt is the black box of congressional ethics investigations,\u201d Morgan said of the Ethics Committee\u2019s chosen category of probe. \u201cYou just don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to get.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, stewarding the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s Russia investigation will fall to Conaway, 68, who also serves as chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. His reputation on Capitol Hill is that of a quiet and diligent lawmaker. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said he was \u201cmore than capable\u201d of carrying out the investigation. In a brief interview, Conaway pledged to work \u201cwith my colleagues on the other side of the aisle\u201d to complete the Russia probe.\n\nBut Conaway is also a Trump supporter, and he has on various occasions sought to sow doubt about the intelligence community\u2019s conviction that Russia meddled in the 2016 elections to help Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\nA major part of both the House and Senate intelligence committee investigations involves potential links between Trump\u2019s campaign and transition teams and Russian officials. But when FBI Director James B. Comey and National Security Agency Director Michael S. Rogers endorsed that finding before the House Intelligence Committee in an open hearing last month, Conaway questioned the intelligence community\u2019s rationale.\n\n[The Nunes-White House question, assessed minute-by-minute]\n\n\u201cThe logic is that because [Putin] really didn\u2019t like presidential candidate [Hillary] Clinton that he automatically liked Trump?\u201d Conaway asked Comey. \u201cThat might work on Saturday afternoon when my wife\u2019s [Texas Tech] Red Raiders are playing the Texas Longhorns,\u201d he noted but suggested that such logic would not apply \u201call the rest of the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s based on more than that,\u201d Comey retorted, defending the intelligence community\u2019s logic by continuing the football metaphor. \u201cWhoever the Red Raiders are playing, you want the Red Raiders to win; by definition you want their opponents to lose.\u201d\n\nIn the past, Conaway has also said that if Congress wants to probe foreign interference in the 2016 election, it should also look into how \u201cHarry Reid and the Democrats brought in Mexican soap opera stars, singers and entertainers who had immense influence\u201d to help get out the vote in Las Vegas.\n\n[Trump administration sought to block Sally Yates from testifying to Congress on Russia]\n\nHelping Conaway is Gowdy, another Intelligence Committee member who has drawn accusations from Democrats of letting partisanship seep into investigations. That was particularly the case when Gowdy chaired a select committee looking into the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012.\n\nGowdy also sits on the House Ethics Committee, which is now investigating Nunes over allegations he may have disclosed classified information against House rules.\n\nMike DeBonis contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/gorsuch-vote-makes-mcconnell-schumer-relationship-look-bad-it-might-get-better/2017/04/06/cddadaf4-1ac0-11e7-855e-4824bbb5d748_story.html", "text": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) departs the Senate chamber after a historic vote on the \"nuclear option,\" a rules change allowing the confrimation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court on a simple-majority vote. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) rattled off questions Thursday to the chamber\u2019s presiding officer, designed to embarrass Republicans just ahead of a historic rules change to ease the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.\n\nA few feet to his right, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) sat silently, giggling to himself at one point.\n\nAs relationships go, the new Democratic leader and the longtime GOP leader have gotten off to one of the worst starts of the last 40 years in the Senate. Democrats turned the nomination process for President Trump\u2019s Cabinet into a long march, stretching out even the most noncontroversial slots into a marathon process that limited McConnell\u2019s time to take up other legislative issues.\n\nSeveral Democrats, including Schumer, even voted against the confirmation of McConnell\u2019s wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. And then, at Schumer\u2019s urging, Democrats blocked Gorsuch with the second-ever successful filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee, prompting McConnell to retaliate with a party-line vote on the rules that put an end to super-majority thresholds for all presidential appointments.\n\n\u201cIf they were looking for 10 different ways to get off to a bad start, this would be 11,\u201d Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), a close friend to both leaders, said after Thursday\u2019s confrontation.\n\n(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\n[Senate Republicans use \u2018nuclear\u2019 option to confirm Gorsuch to Supreme Court]\n\nBut Alexander, along with several other senators and senior advisers, suggested that the two leaders still have the chance to build the kind of relationship that can salvage some of the glory the Senate lost over the past decade of partisan gamesmanship.\n\nThere\u2019s little time before their first big test, just four weeks away, when the legislation that funds the government is set to expire. As they\u2019ve publicly fought over Gorsuch, McConnell and Schumer have privately led negotiations aiming for a three-way deal among House leaders and Trump officials for a large bipartisan funding outline for the rest of 2018.\n\nThe leaders had a productive face-to-face meeting this week, according to one Senate aide, and Alexander said he is optimistic that deal will be completed this month.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason they can\u2019t, very quickly, get back to work defending the Senate as an institution and getting things done, there\u2019s no reason they can\u2019t do that. They both know how to do it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe importance of the McConnell-Schumer bond can seem insignificant in a world where the new president\u2019s campaign is under investigation for possible ties to Russian interference in the 2016 election, where the Middle East sees new crises each week.\n\nBut for the functioning of the Senate, it\u2019s in\u00adcred\u00adibly critical that McConnell and Schumer reach at least a comfortable working relationship. The nature of the Senate has become increasingly anchored around the two leaders. A generation of powerful committee chairmen from each party \u2014 whose stature equaled or even eclipsed their party leaders \u2014 have either died or retired, leaving behind a power vacuum that the floor leaders have consumed.\n\nView Graphic Vote count: How the Senate changed its rules and confirmed Gorsuch\n\nIn that environment, McConnell and Schumer\u2019s predecessor, Harry M. Reid, waged an increasingly hostile relationship throughout the eight years of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, including multiple attempts at taking one another out in elections back home. It poisoned the rest of the Senate\u2019s ability to work together, culminating in the 2013 unilateral rules change that Reid orchestrated on all presidential nominees except for the Supreme Court.\n\nMcConnell publicly ridiculed his counterpart, saying history might record him as the worst majority leader ever.\n\nIn recent weeks, as Republicans headed toward a rules change of their own, they cited Reid\u2019s action a few years ago, over and over. As Democrats defended their pending filibuster of Gorsuch, they cited McConnell\u2019s obstruction of Obama\u2019s nominees \u2014 particularly Judge Merrick Garland, the original nominee for this Supreme Court seat, who never was granted a hearing by McConnell.\n\nIn that regard, some optimists think that this Gorsuch showdown might well have been the last act of the Reid-McConnell wars rather than first showdown between McConnell and the new Democratic leader. It\u2019s possible that, now that each side has changed rules on a party-line vote, the \u201cnuclear option,\u201d a clean slate might finally appear and a new framework could be built.\n\n\u201cAny relationship can be repaired,\u201d said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), the longest serving senator. He recalled fierce early fights between Republican Robert J. Dole and Democrat George Mitchell in the late 1980s, but they kept the Senate from combusting amid Clarence Thomas\u2019s confirmation battle and the debate over the first Iraq war.\n\nLeahy, a fierce partisan, considers Republican Howard Baker\u2019s run in the early 1980s as the \u201cbest majority leader\u201d ever. \u201cIt can be done,\u201d Leahy said.\n\nThe stakes only get higher later this year. By the fall, Washington will be engulfed in another effort to increase the Treasury\u2019s ability to borrow money, risking a first-ever default, and the next government-funding measure will expire Sept. 30. Also, the next round of health-care premiums will be announced at that point, potentially putting more pressure on lawmakers to make changes to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAt this point, rank-and-file senators are still blaming the other party\u2019s leader for what has gone wrong. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) accused Schumer and Democrats of giving in to liberal anti-Trump activists in their opposition to Gorsuch.\n\n\u201cSometimes perception becomes self-reinforcing, and the idea that one would work across the aisle becomes a betrayal to left-wing politics, if you will, which frankly is clearly how this was driven,\u201d Cassidy said.\n\nMany Democrats point the finger at McConnell\u2019s actions. \u201cEverything has been politics for him, trying to keep Obama from being reelected, stopping Obama appointments, stopping Obama legislation. And I don\u2019t know where it leads, it\u2019s trying. It is troubling,\u201d Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said.\n\nAlexander believes that, starting with this month\u2019s funding bill, Schumer and McConnell can set aside the previous venom inside the Senate.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re able to do that, that would demonstrate that the Senate is functioning and that they\u2019re working together as leaders. And it would be a good way to end this chapter and start another one,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more from Paul Kane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/trump-comments-on-syria-xi-visit/2017/04/06/9374a180-1b04-11e7-8598-9a99da559f9e_video.html", "text": "- President Trump said aboard Air Force One on April 6 that \"something should happen\" with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in light of the chemical attack in Khan Sheikhoun.

(Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images)\n\nHouse Republicans indicated Wednesday that they would leave Washington this week without passing their stalled health-care bill, spurning a spirited White House effort to revive the legislation amid a fresh round of intraparty finger-pointing.\n\nThree top GOP leaders each dialed back expectations for action before a two-week recess begins Thursday, after a late-night meeting of holdout factions led by Vice President Pence on Tuesday failed to produce a breakthrough.\n\n\u201cWe can keep working this for weeks now,\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said Wednesday morning, emphasizing that there was \u201cno artificial deadline\u201d for action.\n\n\u201cGetting this done by tomorrow? I think that\u2019s tough,\u201d said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), a view that was echoed by Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), who said it was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d the health-care bill would be voted on this week.\n\n[Republicans try to revive health-care effort as leaders seek to temper expectations]\n\n(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nA continuation of a meeting that began Tuesday night was not expected Wednesday as originally planned, foreclosing any chance that the GOP\u2019s American Health Care Act might be resurrected before the Easter recess begins. However, late Wednesday, Ryan was asked to meet with Pence at the White House, with health care the primary topic, according to House GOP and White House aides. Ryan also met briefly with Trump, a Ryan aide said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s alive, and we\u2019re making progress,\u201d Ryan said Wednesday night in an interview on NPR. But, he added, \u201cit\u2019s going to take a little bit of time.\u201d\n\nThe impasse reflects the ongoing inability of the GOP\u2019s moderate and hard-right wings to reach a compromise on just how much of the Affordable Care Act, signed into law eight years ago by President Barack Obama, ought to be undone. The conflict has persisted despite the sky-high political stakes for congressional Republicans who have long promised to repeal the law, as well as President Trump\u2019s desire to notch a victory with only a handful of legislative workdays remaining in his first 100 days in office.\n\nRep. Patrick T. McHenry (R-N.C.), the chief deputy whip, said the recess could be a \u201ccooling-off period\u201d during which holdouts could \u201clisten to their constituents and justify their position on this bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need people to stop, take a deep breath and think through the way to yes,\u201d McHenry said. \u201cRight now, the offerings have diminished votes, not increased them.\u201d\n\nWhat has filled the void is more blame-casting, with conservatives outside of Congress arguing that the latest standstill lies in the hands of the GOP moderates \u2014 a narrative counter to the one pushed by Trump and House leaders, who have blamed the hard-right House Freedom Caucus.\n\nMichael Needham, chief executive of the conservative group Heritage Action for America, said Wednesday morning on a call with reporters that the moderates had \u201cabandoned\u201d efforts to find compromise.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) at a news conference April 4, 2017, on Capitol Hill. (J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press)\n\n[Trump and House conservatives say a new health-care deal is possible. We\u2019ve been down this road before.]\n\n\u201cIt calls into question their commitment to the basic tenets of the Republican Party,\u201d Needham said. \u201cIt may be time to spend a couple of weeks trying to explain and educate and build support for good ideas.\u201d\n\nAccording to Needham, as many as 20 members of the Freedom Caucus had been ready to support a more conservative proposal, one that would have allowed states to undo most of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance mandates \u2014 provisions that conservatives say are driving up insurance prices \u2014 but moderates balked.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the chairman of the Freedom Caucus, argued Tuesday that conservatives have retreated plenty as the health-care debate has progressed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been giving,\u201d he said. \u201cWe started out with wanting to repeal all of Obamacare, then we backed off to repealing some of Obamacare and repealing all of the taxes. Then we backed off to saying, \u2018Well, we can repeal some of Obamacare and some of the taxes.\u2019 Now we\u2019re down to just a few fundamental issues. . . . Premiums for the people we serve have to come down, and if they don\u2019t come down, we will have failed.\u201d\n\nRep. H. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.), a Freedom Caucus member who was prepared to vote for the earlier bill, agreed that moderates share some of the responsibility for the bill\u2019s failure.\n\n\u201cWhile we were discussing and trying to convince some of my colleagues to hold their nose and vote yes, suddenly we had major defections from the center,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Griffith said the blame game wasn\u2019t helping anyone: \u201cYou can\u2019t do it on one side without the other. Some of my friends on the right need to figure out that we can\u2019t get everything that we want. Some of my friends in the center need to figure out that they can\u2019t get everything they want. But we\u2019ve got to do something positive for the American people.\u201d\n\nModerates, meanwhile, rejected the notion that they were at fault for the health bill\u2019s failure.\n\nRep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.), a member of the moderate Tuesday Group, said the party\u2019s centrist faction is \u201calways wanting to get to yes and to govern\u201d \u2014 a pointed criticism of Freedom Caucus members who have routinely broken with GOP leaders to vote against major bills.\n\n\u201cTo somehow try to transfer this obstructionism to us governing members, to me, is just a sign that maybe they may have overplayed their hand, and I think they\u2019re feeling the ramifications of that,\u201d he said.\n\nSaid Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), another Tuesday Group member: \u201cI know why the original [bill] failed, and I know who\u2019s to blame for that. . . . When we were really close to getting this passed, there was one group that stopped it.\u201d\n\nBut the problems with the bill have gone beyond ideology. Many rank-and-file House Republicans \u2014 particularly members of the committees that wrote the bill \u2014 are concerned that they have essentially been sidelined from the negotiations.\n\n\u201cMany of us on the committees have spent years on these policies, and to just see it kind of being pulled away and put behind the scenes potentially to me is not the wisest course to take,\u201d said Reed, a member of the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\nAnd there continues to be wariness across the House GOP of moving too fast on a major bill that could potentially affect one-sixth of the U.S. economy. Recent polls have found dismal public opinion of the GOP plan, and a Gallup poll released Tuesday found the ACA\u2019s popularity at an all-time high.\n\nRep. Pete Sessions (R-Tex.), chairman of the House Rules Committee, said it was unrealistic to think that the bill could be resurrected in a matter of days after significant changes.\n\n\u201cFor us to vote on something that we have not explained to people back home would be a pretty difficult move for most members,\u201d he said. \u201cRepublicans have said we would go home and talk with people back home about where we are and what we\u2019re doing. And that, in my opinion, has not occurred.\u201d\n\nThe most recent push to revive the bill came as Trump renewed attacks on the Freedom Caucus and its leaders. But while Trump was tweeting attacks, White House officials wondered whether they could shape a deal around the concept of federalism \u2014 that is, allowing states to apply for waivers from the ACA mandates.\n\nPence and other administration officials broached the idea with the various House factions over the weekend, then met separately Monday with the Freedom Caucus and the Tuesday Group. Both congressional groups left thinking there might be a path to a deal, but both had made different assumptions about what that deal might involve.\n\nConservatives thought that what was on offer would allow states to opt out of many ACA mandates aimed at protecting those with preexisting medical conditions, people who would instead be covered through subsidized state-based high-risk pools. The moderates, however, believed the waivers would be much less extensive.\n\n\u201cI think what everybody heard is that we want a deal,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cAnd so when you hear that you want a deal, you\u2019re willing to latch onto whatever is most important to you, and that\u2019s just human nature.\u201d\n\nThe two-hour Tuesday meeting \u2014 brokered by the Republican Study Committee, a larger group of House members that includes Freedom Caucus and Tuesday Group members \u2014 involved Pence, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, leaders of both House factions and key committee chairmen.

Terry McAuliffe (D).\n\n\u201cHope springs eternal,\u201d Sen. Jill Holtzman Vogel (R-Fauquier) said as she encouraged fellow senators to rescue her bill, which would have allowed domestic-violence victims and others covered by protective orders to carry a concealed weapon without the usual permit or training.\n\nThe Senate voted 23 to 17 in favor of the bill, falling short of the 27 votes needed to override the veto.\n\nIt was like that all day. And it has been like that throughout McAuliffe\u2019s term, which began in January 2014 and has seen him veto more bills than any other Virginia governor.\n\n[McAuliffe breaks record, issues most vetoes of any Virginia governor ]\n\nThe GOP controls both chambers, with a wide margin in the House but only a 21-to-19 advantage in the Senate. The legislature has never mustered the votes to override McAuliffe, even on bills that originally sailed out of both chambers with bipartisan support.\n\nThat is not to say that the term-limited governor got everything he wanted. The legislature also considered amendments he had made to legislation, many of them technical but others of great significance to the underlying bills. Lawmakers bucked him on some of those proposed amendments \u2014 sometimes with Democrats leading the charge.\n\nThose bills will return one last time to McAuliffe, who will have to decide whether to accept the legislation without his changes or to veto it. The legislature will not have another opportunity to weigh in.\n\nIn the House, delegates soundly rejected the governor\u2019s effort to restore language in the budget that would allow him to begin the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDel. R. Steven Landes (R-Augusta) said he doubted the ACA would still be in place by the end of the year and argued that expanding Medicaid would blow a hole in Virginia\u2019s budget. Under the ACA, the federal government would pay 100 percent of the expansion to an estimated 400,000 Virginians through next year; after that, the state would be on the hook for about 10 percent of the additional cost.\n\nLandes argued that Medicaid already amounts to 22 percent of the state budget and is growing by 8 to 10 percent per year while state revenue is growing roughly 2 to 3 percent per year.\n\n\u201cOur current Medicaid program is not sustainable at the rate it is continually growing,\u201d Landes said. He added that he agrees with McAuliffe that the state needs to find a way to help low-income people obtain health care, but he said the best vehicle for figuring that out is a joint legislative commission that will convene this summer.\n\nDel. Kenneth R. Plum (D-\n\nFairfax) countered that the state was leaving billions in federal money on the table and that even if funding runs out in a few years, Virginians would be better off for the health care they had during that time.\n\n\u201cThe position we have taken up to this point has left too many Virginians without adequate health care,\u201d Plum argued.\n\nThe House also rejected amendments to add money to the budget for cyber summer camps and cyber training, for mental-health screening in jails, for encouraging the solar industry and for stripping $5 million out of the Jamestown 2019 celebration.\n\nThe Senate rejected McAuliffe\u2019s effort to give the city of Alexandria more time to fix a sewage system that leaks millions of gallons of raw sewage into the Potomac River every year. The legislature had given the city eight years to fix the problem, but McAuliffe wanted to give the city two to five years on top of that.\n\nThe debate split Democrats and gave Republicans a chance to needle Democrats on the governor\u2019s side as lax on the environment. Sen. Adam P. Ebbin (D-\n\nAlexandria), who led the argument for the longer deadline, said the shorter one would not be achievable.\n\nAnother bill McAuliffe had amended would have entitled next of kin to complete records of \u201cunattended deaths,\u201d such as suicides and accidents, once police determine that no criminal charges would be filed. McAuliffe\u2019s amendment would have allowed police to release only a summary rather than the entire investigative file.\n\nThe governor said the amendment responded to a concern by law enforcement that those files could contain sensitive information that could hamper related police investigations, such as a witness statement made in the case of a drug overdose. The amendment\u2019s chief defender was a retired state trooper, Sen. Charles W. \u201cBill\u201d Carrico Sr. (R-Grayson).\n\nSen. Scott A. Surovell (D-\n\nFairfax), who proposed the bill, said the governor\u2019s amendments would deny grieving family members important answers about a loved one\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t get answers, it haunts them the rest of their lives,\u201d he said.\n\nLining up with Surovell was Sen. Jeremy S. McPike (D-Prince William), who lost a brother to suicide 18 years ago. Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) broke a tie by voting against the amendment. Republicans later asked to reconsider the vote, and the amendment failed on a 24-to-16 vote that did not involve Northam.\n\nThe House spent most of the first two hours and 15 minutes of the session in tributes to five Republican members who are not running for reelection. The greatest portion of that time was devoted to speeches from Republicans and Democrats alike honoring Del. Dave B. Albo (R-Fairfax), who surprised many by announcing that he would retire this fall after 24 years in the House.\n\nAlbo delivered an emotional farewell speech, saying he could not afford to continue to devote up to 100 days a year away from his law practice and his family. \u201cI just cannot financially do it anymore,\u201d said Albo, who is known for his love of rock-and-roll and a self-effacing sense of humor. He read aloud from an email that he kept taped to the wall of his office in which someone had called him \u201cthe living definition of a blank-head and a Neanderthal.\u201d\n\nAfter praising his fellow delegates on both sides of the aisle, Albo finished with a flourish. \u201cI\u2019ve dreamed about doing this one thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last thing I\u2019m going to do in the House of Delegates is say: Dave Albo \u2014 out!\u201d And he dropped his microphone to thunderous laughter and applause."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/as-senate-debates-gorsuch-democratic-sen-jeff-merkley-delivers-marathon-speech-against-him/2017/04/05/60a35a24-19f3-11e7-9887-1a5314b56a08_story.html", "text": "When Judge Neil Gorsuch met with Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer on Feb. 7, he told the Democrat something he would repeat privately and publicly: Attacks on the federal judiciary are \u201cdisheartening.\u201d\n\nJust three days had passed since President Trump tweeted his disdain for the \u201cso-called\u201d judge in Washington state who knocked down his first attempt at a travel ban. But when Schumer asked Gorsuch whether he was willing to repeat himself publicly and explicitly call out Trump, the judge and his team declined, according to two people familiar with the exchange who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private gathering. But they affirmed that Schumer was free to talk about the conversation publicly if he wanted.\n\nThe next day, Gorsuch expressed the same \u201cdisheartening\u201d sentiment, this time in a meeting with Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who disclosed the discussion \u2014 grabbing headlines and then concern from colleagues. Democrats began to ask themselves whether Gorsuch was offering a canned line, written to give him distance from Trump without actually signaling that he would break with the president.\n\n\u201cThey came to me afterward and they said, \u2018Wow, he used the same words with me, same act,\u2019 \u201d Blumenthal recalled in an interview.\n\nThe anecdote is telling in that Senate Democrats \u2014 who will move on Thursday to block Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court \u2014 have long had their reservations about Gorsuch, a genial federal appeals court judge who appeared to be caught up in the partisan trench warfare that long preceded him. The decision by 44 Senate Democrats to block consideration of Gorsuch on the Senate floor sets up a historic clash with Republicans, who are expected to move to change the Senate rules, allowing the judge to be confirmed by a simple majority. Under current rules, Republicans would need 60 votes to break the Democratic filibuster.\n\nJeff Merkley, then a candidate for the U.S. Senate, speaks at the Democratic National Convention in Denver in 2008. (Ron Edmonds/AP)\n\nThe confrontation, which members of both parties had once hoped to avoid, comes as liberal organizers demanded that Democrats step up their resistance to Trump. But it is also rooted in Gorsuch\u2019s private answers to individual Democratic senators on what kind of justice he would be and his public testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about his philosophy.\n\n\u201cWe had the opportunity to listen to Gorsuch, meet with him, watch the committee hearings \u2014 something that wasn\u2019t given to the Obama nominee \u2014 and came to the conclusion, each on our own, that this was not somebody we could support,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.).\n\nThe \u201cObama nominee\u201d Murray mentioned is Merrick Garland, who the previous president nominated last year but who Senate GOP leaders never considered. Lingering anger about Garland planted the seeds for the resistance against Gorsuch that could not be easily overcome, Democrats say.\n\nThat bitterness was evident in the Senate-floor speeches Democrats delivered on Wednesday \u2014 including a marathon address by Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), who spoke against Gorsuch for about 15 hours all night Tuesday and into Wednesday morning.\n\n\u201cTo proceed to fill this stolen seat will damage the court for decades to come,\u201d Merkley declared.\n\nRepublicans continued to argue Wednesday that Democrats were being held hostage by a restive political base.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are bowing to hard-left special interests that can\u2019t get over the results of the election and thus are demanding complete Democratic opposition to everything this president touches,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on the Senate floor.\n\nEven as Democrats were able to band together against Gorsuch, their strategy is risky. It could spur Trump to fill future Supreme Court vacancies with even more conservative picks and put their agenda at greater peril.\n\nAs recently as last month, Republicans hoped that at least eight Democrats would find it politically impossible to oppose Gorsuch. Ten of the party\u2019s senators represent states won by Trump in the 2016 elections \u2014 five of them states he won handily. The National Rifle Association and the conservative Judicial Confirmation Network bought millions of dollars in television ads on the issue, asking red state voters to demand a \u201cyes\u201d vote from their senators.\n\nAt this point, only three Democratic senators \u2014 all from states won by Trump in the elections \u2014 have publicly said they will support him.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just opposition from outside Washington that caused Democrats to unite against Gorsuch.\n\nWhile Gorsuch was meeting with senators on Capitol Hill in February and March, Schumer (D-N.Y.) was busy piecing together a coalition against him, made up of Democrats who were angry at the judge, Trump and McConnell for a variety of reasons. Garland was one, they said. Another was concern about Trump\u2019s controversial actions and whether Gorsuch would stand up to them. Yet another was the worry that Gorsuch would not represent the views of everyday people over wealthy companies.\n\nAs time went on, Senate Democrats said they soured on Gorsuch even more. They said his guarded answers to questions during his confirmation hearings did little to persuade them that he would serve as a check on Trump. And as he did in his meeting with Schumer, Gorsuch declined in those hearings to explicitly call out Trump\u2019s criticism of federal judges.\n\nOutside of the Senate, progressives cobbled together an anti-Gorsuch movement.\n\nIlyse Hogue, the president of NARAL, sent a Feb. 21 email to fellow activists, asking for bodies to oppose the nominee. More than a dozen groups followed suit, creating the People\u2019s Defense, rallying in Washington and the states and collecting more than 1 million signatures.\n\n\u201cPeople are in a mood for a principled stance, not for backroom deals,\u201d Hogue said. \u201cWe were told it was unwinnable, but we didn\u2019t really care about the political math. Women needed this fight to be fought.\u201d\n\nProgressives and the Senate Democrats were not terribly well organized when the seat first opened. For much of 2016, after Obama nominated Garland to the court, outside groups endorsed a \u201cWe Need Nine\u201d campaign, charging Republicans with blocking the people\u2019s business by not holding hearings or a vote.\n\nThe campaign against Gorsuch was much more openly ideological. \u201cGorsuch ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby, the case that sought religious exemptions for employers who wanted to deny contraceptive healthcare coverage, before it went to the Supreme Court,\u201d wrote the progressive Working Families Party, a member of the People\u2019s Defense, in a February email to supporters. \u201cGorsuch could also cast a deciding vote on whether immigrants can be detained without due process.\u201d\n\nGorsuch\u2019s hearings, which began on March 20 in the Senate Judiciary Committee, ended up costing him votes. While Gorsuch allies praised his demeanor, Democrats came away unsatisfied with his answers on issues they expected to come before the court. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) confronted the nominee about the outside spending that had promoted his nomination, and whether he would owe his job to anonymous donors.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to ask them,\u201d Gorsuch said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Whitehouse said, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t know who they are.\u201d\n\nWhen Whitehouse returned home for a town hall meeting, he was welcomed with a standing ovation for his question \u2014 and afterward, he told reporters that he was committed to blocking Gorsuch.\n\n\u201cGorsuch did himself no favors in that hearing,\u201d said Ian Millhiser, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. \u201cHe mansplained fairly basic concepts to women senators. He pushed way too hard on the \u2018I\u2019m not going to express a view about anything, ever\u2019 fallback \u2014 much harder than previous nominees. And then, after the Supreme Court unanimously overturned one of his opinions, he defended himself by misrepresenting his own opinion.\u201d\n\nAfter the hearing, just four Democrats announced that they would oppose a Gorsuch filibuster. Seven of the Democrats from Trump-won states opposed him, all comfortably couching their decision with the issues they expected him to rule on.\n\n\u201cWith Judge Gorsuch on the bench, I am deeply concerned that dark money will continue to drown out the voices and votes of citizens,\u201d said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), whose state passed tough campaign finance laws that were struck down by a Republican-appointed judge.\n\nSome Republicans say they could sense for months that Democrats were going to have the votes to block Gorsuch.\n\n\u201cI could count, sure,\u201d said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). \u201cBut I had hoped that we could do what we had done in the past, and that was reach some agreement. And we haven\u2019t, so it\u2019s permanent damage to the body.\u201d\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said it became clear to him that Gorsuch was not going to have the 60 votes necessary to break a Democratic blockade \u201cat the end of the questioning\u201d during his confirmation hearing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised because of their feeling about Garland, but very surprised considering the qualifications that this guy has,\u201d Grassley said.\n\nRepublicans continued to sing Gorsuch\u2019s praises ahead of the expected Thursday clash. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) called Gorsuch \u201cone of the finest judges our nation has to offer\u201d and said he would uphold \u201cjustice, fairness and an interpretation of what the law is.\u201d\n\nA single-party filibuster has never successfully blocked a Supreme Court nomination. A bipartisan coalition used the procedural vote to defeat Abe Fortas\u2019s 1968 nomination to be chief justice. After his marathon speech, Merkley admitted that he would have preferred that the parties come to a deal. But he saw partisan rancor coming from the other side.\n\n\u201cWe labored for the better part of a year, working with our Republican colleagues. It wasn\u2019t like what\u2019s going on now,\u201d he said. He snapped his fingers. \u201cJust like that.\u201d\n\nEd O\u2019Keefe contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/is-trump-trying-to-lead-the-country-the-same-way-he-ran-his-business/2017/04/05/39924b7e-1a5d-11e7-8598-9a99da559f9e_video.html", "text": "- The Post\u2019s Marc Fisher looks at how President Trump\u2019s handling of the health-care battle shines a light on his management style.

McMaster, an Army three-star general who took over the post after retired general Michael Flynn was ousted in February and who is increasingly asserting himself over the flow of national security information in the White House.\n\nMcMaster has become a blunt force within the administration who has made clear to several top officials and the president that he does not want the NSC to have any political elements.\n\nTwo senior White House officials said that Bannon\u2019s departure was in no way a demotion and that he had rarely attended meetings since being placed on the council.

Rice, whose tenure was heavily criticized by Republicans.\n\n\u201cSusan E. Rice operationalized the NSC during the last administration,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cI was put on to ensure that it was de-operationalized. General McMaster has returned the NSC to its proper function.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s NSC, like those of virtually all presidents since the council was established in the late 1940s, grew rapidly during his first term, and some Cabinet officials complained that it \u201cmicromanaged\u201d their departments and decision-making. When Rice became national security adviser in 2013, she embarked on a somewhat successful effort to shrink its size. Her direct involvement in what some considered \u201coperational\u201d activities \u2014 including secret negotiations with Iran and Cuba \u2014 was relatively minimal compared with others\u2019.\n\nBannon\u2019s view of the NSC under Obama is reflective of his broader efforts to \u201cdeconstruct\u201d the federal government, including slimming down bureaucracies, as well as the ad hoc nature of foreign policymaking and blurred lines of authority in the Trump White House so far.\n\n\u201cBannon says he was put on NSC to \u2018de-operationalize\u2019 it. Think the word he was looking for was \u2018dysfunctionalize,\u2019 \u201d tweeted Rep. Adam B. Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. \u201cMission accomplished.\u201d\n\nBannon\u2019s place on the NSC\u2019s principals committee generated intense controversy when the move was announced in January. National security experts, including Rice, characterized it as an elevation of a White House official with no national security experience, even while other national security officials in the administration were included on the NSC only when \u201cissues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise\u201d were involved.\n\n(Alice Li/The Washington Post)\n\nThe White House strongly disputed that characterization, saying Trump chose to change the structure of the principals committee from the one in place during the Obama administration to reduce the number of meetings in which senior intelligence officials were required to participate if the meetings did not pertain to their areas of expertise.\n\n[Trump strategist Stephen Bannon won\u2019t face voter fraud prosecution in Florida]\n\nBannon\u2019s role early on, one of the officials said, was to guide and in essence keep watch over Flynn, who was tasked with reshaping the operation but whose management style could be combative. That official and a second official said Bannon did this from afar, attending one or two meetings of the group.\n\nNational security experts acknowledged that the Obama structure had been rife with complaints about too many meetings involving a glut of decision-makers, but they say those issues could also have been resolved at the discretion of the national security adviser.\n\n\u201cWhether it was too operational or too much micromanagement, that criticism did exist, but you don\u2019t need the chief strategist to be the one to try to rein that in,\u201d said John B. Bellinger III, who was the legal adviser to the National Security Council in the George W. Bush administration.\n\nUnease about Bannon\u2019s strident nationalism and call to \u201cdeconstruct the administrative state\u201d has led to clashes of temperament and policy even within the West Wing, officials said, with Bannon and particularly National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn disagreeing about aspects of Trump\u2019s agenda and forming their own informal power networks within the executive branch.\n\nCohn, who is a registered Democrat, has grown close to Kushner in recent months, and another one of his allies inside of the White House, Dina Powell, was named deputy national security adviser for strategy last month.\n\nWhile Bannon has been removed from the council, the list of invitees to the council\u2019s principals and deputies meetings has expanded to include Powell, an Egyptian-born former national security official in the Bush administration and a Goldman Sachs official whose influence within the West Wing has expanded rapidly.\n\nKushner, Cohn and Powell, along with McMaster, have all become more powerful forces within the White House since the inauguration in liaising with foreign dignitaries and building relationships with key players on various policies.\n\nBannon remains a confidant of the president who is working closely with other advisers on domestic and foreign policy.\n\nAlong with Bannon\u2019s removal, other changes outlined Wednesday in a memorandum further strengthen McMaster\u2019s position. He is now in charge of the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council headed by Tom Bossert \u2014 a reversal from earlier in the year, when the NSC and HSC were put on equal footing.\n\n[Who is Julia Hahn? The unlikely rise of Steve Bannon\u2019s right-hand woman.]\n\nThe new NSC structure also restores the position of the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the principals committee, which was their role in the Obama administration. The director of the CIA has also been added to the principals committee.\n\nIn addition, the secretary and deputy secretary of the Energy Department \u2014 which oversees the nation\u2019s nuclear arsenal \u2014 have been added as members of the principals and deputies committee meetings, respectively.\n\nWilliam Kristol, a Trump critic and longtime hawkish conservative voice, said the Republican foreign policy community was generally pleased to see the changes at the White House.\n\n\u201cMcMaster is in charge and trying to chart policy in a reasonable way,\u201d Kristol said, noting that the news was sudden and unexpected since McMaster has been \u201cpretty quiet since he\u2019s been there, being behind the scenes and avoiding interviews.\u201d\n\nSeveral officials said McMaster is putting his own stamp on the NSC process and trying to formalize it, despite ongoing concerns that Trump\u2019s top White House aides \u2014 and some NSC staffers particularly close to them \u2014 continue to hold strategy meetings outside that process.\n\n\u201cMcMaster is trying to put them under his control and either removing or downgrading people who had independent linkages to the White House so that advice will flow through him, which is normal,\u201d said Mark Cancian, a national security expert and former White House official who is at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nWhile McMaster has tried to inject new hires and remove some existing staff, many of Flynn\u2019s original hires and proteges remain in place. They include Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the senior director for intelligence, who several weeks ago enlisted Bannon and Kushner in a successful effort to reverse McMaster\u2019s effort to replace him.\n\nTrump\u2019s NSC became embroiled in the controversy over Russian interference in the 2016 election. The Washington Post reported last week that three officials from the NSC \u2014 including Cohen-Watnick \u2014 collected and distributed documents to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), whose panel is investigating contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russian officials during the election. Nunes later held a news conference and briefed the president on those documents, which he said suggested that Trump associates were the subjects of incidental and legal surveillance by the Obama administration.\n\nMcMaster, who has become a conduit for foreign diplomatic leaders, has kept a low public profile since joining the administration, avoiding interviews and speeches. But inside the White House, he has gained significant influence and his plans for the council have largely been encouraged by the president\u2019s closest aides.\n\nA key part of McMaster\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is his 1997 book, \u201cDereliction of Duty,\u201d which highlighted the failure of military leaders to give candid advice to the president in the lead-up to the Vietnam War and sets a high bar for advisers to the president.\n\n\u201cHe was very critical of the Joint Chiefs and how they didn\u2019t speak up more forcefully against the war,\u201d Cancian said. \u201cHe put a mark on the wall here, and he has to live up to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to drive him to be very clear and pointed in his advice, particularly if he disagrees with the president or other elements of government,\u201d he added."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/susan-rice-may-have-committed-a-crime-trump-says-without-providing-evidence/2017/04/05/4b68e7d6-1a49-11e7-bcc2-7d1a0973e7b2_story.html", "text": "President Trump addresses a joint news conference with Jordan's King Abdullah II in the Rose Garden of the White House on April 5.

U.S. persons cannot be surveilled without a warrant, but the \u201cunmasking\u201d of such names can be requested if it is necessary for a national security purpose.\n\nRice declined to comment through a spokeswoman: \u201cI\u2019m not going to dignify the President\u2019s ludicrous charge with a comment.\u201d\n\nTrump, his aides and other Republicans have suggested that Rice requested the information for political purposes and leaked them in news media reports. This week on Twitter, Trump called attention to a link on the Drudge Report, a conservative website, that described Rice as having ordered \u201cspy docs\u201d on him.\n\nIn an interview on Tuesday, Rice denied the allegations.\n\n\u201cI leaked nothing, to nobody, and never have and never would,\u201d Rice said on MSNBC. \u201cThe allegation is that somehow Obama administration officials utilized intelligence for political purposes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely false,\u201d she added.\n\n\n\nRice may now face an inquiry by the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is looking into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The committee\u2019s chairman, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), said that Rice may be interviewed as part of the committee\u2019s work.\n\nRice has said that the pace of intelligence reports on Russian meddling increased beginning in the summer of 2016.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments on Wednesday also pointed to a larger conspiracy, that would include other Obama administration officials.\n\nThere is no evidence that Rice improperly requested that names be unmasked.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) first suggested that he had seen intelligence reports that contained the identities of Trump associates, including some where the names were masked but were easily identifiable.\n\nThose reports, which Nunes revealed in a news conference and were the foundation for a briefing he provided to the president, were uncovered by National Security Council officials working in the White House who, The Washington Post reported, secretly passed them on to Nunes.\n\nTrump has also claimed, without evidence, that Obama ordered a wiretap of Trump Tower during the election. Democrat and Republican lawmakers continue to say no evidence supports this claim.\n\nAdam Entous contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/conservatives-fall-short-of-another-goal-defunding-planned-parenthood/2017/04/05/3b6e6832-1a1d-11e7-855e-4824bbb5d748_story.html", "text": "Demonstrators hold placards during a Planned Parenthood rally outside the State Capitol in Austin on Wednesday. (Ilana Panich-Linsman/Reuters)\n\nAntiabortion groups thought they had a sure way to slash funding for the country\u2019s largest abortion provider as part of the health-care overhaul proposed by the House Republican leadership.\n\nBut the overhaul failed \u2014 a nascent effort to revive it has also stalled \u2014 dampening conservatives\u2019 once-high hopes to achieve one of their dearest goals: defunding Planned Parenthood.\n\nAbortion opponents are not giving up the fight. They say there still is a chance to pass a budget measure including major cuts to Medicaid funding for the women\u2019s health group \u2014 without any Democratic support.\n\n[Planned Parenthood could be first casualty of Obamacare repeal efforts]\n\nThe first attempt to defund Planned Parenthood using special budget procedures was through the 2017 budget measure that also carried the House GOP health-care plan. It\u2019s on pause as House Republicans remain badly divided about their next move on health care.\n\nYet abortion foes are holding out hope that the effort will be resurrected after Congress returns from a two-week recess. They don\u2019t have a contingency plan in place if Congress fails to reach a deal on rolling back and replacing the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe really haven\u2019t developed a Plan B,\u201d said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a group that has pushed for defunding Planned Parenthood as part of the effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nConservatives say they have not moved to conversations about alternative ways to defund Planned Parenthood \u2014 although they are not planning to pick a fight in the spending discussion this month. Congress must pass a bill to keep funding the government past April 28. For now, they are keeping their eyes on the Obamacare repeal efforts as their best chance of success.\n\n\u201cI think reconciliation remains by far the ideal way,\u201d said Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), chairman of the House Pro-Life Caucus, referring to a procedural maneuver that allows the Senate to pass something with a majority vote.\n\n\u201cReally, everyone\u2019s head is down in this moment,\u201d said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the antiabortion group Susan B. Anthony List.\n\nTop conservatives including Dannenfelser attended a meeting at the White House on Tuesday with Vice President Pence, who has been trying this week to forge an agreement on an Obamacare repeal. But their hopes dimmed again Wednesday morning, as key members indicated that little progress has been made on bringing conservatives and moderates closer together.\n\nThe state of play is a shock to Dannenfelser and others, who never expected things to turn out this way. They thought they had perfectly laid the groundwork for success by getting Planned Parenthood defunding included in a test vote last year to repeal the health-care law and by extracting a promise from then-presidential candidate Donald Trump during his campaign that he\u2019d sign it.\n\n\u201cThis is like some nightmare we couldn\u2019t have conceived on our own,\u201d Dannenfelser said.\n\nWhat makes the situation even more bitter for antiabortion activists is that there\u2019s little dispute among House Republicans about blocking Planned Parenthood clinics from getting Medicaid dollars, which represent about 30 percent of the health provider\u2019s budget.\n\nA few Senate moderates \u2014 including Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) \u2014 oppose defunding Planned Parenthood. But beyond those senators, the issue represents one strong point of GOP agreement on the health-care bill.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that pro-life issues . . . [were] the base of the bill and a nonnegotiable issue,\u201d said Tom McClusky, a lobbyist for March for Life.\n\nThe House voted in September 2015 to freeze Planned Parenthood\u2019s funding for one year, after undercover videos purportedly showed officials talking about the selling of fetal tissue. Senate Democrats blocked that effort, but with Trump in the White House, abortion opponents seized an opportunity to defund Planned Parenthood through the budget.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t possibly go wrong. [It is] the top priority of the president, the must-pass piece of legislation,\u201d Dannenfelser said. \u201cWe know we have the votes. The skids are greased, ready to go.\u201d\n\n[Two activists who filmed undercover videos of Planned Parenthood charged with 15 felonies]\n\nThe American Health Care Act, the bill from House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) to replace Obamacare, would essentially block Planned Parenthood clinics from getting Medicaid payments for one year. Medicaid and other taxpayer dollars can\u2019t be used for abortions, but conservatives argue that the money is all fungible and should not go to any providers of abortion services.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has been defending itself in part by playing up the non-abortion health care services it provides \u2014 such as contraception and cancer screenings \u2014 and even running ads featuring a patient talking about how a Planned Parenthood doctor encouraged her to give birth to her son instead of having an abortion.\n\n\u201cOne in five women has gone to Planned Parenthood for care in her lifetime,\u201d Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards said. \u201cEvery single member of Congress represents a Planned Parenthood patient, former patient or supporter. You cannot attack Planned Parenthood without serious consequences.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood remains the country\u2019s largest abortion provider, however, and will remain a key target for opponents who had hoped to see the end of their long-standing battle with the help of one-party GOP rule in Washington.\n\nFranks said if the stalled health-care discussions ultimately result in a better bill, it was \u201cworth the challenge.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we lose, it\u2019s a tragedy,\u201d he said.\n\nIf Congress and the White House ultimately don\u2019t follow through, conservatives are threatening retribution.\n\n\u201cIf it isn\u2019t done at all, there will be a lot of new faces in January 2019,\u201d McClusky said.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/mcconnell-nuclear-option-helps-senate-mccain-whoever-says-that-is-a-stupid-idiot/2017/04/05/d9d73aec-1a1a-11e7-9887-1a5314b56a08_story.html", "text": "The \u201cnuclear\u201d showdown in the Senate has split the chamber\u2019s most senior Republicans over how bad the fallout will be.\n\nOn one side is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who says that once Democrats filibuster Judge Neil Gorsuch, the GOP\u2019s unilateral response to confirm him on a simple majority vote will take senators \u201cback to what was the tradition in the Senate\u201d for confirming Supreme Court justices.\n\nIt will be, McConnell says, a good thing for the Senate.\n\n\u201cLook at the Senate through the long history of the body, the practical effect of all this will be to take us back to where we were,\u201d McConnell, 75, told reporters Tuesday.\n\nOn the other side is Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the fiery 80-year-old who sees this move as the next step in the inexorable slide to crushing the chamber\u2019s bipartisan traditions. He thinks senators who view this as a good step are, well, not fully in command of their faculties.\n\n(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cIdiot, whoever says that is a stupid idiot, who has not been here and seen what I\u2019ve been through and how we were able to avoid that on several occasions,\u201d McCain said Wednesday, recalling past efforts to defuse these judicial confirmation wars. \u201cAnd they are stupid and they\u2019ve deceived their voters because they are so stupid.\u201d\n\nEven so, McCain will support McConnell\u2019s move to eliminate the 60-vote threshold for reaching a final vote on approving Supreme Court justices to lifetime appointments. That will come after Democrats, as expected, formally block Gorsuch\u2019s nomination on Thursday.\n\n[The Fix: Sen. Merkley could have talked until he turned blue in the face. But he can\u2019t stop a vote on Gorsuch.]\n\nThere is no question that McConnell has the votes to change the Senate rules on a party-line vote. All 52 Republicans agree Gorsuch is a worthy nominee. They dismiss the Democratic opposition as a political reaction to McConnell\u2019s refusal to consider Judge Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination last year, and to the liberal base demanding resistance to anything President Trump proposes.\n\nThe dispute, instead, is about the future of the Senate. McCain and some senior Republicans assert that this will lead to the abolition of the filibuster in all its forms, including on legislation.\n\n\u201cThis is a body blow to the institution, and I think we\u2019re on a slippery slope,\u201d McCain said.\n\nMcConnell promised to protect the supermajority on legislation, saying that filibusters on nominations are a new phenomenon but those on legislation are essential to the Senate\u2019s essence.\n\nSen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), shown here at a rally for President Trump in Nashville, worries about blowing up Senate filibuster rules on legislation. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cThe legislative filibuster has been there a long time, everybody has been up or down, majority or minority at various times. We all understand that\u2019s what makes the Senate the Senate,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday.\n\nIt\u2019s been 100 years since the Senate adopted Rule XXII, which was established because President Woodrow Wilson grew tired of a small band of senators blocking his efforts to execute World War I.\n\nSo the Senate formally established how a supermajority could shut off debate, setting a two-thirds threshold for ending a filibuster. After a bloc of southern Democrats obstructed civil rights legislation, a large bipartisan group in 1975 lowered that threshold to just 60 of the 100 senators \u2014 leaving in place the two-thirds majority for a rules change.\n\nDuring George W. Bush\u2019s presidency, Senate Democrats blocked more than 10 of his nominees to the appellate courts, the first time judicial nominees regularly got blocked by the minority. Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), long before he became minority leader, drew up that strategy beginning in 2001.\n\nThis prompted Republicans to consider a unilateral move that would not technically be a rule change but would have the same effect. But McCain led a bipartisan \u201cGang of 14\u201d to save the filibuster in 2005. At the time, then-Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.), who helped advise McCain\u2019s group, dubbed it the \u201cnuclear option\u201d because it was such a partisan move that the fallout would be lasting.\n\n[Your guide to Neil Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court]\n\nSen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, agrees with Lott\u2019s prediction. In a little-noticed floor speech, Corker blasted unnamed senators who said the 2013 nuclear option by Democrats to end most filibusters on nominees and the pending Republican step were not bad for the Senate.\n\n\u201cSomebody acted like it was no big deal, that it had just gotten us back to where we had always been,\u201d Corker said last week, appearing to direct his critique at McConnell.\n\nHe recounted how, after Democrats first triggered the nuclear option to end filibusters on most nominees, the Senate practically stopped working.\n\n\u201cThere were days \u2014 not days, months \u2014 where people who had normally worked with people on the other side of the aisle just kind of shut down. It was hard to believe the nuclear option had been invoked,\u201d Corker said.\n\nNow, the sides have changed. McConnell has gone from hating the filibuster (2005) to supporting it (2013) to again trying to abolish it (2017) \u2014 an evolving set of positions that correlate with which party had the majority. Schumer has, coincidentally, held the exact opposite position of McConnell each step along the way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not where you stand, it\u2019s where you sit,\u201d McCain said.\n\nThat\u2019s why Corker argues that they will not be able to resist the temptation to blow up supermajority requirements on legislation.\n\n\u201cEverybody says, \u2018Oh, we are never going to do it on legislation.\u2019 Come on,\u201d Corker said, adding that the pressure from the respective party bases will become too much. \u201cGive me a break. Somebody is not living in reality.\u201d\n\nMcConnell has tried to reassure his GOP colleagues that will not happen. He says that all presidential nominees will now be free of the filibuster hurdle, returning the chamber to its traditional role of voting them up or down.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a single Senator in the majority who thinks we ought to change the legislative filibuster. Not one,\u201d he said.\n\nMcConnell was then told about McCain\u2019s sense that only a \u201cstupid idiot\u201d could say this was a good thing for the Senate. He laughed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I have any comment on that,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nRead more from Paul Kane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trumps-tough-talk-on-china/2017/04/05/32afc450-1a38-11e7-8598-9a99da559f9e_video.html", "text": "- President Trump met with China's president on April 6, after months of criticizing China and promising big trade changes.

Ryan (R-Wis.), a day after visiting separately with conservative hard-\n\nliners and moderates to gauge the potential for a revamped version of legislation that collapsed last month.\n\nThe crux of the new proposal would be to allow states to seek exemptions from certain mandates established under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 including a requirement that insurers cover 10 \u201cessential health benefits\u201d as well as a prohibition on charging those with preexisting medical conditions more than the healthy.\n\nWhile the largely behind-the-scenes effort generated optimistic talk, no clear path has emerged toward House passage of the Republican bill.

But the meeting broke after two hours without a clear resolution, though several participants said there was progress and plan to continue the discussions on Wednesday.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the Freedom Caucus chairman, said before the meeting that his group was still seeking broad relief from the ACA\u2019s insurance mandates. Afterward, he said there was debate but no real accord on that contentious issue.\n\n\u201cThere were no agreements tonight, and no agreements in principle, and certainly no agreements in terms of a foundation,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a general agreement that the progress we\u2019re making is certainly progress, and there are good discussions, but understanding that there\u2019s a whole lot of things that we have to work out.\u201d\n\nOthers \u2014 both Republicans and Democrats \u2014 objected to the idea of undoing protections for people with preexisting conditions. That ACA requirement, known as \u201ccommunity rating,\u201d prohibits insurers from segregating healthy subscribers from sick ones or charging the latter higher prices. Instead, they may vary their prices based only on age, geographic location and tobacco use, allowing the premiums paid by the healthy to subsidize the sick.\n\nSen. Patty Murray (Wash.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said in a statement that the proposal would \u201cgive power back to the insurance companies, increase costs, and undermine care for people with preexisting conditions.\u201d\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) on Capitol Hill last month. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nRep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.), a member of the Ways and Means Committee, called the provision \u201ca very significant reform\u201d that he was concerned about rolling back, even if states would have to be granted a waiver.\n\nThe new proposal could also allow states to strip back other mandates, including requirements that insurers provide coverage for mental-health care, substance abuse treatment, maternity care and prescription drugs.\n\nThe changes were largely calibrated to win over the hard-liners in the Freedom Caucus, who blame the mandates for driving up insurance premiums. But the proposal also takes into account the qualms of moderates who are wary of undermining the ACA\u2019s key reforms by requiring states to apply for waivers and to justify why insurers should not be required to provide certain coverage.\n\nThose moderates helped defeat the original version of the American Health Care Act nearly two weeks ago, largely out of concern over a similar provision governing essential health benefits. And advocates of the new proposal appeared to be making little headway Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWhile we haven\u2019t picked up any votes yet, this concept is already showing signs of losing a ton of them,\u201d said a House Republican leadership aide, who requested anonymity to speak more candidly.\n\nRyan said Tuesday that the talks were in the \u201cconceptual stages\u201d and did not commit to a timeline for resolving the differences that sank the bill last month. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we don\u2019t just win the votes of one caucus or one group,\u201d he said.\n\nPence sounded a similarly nonspecific note, telling a gathering of business executives at the White House that he and President Trump \u201cremain confident\u201d that Congress would repeal and replace the ACA.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer offered no timetable either, saying only that administration officials would continue meeting with lawmakers in hopes of advancing the bill.\n\n\u201cThe president would like to see this done if we can get a deal,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to raise expectations, but I think that there are more and more people coming to the table with more and more ideas about how to grow that vote.\u201d\n\nThough aides said Trump has been in touch with both House and Senate members in recent days, he was playing a much less visible role in deliberations than in the days leading up to the aborted vote. Aides said that was partly because of a string of visits this week from three world leaders.\n\nPence, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and budget director Mick Mulvaney began the two-day push to revive the repeal effort late Monday, with a trip to Capitol Hill to attend a Freedom Caucus meeting. Meadows said they offered a \u201csolid idea\u201d in that meeting to build a potential compromise around.\n\nBut both Freedom Caucus members and moderates emerged from a Tuesday morning House GOP conference lacking clarity on the path forward.\n\n\u201cRight now there are really just discussions, there\u2019s no deal in the works, there\u2019s been no deal on anything,\u201d said Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), a Freedom Caucus member.\n\nRep. Steve Womack (R-Ark.), a House leadership ally, said he didn\u2019t get the sense that a compromise was near.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get any vibe this morning of \u2018hold the phone, we may be close to a deal here,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no white smoke coming out of any leadership office that I\u2019m seeing.\u201d\n\nMeadows said late Monday that he expected that the proposal would be drafted into legislative text within 24 hours, but he said after the Tuesday-night meeting that no such text had been offered by the White House or congressional leaders, leaving \u201cunanswered questions\u201d for hard-liners.\n\nWhile addressing reporters, Spicer was asked whether a deal that rolled back protections for preexisting conditions would violate a campaign pledge by Trump. \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re having discussions.\u201d\n\nTwo other moderate House members also said they remained opposed: Rep. Frank LoBiando (R-N.J.) tweeted that he had \u201cseen nothing in terms of reported possible changes to American Health Care Act warranting reconsideration.\u201d And Rep. Leonard Lance (R-N.J.) said changes to community rating would undermine protections for those with preexisting conditions.\n\nOn the flip side, it was unclear just how many Freedom Caucus members could be swayed with the softened provision to give states the option of requesting exemptions to some of the ACA\u2019s mandates.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that a long-term solution consists of allowing states to ask the federal government for waivers, because presidents change,\u201d said Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.). \u201cStates ought to have as a matter of right the ability to determine what insurance policies for their citizens should contain.\u201d\n\nA health-care industry official argued that the proposed changes to the bill appear to leave in place most of the core problems with the original bill and exacerbate others by making changes that would effectively make insurance either too expensive or too skimpy for sick people.\n\n\u201cTo put it simply, this is making a bad bill worse,\u201d said the industry official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to speak frankly. The official added that his industry is waiting to see the details of the revised bill before weighing in publicly: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to rain on a parade until you know it\u2019s headed into town.\u201d\n\nAs part of his push to revive the bill, Pence also arranged on short notice a meeting and phone call Tuesday with some leading conservative activists who have been skeptical of the health-care proposals floated so far.\n\nThe group included Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List; Jim DeMint, president of the Heritage Foundation; Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform; Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity; and Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union.\n\nThe flurry of activity Monday and Tuesday raised some hopes that the closely watched legislation could be revived and passed through the House quickly. But with lawmakers ready to leave town Thursday for a two-week Easter recess, others questioned the rush.\n\n\u201cA lot of people would love to get this done this week \u2014 kind of unrealistic given all the changes that are being discussed,\u201d said Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.), a Freedom Caucus member who supported the original version of the AHCA. \u201cSome people want to come back next week \u2014 kind of unrealistic given all of the plans everybody has in their district for next week. And then the most realistic thing, I think, is to try and get something done when we get back.\u201d\n\nMeadows said Tuesday night that it was \u201cpremature\u201d to rule out a vote this week but also made clear no deal was at hand and there are \u201cno real discussions\u201d about potentially keeping the House in session to push the bill through.\n\n[\u2018It went off the rails almost immediately\u2019: How Trump\u2019s messy transition led to a chaotic presidency]\n\nRyan has taken a less direct role in the renewed negotiations, aides involved in the discussions say, out of a desire to let the various GOP factions work matters out on their own timetable rather than forcing a deal that could backfire.\n\nTrump took aim at the Freedom Caucus in tweets Thursday, pledging to \u201cfight them\u201d at the polls in the 2018 midterms.

One staunch Gorsuch critic, Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), took to the Senate floor Tuesday night to launch a marathon speech against him. Merkley\u2019s office said he planned \u201cto hold the floor and refuse to yield for as long as he is able to continue speaking.\u201d\n\nSen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who said Tuesday he would not try to broker any dispute involving judicial nominees, speaks to journalists at the U.S. Capitol on March 28. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nThe overall Democratic obstruction is expected to compel GOP leaders to eliminate a 60-vote requirement for Supreme Court nominees and allow confirmation of Gorsuch with a simple majority vote.\n\nThe partisan standoff underscores the sharp polarization that has seized Congress less than three months into Trump\u2019s presidency. Senate Democrats angered by Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 and McConnell\u2019s refusal to consider Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee last year \u2014 have united against Gorsuch, clinching enough votes to block him earlier this week.\n\nIt also heralds a potentially more contentious climate in the Senate, which traditionally has allowed the minority party to exert a powerful voice in debate over key nominations and legislation \u2014 unlike in the House. Senate Democrats changed the rules in 2013 to permit executive-branch nominees and federal judges to be approved by a simple majority, with the critical exception of Supreme Court selections.\n\n[Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks are likely to be easily confirmed. That\u2019s because of Senate Democrats.]\n\nBut doing away with the 60-vote barrier would eliminate the minority party\u2019s historic influence over who the president nominates to the high court and significantly decrease its ability to help exercise a check on the executive branch.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason they call it the \u2018nuclear option,\u2019 and that is that there\u2019s fallout. And this fallout will be dangerously and perhaps disastrously radioactive for the Senate in years to come,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).\n\nThe nuclear option \u2014 in this case, allowing high court nominees to be approved by a simple majority \u2014 may also further poison relations between Democrats and Republicans as each side is embittered by the other\u2019s behavior, from the GOP\u2019s move to block any consideration of Garland in 2016 to the Democratic blockade of Gorsuch now. That could have a practical impact on Trump\u2019s agenda, such as passing a complex tax package, health-care legislation and an infrastructure plan.\n\nMcConnell said that while he is prepared to deploy the nuclear option to overcome Democratic resistance to Gorsuch, he vowed not to end the 60-vote threshold on legislation while he is majority leader, maintaining what is known on Capitol Hill as the filibuster as it pertains to making laws.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no sentiment to change the legislative filibuster,\u201d he said.\n\nSenate Democrats said the only way they will end their resistance is if Trump submits a new nominee. They portrayed Gorsuch as outside the mainstream and expressed doubts that he has sufficiently demonstrated his independence from Trump.\n\n\u201cIf Senator McConnell is willing to be reasonable and cooperate in a bipartisan way, we can avoid the nuclear option,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.).\n\nAs Democrats and Republicans took turns on the Senate floor on Tuesday, they delivered sharply contrasting speeches. Democrats repeatedly brought up Garland, casting Gorsuch as beholden to wealthy corporate interests and not average Americans. Democrats expressed concern about confirming Trump\u2019s nominee at a time when ties between his team and Russia have come under heavy scrutiny.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). \u201cI think it is crazy that we are considering confirming a lifetime Trump nominee to the Supreme Court at a moment when the president\u2019s campaign is under the cloud of an active, ongoing FBI counterintelligence investigation that could result in indictments and appeals that will go all the way to the Supreme Court so that Trump\u2019s nominee could be the deciding vote on whether Trump or his supporters broke the law and will be held accountable. That is nuts.\u201d\n\nRepublicans portrayed Gorsuch as a more-than-qualified and mainstream judge with sterling career credentials and accused Democrats of caving to their political base.\n\n\u201cTheir base demands total war, total obstruction, and they are begrudgingly bowing to this demand. Unfortunately for them, it has proven difficult to invent attacks against an obviously well-qualified judge,\u201d said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.).\n\nThere were no signs, however, that senators were making serious moves on Tuesday to avoid the impasse. Signaling that any hopes of a compromise are probably dead, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who successfully brokered past disputes on judicial nominees, thanks to his close relationship with several Democrats, said that this time he is done trying.\n\nMcCain, who was part of a 2005 agreement among 14 senators of both parties to allow the confirmation of several of former president George W. Bush\u2019s federal court nominees without changing the rules, said talks between Democrats and Republicans in the past few days \u201cdidn\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d He declined to specify areas of disagreement.\n\nMeanwhile, the resistance against Gorsuch grew. Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, announced he would join the Democrats\u2019 blockade.\n\nIn a written statement explaining his decision to oppose Gorsuch, King accused the judge of providing answers to questions in his confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee that seemed \u201cat best, increasingly evasive, and, at worst, simply not forthright.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I am opposed to this nomination, it seems logical to oppose cloture because under the current rules, this would defeat the nomination,\u201d King said.\n\nIn a sign that at least some senators still want to avoid the showdown, Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) said that even though he plans to oppose Gorsuch and support the Democratic barricade, he is willing to work on an agreement that would stave off changes to how the Senate confirms Supreme Court nominees.\n\n\u201cThere are Democrats and Republicans who I hope will be talking this week, in the next two days, to see if we could find some path forward where we preserve the filibuster,\u201d Coons said in a CNN interview.\n\nSen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, said that he had been discussing a potential compromise with Democrats as recently as Monday but admitted \u201cI haven\u2019t made a real push\u201d to reach an agreement.\n\nPlans for a Democratic filibuster \u201care stupid. I think it\u2019s a big mistake,\u201d Hatch added.\n\n[How Senate Republicans will break the Democratic filibuster on Neil Gorsuch and get him on the Supreme Court]\n\nAll Republicans are expected to vote to confirm Gorsuch. Only a few Democrats will not stand in his way.\n\nDemocratic Sens. Joe Donnelly (Ind.), Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.) and Joe Manchin III (W.Va.) \u2014 all of whom are up for reelection in states won by Trump \u2014 say they plan to support Gorsuch. Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.), who represents Gorsuch\u2019s home state, says he won\u2019t support the filibuster but has yet to signal whether he would vote to confirm Gorsuch on the floor.\n\nThe four were the only Democrats who joined with Republicans in the 55-to-44 vote to move ahead with debate on Gorsuch\u2019s nomination Tuesday.\n\nA single-party filibuster has never successfully blocked a Supreme Court nomination. A bipartisan coalition used the procedural vote to defeat Abe Fortas\u2019s 1968 nomination to be chief justice.\n\nFor weeks, Republicans have warned that they will not hesitate to change the chamber\u2019s rules to confirm the 49-year-old federal appeals court judge if Democrats block him. A rules change will require majority support.\n\nAsked Tuesday if he is confident he has the votes to make that change, McConnell replied simply: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-trump-pursues-america-first-chinas-xi-sees-opening-for-primacy-in-asia/2017/04/04/c8b9b570-1937-11e7-855e-4824bbb5d748_story.html", "text": "President Trump\u2019s retrenchment of U.S. global leadership on issues such as free trade, climate change and multilateral alliances has opened the door for an unlikely rival to assert itself \u2014 China.\n\nSince Trump\u2019s unexpected victory in November, Chinese President Xi Jinping has moved to position his fast-developing nation as a defender of globalization, and he has accelerated Beijing\u2019s challenge to U.S. primacy in Asia.\n\nThis budding shift of power dynamics has alarmed U.S. allies and partners in the region and raised the stakes as Trump prepares to welcome Xi for a two-day summit starting Thursday at his Mar-a-Lago estate in South Florida. The two are expected to discuss a wide range of issues, including North Korea\u2019s mounting nuclear threat and a lopsided trade imbalance in China\u2019s favor, in what aides called a meeting aimed at establishing a working relationship.\n\nAdministration officials told reporters Tuesday that Trump will exhort Xi about the \u201curgent\u201d need to exert more economic pressure on Pyongyang to curb its nuclear and ballistic missile testing, as U.S. patience with North Korea has been exhausted after it turned down opportunities to join the \u201ccommunity of nations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe clock has now run out, and all options are on the table for us,\u201d one official said of North Korea.\n\n(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nIn an interview last weekend with the Financial Times, Trump suggested he would consider using the threat of trade sanctions as leverage to persuade Beijing to act with regard to Pyongyang.\n\n\u201cIf China is not going to solve the problem, we will,\u201d the president said. Speaking to business leaders in Washington on Tuesday, Trump said he had \u201ca lot of respect\u201d for Xi, but he emphasized China must do more to open its markets to U.S. companies. \u201cWe have to do better,\u201d Trump said.\n\nMore broadly, however, the Trump administration has not developed or publicly enunciated a coherent policy to deal with China\u2019s growing economic and military clout. And Trump, who called China a currency manipulator during his campaign, has delivered mixed messages on how far he is willing to go to confront Beijing.\n\nFor example, Trump angered Chinese leaders by accepting a congratulatory phone call from Taiwan\u2019s president after the election and questioning the United States\u2019 commitment to the \u201cone China\u201d policy that has undergirded the bilateral relations for decades. But, after Xi reportedly gave him the silent treatment, Trump agreed to honor the policy during a phone call.\n\nThe summit comes as Trump\u2019s administration has yet to fill leadership positions across government agencies, including the State Department and Pentagon, leading foreign policy analysts to fret that the Mar-a-Lago meeting is premature.\n\nWhite House aides said the summit is intended as a more informal affair similar to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s visit to Mar-a-Lago in February, although Xi, unlike Abe, will have no session with Trump at the White House.\n\nXi also is not expected to play golf with Trump in Florida as Abe did. Rather, the two men, and their wives, will spend about 24 hours together, including a dinner Thursday and working lunch Friday, White House officials said.\n\nPresident Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping begin a two-day summit Thursday at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla. (Paul J. Richards/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cSince there\u2019s no China policy we can discern, the question arises, \u2018On what basis is the president going to enter this talk?\u2019 Who the hell knows,\u201d said Robert D. Blackwill, who served as U.S. ambassador to India during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nIn 2015, Blackwill co-authored a paper, widely read in Washington, calling for a new \u201cgrand strategy\u201d aimed at containing China\u2019s rise.\n\n\u201cIt is very dangerous for presidents to be utterly extemporaneous in their interactions with major powers,\u201d said Blackwill, now a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cContrast that with the Chinese. Do we think that Xi Jinping will come to the meeting with a very clear set of strategic objectives and strategies? Absolutely.\u201d\n\nAnalysts said Xi, mindful of Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric, will seek to soothe his concerns and tout increased Chinese investment in the United States \u2014 a tactic also employed by Japan\u2019s Abe.\n\nAt the same time, Xi is expected to pursue his strategy of establishing China as a worthy rival to the United States in Asia. The Chinese leader, who took office in 2012, has sought buy-in from the United States for what he calls \u201ca new model of great power relations.\u201d It is Xi\u2019s concept for a system in which the two countries avoid conflict by agreeing not to meddle in each other\u2019s \u201ccore interests.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration, after initially echoing the phrase, quickly reversed course as China moved to expand its influence through an Asia trade pact that excluded the United States, an infrastructure development bank for Asian nations and provocative maritime operations in the East China Sea and South China Sea.\n\nLast month, however, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson raised eyebrows during a visit to Beijing when he appeared to endorse Xi\u2019s vision by parroting some of the language used by Chinese leaders.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re likely to do is feed into the sense in the Trump administration that disengagement from the global system is a good thing,\u201d said Michael Auslin, an author and Asia analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. He added that Xi will \u201cpresent Trump with a fait accompli that this is the new style of great power relations.\u201d\n\nTrump administration officials point to the president\u2019s push for greater military spending as evidence he does not intend to shy away from confrontation. During the campaign, Trump denounced China\u2019s maritime expansionism.\n\nBut the blustery unilateralism that has defined Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d agenda has already had consequences.\n\nWhile President Barack Obama sought to hedge against China\u2019s rise by building multilateral partnerships, Trump has moved to unwind them. In his first week, Trump signed an executive order pulling the United States out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership that Obama touted as an alternative to the Chinese trade model.\n\nLast week, Trump moved to reverse federal regulations established by Obama to curb U.S. carbon emissions, casting doubt on the United States\u2019 ability to meet its obligations under a global climate agreement signed in Paris in 2015 that includes China.\n\nInto the void stepped Xi, with a pair of speeches at an Asia-Pacific economic summit in Lima, Peru, last fall and at a forum of global economic elite in Davos, Switzerland, in January in which he offered a stout defense of liberalizing trade rules and taking steps on climate.\n\n\u201cIn my view, economic globalization . . . delivers benefits to all,\u201d Xi said in Lima. In Davos, he called the climate accord a \u201chard-won achievement\u201d and added that \u201call signatories should stick to it in instead of walking away from it.\u201d\n\nTrump did not send a representative to Davos, which took place days before he was sworn in \u2014 aides said he viewed the gathering as a betrayal of his populist campaign message.\n\n\u201cI do not want to be the president of the world,\u201d Trump said at an event hosted by building trade unions Tuesday.\n\nWhile analysts said China also is not interested in, or capable of, assuming the mantle of global leadership, they emphasized that Beijing\u2019s neighbors in Asia have been forced to rethink their relationships with the United States.\n\n\u201cThere are big opportunities for the Chinese as a consequence of the America first policy,\u201d said Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, a global risk assessment firm. \u201cA lot of countries that used to think they could count more on the United States and were already concerned under Obama are vastly more so under Trump.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/trump-and-house-conservatives-say-a-new-health-care-deal-is-possible-weve-been-down-this-road-before/2017/04/04/b3703fb0-195d-11e7-9887-1a5314b56a08_story.html", "text": "Vice President Mike Pence and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus depart after a Senate Republican luncheon at the Capitol on Tuesday. Pence and Priebus are both trying to broker a deal with House Republicans to revive efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. (Aaron P. Bernstein/Bloomberg)\n\nTrump administration officials and arch conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus have gotten off to a rocky start, driven at least in part by their mutual tendency to hear what they want to hear from the other side.\n\nTwo weeks ago, as talks built to a dramatic failure of a Republican proposal to overhaul the nation\u2019s health-care system, conservative lawmakers praised their discussions with President Trump\u2019s top advisers. After each White House visit, these Republicans returned to the Capitol proclaiming that, deep down, the president was on their side in opposing key portions of a draft that had been assembled by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.).\n\n\u201cI the administration actually wants a free-market solution to this,\u201d Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) said on the evening of March 22, as his Freedom Caucus compatriots continued their push for \u201ca conservative solution\u201d to Ryan\u2019s original proposal. \u201cWe\u2019re on the same side as the administration.\u201d\n\nA day later, White House officials shut down negotiations and demanded that everyone fall in line \u2014 and Ryan scheduled a vote for the next morning, March 24. We all know how that ended \u2014 the vote never happened because support for the legislation collapsed. By last week, Trump and Freedom Caucus members were fully engaged in a Twitter war over which side was telling the truth.\n\nIt\u2019s worth recalling this scenario now that administration officials, led by Vice President Pence and budget director Mick Mulvaney, have re-engaged the conservative caucus in talks to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act and replace it with new tax incentives.\n\nIt\u2019s worth taking careful measure of optimism that doesn\u2019t necessarily add up to 216 votes \u2014 the number needed to get a bill out of the House.\n\nLate Monday night, after a huddle with Pence, Mulvaney and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Freedom Caucus members emerged preaching optimism. The White House trio had presented a \u201csolid idea,\u201d Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the chairman of the Freedom Caucus, told reporters.\n\nThe latest negotiation is centered on allowing individual states to apply for waivers from mandates such as \u201cessential health benefits,\u201d which provide coverage in critical areas such as mental health, substance abuse and maternity care. This is a modified version of a key issue from the standoff two weeks ago, when the conservatives pushed for and won inclusion of a provision to eliminate the essential benefit coverage.\n\n[\u2018The closer\u2019? The inside story of how Trump tried and failed to make a deal on health care]\n\nThis effort is trying to thread the needle between conservatives who want to see lower premiums in the insurance markets, which they think would result once coverage mandates are lifted, and mainstream Republicans who balk at the idea of denying coverage for critical areas such as pregnancies.\n\nEveryone says they\u2019re open to finding common ground between the conservative and moderate flanks of the House Republican Conference, both of which recoiled at the Ryan legislation in late March and delivered an embarrassing defeat to the speaker and the new president.\n\nThe question is whether all sides are hearing one another\u2019s concerns or, as they did in previous talks, are interpreting the discussions as evidence of a shift in their direction.\n\nRyan seems to think that the latter scenario is repeating itself. He has managed to keep a close watch on the renewed talks without attaching his credibility to them.\n\nTaking a couple minutes\u2019 worth of questions at his leadership media briefing, Ryan used some mix of \u201cconcept\u201d or \u201cconceptual\u201d eight separate times to describe the stage of these Pence-led talks with the Freedom Caucus.\n\nHe dismissed talk of a vote this week by saying that it was \u201cpremature to say where we are\u201d and declared that he would not set \u201can artificial deadline\u201d for considering the legislation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re throwing around concepts to improve the bill. That\u2019s occurring right now, but that is not to say that we are ready to go,\u201d he said.\n\nA political intelligence firm, the Cowen Washington Research Group, summed up the state of talks in a simple declaration in a communication to its investment firm clients: \u201cPolicy purgatory \u2014 don\u2019t confuse commotion for motion.\u201d\n\n[Republicans try to revive health-care effort as leaders seek to temper expectations]\n\nA few weeks back, the Capitol was filled with commotion.\n\nPence and Mulvaney were engaging in shuttle diplomacy, huddling at the White House with the conservative Freedom Caucus and the moderate Tuesday Group, then heading over to Ryan\u2019s office at the Capitol for more meetings with the conservatives and then the moderates. The cycle repeated itself over and over, including trips up Pennsylvania Avenue for face-to-face meetings with the president.\n\nEach side seemed to not fully grasp what the other was saying \u2014 or else some people simply couldn\u2019t take yes for an answer. In the final 36 hours of those talks, the essential benefits issue remained a key focus as the conservatives demanded the legislation include language that would abolish those guaranteed portions of coverage.\n\nTrump\u2019s team agreed, and House GOP leaders began drawing up a new version to include this nod to conservatives. But no one had bothered to get a guarantee that this meant that the Freedom Caucus would come aboard.\n\nThe morning after Mulvaney, their former colleague in the caucus, declared that the negotiations were finished, the conservatives remained largely opposed to the legislation. And then moderates began jumping ship, announcing they were opposed to the more conservative legislation.\n\nFast forward to this week.\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon Meadows began expressing optimism about a renewed effort to get to yes and said that the approximately three dozen Republicans who had declared their opposition to the legislation might reconsider.\n\n\u201cAnything that gets changed substantially allows you to walk back those declarations,\u201d he said.\n\nJust don\u2019t expect Ryan to take a stance on these new talks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s premature to say where we are or what we\u2019re on, because we\u2019re at that conceptual stage right now,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more from Paul Kane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trump-says-devos-is-highly-respected-and-has-one-of-the-toughest-jobs/2017/04/04/775e5f2c-1979-11e7-8598-9a99da559f9e_video.html", "text": "- At a CEO town hall on April 4, President Trump said the state of education is \u201csad\u201d and that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has one of the toughest jobs of anyone in his cabinet.

Missing from the list for the post of national security adviser was retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, according to two knowledgeable officials.\n\nFlynn was a loyalist who had a close relationship with Trump. It was obvious to the transition team that Trump would give him a prominent appointment. But among some of those tasked with bringing forward prospective candidates, there was a belief that Flynn was ill-suited for the critically important job of coordinating national security policy in the new White House.\n\nTrump, however, had his own list of candidates, and Flynn was at the top. Eleven days after winning the election, he announced Flynn as his choice. Twenty-four days after Trump was sworn in as president, Flynn was forced out for having misled Vice President Pence and others about communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn later acknowledged that he had worked on behalf of the Turkish government while serving as a campaign adviser. Last week, through his lawyer, he offered to testify, in exchange for immunity, in the ongoing investigations of Russian interference in the election.\n\nViewed through the lens of the first months of the new administration, Trump\u2019s transition provided the template for what has unfolded since Inauguration Day on personnel and other matters. No transition goes exactly as planned, but Trump\u2019s proved messier than most and that has carried over into the first months of his presidency.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Trump took a hands-off approach to transition preparations. It was bad karma, he believed, to start planning a presidency before he won the election. Once elected, he decided to run things his own way. \u201cIt went off the rails almost immediately after the election,\u201d said one knowledgeable person who spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment.\n\n(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\n[Trump remains the center of attention \u2014 but politically he is increasingly isolated]\n\nOne effect was that the Trump team could not scale up quickly enough during the transition and, therefore, failed to maintain a full pipeline of appointees for the new administration. The Partnership for Public Service, in collaboration with The Washington Post, has been tracking 553 key administration positions that require Senate confirmation. To date, just 21 nominees have been confirmed, with 20 more formally nominated and an additional 25 awaiting nomination.\n\nThe pace of critical subcabinet appointments remains a serious problem, with many agencies sparsely populated at the top. An administration official said announcements generally have been held back until proper vetting can take place, which did not occur during the transition. The hope is that, once nominated, confirmations can be completed more quickly.\n\nTrump\u2019s management preferences, honed in his business, also overrode the recommendation of some transition planners for a White House structured with clear lines of authority and a strong chief of staff. That structure was meant to discipline the president\u2019s mercurial style. Instead, Trump created a White House of multiple and competing power centers, personal rivalries and internal conflict.\n\nMartha Joynt Kumar, director of the White House Transition Project, a nonpartisan organization that aids new administrations, said that course was set when Trump named Reince Priebus as chief of staff and in the same release named Stephen K. Bannon as senior counselor and chief strategist.\n\n\u201cYou knew right there that was going to be a White House that was not going to be organized in a regular hierarchical fashion, as most Republicans develop them,\u201d Kumar said. \u201cYou knew there that was going to be a White House where conflict was going to be something the president saw as positive.\u201d\n\nKumar noted one other thing about the transition that has plagued the administration since Inauguration Day: The president\u2019s habit of continuing to raise grievances about the campaign. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t leave the election behind, and it\u2019s still been difficult for him,\u201d she said.\n\n(The Washington Post)\n\nTrump\u2019s transition was the first one conducted after passage of the Presidential Transitions Improvements Act of 2015 and the operation did much good work, both in the pre-election planning and in preparing for a new administration after the election. The team combed through almost 87,000 r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, identified more than 500 people to go into agencies after Inauguration Day, conducted hundreds of interviews of prospective nominees and established new procedures from which future transitions could profit.\n\nThose kinds of accomplishments led Ken Nahigian, who played a central role in both the pre-election and post-election phases, to say, \u201cThis transition was as smooth and well executed as we ever could have expected.\u201d\n\n[Flynn told Trump he might register as a foreign agent]\n\nBut the transition operated as two units, one in Washington, where the bulk of the staff was based, and the other at Trump Tower, where the president-elect and his top campaign advisers were located. \u201cThe operation went forward, but it wasn\u2019t connected to the decision-makers,\u201d said Max Stier, the president and chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service. He added that, despite the planning done ahead of the election, Trump and his inner circle \u201ccreated a decisional process that was opaque and held by a few people.\u201d\n\nOn Election Day, Trump\u2019s transition advisers presented the president-elect\u2019s inner circle with 30 binders of materials. One binder provided the overview and outlined detailed recommendations for the 73-day presidential transition then commencing. This was to serve as a road map designed to assure, to the extent possible, an orderly start for the new administration. A copy of that transition planning material was provided to The Post.\n\nThe documents included proposed hour-by-hour schedules for the president-elect as he began the transition; week-by-week transition messaging themes aimed at highlighting Trump\u2019s campaign promises; ambitious timetables for completing congressional action on those promises; drafts of executive orders; policy backgrounders; a lengthy memo analyzing a White House staff structure; and landing teams assigned to key executive branch agencies, most approved by members of Trump\u2019s family.\n\nThe materials represented the fruits of months of work by Trump\u2019s transition team. Then, days after the election, the transition took an unexpected turn. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, the transition chairman, was removed from his position and replaced by the vice president-elect.\n\nChristie friends say he was the victim of a power play by Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and the husband of Ivanka Trump, and was told that when he was informed of the change. As U.S. attorney in New Jersey, Christie had been involved in the prosecution of Kushner\u2019s father, which resulted in a jail sentence. At the time of Christie\u2019s demotion in November, transition spokesman Jason Miller said reports that Kushner had pushed him aside \u201ccouldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\u201d\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s close advisers had concerns that pre-election convictions of former Christie allies Bill Baroni and Bridget Kelly in the 2013 George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal tarnished Christie and would reflect badly on Trump. Baroni and Kelly were sentenced to prison terms last week.\n\nSome Trump loyalists simply didn\u2019t trust Christie, whom they saw as still bitter that he had not been picked as Trump\u2019s running mate. Another charge was that the work was not being done at the rate it needed to be, although a summary document presented to Trump\u2019s inner circle the day before the election showed no area where the transition was behind schedule.\n\nThere also were reports that the transition staff and volunteers were stocked with Washington lobbyists. There were lobbyists among those recruited during the fall, but according to four knowledgeable officials, the transition moved to bar them after Trump delivered his \u201cdrain the swamp speech\u201d in October. \u201cWhen he put down the rule about lobbyists, we adjusted,\u201d one of the officials said.\n\n\u201cI personally made a presentation on November 11th to 200 to 250 transition employees and volunteers, including potential members of landing teams,\u201d said William Palatucci, who served as transition general counsel and was a longtime Christie confidant. \u201cIf you wanted to be part of the transition team and on a landing team, there was a lobbying ban.\u201d There also were prohibitions against working for a foreign government, as it turned out Flynn had been doing.\n\n[Trump and his advisers can\u2019t keep quiet, and it\u2019s becoming a problem]\n\nAlthough Trump remained aloof from the transition team, his family provided oversight on his behalf. Transition leaders met weekly with an executive committee composed of Trump\u2019s children Ivanka, Don Jr. and Eric, as well as Kushner and other campaign officials.\n\nThe original transition blueprint was ambitious and detailed. \u201cThe day after Election Day \u2014 Day Next \u2014 the presidential transition will launch in the form of a shadow White House and will function through the 73-day period leading up to the Inauguration,\u201d according to the overview briefing book. While acknowledging there could only be one president at a time, the transition document proposed \u201ca strategic approach that departs from the historical precedent of \u2018laying low\u2019 during the presidential transition.\u201d\n\nAt times, Trump simply ignored the recommendations. The transition team wanted Trump to observe Veterans Day by flying to Washington for a possible event at the National World War II Memorial. As one person with close knowledge of the transition put it, \u201cYou come with a plan and he modifies it. He\u2019s the boss.\u201d\n\nThe legislative timetable was hugely ambitious. One transition document, for example, called for Congress to complete work on repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act by Feb. 24, or Day 36 of the administration. The GOP health-care bill wasn\u2019t even introduced by that date and was pulled from a House vote last month after meeting fierce resistance, even from many Republicans.\n\nThe transition team had prepared lists of prospective candidates not only for the Cabinet but also for many of the other senior positions throughout the executive branch, about 300 in all. The sequencing was designed to provide a steady stream of personnel decisions to assure that the new administration would be able to populate the upper ranks of executive branch agencies as rapidly as possible.\n\nAhead of the election, transition leaders spent two full days culling longer lists of names to between four and six for each key position. Prospective candidates recommended for national security adviser included retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, who was selected for defense secretary; retired Marine Gen. Peter Pace, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; retired Adm. William H. McRaven, who oversaw the raid that killed Osama bin Laden and is now chancellor of the University of Texas System; and K.T. McFarland, the current deputy national security adviser.\n\nFlynn was penciled in as a possible director of national intelligence, for which transition officials believed he was better suited than national security adviser.\n\nCabinet selections were to be made quickly after the election but withheld until at least Thanksgiving. \u201cWe wanted him to make [Cabinet] selections privately so we could do vetting privately before announcements,\u201d said one official with knowledge of the process who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private information.\n\nInstead of an orderly rollout, however, the process quickly went Trumpian. Candidates were called to meet with Trump at Trump Tower or at his golf course in Bedminster, N.J., in a process that critics likened to a reality-TV show. Announcements sometimes were made through press release rather than by the candidate in a public setting. The process rather than the announcements became the theater \u2014 and the narrative."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/susan-rice-may-be-of-interest-to-us-says-senate-intelligence-chairman/2017/04/04/c6f58bd6-195c-11e7-855e-4824bbb5d748_story.html", "text": "The Senate Intelligence Committee chairman is not ruling out interviewing former national security adviser Susan Rice over allegations that she sought to have the identities of President Trump\u2019s transition team revealed in foreign surveillance reports.\n\n\u201cIf the reports are right,\u201d Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said on Tuesday, \u201cthen she will be of interest to us.\u201d\n\nSome Republican lawmakers have been clamoring for the Senate Intelligence Committee to force Rice to testify under oath after a report from Bloomberg\u2019s Eli Lake suggested Rice on dozens of occasions requested the identities of people connected to Trump be \u201cunmasked.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to Susan Rice, you need to verify, not trust,\u201d Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said Tuesday during an interview on Fox News. \u201cI think every American should know whether or not the national security adviser to President Obama was involved in unmasking Trump transition figures for political purposes.\u201d\n\nSen.

A Washington Post report found that at least three White House officials are tied to the files that were shared with Nunes, while the Bloomberg report suggests that those officials began handling the files after they discovered Rice\u2019s requests to unmask certain people\u2019s identities.\n\n[Three White House officials tied to files shared with House intelligence chairman]\n\nNunes would not comment Monday night on whether Rice was in any way associated with the documents he had seen.\n\nBut Republicans have long been suspicious of Rice, who emerged as a central figure in the party\u2019s long probe of what led to the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012.\n\n\u201cSusan Rice is the Typhoid Mary of the Obama administration foreign policy. Every time something went wrong, she seemed to turn up in the middle of it,\u201d Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Tuesday on Hugh Hewitt\u2019s radio program.\n\nHe also said there was \u201cno doubt\u201d that Rice should be the subject of a committee hearing, pledging that the Intelligence Committee \u201cought to review...and will review\u201d both Rice\u2019s alleged actions and questions raised by Nunes\u2019s claims.\n\nAs national security adviser, Rice had the authority to request to see the identities of names that otherwise would have been obscured in surveillance reports. That authority applied to situations where knowing the identity of a person contained in the report was necessary for understanding its intelligence value.\n\nRice said on MSNBC Tuesday that that was the only context in which she ever requested the \u201cunmasking\u201d of any names \u2013 \u201cabsolutely not for any political purposes, to spy, expose, anything.\u201d\n\nShe also denied being the source of any leaks \u2014 another area of focus for Congress as it probes the extent of the Trump team\u2019s ties to Russian officials.\n\nBurr has repeatedly promised that his Intelligence Committee will follow the facts surrounding Russia\u2019s suspected interference in the 2016 elections wherever they lead. This week, the panel embarked on 20 interviews, most of them with members of the intelligence community that played a role in compiling a January assessment determining that Russia had tried to interfere in the 2016 elections with the purpose of helping Trump.\n\nIn the House Intelligence Committee, a similar probe all but ran aground last week, as Democrats accused Nunes of going around the committee to coordinate with the White House on the surveillance reports and alter the roster of witnesses testifying before the panel.\n\nNunes, like many others Republicans, has focused on the leaks of information alleging ties between the Kremlin and the Trump team, calling them the only clearly criminal act that took place and stressing there is no evidence of collusion between Trump allies and Russian officials. Democrats, however, have accused Nunes of effectively facilitating improper leaking himself when he went to the White House to view the information he then referred to publicly.\n\nAfter a week and a half of wrangling, committee ranking member Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) also went to the White House Friday to view those documents. He said in a statement that the materials would soon be made available to the entire committee.\n\nBut House Democrats and Republicans are still at odds over how their investigation can proceed.\n\nNunes cancelled a public hearing for last week with former director of national intelligence James R. Clapper, former CIA director John Brennan, and former acting attorney general Sally Yates. The Washington Post reported that the administration sought to prevent Yates\u2019s testimony, but Nunes maintained the hearing was cancelled to allow committee investigators to again grill FBI Director James B. Comey and NSA Director Adm. Mike Rogers.\n\nNunes said in an interview Monday evening that the committee might resume certain interviews later this month, as soon as the third week of April. But he stressed there were still some witnesses whose testimony would have to wait until after Comey and Rogers return. Nunes said that Comey was the one holding tup hat briefing; a spokesperson for the FBI said Tuesday that the agency was \u201ccontinuing to work with the committee on its requests.\u201d\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/what-to-know-about-the-back-and-forth-over-unmasking/2017/04/04/5bc9df60-196b-11e7-8598-9a99da559f9e_video.html", "text": "- With allegations targeting former Obama national security adviser Susan E.

(Pavel Golovkin/AP)\n\nCarter Page, who served briefly as a foreign policy adviser to Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, made an appearance in a federal espionage case because he communicated several years ago with a Russian intelligence agent under surveillance by the FBI.\n\nIn a statement released Tuesday, Page confirmed his role in the 2015 Justice Department spy case, adding another twist to the still-unfolding story of Trump\u2019s peculiar and expanding ties to people connected to Russia.\n\nPage said he assisted U.S. prosecutors in their case against Evgeny Buryakov, an undercover Kremlin agent then posing as a bank executive in New York. Buryakov was convicted of espionage and released from federal prison last week, a few months short of completing a 30-month sentence. Buryakov agreed to be immediately deported to Russia.\n\nPage\u2019s involvement was first disclosed Monday by BuzzFeed, which said Page was identified as \u201cMale 1\u201d in the Justice Department\u2019s complaint against a Russian spy network based in New York.\n\nIn a written exchange with The Washington Post, Page confirmed playing a role in the case but declined to discuss details.\n\nEvgeny Buryakov sits in court in New York on Jan. 26, 2015.

(Jane Rosenburg/Reuters)\n\n\u201cGiven the very light masking in the original document from January 2015, you can draw your own conclusions,\u201d Page wrote.\n\nAccording to the court records, the FBI interviewed Page as part of the case against three Russian men identified as agents of the Russian overseas intelligence agency, the SVR. One of them, Buryakov, was operating undercover as an executive in the New York office of a Russian development bank, Vnesheconombank.\n\nThe case resurfaced in news accounts last week when President Trump\u2019s adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, acknowledged he had met with the head of the same bank in December.\n\nThe complaint includes transcripts from 2013 of wiretapped conversations among the Russians discussing their efforts to recruit Male 1, identified as a New York energy trader whom the Russians described as willing to talk.\n\nIn his statement, Page compared the revelation of his role to \u201cthe politically-motivated unmasking standards seen in the Obama Administration which have recently been exposed.\u201d\n\nHe said the information was released as \u201cretribution for my public positions of dissent\u201d against Obama administration policy toward Russia. The information about his role in the case \u201camplified the reputational damage against me\u201d that has occurred through 2016, Page said. After he was named by Trump as a foreign policy adviser, news reports discussed his travel to Russia and his frequent criticism of U.S. policy toward Russia under Obama.\n\nAccording to the 2015 complaint filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York, Page met with a Russian agent, Victor Podobnyy, in January 2013 at an energy conference in New York. It says that from January to June of that year, Page as Male 1 \u201cprovided documents to [Podobnyy] about the energy business.\u201d At the time, the Russians were seeking information on U.S. sanctions and on energy development.\n\nAlthough Page communicated with the Russian agents in 2013, he said the information he provided was innocuous.\n\n\u201cAs I explained to federal authorities prior to the January 2015 filing of this case, I shared basic immaterial information and publicly available research documents\u201d with the spy who was serving then as a junior attache at the Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the United Nations.\n\n\u201cIn doing so, I provided him nothing more than a few samples from the far more detailed lectures I was preparing at the time for the students in my Spring 2013 semester \u2018Energy and the World: Politics, Markets and Technology\u2019 course which I taught on Saturdays at New York University.\u201d\n\nDuring an interview with The Washington Post editorial page staff in March 2016, Trump identified Page, once a Merrill Lynch investment banker in Moscow, as a foreign policy adviser to his campaign.\n\nBut in January, after Page\u2019s name came up in news reports about Trump administration ties to Russia, Trump press secretary Sean Spicer declared that \u201cCarter Page is an individual the president-elect does not know.\u201d\n\nPage, a longtime energy executive, is a U.S. Naval Academy graduate who rose through the ranks at Merrill Lynch before founding his current firm, Global Energy Capital. He previously was a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he focused on the Caspian Sea region and economic development in former Soviet states. He is also a fellow at the Center for National Policy in Washington and has a PhD from the University of London.\n\nHe made a speech in Moscow in July that included some criticism of U.S. policy.\n\nThe White House has energetically rejected the idea that Trump or his allies coordinated with Russia during the election. The president has said investigators and the public should focus instead on leaks of information and reports that he and his advisers were improperly surveilled by the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cThe real story turns out to be SURVEILLANCE and LEAKING! Find the leakers,\u201d Trump tweeted Monday morning.\n\nPage has said repeatedly in recent weeks that he would like to tell his story to congressional investigators looking at Russian government efforts to influence the course of the 2016 election and the leak of information about that effort.\n\n\u201cI very much look forward to providing further evidence regarding last year\u2019s historic crimes committed against me and all Americans,\u201d Page said."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trump-to-construction-workers-together-we-are-going-to-rebuild-our-nation/2017/04/04/886037d2-1956-11e7-8598-9a99da559f9e_video.html", "text": "- President Trump told assembled construction workers that he intends to \u201crebuild\u201d America, at the 2017 North America\u2019s Building Trades Unions National Legislative Conference on April 4 in Washington.

(Scott Eisen/Getty Images)\n\nShaking out the Internet doesn\u2019t result in tidy piles of content: some real, some fake; some human, some automated; some sincere, some trolling. The nature of the online world is baked into its name. It\u2019s a web of conflicting and conflicted stories, arguments and people that can make identifying how and why something has seized the popular attention often tricky.\n\nKate Starbird, a researcher at the University of Washington, first realized this directly when she was studying the online reaction to the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010. Analyzing a dataset of 600,000 tweets about the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, she helped put together a map of how information was shared among those close to the event and more broadly. In addition to tweets about the likely effects of the spill, she noticed an undercurrent of another type of information: misinformation about the most dire possible outcomes \u2014 often coming from politically focused accounts.\n\n\u201cThere were these weird claims the ocean floor was going to collapse and there was going to be a tsunami of oil coming ashore,\u201d Starbird said when we spoke by phone last week. \u201cIt was confusing. I remember people were emotionally affected and scared about this, people that lived in the area.\u201d One woman who lived in Louisiana even sent Starbird a panicked message asking if that risk was real. It wasn\u2019t, of course. But the story was shared within that community as though it might be, including by one Twitter user central to the conversation whose main focus during the spill was using it to be critical of Barack Obama.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, Starbird revisited that discussion and noticed something resonant.\n\n\u201cI went back and tracked some of these articles using the Wayback Machine and they cited Russian scientists, and they went through right-wing blogs that we might call alt-right now,\u201d Starbird said, referring to the Internet Archive\u2019s tool for cataloging the history of websites. \u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t notice what was going on, but with the benefit of hindsight, you notice that this stuff was happening for a long time.\u201d\n\nWhile Starbird didn\u2019t document any direct influence from Russian actors in her analysis, it would not have been the only instance of their behaving in that way. In his analysis of a Russian disinformation agency for the New York Times in 2015, journalist Adrian Chen documented an incident from 2014 in which Russians actively spread a news story about a disaster at a chemical plant in Louisiana, going so far as to create fake Web pages and news videos to add realism to the effort. Why? As Chen later explained, the intended effect \u201cwas not to brainwash readers but to overwhelm social media with a flood of fake content, seeding doubt and paranoia, and destroying the possibility of using the Internet as a democratic space.\u201d\n\nIn early 2016, Starbird and her research team embarked on a different but related analysis. Over the course of the first nine months of the year, they gathered any tweet about a shooting incident in the United States, including tweets using the words \u201cshooting,\u201d \u201cshootings,\u201d \u201cgunman\u201d or \u201cgunmen\u201d and any tweets that used language indicating skepticism about the official story of an attack: \u201choax,\u201d \u201cfalse flag\u201d \u2014 meaning an attack secretly launched by authorities to push a political agenda \u2014 and \u201ccrisis actor,\u201d a term for people theoretically playing roles in a false-flag type of attack. The team then analyzed the data, looking at how \u201calternative narratives\u201d \u2014 a nonjudgmental way of saying \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d \u2014 took root and spread.\n\nOf course, the first nine months of 2016 was a particularly interesting time to document the spread of rumors on the Internet. And, sure enough, Starbird documented an ecosystem with which many would soon become intimately familiar as the campaign of Donald Trump was bolstered by the same sort of doubt and factual relativism that Chen\u2019s Russians sought to sow.\n\nThe graph below shows the result of Starbird\u2019s work. Bigger dots show domains that were mentioned more frequently in tweets her team analyzed. The size of links between them indicate how frequently the same user tweeted links to those two domains. They are colored by type: purple is mainstream media; aqua, alternative media; red, government-controlled media.\n\nThe story that image tells isn\u2019t simple to extract. For example, why, in a network of conspiracy theories, is The Washington Post so big?\n\nOne of the major shooting events Starbird documented was the attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. As it turns out, The Post debunked conspiracy theories about that attack. We\u2019d also written about a professor who was fired for claiming that the attack at Sandy Hook was a hoax. Both of those articles were resonant within that universe of people discussing whether or not shootings in 2016 were real or manufactured, for perhaps obvious reasons. And one less obvious reason: That The Post was debunking the conspiracy theories was seen by some as evidence supporting the theory. After all, the Establishment must have been spooked if The Post were going to that trouble.\n\nAs Starbird summarized that argument: \u201cLook, the mainstream media says this is untrue. This is even more evidence that it must be true.\u201d\n\nSeveral sites were central to sharing and fostering the hoax theories: BeforeItsNews.com, NoDisinfo.com and VeteransToday.com. One trait she noticed among this galaxy of sites was that the same story or theory was often repurposed among multiple sites, giving readers an impression of corroboration when what was actually happening was duplication.\n\nAlso prominent is Newsbusters.org, a site run by the conservative group Media Research Center \u2014 which itself is heavily funded by the Mercer family, who helped guide Trump\u2019s victory in 2016. Newsbusters\u2019 stated aim is to unearth the bias of the \u201cliberal media\u201d \u2014 meaning, in short, that it\u2019s in the business of positioning many mainstream media outlets as fundamentally untrustworthy, making it of use to those wishing to promote alternative narratives.\n\nIt\u2019s prominent in Starbird\u2019s graph, she said, mostly thanks to another name that you may be familiar with from the 2016 election: Mike Cernovich, a prominent voice in the far-right social media community. A Cernovich tweet of a Newsbusters story about how CNN edited a statement from the victim of a shooting was used by Cernovich to suggest that mainstream narratives are often wrong.\n\nTwo Russian government-backed sites, RT.com and Sputnik, were also included in the alternate-narrative conversations. RT (formerly Russia Today) would duplicate stories from a site called 21stCenturyWire \u2014 a site which was generally shared by users in Starbird\u2019s dataset who also shared stories from NoDisinfo and VeteransToday.\n\nA node on that graph you might expect to see is Infowars, a site predicated on sharing poorly sourced theories of this nature. But Infowars, while prominent, stands apart from the main network. That\u2019s in part because a lot of the accounts tweeting Infowars links were automated, Starbird said.\n\n\u201cIt was amplified by an army of bots,\u201d she said. Of the tweets she collected, \u201cprobably 80 percent, maybe even 90 percent were accounts that sent only one tweet that I captured, it pointed to Infowars, it was usually a retweet of another account.\u201d This was evidence, she said, of a \u201cpretty unsophisticated bot.\u201d\n\nBots played a much bigger role in boosting another site \u2014 so much so that Starbird removed it from the graph because it was so inflated. TheRealStrategy.com \u201ccoordinated hundreds of accounts that tweeted content related to several different alternative narratives from these events and others,\u201d she writes in an article about her research.\n\nThese bots were much more sophisticated and looked more like actual social media users.\n\n\u201cWe think they were borrowing a set of accounts or leasing them,\u201d Starbird said, \u201cwhere certain accounts all of a sudden changed their profiles to become part of this botnet for a set period of time, and then they go back and later they\u2019re tweeting about something else for somebody else.\u201d In his analysis, Chen noted that the Russian disinformation agency was also selectively loyal. While many of the users he was following had stopped tweeting by the middle of 2016, \u201csome continued,\u201d he writes, \u201cand toward the end of last year I noticed something interesting: many had begun to promote right-wing news outlets, portraying themselves as conservative voters who were, increasingly, fans of Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nThe central challenge Starbird encountered was in determining \u201cwhich properties are emergent and which properties are orchestrated\u201d \u2014 that is, what parts of a network of conspiracy theorists is a function of natural skepticism and information-sharing and which part is bolstered by the use of automation and/or to promote a particular idea. Starbird\u2019s study, limited in scope, couldn\u2019t suss out where that boundary might lie.\n\nHer research, though, did reveal a common theme from 2012 \u2014 when she analyzed the Deepwater Horizon spill data \u2014 through 2016: a group of sites focused mainly on opposition to \u201cglobalist\u201d and corporate hegemony that peddled in alternative explanations for the world around them. These themes (and that strategy) have been echoed by Trump and his team.\n\nIt also demonstrated to her the extent to which these sites and this network powers an alternate arguments in American politics, bot-driven or not.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how far these ideas are echoing,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt just became clear to me that they weren\u2019t as marginal as I originally thought they were.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/im-somewhat-intrigued-by-the-lack-of-interest-spicer-critiques-press-over-coverage/2017/04/04/bc078ba8-1901-11e7-8598-9a99da559f9e_video.html", "text": "- White House press secretary Sean Spicer took the media to task on April 3 for what he called a \"lack of interest\" in allegations that Obama administration officials abused access to intelligence.

Ryan (R-Wis.), a day after visiting separately with conservative hard-\n\nliners and moderates to gauge the potential for a revamped version of legislation that collapsed last month.\n\nThe crux of the new proposal would be to allow states to seek exemptions from certain mandates established under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 including a requirement that insurers cover 10 \u201cessential health benefits\u201d as well as a prohibition on charging those with preexisting medical conditions more than the healthy.\n\nWhile the largely behind-the-scenes effort generated optimistic talk, no clear path has emerged toward House passage of the Republican bill.

But the meeting broke after two hours without a clear resolution, though several participants said there was progress and plan to continue the discussions on Wednesday.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the Freedom Caucus chairman, said before the meeting that his group was still seeking broad relief from the ACA\u2019s insurance mandates. Afterward, he said there was debate but no real accord on that contentious issue.\n\n\u201cThere were no agreements tonight, and no agreements in principle, and certainly no agreements in terms of a foundation,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a general agreement that the progress we\u2019re making is certainly progress, and there are good discussions, but understanding that there\u2019s a whole lot of things that we have to work out.\u201d\n\nOthers \u2014 both Republicans and Democrats \u2014 objected to the idea of undoing protections for people with preexisting conditions. That ACA requirement, known as \u201ccommunity rating,\u201d prohibits insurers from segregating healthy subscribers from sick ones or charging the latter higher prices. Instead, they may vary their prices based only on age, geographic location and tobacco use, allowing the premiums paid by the healthy to subsidize the sick.\n\nSen. Patty Murray (Wash.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said in a statement that the proposal would \u201cgive power back to the insurance companies, increase costs, and undermine care for people with preexisting conditions.\u201d\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) on Capitol Hill last month. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nRep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.), a member of the Ways and Means Committee, called the provision \u201ca very significant reform\u201d that he was concerned about rolling back, even if states would have to be granted a waiver.\n\nThe new proposal could also allow states to strip back other mandates, including requirements that insurers provide coverage for mental-health care, substance abuse treatment, maternity care and prescription drugs.\n\nThe changes were largely calibrated to win over the hard-liners in the Freedom Caucus, who blame the mandates for driving up insurance premiums. But the proposal also takes into account the qualms of moderates who are wary of undermining the ACA\u2019s key reforms by requiring states to apply for waivers and to justify why insurers should not be required to provide certain coverage.\n\nThose moderates helped defeat the original version of the American Health Care Act nearly two weeks ago, largely out of concern over a similar provision governing essential health benefits. And advocates of the new proposal appeared to be making little headway Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWhile we haven\u2019t picked up any votes yet, this concept is already showing signs of losing a ton of them,\u201d said a House Republican leadership aide, who requested anonymity to speak more candidly.\n\nRyan said Tuesday that the talks were in the \u201cconceptual stages\u201d and did not commit to a timeline for resolving the differences that sank the bill last month. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we don\u2019t just win the votes of one caucus or one group,\u201d he said.\n\nPence sounded a similarly nonspecific note, telling a gathering of business executives at the White House that he and President Trump \u201cremain confident\u201d that Congress would repeal and replace the ACA.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer offered no timetable either, saying only that administration officials would continue meeting with lawmakers in hopes of advancing the bill.\n\n\u201cThe president would like to see this done if we can get a deal,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to raise expectations, but I think that there are more and more people coming to the table with more and more ideas about how to grow that vote.\u201d\n\nThough aides said Trump has been in touch with both House and Senate members in recent days, he was playing a much less visible role in deliberations than in the days leading up to the aborted vote. Aides said that was partly because of a string of visits this week from three world leaders.\n\nPence, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and budget director Mick Mulvaney began the two-day push to revive the repeal effort late Monday, with a trip to Capitol Hill to attend a Freedom Caucus meeting. Meadows said they offered a \u201csolid idea\u201d in that meeting to build a potential compromise around.\n\nBut both Freedom Caucus members and moderates emerged from a Tuesday morning House GOP conference lacking clarity on the path forward.\n\n\u201cRight now there are really just discussions, there\u2019s no deal in the works, there\u2019s been no deal on anything,\u201d said Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), a Freedom Caucus member.\n\nRep. Steve Womack (R-Ark.), a House leadership ally, said he didn\u2019t get the sense that a compromise was near.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get any vibe this morning of \u2018hold the phone, we may be close to a deal here,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no white smoke coming out of any leadership office that I\u2019m seeing.\u201d\n\nMeadows said late Monday that he expected that the proposal would be drafted into legislative text within 24 hours, but he said after the Tuesday-night meeting that no such text had been offered by the White House or congressional leaders, leaving \u201cunanswered questions\u201d for hard-liners.\n\nWhile addressing reporters, Spicer was asked whether a deal that rolled back protections for preexisting conditions would violate a campaign pledge by Trump. \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re having discussions.\u201d\n\nTwo other moderate House members also said they remained opposed: Rep. Frank LoBiando (R-N.J.) tweeted that he had \u201cseen nothing in terms of reported possible changes to American Health Care Act warranting reconsideration.\u201d And Rep. Leonard Lance (R-N.J.) said changes to community rating would undermine protections for those with preexisting conditions.\n\nOn the flip side, it was unclear just how many Freedom Caucus members could be swayed with the softened provision to give states the option of requesting exemptions to some of the ACA\u2019s mandates.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that a long-term solution consists of allowing states to ask the federal government for waivers, because presidents change,\u201d said Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.). \u201cStates ought to have as a matter of right the ability to determine what insurance policies for their citizens should contain.\u201d\n\nA health-care industry official argued that the proposed changes to the bill appear to leave in place most of the core problems with the original bill and exacerbate others by making changes that would effectively make insurance either too expensive or too skimpy for sick people.\n\n\u201cTo put it simply, this is making a bad bill worse,\u201d said the industry official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to speak frankly. The official added that his industry is waiting to see the details of the revised bill before weighing in publicly: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to rain on a parade until you know it\u2019s headed into town.\u201d\n\nAs part of his push to revive the bill, Pence also arranged on short notice a meeting and phone call Tuesday with some leading conservative activists who have been skeptical of the health-care proposals floated so far.\n\nThe group included Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List; Jim DeMint, president of the Heritage Foundation; Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform; Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity; and Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union.\n\nThe flurry of activity Monday and Tuesday raised some hopes that the closely watched legislation could be revived and passed through the House quickly. But with lawmakers ready to leave town Thursday for a two-week Easter recess, others questioned the rush.\n\n\u201cA lot of people would love to get this done this week \u2014 kind of unrealistic given all the changes that are being discussed,\u201d said Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.), a Freedom Caucus member who supported the original version of the AHCA. \u201cSome people want to come back next week \u2014 kind of unrealistic given all of the plans everybody has in their district for next week. And then the most realistic thing, I think, is to try and get something done when we get back.\u201d\n\nMeadows said Tuesday night that it was \u201cpremature\u201d to rule out a vote this week but also made clear no deal was at hand and there are \u201cno real discussions\u201d about potentially keeping the House in session to push the bill through.\n\n[\u2018It went off the rails almost immediately\u2019: How Trump\u2019s messy transition led to a chaotic presidency]\n\nRyan has taken a less direct role in the renewed negotiations, aides involved in the discussions say, out of a desire to let the various GOP factions work matters out on their own timetable rather than forcing a deal that could backfire.\n\nTrump took aim at the Freedom Caucus in tweets Thursday, pledging to \u201cfight them\u201d at the polls in the 2018 midterms. He remained active on Twitter over the weekend, suggesting that the situation was still fluid \u2014 and that he is looking at ways to move forward with the help of either moderate Democrats or conservative Republicans.\n\nThe president also played a round of golf Sunday with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), the libertarian-oriented former presidential candidate who has been a sharp critic of the House bill and celebrated its failure less than two weeks before.\n\nPaige Winfield Cunningham, Carolyn Y.

Wow!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat made my decision a lot easier, with 22 candidates,\u201d Rogers said.\n\nWendy Carrillo takes a photograph with a crowd of supporters during a rally for her campaign in Los Angeles on April 1, 2017. Carrillo is a candidate for Congress in California\u2019s 34th district. (Dania Maxwell/FTWP)\n\nGomez, the Harvard-educated son of Mexican immigrants, is the front-runner in the first congressional race of the Trump era. It\u2019s happening in a part of America where Republicans are becoming scarce.\n\nIn 2000, the last year that a Republican presidential candidate campaigned in California, George W. Bush won 29.5 percent of the vote in what\u2019s now the 34th Congressional District. In 2016, Donald Trump won just 10.7 percent. California\u2019s unique primary system means that the top two candidates from the April 4 primary, regardless of party, will advance to the June 6 general election. The overwhelming partisan nature of the district means that two Democrats \u2014 one of whom is expected to be Gomez \u2014 are likely to advance.\n\nGomez is not exactly on the vanguard of the new progressive resistance movement that is sweeping the country in protest of Trump. He\u2019s been endorsed by a slew of elected officials \u2014 and the California Democratic Party itself. But his background \u2014 and liberal politics \u2014 has not turned off progressives. Gomez supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 race, but a surge of new voters won the district for Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u201cI like him a lot, and I\u2019ve known him a long time,\u201d Rep. Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), the co-chair of the House Progressive Caucus, said of Gomez. \u201cYou have a lot of progressives in that race, but Jimmy\u2019s progressive, too. Credential-wise, it\u2019s a win-win for us.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the district\u2019s very blueness that\u2019s made it a proving ground for liberal politics. To win back the House in the 2018 midterms, the Democrats would have to flip districts in California, as well as the increasingly competitive states of Arizona and Texas, where the Latino and Asian populations are growing quickly.\n\nAt the same time, the Trump victory has been driving Latino politics to the left \u2014 a movement that outside groups encourage. Even though Becerra endorsed Clinton for president last year, two of Gomez\u2019s rivals, Wendy Carrillo and Arturo Carmona, worked for Sanders in California and are touting that connection. In 1992, the last time the area elected a new congressman, just nine Democrats ran. This year, the field had doubled.\n\nThe district, meanwhile, is 65 percent Hispanic, and every leading candidate but one is Latino.\n\n\u201cWhat we see are Latinos joining other groups to push back on the Trump administration\u2019s attacks on women\u2019s access to health services, health care, environmental protections, and other key social issues,\u201d said Latino Victory Project President Crist\u00f3bal Alex. \u201cWe are witnessing a wave of qualified Latinos who see it as their duty to run for office at all levels to defend their communities and fight back against Trump and this hostile administration.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s played out in the 34th, which starts in downtown Los Angeles and stretches west to Koreatown and north to Pasadena. Gomez rose through the Latino political network, serving as a congressional staffer, then moving to L.A. and winning a safe Assembly seat. He\u2019s raised $245,000 for the House race \u2014 much of it from political action committees and political allies. His campaign literature rattles off endorsements from Becerra, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), the leaders of the state legislature and the California Democratic Party.\n\nCarmona, the deputy political director of the Sanders campaign in California, has tried to flip Gomez\u2019s endorsements against him. In a negative mailer, he warns voters that the assemblyman has taken $13,000 from \u201cde escuelas charter,\u201d or charter schools, and $73,700 from \u201ccompa\u00f1\u00edas farmac\u00e9uticas,\u201d or pharmaceutical companies. In an interview near Mariachi Plaza, Carmona declined to attack Gomez personally, but bemoaned candidates who \u201care taking or have taken hundreds of thousands of dollars from interests that are hurting immigrants, that are hurting consumers.\u201d\n\nThe outside arbiters of progressive politics have declined to enter the race \u2014 in part, because Gomez has ceded so little room to his left. He reminds voters that he expanded paid family leave in California, that he supports single-payer health care and a $15 minimum wage. On Saturday, when volunteers arrived at Gomez headquarters to walk precincts, they were signed in by Yolanda Nogueira, a local business owner who\u2019d housed \u201cNortheast L.A. for Bernie\u201d in her building.\n\n\u201cTo me, \u2018the establishment\u2019 means people who are out of touch with the people they\u2019re elected to represent,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cSomeone like Bernie Sanders can be in office for 30 years, but he\u2019s not the establishment.\u201d\n\nNeither Sanders nor his group Our Revolution has endorsed a candidate. Cenk Uygur, whose Young Turks network and Justice Democrats PAC are based just outside of the district, said several candidates had reached out to him. Gomez\u2019s only apparent strike was that he backed Clinton for president.\n\nThe risk progressives see in deep-blue seats is not that Democrats will lose, but that opposition to Trump will allow the candidates opposed by progressives to blur the lines.\n\nIn the 34th, every leading candidate puts the president near their message\u2019s center. Gomez\u2019s mail features the warning that \u201cthe first congressional election in the U.S. since Trump won will be held . . . in OUR community.\u201d Former journalist Alejandra Campoverdi, also a candidate, tells voters she\u2019s \u201cthe proven fighter we need to stand up to Donald Trump.\u201d Sara Hernandez, a teacher-turned-political aide, is running TV ads promising to take Trump \u201cto school\u201d and fight deportations.\n\nAnother problem for a progressive candidate emerged in the form of social-media posts from women in the Sanders campaign who worked with Carmona, accusing him of incompetence and sexism. Several progressive groups had already bet on Carmona as the best \u201cBernie\u201d candidate. Democracy for America, which had endorsed Sanders, condemned Carmona. In an interview, Carmona insisted that he was being smeared.\n\n\u201cThere were definitely some entrenched issues around sexism in the broader campaign,\u201d Carmona said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that sexism exists in our society. I have worked to be an ally all my life, and all my career. But when it comes to these specific three or four attacks, they\u2019re not only unsubstantiated, they\u2019re false.\u201d\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/spicer-responds-to-propublica-story-on-trumps-trust/2017/04/03/089a2e96-18e7-11e7-8598-9a99da559f9e_video.html", "text": "- White House press secretary Sean Spicer said on April 3 that he wasn't aware of any changes to President Trump's trust, after a ProPublica investigation revealed new records showing the trust agreement allows Trump to withdraw money upon request.

Kushner will head back from Iraq, for instance, in time to join Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida for two days of meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping, which he helped facilitate.\n\n(Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)\n\nBut Kushner\u2019s outsize role has led to larger-than-life sniping and resentments, with rivals whispering that he has little depth and lacks the self-awareness to know what he doesn\u2019t know, and allies arguing that he has hired a team of top deputies, many from outside government. His entrepreneurial background, they say, is exactly what Trump meant when he promised to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of Washington.\n\n\n\nKushner also comes with financial entanglements, with new disclosures showing that he and his wife, Ivanka Trump, have property and investment holdings worth as much as $740 million. In perhaps the clearest sign of Kushner\u2019s penchant for multitasking, he had to resign from 260 boards and business entities simply to take a job in the White House.\n\n[Inside Trump\u2019s White House, New York moderates spark infighting and suspicion]\n\nSimply put: Kushner\u2019s role and relationship with the president \u2014 neither chief of staff nor regular political adviser \u2014 come with no precedents.\n\nThomas Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, compared the Trump-Kushner dynamic to \u201ca mob family operation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if Trump is the don and he only trusts his close family members,\u201d Mann said. \u201cThere\u2019s no indication that experience in the real estate business prepares one for the tasks at hand. It\u2019s the hubris of a businessman imagining he can run government just because he\u2019s a businessman. I don\u2019t know if Jared Kushner shares the hubris of his father-in-law, but he\u2019s certainly willing to say, \u2018Yes, sir.\u2019 \u201d\n\nDoug Wilson, a former assistant secretary of defense for public affairs in the Obama administration, seconded the notion that Trump\u2019s reliance on Kushner stems from the reality that \u201cthe group of people Trump trusts is really small.\u201d\n\nJared Kushner listens to his father-in-law, President Trump, during a roundtable with cyber-security experts at the White House on Jan. 31. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThe trip to Iraq, at the invitation of Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is yet another example of Kushner\u2019s mushrooming portfolio of ostensible responsibilities. Less than 100 days into Trump\u2019s presidency, the list includes Canada, China and Mexico; brokering a peace deal in the Middle East; helming a new office devoted to overhauling the federal bureaucracy; and serving as the unofficial West Wing therapist and Trump whisperer.\n\nBut the visit to a crucial country of U.S. interest that Kushner had never visited before also serves to illustrate just how little foreign policy and governing experience the 36-year-old real estate heir has.\n\nIn a breach of protocol, senior White House officials confirmed Kushner\u2019s trip to Iraq before he landed, raising concerns from the Pentagon. U.S. military officials usually provide information about trips by senior officials under the condition, for security reasons, that the media not report them until the officials already have touched down in a country.\n\nDuring his daily briefing with reporters Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer found himself insisting that Kushner had not, in fact, also added Iraq to his purview.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think to, sort of, then translate it into he\u2019s overseeing Iraq is an accurate assessment,\u201d Spicer said.\n\nSpicer said Kushner\u2019s role is in part one of delegation. \u201cHe has a team that he oversees,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cThere is a team, depending on the subject, that is working with him. And he is providing oversight and direction.\u201d\n\nDuring the campaign, Kushner began quietly amassing power, acting as a jack-of-all-trades troubleshooter who, by the end, was basically the de facto campaign manager.\n\n[Jared Kushner proves to be a shadow diplomat on U.S.-Mexico talks]\n\nHe also served as the primary point of contact with presidents, ministers and ambassadors from more than two dozen countries and quickly emerged as the phantom chief diplomat within the administration. In one remarkable moment in January, Kushner ushered the foreign minister of Mexico into the Oval Office, where the two men huddled with Trump to rework a speech the president was giving on U.S.-Mexico relations later that day.\n\nAnd late last month, the president announced that Kushner would lead a new White House Office of American Innovation, a team dedicated to streamlining the federal bureaucracy.\n\nAll of which has raised a somewhat uncomfortable question for the White House: If Kushner\u2019s wife, Ivanka, is perhaps the Trumpian embodiment of women having it all (three kids, a West Wing office, a polished public persona), can her husband actually do it all?\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s taken on a portfolio that is unprecedented in White House history,\u201d said Paul Light, a professor at New York University who studies the presidency. \u201cMy experience is that somebody who has this much in his or her portfolio is not doing anything particularly well. They\u2019re going to flit in and out.\u201d\n\nIt is, he added, \u201cremarkable, unprecedented and unwise.\u201d\n\nDennis A. Ross, a counselor at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and a former American envoy to the Middle East, said achieving peace in the Middle East \u2014 one of Kushner\u2019s many tasks \u2014 has bedeviled diplomats for decades.\n\n\u201cGiven the reality of the state of relations between the Israelis and the Palestinians, the gaps between them psychologically have never been so great,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take a lot of diplomatic effort and done quietly.\u201d\n\nBut, Ross added, in an arena where trust and relationships loom large, Kushner\u2019s direct line to the president is a valuable asset. He sees Kushner positioning himself more as a traditional secretary of state rather than a day-to-day negotiator.\n\n\u201cIf he were to be the envoy, he has too many other things to do to fulfill that role,\u201d Ross said. \u201cBut if his role is to be someone who intervenes at certain strategic moments, that\u2019s probably much more manageable, given all he needs to be doing.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Kushner\u2019s ballooning portfolio has become something of a media punchline. After the innovation office was announced, the Huffington Post ran a story that imagined Kushner\u2019s daily schedule under the cheeky headline: \u201cWhite House Announces Jared Kushner Is Now Responsible For Everything.\u201d\n\nBut White House aides and congressional staffers mock Kushner at their own peril, and some refuse to even speak about him. Kushner was instrumental in pushing out Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s first campaign manager, and he also signed off on the ouster of Paul Manafort, Lewandowski\u2019s replacement.\n\nTimothy Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University, said the best parallel he could think of was John S.D. Eisenhower, the son of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who served as a national security adviser during his father\u2019s presidency.\n\n\u201cHe was very helpful to the president in teeing up issues,\u201d Naftali said.\n\nBut, he added, the comparison has its limits. \u201cJohn Eisenhower had had a career in the U.S. military and was an amateur historian, so he had some relevant background,\u201d Naftali said."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/she-voted-illegally-but-was-the-punishment-too-harsh/2017/04/03/34198b02-0f0f-11e7-9d5a-a83e627dc120_story.html", "text": "\n\nRosa Ortega is hugged by her daughter Gracie Garza, 12. Son Rene Garza, 16, stands next to them. (Cooper Neill for The Washington Post)\n\nRosa Ortega stirred herself awake at the sound of a prison guard yelling in her dreams.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a nightmare,\u201d Oscar Sherman assured her as the pair rested in his low-slung apartment complex in a desolate part of town. \u201cIt\u2019s over now.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mind\u2019s not right,\u201d Ortega said later that afternoon. \u201cI have nightmares. I can\u2019t combine foods. I\u2019m always on top of everything, but my brain hurts. It can\u2019t stop thinking about the situation.\u201d\n\nThe situation is that Ortega, 37, voted illegally and has become the national face of voter fraud, a crime that President Trump and other Republicans believe is an epidemic endangering the integrity of American elections, even though no evidence supports the claim.\n\nMexican born and Texas raised, Ortega voted in Dallas County after filling out a registration form saying she was a U.S. citizen. She did the same after she moved one county over, which led detectives to knock on her door. Ortega told them she thought she could vote because she has a green card. Isn\u2019t that enough?\n\nIt isn\u2019t. After successfully convicting her on voter fraud charges, Texas Assistant Attorney General Jonathan White asked the jurors to deliver a punishment they thought was fair.\n\nBefore Ortega, \u201cfair\u201d usually resulted in a minor penalty \u2014 community service or probation. In the 38 illegal voting cases Texas has resolved since 2005, only one defendant received more than three years in prison. And that was a public official who admitted to registering noncitizens to help her win an election.\n\nBut by February 2017, the notion of what was fair had changed.\n\n\u201cEight years,\u201d Ortega remembers hearing, as her family started to sniffle in the background. After that, she would likely be deported to Mexico.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Ortega wondered. \u201cWhy me, God? Eight years for signing a piece of paper wrong. I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. I don\u2019t have any criminal record. Why am I the example?\u201d\n\nHer defense attorney, Clark Birdsall, said he was so upset at the jury members that he could not even look at them. But he didn\u2019t entirely blame them.\n\nCandidate Donald Trump warned of his own election being rigged, and President Trump baselessly alleged that as many as 5 million illegal ballots cost him the popular vote. With his claims that Mexico doesn\u2019t send the United States \u201cits best\u201d and his calls for mass deportation, Trump had fostered \u201ca sense of ill-will\u201d toward minorities, Birdsall said. And he believed that atmosphere helped to \u201cwarp the perspective of the jurors.\u201d\n\n(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nThe case rippled across a country divided over the scale and impact of voter fraud and the assertions of opinion over facts. Did Ortega\u2019s harsh sentence help to deter a societal problem, or was it the consequence of some modern-day myth?\n\nFor Ortega, who spent a month in jail and is out awaiting appeal, the consequences were severe. She was a sixth-grade dropout and mother of four teenagers, worked temp jobs, prayed in church and loved hugging her Chihuahua mixes. She lived with Sherman, the children and the pets in a two-floor apartment complex with chipped paint and broken air-conditioning, surrounded by a boarded-up key-making shop, an empty lot and a convenience store.\n\nThree of the teenagers and two of the dogs, Little Girl and Mae, crowded her on the couch one recent afternoon while she watched Halle Berry movies. Her youngest, Gracie, 12, now always clinging to her mom, braided her waist-length brown hair into a long french braid. Half-eaten \u00adslices of pizza and their boxes were stacked on a wobbly dining table.\n\nOut of nowhere, Ortega asked: \u201cWho is coming with me to Mexico?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will go, Mommy,\u201d Gracie said.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t go,\u201d 14-year-old Clara said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll come visit.\u201d\n\nHer eldest, 16-year-old Rene, paused and looked down. \u201cIt\u2019s just I can\u2019t right now,\u201d he said. His girlfriend was recently caught in a crossfire and got shot in the leg, and he couldn\u2019t bear to think about leaving her. \u201cShe\u2019s hurting.\u201d\n\nNow it was Ortega who was looking down. Her voice began to break.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re thinking about your future,\u201d she said.\n\nHer future seemed to rest on a country she thought had lost its sense of compassion. After her \u00adtrial, the state\u2019s Republican attorney general, Ken Paxton, proclaimed that \u201cthe outcome sends a message that violators of the state\u2019s election law will be prosecuted to the fullest.\u201d\n\nTo Ortega, it was more than an insult. It was betrayal.\n\n\u201cI voted for him,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nRosa Ortega looks at her son Rene Garza, 16, while her daughter Gracie Garza, 12, braids her hair in Grand Prairie, Tex. (Cooper Neill/For The Washington Post)\n\nOrtega checks so many boxes that conservatives covet: Young. Female. Hispanic. She wasn\u2019t much for politics before she met Sherman, but his father loved to watch Fox News and before long she found that she did, too.\n\n\u201cI always liked the idea of people doing things for themselves and being for business,\u201d she said, explaining why she was a Republican. \u201cAnd I\u2019m religious.\u201d\n\nShe first voted in Dallas County in 2004, records show. On a form, the county asked whether she was a U.S. citizen. The question was trickier to her than it seemed.\n\nFrom the time she was in diapers, Ortega had bounced from one side of the border to the other with her mother. She settled in Dallas when she was about 13 after she received a green card, although she insists no one told her what that meant. She spoke English with a small twang and loved barbecue, and always viewed herself as \u201cmore than just an immigrant.\u201d If the county was asking her to choose, she had little doubt which best represented her: citizen.\n\nThe Bible is next to the couch with old family photos in Grand Prairie, Tex. (Cooper Neill/For The Washington Post)\n\nIn 2006, two years after she first registered to vote, then-Attorney General Greg Abbott began a campaign to root out the \u201cepidemic of voter fraud.\u201d\n\nInitially, some Texas Democrats agreed that mandatory photo IDs might be a good idea. State Rep. Rafael Anchia (D) said he had been open to the efforts, but he then \u201cstarted to see cracks in the narrative. I started asking myself what is this about? It was clear this was about suppressing the vote of black and brown people.\u201d\n\nSupport dissipated further after a PowerPoint by Abbott. Slide 25 showed a queue of citizens lining up to vote illegally \u2014 and they were all black. Slide 61 used a stamp encouraging testing for sickle cell anemia \u2014 a disease commonly found in blacks \u2014 as an example of an \u201cunusual stamp\u201d that should trigger concerns about foul play.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans agree that there is a problem with voter apathy in Texas \u2014 only West Virginia, Tennessee and Hawaii had lower participation rates in 2016.\n\nDemocrats say this is because of the state\u2019s history of intimidating minority voters. Advocates have taken the state to court every time lawmakers have tried to redraw districts since 1970, arguing that they were attempting to dilute the voting power of growing black and Hispanic populations. Each time, the state lost.\n\nRepublicans say low turnout stems from an entrenched belief that the system is rigged.\n\n\u201cOne thing in Texas is there\u2019s one side that wins, and the other side thinks they cheat,\u201d said state Rep. Phil Stephenson (R), a lawmaker from the southeastern part of Texas. \u201cThat\u2019s probably why more people don\u2019t get off their taters and vote.\u201d\n\nDemocrats beat back efforts to install a voter ID law until the swell in popularity of the tea party movement and, in 2011, Gov. Rick Perry fast-tracked the passage of the measure in an overwhelmingly Republican legislature. After five years of legal battles, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled the law discriminatory in July and struck it down.\n\nThis year, Republicans in the legislature are pushing another voter ID law, although no agency has been able to identify widespread voter fraud \u2014 the Abbott investigation only yielded 38 cases of illegal voting out of more than 20 million votes. Lawmakers now say the law is needed not simply because they think there is a problem, but because they have created the perception of one.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if voter fraud exists, but people need to have faith in our system,\u201d said state Rep. Cecil Bell (R) of rural Waller County. \u201cOur Constitution rests on the right to have a reliable voting system. It shouldn\u2019t be ignored or left unaddressed.\u201d\n\nAmong the people who agree with this perspective is Rosa Ortega. She knows lots of people who distrust the voting process. She was in love with one of them.\n\n\n\nRosa Ortega and Oscar Sherman at a park in Grand Prairie, Tex. (Cooper Neill/For The Washington Post)\n\nOscar Sherman, 27, a balding, red-haired trucker who prides himself on being such a Texas conservative that he is one of the \u201cfew people who didn\u2019t turn his back on W.\u201d \u2014 referring to George W. Bush. Still, he doesn\u2019t vote. He said he thinks the system is too corrupt.\n\n\u201cVoter fraud happens every day,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cAnd it ain\u2019t just Mexicans cheating. . . . I don\u2019t even need to prove it, I know there are dead people voting and people who aren\u2019t supposed to vote voting.\u201d\n\nDuring Ortega\u2019s trial, prosecutors asked Sherman whether he suspected he was dating one of them. His response, he recalled, was, \u201cthat\u2019s a stupid-ass question.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you meet someone,\u201d Sherman said, \u201cyou stare into her eyes, you ask her what she likes to do. You don\u2019t ask what her citizenship status is.\u201d\n\nHe first stared into her eyes at the Metro Diner in Dallas in 2008, where he was a morning regular who ribbed the new waitress for bringing his sweet tea in a glass and not in a to-go cup.\n\nThey went on a few dates and began to hit it off: two talkative Texans who loved watching movies. She developed a love for the country, riding with him through all 48 lower states. He taught her to shoot her first hog. After two years, they were engaged.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think I would fall in love with a guy like him,\u201d Ortega said. \u201cBut he was kind and funny.\u201d\n\nIn a matter of months, she and her children from a previous marriage moved into his house in Dallas and he took pride in being the provider for the family. \u201cShe makes me feel great, and makes me feel like a man,\u201d he said.\n\nThey moved in 2014 from Dallas to Tarrant County \u2014 blue county to red county \u2014 so Ortega\u2019s children could go to better schools. On Oct. 21 of that year, records show Ortega filled out a county voter registration form. This time she checked the box that said she was not a U.S. citizen.\n\nThat was accurate. But it also was a \u201cmistake,\u201d her attorney maintained. Ortega thought she was a citizen and had checked the wrong box.\n\nWhite, who prosecuted her, thought \u201cshe probably forgot\u201d that she needed to indicate she was a citizen to vote.\n\nOrtega went to the polls eager to vote for Abbott, the attorney general behind the effort to eradicate voter fraud, to become the next governor of Texas. When she was denied, according to both lawyers, she called the county\u2019s election department to explain the situation.\n\nThe supervisor told her either she was a citizen and could vote or she checked the wrong box, Birdsall said. Ortega asked for another form. This time, both lawyers agree, she checked U.S. citizen.\n\nNearly a year later, about 9:30 a.m. on Oct. 8, 2015, Ortega answered her door. There were two detectives with dogs who asked her to step outside, where they secretly recorded their conversation.\n\n\u201cLooks like you applied to register to vote,\u201d Sgt. Boone Caldwell said to Ortega, according to the transcript.\n\n\u201cMmhmm,\u201d Ortega responded.\n\n\u201cSo are you a citizen?\u201d Caldwell asked.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cA U.S. citizen?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not U.S. citizen.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, so did you know you can\u2019t vote as a non-U.S. citizen?\u201d Caldwell asked.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that because Dallas never had, you know what I\u2019m saying, like, a problem with that.\u201d\n\nThe detectives showed her the voter registration forms.\n\n\u201cI mean they say you are a U.S. citizen and you signed it,\u201d Caldwell said, \u201cbut you\u2019re not . . . So yeah, don\u2019t vote, don\u2019t vote again until you get your citizenship.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you I got that one,\u201d Ortega said. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019? I ain\u2019t sending it no more.\u201d\n\nThe interview was completed at 9:54 a.m. Ortega immediately called Sherman, who was delivering lettuce in New York.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to jail,\u201d she told him.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he responded.\n\nA month later, she was arrested.\n\n\n\nRosa Ortega and Oscar Sherman at their home in Grand Prairie, Tex. (Cooper Neill/For The Washington Post)\n\nThings began to unravel at home. Ortega\u2019s family used to take votes on where to eat out for dinner, but the children wanted little to do with anything that sounded like democracy.\n\nRene, Ortega\u2019s oldest child, yelled at her for snitching on herself to the police, and then wondered whether his mom was being punished because he was a bad son. Sherman tried to keep her mind off things, planning a special trip to a casino in Oklahoma, where he said he splurged for a \u201ccorner room in a nice motel.\u201d\n\nBy early 2016, Ortega was pregnant, soon to miscarry, she believes from the stress. \u201cWhat if I go to jail and I\u2019m pregnant,\u201d she recalled feeling.\n\nSherman said he felt there was little to fret over. \u201cMe, as the O.J. Simpson expert, watching the show, I wasn\u2019t worried,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew all you need is a short, Mexican woman from the grocery store and you get a hung jury.\u201d\n\nThe jury was composed of two men and 10 women, one of whom had a Hispanic surname and another who was African American. Transcripts from the trial are not yet available, but the lead attorneys, Ortega and Sherman all agreed on the details.\n\nBirdsall said he felt confident that there was no way a jury with 10 women would lock up a mom. He painted Ortega as an ignorant woman who grew up with an abusive father and a criminal mother, trying to be better than her past. Even though she dropped out of school, she went to job corps and found work and wanted to participate in the democratic process.\n\nShe was not impersonating someone else or trying to rig an election. She just didn\u2019t know the difference between a permanent resident and a citizen.\n\nOrtega asserted that no one ever told her the difference, and suggested Tarrant County had tried to set her up. Instead of giving her another form, officials could have just stopped her from voting. Both attorneys agreed she did not present herself well. She came across as defiant and self-righteous, White said, with no sense of contrition.\n\n\u201cThey tried to beat me on the stand, but they didn\u2019t beat me,\u201d Ortega said. \u201cBecause I got up there and told them the truth. But the problem was no one wanted to listen to me. It was like I was looking in [a] den of lions.\u201d\n\nThe prosecutor asked the jury to think about the sanctity of American democracy. He noted that some people say voter fraud doesn\u2019t exist, but wondered how they could really know if, like Ortega, they could just falsely check \u201cU.S. citizen\u201d on a piece of paper.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about one vote,\u201d White said he told the jury. It was about safeguarding the entire American system.\n\nWhite thought she might get five years in prison, the same sentence as the convicted council woman. But the jury thought otherwise. \u201cThey wanted to send a message and, quite frankly, it was heard,\u201d White said.\n\nOrtega hugged Sherman on her way out of the courtroom and tried to be strong. Sherman said he felt his heart drop.\n\n\u201cMe and Rosa had plans. The whole family had plans,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d have a house in the country, and just be that Brady Bunch kind of family. Dogs and cats and a yard and everything.\u201d\n\nOrtega wondered whether the jury considered the consequences on her life. \u201cThey did this like it was one big game,\u201d Ortega recalled. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t realize they were playing with my life. And then I thought, oh no, I\u2019m not going to see my kids no more.\u201d\n\nRene stopped going to school. Little Girl, the Chihuahua-dachshund mix, refused to budge from a pile of Ortega\u2019s dirty clothes. Sherman struggled to pay the bills because Ortega used to do that. He planned to get a trucking job on the border, crisscrossing like Ortega did back when she was a child.\n\nOrtega wished they would just send her back to Mexico instead of prison. \u201cWhy keep me in the country?\u201d she wondered. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t want me anyway.\u201d\n\nAfter a month in jail, she was released on $11,111 bond. Sherman rented the movie \u201c22 Jump Street\u201d and bought pork chops to make for dinner. But her stomach was so upset she could barely touch Sherman\u2019s meal. Only sour foods, like pickles, suited her.\n\nHer life became a race \u2014 one day trying to secure passports for her kids, the next trying to figure out if she could still be eligible for U.S. citizenship. She resumed her fledgling career as a model, under the moniker \u201cFame,\u201d and earned some money as an extra in music videos.\n\nShe told Sherman, whose name was tattooed on the back of her neck, to find someone else. Their engagement was over. \u201cMove on with your life,\u201d she said one evening. \u201cWhat are you going to do in Mexico? Do you know what they say they do to white people there? I can\u2019t put you in danger.\u201d\n\nSherman refused.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just lost in the neighborhood right now \u2014 we don\u2019t have a GPS or a map or nothing,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cShe can move on and meet Jose or Jesus in Mexico, but she knows she is the only woman I will ever love, and I think she still loves me.\u201d\n\nEvery day was a struggle to get back on the map.\n\n\u201cThis is just like normal, hey Ma?\u201d Sherman asked on a recent Saturday as Ortega watched a movie while he played a college football video game.\n\n\u201cYeah, Dad,\u201d she said \u2014 a term of affection. Rene and Clara hung out on the couch, while the youngest unbraided her hair to braid it again. A moment without stress. Until it was pierced by the case looming over all of them.\n\n\u201cYou all should still vote,\u201d Ortega said to her children.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d they shouted in unison.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t vote because I\u2019m scared after your experience,\u201d Gracie said. \u201cBut you all are citizens,\u201d Ortega told them. \u201cIt\u2019s different.\u201d\n\nRene said he learned in prelaw class that citizens have a right to vote \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean they have to. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to in this country anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cI think, with Trump in, the country\u2019s kinda racist now.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes I feel like we\u2019re living in the 1960s,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cBut instead of it being the blacks, it\u2019s now the Mexicans.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is true,\u201d Ortega said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would have been as bad if I weren\u2019t Mexican. People are into looking at color again in this country.\u201d\n\nOrtega said she hoped, at least, that her plight might have been a lesson to others. But in her home it was doing no good: Sherman felt no better about the sanctity of the electoral system and her children planned to never step into a voting booth.\n\nHer family in Mexico had told her she shouldn\u2019t fear returning to Monterrey. There were new houses and hotels. It was no longer a place of dusty roads and feral chickens. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same country anymore,\u201d they told her.\n\nSitting with her despondent children, now pessimistic about the American promise, she shook her head. This country, too, she thought, was no longer the same.\n\n\n\nRosa Ortega with her children outside their apartment in Grand Prairie, Tex.

That gives Democrats more than the requisite 41 senators to block a procedural vote and compel President Trump and Republicans either to withdraw Gorsuch\u2019s nomination or to change Senate rules to eliminate the 60-vote requirement.\n\n\u201cThis is a new low,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in response to Democratic opposition. But he also reiterated his vow that Gorsuch will be confirmed by Friday despite the likelihood of a filibuster. That\u2019s because McConnell is prepared to invoke what is known as the \u201cnuclear option\u201d \u2014 a change in rules to allow \u00adSupreme Court nominees to be confirmed with a simple majority vote. With 52 seats, Republicans would then have enough votes to secure Trump\u2019s first selection for the high court.\n\nThe procedural vote known as cloture has long set the Senate apart from the House of Representatives \u2014 and it has long been hailed by members of the upper chamber for requiring bipartisan cooperation, and forcing consensus, on major legislation or confirmation votes.\n\nIf that step is eliminated, the Senate is \u201cheaded to a world where you don\u2019t need one person from the other side to pick a judge,\u201d warned Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.). \u201cAnd what does that mean? That means the \u00adjudges are going to be more ideological, not less. It means that every Senate seat is going to be a referendum on the Supreme Court. . . . The damage done to the Senate is going to be real.\u201d\n\n(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nMcConnell won\u2019t be the first to go nuclear, however. Now-retired Sen. Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) first invoked the option in 2013 when he was majority leader, allowing non-Supreme Court presidential appointments to be confirmed with a simple majority.\n\nAnd McConnell will probably face more pressure to eliminate the 60-vote requirement in other cases \u2014 on budget bills, for instance, or on any legislation at all. If that happens, the need for bipartisan cooperation could disappear entirely from the Senate.\n\nGraham\u2019s comments came as the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to refer Gorsuch\u2019s nomination to the full Senate, which is expected to begin debating the pick Tuesday. The procedural step that Democrats have the votes to block is expected by Thursday, but if McConnell at that point seeks a rules change \u2014 which would succeed with a simple majority \u2014 it would start the clock for a final confirmation vote Friday.\n\n[How many votes Democrats need to block Neil Gorsuch\u2019s Supreme Court nomination]\n\nThe outcome of the Judiciary Committee\u2019s vote was never in doubt \u2014 Republicans hold a majority of seats on the panel, and Gorsuch was approved on a \u00adparty-line vote. But the testy hearing foreshadowed what is likely to be a combative floor debate over the merits of Trump\u2019s selection and the way both parties have behaved during years of feuding over the makeup of the federal court system.\n\nDemocratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), Patrick J. Leahy (Vt.), Christopher A. Coons (Del.), Mark R. Warner (Va.) and Robert Menendez (N.J.) indicated Monday that they would oppose Gorsuch and vote against cloture \u2014 the motion to end a filibuster that is required to hold an up-or-down confirmation vote.\n\nDuring an hours-long committee hearing, Leahy criticized Gorsuch\u2019s answers during his marathon confirmation hearing as \u201cexcruciatingly evasive.\u201d He said that a GOP move to end filibusters of Supreme Court nominees would damage the Senate, but he argued that he had to vote his conscience, even if it pushes Republicans to change the rules.\n\nJudge Neil Gorsuch prepares to testify during the third day of his confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee last month. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cI cannot vote solely to protect an institution when the rights of hard-working Americans are at risk,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I fear that the Senate I would be defending no longer exists.\u201d\n\n[Home stretch for Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee could forever alter the Senate]\n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) shot back, blaming Democrats for years of partisan bickering over judicial nominees that he said started when President George W. Bush made several nominations for federal court vacancies.\n\n\u201cI disagree with those who somehow say this is the end of the Senate as we know it,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cThis is a restoration of the status quo ante before our Democratic colleagues directed this artificial 60-vote requirement.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) dismissed Republican attempts to blame Democrats for the change.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we could trace it all the way back to the Hamilton-Burr duel,\u201d he quipped.\n\n\u201cThe answer isn\u2019t to change the rules,\u201d Schumer added. \u201cThe answer is to change the nominee.\u201d\n\nIn a sign that there is almost no hope of ending the impasse without a rules change, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) \u2014 who helped quell previous fights about judicial nominees \u2014 said that this time, he is standing with fellow Republicans.\n\n\u201cI have to. I have no choice,\u201d he told reporters. He said he would have to vote for the change \u201cbecause we need to confirm Gorsuch.\u201d\n\nMcCain has been part of fruitless attempts to reach a bipartisan agreement in recent days, including consultations with Coons and Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W. Va.) late last week. McCain told reporters that he was part of a similar conversation Monday, but he did not elaborate.\n\nManchin is one of three moderate Democrats who plan to vote for Gorsuch, and with Republicans, to end the filibuster. Manchin and the other two moderates, Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), have been the focus of a $10 million ad campaign by the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, which is pressuring Democrats facing reelection next year in states that Trump won in November to vote for Gorsuch.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) on Monday became the fourth Democrat to say he would join Republicans in trying to end the filibuster. But in a sign of the incredible political pressure he faces as he votes on a nominee from his home state, Bennet did not say whether he plans to support or oppose Gorsuch. He has also faced pressure from JCN to back Gorsuch. So far, he is the only Democratic senator to oppose the filibuster who is not up for reelection in 2018.\n\n[Democrats just took the filibuster off life support]\n\nCarrie Severino, JCN\u2019s chief counsel and policy director, said Monday that in the face of \u201cunprecedented obstruction by Democrats, Republicans now have no choice but to invoke the \u2018constitutional option\u2019 \u201d \u2014 the nuclear option \u2014 to confirm Gorsuch.\n\nGorsuch was nominated by Trump on Jan. 31 and spent weeks privately meeting with senators and preparing for his confirmation hearings. He was questioned by the Judiciary Committee last month for almost 20 hours over three days, answering nearly 1,200 questions and later sending about 70 pages of answers to written follow-up questions, according to a team of White House officials assisting with his nomination.\n\nAs of Friday, Gorsuch had met with 78 senators \u2014 all but some of the most conservative and liberal lawmakers, whose votes are likely to fall along party lines. But three first-term Democratic senators, Catherine Cortez Masto (Nev.), Tammy Duckworth (Ill.) and Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), complained that they were unable to get a face-to-face meeting with the nominee or were not offered the opportunity.\n\nThe two big, misleading statements senators can\u2019t stop making in the Neil Gorsuch battle\n\nThis week\u2019s anticipated change in Senate procedure dates to 2013, when Democrats, angered by Republican opposition to then-President Obama\u2019s nominees voted to end filibusters of executive branch and lower-court nominees. Republicans warned then that there might one day be retribution.\n\n\u201cChanging the rules is almost inevitable; it\u2019s only a question of when,\u201d said Norm Ornstein, a longtime congressional expert and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nOrnstein warned that with Republicans set to extend the filibuster ban to Supreme Court nominees, they may soon face pressure to end filibusters of legislation to keep major health-care and tax reform bills passed by the GOP-led House from stalling in the more closely divided Senate.\n\nMcConnell \u201cwill resist the change in some cases because it\u2019s in his interest not only when he\u2019s in the minority again but also to be able to rely on Democrats when the House sends you crazy things,\u201d Ornstein said. \u201cAnd because it\u2019s not clear they have the 51 votes necessary to change the rules for filibusters on legislation.\u201d\n\nBut McConnell said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday that \u201cI don\u2019t think the legislative filibuster is in danger.\u201d\n\nSchumer, appearing on the same program, agreed. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any thirst to change the legislative rules,\u201d he said. \u201cMost Democrats and most Republicans have served in both the minority and majority and know what it means.\u201d\n\nAmber Phillips contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-to-weigh-corporations-liability-in-human-rights-violations-abroad/2017/04/03/fcc60b2c-1895-11e7-bcc2-7d1a0973e7b2_story.html", "text": "At issue in the case is the 1789 Alien Tort Statute, which has been revived by human rights activists as a way to seek compensation for atrocities committed overseas.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nCentral to Donald Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy was the idea that the United States was beset by all manner of threats: terrorists pouring over the border, immigrants undercutting the economy and crime spiking. \u201cThe first task for our new administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities,\u201d Trump said during his convention speech and, despite deaths from terrorism being rare in the United States and the violent crime rate being lower now than it was when Barack Obama took office, the message clearly stuck.\n\nEvery two years, a national survey of political and social attitudes is conducted, called the General Social Survey. When it was conducted in 2014, 46 percent of respondents felt as thought the country was spending too little nationally on law enforcement. That figure had been trending downward since 2006. But in 2016, a spike back up, over the 50 percent mark.\n\nWhy? To some extent because of independents who indicated that they felt America should spend more on national law enforcement efforts. (Among independents, the figure topped 50 percent for the first time since the 1990s.) But mostly it was Republicans. The percent of Republicans saying that they felt as though too little was being spent on law enforcement surged 18 percentage points \u2014 up 34 percent \u2014 since the 2014 survey.\n\nThe figure in 2016 among Republicans was above the previous high-water mark, set in 1994.\n\nIn 1994, the national violent crime rate was 713.6 incidents per 100,000 residents. In 2015, the most recent year for which data is available, it was 372.6 \u2014 just over half the 1994 rate.\n\nHow much of this is attributable to Trump\u2019s rhetoric isn\u2019t clear. Trump deftly seized upon issues that were already of concern to conservative Republicans over the course of his campaign, so he may have been trailing the trend, not leading it. What\u2019s more, the issue of law enforcement became heavily politicized over the past two years, as high-profile incidents of police shooting criminal suspects and innocent people polarized the issue.\n\nInterestingly, the number of people who want to spend more on law enforcement consistently trails the number interested in spending to fight crime. (The latter question has been asked for longer.)\n\nThere\u2019s no real difference on that question when it comes to politics; Republicans and Democrats both are about as likely to say we\u2019re spending too little in that regard. (Notice the change to the vertical axis on this graph.) There\u2019s been an upward trend among each political group for the past several surveys.\n\nWhere there\u2019s a split is on race. Black Americans are far more likely to say that we should spend more on fighting crime than are whites.\n\nYet they are no more likely to say that we should spend more on law enforcement.\n\nRepublicans are the only group to think we\u2019re spending too little on law enforcement and on crime to the same extent. Among no group is the gulf of opinions on that spending wider than among black Americans, who are 26 percentage points more likely to say we\u2019re spending too little on crime than on law enforcement.\n\nThat black Americans should be more skeptical of law enforcement two years after the advent of the Black Lives Matter movement isn\u2019t surprising. That said, the percentage of black Americans who think too little is spent on national law enforcement didn\u2019t decrease since 2014, but instead stayed flat.\n\nTrump has apparently made his priority here clear. His recent budget proposal focuses on adding new national law enforcement in the form of Border Patrol agents. Funding for efforts to reduce crime through preventive measures were, like many other line items, slashed.\n\nThe General Social Survey was funded primarily by the National Science Foundation and conducted through in-person interviews with a random national sample of roughly 1,900 adults in the spring of 2016. Overall results carry a margin of sampling error of roughly 2.5 percentage points; the error margin for subgroups is larger."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-budget-would-hit-rural-towns-especially-hard--but-theyre-willing-to-trust-him/2017/04/02/51a456d4-12e3-11e7-833c-503e1f6394c9_story.html", "text": "\n\nLarry Long, director of the Durant Boys and Girls Club, helps serve hot dogs to children there.

There\u2019s just never enough money left in the annual $30 million budget to tear up and replace Main Street and other main roadways. It would take at least $20 million to update the roads, he said.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t have the resources,\u201d Rundel said.\n\nIt would cost another $10 million to $20 million to update the city\u2019s generations-old water treatment and sewer systems, the life of which has been extended by city workers willing to come up with creative fixes and build their own parts. Trump\u2019s budget promises \u201crobust funding for critical drinking and wastewater infrastructure,\u201d but it also would eliminate a $498 million grant and loan program that helps rural communities that are smaller than Durant upgrade their water and wastewater systems.\n\nHeading east on Main Street \u2014 past the \u201cworld\u2019s largest peanut\u201d outside City Hall \u2014 takes you over railroad tracks and into a deeply impoverished neighborhood.

An eco-friendly steel mill is slated to open this fall, providing as many as 300 new jobs, thanks to a New Markets Tax Credit of $21 million that encourages building in areas with high unemployment rates.\n\nDurant is already home to a number of industrial plants \u2014 including a Big Lots distribution center and a glass factory \u2014 and has been growing. But to continue to add all of the jobs Trump promised, Rundel said the city has to strengthen its strained infrastructure.\n\nTrump promised that within 100 days of taking office he would introduce legislation to \u201cspur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over ten years.\u201d He has yet to do so. And when his aides discuss infrastructure, they talk more about toll roads, pipelines and major airports than crumbling Main Streets.\n\nJohn Czwartacki, a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget, pushed back at the idea that the budget hits rural areas especially hard.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump was elected to represent all Americans \u2014 rich and poor, rural and urban,\u201d he said. \u201cHis administration and his budget prioritize American security and economic success, while at the same time recognizing that we must be mindful of every tax dollar spent, given our nearly $20 trillion national debt.\u201d\n\nThere is hope among many Trump supporters that the possible budget sacrifices will be worth it.\n\nRick Munholland, 64, owns a tire shop near the train tracks on Main Street and said customers often ask to purchase tires made in the United States, which are difficult to find.

She pays for college with a combination of Pell Grants, which the president has pledged to protect, and other scholarships. She lives with her grandparents in Boswell, about 30 miles away, so that she can coach girls\u2019 sports teams there.\n\nOut of Tate\u2019s graduating high school class of 17, six attempted college or a trade school and only two stuck with it, including her.

The festival used to receive $150,000 a year in state and federal funds, which have been slashed to $26,000 a year, including NEA grants that Trump wants to eliminate.\n\nAnd the Boys and Girls Club of Durant watches over about 200 children and teenagers each day after school and during the summer in a former middle school that is being renovated. More than half of the students are Native American and 20 percent live with their grandparents or in foster care.\n\n\u201cFrom 3 o\u2019clock to 6 o\u2019clock in the evening is the worst time for kids \u2014 that\u2019s when kids get in trouble, get into vandalism, when young ladies get pregnant,\u201d said Executive Director Larry Long, 69, who attended a Boys and Girls Club in Missouri as a child. \u201cWe keep them busy.\u201d\n\nLong has to hustle to keep the club safe, clean and operating.

The Trump administration says the $434 million program has failed to transition enough of these workers into unsubsidized jobs.\n\nTrump has also proposed cutting all federal funding for AmeriCorps VISTA, which provides staff during the summer, and reducing funding for the federal work-study program, which pays some of the club\u2019s college-aged workers.\n\nOne of the senior workers, Sharon Green, said she learned about the potential cuts while watching PBS, which could also lose federal funding.\n\n\u201cThese things are vital,\u201d said Green, 72, is a retired accountant. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that they should have cuts \u2014 I mean, there are many other places where they could cut, it looks like to me.\u201d\n\nGreen will not say whom she voted for but said, \u201cI didn\u2019t have any concerns along these lines for my party.

(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s attacks on conservative members of his own party come as his allies beef up an array of groups to promote his agenda, amassing firepower that could end up being trained on fellow Republicans.\n\nAt least four separate organizations are seeking to drive public support for Trump and his priorities \u2014 a marked shift from the first two months of his administration, when the White House had limited outside air cover.\n\nThe immediate goal: to lean on Democratic senators in the run-up to a vote expected this week on Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch. But down the road, some of the groups could end up turning their focus on lawmakers who cross Trump, including members of his own party, according to people familiar with internal discussions.\n\n\u201cIt is something we would consider if there is clarity that a group is stymieing the agenda, whether it\u2019s establishment types or others,\u201d said Eric Beach, co-chairman of the pro-Trump advocacy group Great America Alliance, which has already spent $3.5 million on ads promoting the Trump administration.\n\nPressure could also eventually come from America First Policies, which was launched by a group of former Trump advisers in January to serve as the leading pro-Trump advocacy group. The organization has not yet turned its attention to the 2018 midterm elections, said spokeswoman Katrina Pierson.\n\n\u201cThere is plenty of time and opportunity for Republican lawmakers to keep their promises to their voters and support the president\u2019s agenda to make America great again,\u201d Pierson said. \u201cLawmakers will be held accountable at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nThe White House is offering many cues that it wants its allies to go after members of the House Freedom Caucus, whom Trump blames for derailing legislation that would have repealed parts of the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\n\nOn Saturday, White House social-media director Dan Scavino Jr. tweeted that Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, a member of the Freedom Caucus, is \u201ca big liability.\u201d\n\n\u201c#TrumpTrain, defeat him in primary,\u201d Scavino wrote from his personal Twitter account.\n\n[White House social-media director misused official position by going after GOP lawmaker, ethics experts say]\n\nBut it remains to be seen whether the wealthy Trump donors who are financing the advocacy groups \u2014 many of whom have also been supportive of conservative lawmakers \u2014 will feel comfortable using their resources to fuel internecine GOP battles.\n\nComplicating the situation is the fractured nature of efforts by allies to support the White House. Exactly which group will take the lead in backing Trump, and on which issues, remains unclear.\n\nEmily Cornell, chief operating officer of a new group called Making America Great that was started by GOP megadonor Rebekah Mercer, said that her organization will be eying ways to break logjams on Capitol Hill. Making America Great kicked off last week with a $1 million TV and digital ad buy praising Trump for keeping his promises that is aimed at 10 Democratic senators up for reelection in 2018.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to bring attention to policy movement in Washington \u2014 or lack thereof,\u201d Cornell said. \u201cIn terms of supporting the president\u2019s agenda, we\u2019re thrilled about his recent accomplishments, and we plan to review our support one policy at a time.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials said they believe the absence of a coordinated external campaign contributed to the GOP\u2019s failure to roll back President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health-care law. That prompted White House deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh to leave her post last week to jump-start America First Policies, which has had a relatively low profile since its launch.\n\n[Senior aide Katie Walsh leaves White House to run pro-Trump outside group]\n\nOne other pro-Trump advocacy group is also in the mix: 45Committee, which has already spent millions on ads touting Trump\u2019s nominees and policies.\n\nThe increasingly crowded space recalls last year\u2019s campaign, when multiple super PACs jockeyed to be viewed as the favored pro-Trump group. Since the election, the effort to create a robust organization to bolster the president from outside the White House has been hampered by rivalries and personal friction, splintering the donor world.\n\nThe wealthy Mercer family, along with other top Trump contributors, was expected to support America First Policies. But after tensions about the direction and leadership of the group, Rebekah Mercer launched her own effort, Making America Great, according to multiple people familiar with the dynamic. She was joined by at least two other major donors: Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus and high-frequency-trading mogul W.E. Bosarge, said a person familiar with their support.\n\nThere are ongoing efforts to broker a collaboration between the two pro-Trump outfits, according to multiple people familiar with the situation. But for now, there is not yet a corollary in Trumpworld to Organizing for Action, the premier advocacy group that supported Obama\u2019s legislative agenda.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear \u201cwhich one of the organizations is going to rise to be seen as the one that supporters are going to go to,\u201d said GOP strategist Mike DuHaime, adding, \u201cI think people thought it would have come together more quickly than it has. It would have been helpful in the last legislative fight.\u201d\n\nMultiple groups are now jumping into the current, most urgent battle: the Gorsuch confirmation vote in the Senate.\n\nThe 45Committee is putting $1 million into a new, nationally running pro-Gorsuch spot called \u201cQualified,\u201d which has state-specific versions that target undecided Democratic senators such as Jon Tester of Montana. The advocacy organization and its affiliated super PAC, backed by casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts, poured $60 million into last year\u2019s campaign and has spent another $4 million since the election supporting Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks.\n\nGreat America Alliance also is running ads aimed at putting pressure on Democrats, including a new spot that targets Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida. The group\u2019s supporters include billionaire investor Julian Robertson, Minnesota media mogul Stan Hubbard, Texas banker Hank Seale and Jewelry Exchange chief executive William Doddridge, according to a person familiar with their contributions.\n\n[McCaskill swings to \u2018no\u2019 vote on Gorsuch]\n\nThe largest pro-Gorsuch investment is coming from a long-standing player: the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative nonprofit that is plowing $10 million into a sustained air campaign to pressure Democratic senators to vote for his confirmation.\n\nDetermining who is financing all the pro-Trump efforts is difficult.

Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said in a statement.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump repeatedly called for transparency in political spending.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind the money coming in,\u201d he told Time magazine in 2015. \u201cLet it be transparent. Let them talk, but let there be total transparency.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials did not respond to questions about whether the president will call for pro-Trump groups to voluntarily disclose their donors, as Organizing for Action did when it launched to support Obama.\n\nJohn Pudner, a conservative activist who heads Take Back Our Republic, a group that seeks to lessen the influence of big money on politics, said Trump could buttress his credibility by calling for more robust disclosure.\n\nAbsent that, Pudner said, \u201cit looks like you\u2019re sort of enjoying the swamp.

Scott Walker, right, hopes the Trump administration will give his state a green light for requiring drug testing of Medicaid applicants. (Matt Rourke/AP)\n\nNow that House Republicans have squandered their shot at reordering Medicaid, governors who want conservative changes in the health program for \u00adlow-income Americans must get special permission from the Trump administration.\n\nNear the front of the line is Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican who not only supports work requirements and premium payments but also a new additional condition: to make applicants undergo a drug test if they\u2019re suspected of substance abuse.\n\nIf Walker gets his way, Wisconsin would be the first state in the country with mandatory drug screening for Medicaid enrollees. The governor plans to release his proposal in mid-April and submit it to the Department of Health and Human Services by the end of May.\n\nThe approach \u2014 which also would mandate treatment for those testing positive \u2014 aligns with the goals of several Republican governors intent on tightening the program\u2019s rules. Although the Obama administration allowed them to place expectations on enrollees, they\u2019re hoping for far more leeway from HHS Secretary Tom Price.\n\nThe goal behind Walker\u2019s proposal \u201cis to help people get healthy so they can get back in the workforce,\u201d said Julie Lund, communications director for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services.\n\nYet states that have started screening their welfare applicants over the past few years have turned up few drug users. In North Carolina, less than 0.3 percent of applicants to its WorkFirst welfare program tested positive for drugs during a five-month period in 2015. Michigan didn\u2019t find any welfare recipients abusing drugs during a year-long pilot program in 2016.\n\nOpponents of Walker\u2019s idea say the data shows that drug testing for Medicaid applicants isn\u2019t worth the cost and effort.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t turned up much use of drugs among that population,\u201d said Jon Peacock, research director for the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families.\n\nRepublicans have long wanted to overhaul the Medicaid program, frustrated by its growing costs to states and provider shortages. The Affordable Care Act replacement backed by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) would have cut federal Medicaid spending by allotting it to states on a per capita basis, but that plan folded late last month amid insurmountable differences between conservatives and moderates.\n\n[On first day in office, new Medicaid chief urges states to charge premiums, prod recipients to get jobs]\n\nUnder President Barack Obama, the Republican-led states that accepted the ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion got permission through waivers to shape their programs in alternative ways. His administration allowed them to place extra responsibilities on new enrollees, though it stopped short of work requirements.\n\nPatients in Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan and Montana must pay part of their monthly coverage premium. Two dozen states require some cost-sharing, up to 5 percent of household income, for certain care.\n\nWith President Trump in office, that approach looks more promising than ever to Republican governors. Indiana, Arizona, Kentucky and Pennsylvania have requested to make work a condition of Medicaid eligibility, while Arkansas has said it will submit a proposal to the new administration.\n\nRed states have good reason to believe they\u2019ll be successful. Earlier this month, Price and the new head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services indicated in a letter to governors that proposals related to \u201ctraining, employment and independence\u201d would be welcome.\n\nYet it\u2019s less clear how the administration will react to Walker\u2019s request for drug screening. While applicants would be tested only if they\u2019re reasonably suspected of using drugs, the requirement could appear hostile at a time when Trump and Republicans are trying to appear more sympathetic to the problem of drug addiction.\n\nTrump tapped New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) to lead a new commission on drug addiction and urged more focus on the problem at a White House forum Wednesday. \u201cThis is a total epidemic,\u201d Trump said.\n\n[Chris Christie to lead Trump White House drug commission]\n\nHealth advocates in Wisconsin, who are generally opposed to Walker\u2019s idea, point to the underwhelming results from applying testing to welfare programs. They also raise concerns that it could increase stigma about drug abuse and the poor. While some research has shown higher rates of drug abuse among low-income Americans, experts are divided on how big the difference is and stress that it\u2019s a problem afflicting people at all income levels.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re singling out lower-income people, playing on stereotypes, on the premise that somehow people on Medicaid are getting something they shouldn\u2019t be getting,\u201d said Robert Kraig, executive director of Citizen Action of Wisconsin.\n\nHealth advocates also note that requiring Medicaid enrollees to get treatment for substance abuse doesn\u2019t guarantee they\u2019ll be able to find a provider in Wisconsin, which like many states has a shortage of doctors willing to accept Medicaid\u2019s lower reimbursements.\n\n\u201cThis is a simplistic response to a far broader problem,\u201d Peacock said. \u201cWisconsin and, I think, many other states need to invest far more in effective treatment and prevention programs.\u201d\n\nWalker did include in his bundle of Medicaid proposals one provision health advocates like: at least partial coverage of residential treatment for substance abusers. But they\u2019re hesitant to give the governor much credit, since they\u2019ve long bristled at his refusal to accept the extra federal funding with Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe best way to get treatment for drug abusers is to expand Medicaid, not require screening as a prerequisite for enrolling, said Judy Solomon, vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sound bite as far as I\u2019m concerned, without any evidence,\u201d she said.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/lawmakers-face-new-questions-on-russia-probe-after-flynns-immunity-request/2017/04/02/62d3b684-17ca-11e7-8598-9a99da559f9e_video.html", "text": "- Lawmakers of both parties on April 2 faced new questions on congressional probes of Russian meddling in the 2016 election after Michael Flynn, President Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, offered to testify in exchange for immunity.

Already, congressional Republicans have balked at his proposed budget, and the White House\u2019s insistence on increased spending for the military and a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border could imperil a spending bill needed to keep the government running past the end of April.\n\nNo easy resolution has appeared, and despite loose talk from White House aides and staff-level conversations this week, little has been done to court Democratic support for his priorities. Meanwhile, most Democrats remain wary of Trump\u2019s hard-line policies and incendiary persona, and the confirmation vote on Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, faces a potential filibuster by Senate Democrats.\n\n\u201cPart of it is self-imposed,\u201d former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said of Trump\u2019s challenges and political drift, adding that many key players often find it difficult to build a bond with the 70-year-old executive. \u201cPeople know him, they see him at meetings, but it\u2019s been hard for people in Congress and around it to get to know him in a way that\u2019s helpful for Trump.\u201d\n\nThe White House last week resorted to threats against Democrats and members of its own party in an effort to push members to the negotiating table on repealing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with the American Health Care Act, a Republican alternative championed by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) but beleaguered by opposition from conservative groups.\n\nWeeks of early, politically damaging battles over controversial policies and an ongoing probe into his campaign\u2019s ties to Russian interference in the election also have left Trump with the lowest approval rating of any president at this point in his administration since such data was first collected, during Harry S. Truman\u2019s presidency. Most of the right-wing Republican House members in the Freedom Caucus, now in the president\u2019s crosshairs, outperformed him in the 2016 election, giving them little incentive to cooperate.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you have an unpopular president . . . popularity scares people,\u201d said Ari Fleischer a former adviser to President George W.

Last week, Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh left the White House to help prop up an outside group that aims to provide air cover for the president in the legislative battles ahead after a health-care effort that left him exposed to criticism from the left and the right.\n\n1 of 94 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 See what President Trump has been doing since taking office View Photos The beginning of his term has featured controversial executive orders and frequent conflicts with the media.

Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nIn the West Wing, frustration abounds. For a president fixated on winning, people close to him say he is anxious to find out what went wrong with his team\u2019s health-care push and get to a deal on that issue or another front such as taxes or infrastructure as fast as possible.\n\nChristopher Ruddy, the Newsmax Media chief executive who is a friend of the president, said the lesson learned within the White House is to be more careful moving forward when it comes to trusting Congress and the leadership\u2019s whip counts.\n\n\u201cThe White House did the right thing. Ryan carried the luggage here. He delivered it and it was damaged goods,\u201d Ruddy said of the health legislation. \u201cThey wanted to work with Congress, they accepted the congressional plan and it blew up on them. Now they realize they can\u2019t do that in the future.\u201d\n\nAlthough the White House has not settled on a clear path forward, a partial strategy has taken shape on social media: going after the ideological purists who blocked Trump on health care. After dealing initially with the House Freedom Caucus with a carrot, Trump has settled on a stick, promising to \u201cfight\u201d Freedom Caucus members along with Democrats in 2018.\n\nAmong them: Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a Trump supporter who defended him during one of the darkest periods of his campaign, when lewd \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tapes emerged of Trump discussing grabbing women. Trump courted Meadows in meetings and calls, but White House aides say he feels scorned by Meadows and fellow Freedom Caucus members \u2014 and keeps a close watch on their television appearances and how they talk about him.\n\nSome conservative leaders say the tensions between Trump and the Freedom Caucus could be fleeting because the president may eventually need them to pass legislation in the coming months.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of frustration all around town,\u201d said Michael Needham, chief executive of Heritage Action, which backed Freedom Caucus members in opposing the AHCA. \u201cIn a couple of weeks people will look back and people will say the coalition in the Republican House and the Senate is a center-right coalition that wants to get big things done.\u201d\n\nTrump showed some signs over the weekend of softening his assault on conservatives in Congress. On Sunday morning, he tweeted a more positive message about unity on health care \u2014 \u201cAnybody (especially Fake News media) who thinks that Repeal & Replace of Obamacare is dead does not know the love and strength in R Party!\u201d \u2014 and later went golfing with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a staunch opponent of the bill who lobbied House conservatives to oppose it.\n\nBut building support will take more than schmoozing. Needham argued that the White House and congressional leadership asked Republicans to make a politically impossible decision on health care \u2014 casting a vote in support of a bill that had a 17 percent public approval rating, according to a recent Quinnipiac University poll.\n\nThat angst remains pervasive, with members wondering whether Trump is backing the right kind of bills, the sort of agenda that could lift him and the GOP ahead of the 2018 midterms.\n\nRep. Rod Blum (R-Iowa), a House Freedom Caucus member, said his office surveyed thousands of constituents about the health-care bill and found the response to be \u201coverwhelmingly against it\u201d \u2014 not just among Democrats, but independents and Republicans, too.\n\n\u201cI feel pressure, yes, I do: I feel pressure to say no,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re overwhelmingly, resoundingly saying, \u2018Thank you for being a no.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAs a candidate, Trump leapfrogged his opponents by running an anti-establishment outsider campaign. He pitched a populist infrastructure bill, tax code overhaul and a border wall \u2014 all of which have been held up by a push for a health-care bill that is more closely associated with long-standing Washington Republican dogma and that critics say fails to address Trump\u2019s promise of making health care less expensive and more widely accessible.\n\nAmong Trump\u2019s closest confidants are those urging him to abandon hard-liners in the Republican conference and strike a deal with Democrats on health care and on other issues.\n\n\u201cThe president is a dealmaker, and he realizes that 30 members of the House shouldn\u2019t control the process,\u201d Ruddy said. \u201cHe is looking for a way to develop a majority that doesn\u2019t include them.\u201d\n\nStriking such a deal is likely to require even more political acumen than bringing Republicans in line, as it could risk alienating the Republican leadership in Congress and the conservative base. It, too, would necessitate that Trump find stakeholders and power brokers he can trust on the other side of the aisle.\n\n\u201cYou look at George W. Bush, who worked with Ted Kennedy early on with education. Trump is going to have to find somebody he can work with on the other side,\u201d Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.) said. \u201cHe knows he has to appeal to people because he\u2019s not ideological, but he has to find out how he can get out of the Republican straitjacket and build the relationships, figure out a coalition for taxes, for infrastructure.\u201d\n\nDemocrats remain skittish about cutting deals with a president who so easily lashes out at his own party.\n\n\u201cRight now he looks, I don\u2019t know, in personal disarray,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said. \u201cIn some ways, he had a successful campaign, \u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019 something that is obviously very appealing to many people.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s interpreting that as a personal endorsement,\u201d she added. \u201cMembers of Congress vote their district; they don\u2019t necessarily vote their president. The powers of persuasion that worked on the campaign trail aren\u2019t going to seal the deal in Washington.\u201d\n\nMike DeBonis contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/corey-stewart-declares-victory-for-free-speech-after-two-venues-back-out-of-immigration-rally/2017/04/01/a41166a0-162b-11e7-ada0-1489b735b3a3_story.html", "text": "Corey Stewart led a rally against illegal immigration on the steps of a historic courthouse Saturday after two local restaurants, bowing to threats of boycotts, backed out of hosting the firebrand Republican running for Virginia governor.\n\n\u201cYou know you\u2019re winning the battle when your opponents try to shut you down,\u201d Stewart told the crowd.\n\nStewart\u2019s campaign originally booked a Harrisonburg restaurant for his \u201cRally to End Illegal Immigration.\u201d But the restaurant canceled last week after receiving phone calls and emails from members of Harrisonburg Indivisible and other local activists. Complaining about Stewart\u2019s \u201cdivisive rhetoric,\u201d they told restaurant managers they would no longer patronize the eatery if it hosted the rally.\n\nStewart\u2019s campaign then reserved a room at a second restaurant, but that got canceled as well after another round of emails and phone calls. His team scrambled Friday to get a permit to hold the rally at the Rockingham County Courthouse, where on Saturday Stewart declared a victory for free speech.\n\n[GOP chair slams Va. gubernatorial contender for calling rival a \u2018cuckservative\u2019]\n\nStewart used his canceled reservations saga in fundraising appeals as a critical campaign finance deadline approached Friday, claiming that the activists were on the payroll of financier George Soros \u2014 something the activists said was not true.\n\n\u201cGeorge Soros and his group of paid liberal activists, Indivisible, have launched an attack intending to stop my rally against illegal immigration,\u201d one fundraising email reads. \u201cThey are trying to convince people that my ideas are unreasonable. But how can protecting the safety of American citizens and upholding the rule of law be considered unreasonable?\u201d\n\nStewart is in a three-way race for the GOP nomination with former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie and state Sen. Frank Wagner (Virginia Beach). On the Democratic side, Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam and former congressman Tom Perriello are vying for their party\u2019s nod. Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) is prohibited from seeking reelection this year under the state Constitution, which bars governors from serving consecutive terms. Both nominations will be decided in June 13 primaries.\n\nStewart was chairman of Donald Trump\u2019s Virginia campaign, and he is seeking the governorship in similarly provocative style. Far behind Gillespie in fundraising and endorsements, the chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors has often sought to stoke controversy and attract counterprotesters to his events.\n\n[Trump\u2019s Virginia Mini-Me: Corey Stewart ties his ambitions to the GOP candidate]\n\nStewart has used heated rhetoric regarding illegal immigrants, vowing to \u201chunt them down.\u201d He has, at times, called the preservation of the state\u2019s Confederate monuments the most important issue in the governor\u2019s race. His campaign got lots of mileage out of video showing liberal protesters mobbing him in Charlottesville in February, when he held a rally to defend a Robert E. Lee statute that city leaders want removed.\n\nHarrisonburg looked like fertile ground for that kind of visual. Nicknamed \u201cthe Friendly City,\u201d it is a college town with a population more diverse than its Shenandoah Valley surroundings might suggest. The Latino population has grown from just under 9 percent in 2000 to nearly 19 percent in 2015, according to census figures. About 17 percent of residents are foreign-born, up from 9 percent in 2000. Church-based refugee resettlement programs and a poultry industry dependent on immigrant labor are behind the trends.\n\nYet Saturday\u2019s rally was no repeat of the Charlottesville mob that shouted Stewart down. The event drew only about 20 supporters and 10 protesters. Except for a man who shouted \u201cScumbag!\u201d at Stewart, the protesters were not disruptive. They stood silently around a sign that said, \u201cNo matter where you are from, we\u2019re glad you\u2019re our neighbor,\u201d in Spanish, English and Arabic.\n\nIn a conversation after the rally, Stewart stressed that he does not oppose legal immigrants, only those who come to the country illegally.\n\nDanny Maybush, a truck driver in a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap, said he only opposed immigrants who \u201ccome up here and want to get a better life and start some stupid gang.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like that it\u2019s a melting pot,\u201d he said of the country. \u201cI have a Hispanic family that lives near me, and they came here legally, and they all work hard. We had a big snow the year before [last]. I was going to snowblow their driveway but they already had seven people out there going at the driveway.\u201d\n\nThe on-again, off-again lead-up to the rally ultimately proved to be more dramatic than the event itself. Stewart began by unfolding a piece of paper with three mug shots. They were of three illegal immigrants from El Salvador who were charged last week in the death of a Lynchburg teenager, 17-year-old Raymond Wood. Stewart went on to ask for a moment of silence for Wood and all the other \u201cboys and girls in Virginia and across the country who have been murdered by illegal aliens.\u201d\n\nThat was the kind of rhetoric that John Schaldach, a Harrisonburg Indivisible organizer, said he objected to when he organized the email and phone call campaign to the two restaurants, Dave\u2019s Taverna and Wood Grill Buffet.\n\n\u201cAsk them to cancel the Stewart event,\u201d his email to activists said. \u201cLet them know if they don\u2019t, you will not patronize Dave\u2019s and you will ask your friends to do the same. Please be kind to the manager! . . . Thank you for taking action on this critical local issue! Together we can make sure Corey Stewart knows his message is not welcome here.\u201d\n\nSchaldach, a 46-year-old piano technician, did not dispute Stewart\u2019s right to express his views in public, as the candidate ultimately did at the courthouse. But he said the activists had a right to let local restaurants know that they opposed his message.\n\n\u201cMy concern is that his rhetoric is divisive,\u201d he said. \u201cThe effect of his rhetoric is a segment of our community ends up feeling isolated. . . . He talks about illegal immigration, and then he talks about crime and he mixes it all together. And you come out the other end, and you think immigrants are related to crime. When, in fact, the opposite is true. . . . There\u2019s no evidence they commit more crimes.\u201d\n\nIn linking the protest to Soros, Stewart was echoing a claim White House press secretary Sean Spicer and others have lobbed against Indivisible activists who have sought to disrupt GOP town hall meetings nationally.\n\n[Republicans see AstroTurf in Democratic protests]\n\nSoros has pumped millions into liberal causes since the 2004 election cycle. But Soros spokesman Michael Vachon has disputed claims that Soros has paid Indivisible protesters or picked up their transportation tab. Schaldach said his group gets no money from Soros.\n\nThe Harrisonburg group is one of more than a thousand Indivisible spinoffs created nationwide and organized around the Indivisible Guide, an organizational how-to manual drafted by former Democratic staffers. Stewart\u2019s campaign noted that some of the aides now work for Soros-funded organizations, such as the National Immigration Law Center."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/pence-we-will-repeal-and-replace-obamacare/2017/04/01/7d30e992-1708-11e7-bb16-269934184168_video.html", "text": "- During a visit with business owners in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, Vice President Mike Pence vowed that President Trump will succeed in getting Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

Frustrated by their obstruction on health care, Trump last week threatened to destroy Freedom Caucus members in the 2018 midterm elections, even as Mulvaney is working with them to forge consensus on an agreement to keep the government funded.\n\nBut there are clear limits to Mulvaney\u2019s influence, as this month\u2019s embarrassing collapse of the Republican health-care bill laid bare. Some Freedom Caucus members speak privately of Mulvaney\u2019s \u201cphilosophic convulsion,\u201d as one put it, and are quick to note that he no longer speaks with the ideological purity they came to respect in him, but rather as an agent of a president on the hunt for a deal.\n\n(Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cAll of our lives are composed of trade-offs,\u201d said Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.), a Freedom Caucus member. \u201cEach person has a different calibration on where \u2018go\u2019 means \u2018go\u2019 and where \u2018no\u2019 means \u2018no.\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t attempt to suggest for another where their own lines ought to be on that balancing act of personal philosophy and assigned roles or jobs, but what I would say is that I wish Mick the absolute best.\u201d\n\nTrump and his other advisers, however, see Mulvaney as their bridge to the Freedom Caucus, believing he still has unique credibility with the conservative hard-liners, however hostile they may be to some of the administration\u2019s priorities.\n\n\u201cIf you have to have somebody on your side that understands the complexity of these [bills] and the stakes around a government shutdown, who would you rather have than Mick Mulvaney?\u201d asked Stephen K. Bannon, the chief White House strategist.\n\nBannon called Mulvaney \u201cthe unsung hero of this administration, because he\u2019s doing yeoman\u2019s work on just about every front. He\u2019s a rock star.\u201d\n\nMarc Short, the White House legislative affairs director, said Mulvaney is \u201canchored in his core philosophy,\u201d but that he has said, \u201cAs much as he loves his colleagues in the House, sometimes it\u2019s less about winning the argument than about actually advancing the ball.\u201d\n\nOne example of Mulvaney\u2019s dramatically altered role came with Sanford, who told The Post and Courier in Charleston, S.C., that Trump used Mulvaney as an intermediary to threaten to oust Sanford in retaliation for not supporting the health-care bill. Sanford said Mulvaney told him, \u201cThe president asked me to look you square in the eyes and to say that he hoped you voted \u2018no\u2019 on this bill so he could run [a primary challenger] against you in 2018.\u201d\n\nThe episode marked an uncomfortable evolution for a man once allied with Sanford who saw his previous job in Congress as protecting the American taxpayer against runaway spending \u2014 even for the military and even if the cuts he championed caused pain for his constituents.\n\n(Reuters)\n\n[Trump wants to add wall spending to stopgap budget bill, potentially forcing shutdown showdown ]\n\nNow as director of the Office of Management and Budget, however, Mulvaney has proposed a large increase in defense spending, which would be offset by steep cuts in social services such as housing, job training, and after-school activities, as well as foreign aid.\n\nSome of these positions have infuriated antipoverty advocates, particularly his statements that federal assistance for low-income students and the elderly is ineffective.\n\n\u201cRarely will any program be able to fully accomplish its goals because the needs are so great, but if you took those programs away, there would be a huge impact,\u201d said Libba Patterson, a professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law who ran the state\u2019s social services agency for four years.\n\nFiscal hawks had a different reaction to Mulvaney\u2019s first budget. Rep. Jeff Duncan (R., S.C.), a Freedom Caucus member who served with him in the South Carolina legislature before they were both elected to Congress in 2010, cheered Mulvaney\u2019s moves. \u201cWe were all dancing in the street that Mick was chosen to be OMB director,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) praised Mulvaney, a friend, as \u201ca committed conservative.\u201d But, he said, Mulvaney is wearing \u201ca different hat. He is now representing the administration\u2019s policy, so he doesn\u2019t have the same freedom he had as someone who represented the people of South Carolina.\u201d\n\nDuring the health-care push, Mulvaney was one of the most visible administration officials. He appeared regularly on television news \u2014 Trump thinks he is an especially smooth and punchy communicator, aides said \u2014 and lobbied lawmakers incessantly, from negotiating sessions on Capitol Hill to a game of bowling in the White House basement.\n\n[\u2018The closer\u2019? The inside story of how Trump tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to make a deal on health care]\n\nDuncan said Mulvaney helped persuade him to support the Affordable Care Act replacement bill, even though many Freedom Caucus colleagues were opposed.\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t convince everyone,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cBut even when he was in Congress and the Freedom Caucus, he couldn\u2019t convince everyone.\u201d\n\nOne of Mulvaney\u2019s selling points for the budget director job was his connection to the Freedom Caucus, Trump aides said, and there is some disappointment that he fell short on selling the health-care bill. But advisers said blame for the failure has fallen on many officials, including White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, not just Mulvaney.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more that he could have possibly done,\u201d White House press secretary Sean Spicer said of Mulvaney. He called the budget director \u201ca very well-steeped, well-regarded workhorse\u201d who has \u201can instant sense of credibility on Capitol Hill.\u201d\n\nMulvaney was well-liked in the House, a rare Freedom Caucus member who made friends with House leaders, including Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.).\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s easy for the media to paint him in a corner philosophically, but his friendships obviously go across the entire spectrum of the Republican conference, and I think that\u2019s why he\u2019s such a great asset,\u201d Short said.\n\nYet in the Senate, Mulvaney barely won confirmation. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) joined all 48 Democrats and independents in opposing his appointment, in part because of Mulvaney\u2019s past opposition to higher defense spending levels.\n\n[Trump\u2019s federal budget 2018: Massive cuts to the arts, science and the poor]\n\nBefore coming to Washington, Mulvaney, 49, was a state lawmaker and also owned and operated a South Carolina franchise of Salsarita\u2019s Fresh Cantina. He first got elected to the House by unseating one of Congress\u2019s long-serving lions \u2014 John Spratt, then the House Budget Committee chairman \u2014 in a district that Democrats had controlled for more than 100 years.\n\nSpratt said he was surprised Mulvaney had pulled off getting appointed budget director, arguing that he has no \u201creal experience in budget-making.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still surprised that he was able to pull down a prize like OMB,\u201d Spratt said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most difficult jobs in the United States. He\u2019s got to prove himself worthy of the job.\u201d\n\nMulvaney\u2019s colleagues said he has proven a quick study, and that he helps them see around corners politically.\n\nMulvaney has instructed the career staff at the budget office to read Trump\u2019s 1987 bestseller, \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d He supported Paul in the 2016 presidential primaries, but came around to Trump once he emerged as the presumptive nominee.\n\nNow one of Trump\u2019s employees \u2014 he attends the White House senior staff meetings every morning \u2014 Mulvaney is forging a bond with the president. Aides said that whenever Trump talks about numbers, he summons Mulvaney if he is not already in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump also invited Mulvaney to join him last weekend at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, according to one of the president\u2019s advisers.\n\n\u201cHe can take the mundane \u2014 budget policy is not the sexiest thing in the world, let\u2019s face it \u2014 and not only make it interesting, but talk to you about the different angles of it,\u201d said Rick Dearborn, a deputy White House chief of staff. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the policy piece of it, but his political insights that make it very interesting. He gives you these \u2018aha moments\u2019 of, \u2018Oh, yeah, I hadn\u2019t thought about that.\u2019\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/04/01/86-percent-of-trump-counties-make-less-in-a-year-than-27-trump-staffers-are-worth/", "text": "Financial reports released by the Trump administration indicate that 27 staffers who work for him are worth a combined $2.3 billion thanks to real estate, investments and hefty salaries.\n\nHow much is $2.3 billion? Here\u2019s one way to look at it. Consider the amount of money earned in any county in the country in a year \u2014 the number of households in each county times the average household income in the county. In 80 percent of the counties in America, every household combined earns less than $2.3 billion a year. In counties that voted for Donald Trump, that figure is higher: In 86 percent of Trump counties, the total amount of income earned in a year is less than $2.3 billion. (On average, it\u2019s $2.1 billion, using 2011 to 2015 five-year estimates from the Census Bureau.)\n\nOnly 8 percent of Trump-voting counties have a cumulative annual income greater than the $3.9 billion Forbes says the president himself is worth. Only 2 percent earn more annually than the $10 billion Trump claims to be worth.\n\nThis, of course, falls into the same trap that Trump has exploited to inflate his electoral success last year. Most counties don\u2019t have very many people \u2014 which is also why, cumulatively, they don\u2019t earn as much in income annually. The counties that tend to beat the $2.3 billion in annual income tend to be counties that include large cities. And, as a result, a map of where incomes beat the Trump staff\u2019s net worth looks like an electoral map: Swaths of counties that earn less each year than those 27 people are worth and a few pockets, mostly on the coasts, that are exceptions.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s also a broad disparity within the over-$2.3-billion counties, too.\n\nThose largest counties also correlate to ones that Hillary Clinton won last year. About half of Clinton counties fall under the $2.3 billion mark. On average, counties that backed Clinton earn $5.1 billion in cumulative annual income according to that Census Bureau data.\n\nAgain, the data here are averages from 2011 to 2015. Household incomes have climbed over the past few years, so the number of counties that are under the $2.3 billion mark is probably slightly lower.\n\nHoly moly \u2014 household income finally back up to pre-recession levels.

A lot of very wealthy people, most of whom come from those Clinton counties, work in the White House. A lot of other houses scattered across the country are relying on those millionaires to boost their own incomes."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/joe-manchins-high-wire-act-working-with-trump--and-criticizing-both-parties/2017/04/01/1527d2c6-164e-11e7-833c-503e1f6394c9_story.html", "text": "On Thursday, West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin III became the first Democratic senator to support President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee.\n\nOn Friday, he came to this town of 484 people to explain why.\n\nThe United Mine Workers of America was hosting Manchin for an ask-anything town hall meeting, and one of the first skeptical questions focused on what \u201cworking people\u201d could expect from Judge Neil Gorsuch.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been portrayed as not being for the working person,\u201d said Manchin. \u201cWell, I talked to Merrick Garland\u201d \u2014 former president Barack Obama\u2019s nominee for the same court vacancy, whom Republicans blocked last year. \u201cI thought he was a good man.

(Bill Pugliano/Getty Images)\n\nPerhaps the most vulnerable Senate Democrat of the 25 up for reelection in 2018, Manchin is testing whether voters in a state that overwhelmingly supported Trump will also continue to back him. He pulls no punches with his own party, which voters from his state and others along the Appalachians abandoned overwhelmingly as they looked for someone to blame for the collapse of the coal industry and their way of life.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats became so politically correct and so perfect,\u201d Manchin said in an interview in Matewan, after walking its short main street in a grey-and-black UMWA polo shirt. \u201cThe people in there, they grew up knowing that the Democratic Party would be there ensuring their jobs. And now it\u2019s the party they believe is preventing them from working.\u201d\n\nBut Manchin is an enthusiastic critic of Trump\u2019s party too. His message is complicated: He tells West Virginians why Republicans are tools for the wealthy, is trying to work with the president his state elected, and remains firmly wedded to a party that is increasingly environmentalist and focused on winning a diversifying, suburban electorate.\n\n\u201cFor me to be a Republican, I would have to put the bottom line before I would a human being,\u201d Manchin told The Washington Post last month.\n\nIt\u2019s a high-wire act, with Republicans hoping for a stumble.\n\nThe first months of the Trump administration have reshaped the Democratic Party, but Manchin has participated only on the margins. After the election, he was added to an expanded Democratic strategy group, along with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).\n\nHe is more adamant than ever that he will stay within the party, in part so it won\u2019t become exclusively populated by the sort of people who demand he be primaried. (We Will Replace You, a new PAC, reiterated its call for a Democratic primary after Manchin\u2019s Gorsuch statement.)\n\nA Matewan police officer waits for Manchin to arrive for the meeting Friday. (Bill Pugliano/Getty Images)\n\nIn West Virginia, Manchin presents himself as the Democrat who wants Trump to fulfill the promises that won over miners and workers \u2014 and hopefully, nothing else. Most of the Matewan town hall focused on the Miners Protection Act, Manchin\u2019s cause for most of his Senate career, which would transfer money from the Abandoned Mine Lands fund to pay for the health-care insurance and pensions that thousands of miners lost after Patriot Coal and other companies went bust.\n\nEvery Senate Democrat has endorsed the bill, which Manchin touts as an accomplishment.\n\n[Maryland\u2019s only Republican congressman faces harsh crowd in town hall]\n\nWhen he\u2019s talking about that bill, or about health care, Manchin speaks in stark moral terms. On Thursday, he told miners, he met with the president and got a fresh assurance that the miners\u2019 bill would get his support \u2014 even if Republicans took Manchin\u2019s name off it. He asked the president to tweet about it, too.\n\n\u201cHow long did it take them to bail out Wall Street?\u201d Manchin asked in Matewan. \u201cIt took \u2019em hours. Can\u2019t you take care of the people who basically made the country?\u201d\n\nIn those moments, Manchin sounds like Bernie Sanders, whose 2016 primary victory here is thrown back at Manchin whenever progressives want to get a rise out of him. Manchin endorsed Hillary Clinton for president; in an interview, he recalls how Clinton pledged to team him up with her husband \u2014 the last Democrat to win the state in a presidential election \u2014 to craft a bill for miners.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is, Bernie never had a glove laid on him,\u201d said Manchin. \u201cIf they knew that Bernie Sanders would shut down every coal plant, every coal mine \u2014 because he\u2019s said it \u2014 it\u2019d have been a complete different primary outcome. But Hillary was so detested. Bernie would not have won West Virginia, knowing West Virginia the way I know it. He\u2019d have got maybe 40 or so.\u201d\n\nThat was better than Clinton, whose 27 percent of the vote represented the worst performance by a Democratic presidential nominee since West Virginia became a state. In 2012, when he won his first full term, Manchin, a former governor, took 61 percent of the vote and ran 25 points ahead of Barack Obama. Even if Manchin improves on Clinton\u2019s vote by 25 points next year, he\u2019d win by single digits.\n\nRepublicans, who need eight Senate seats to block a filibuster on the Gorsuch confirmation, are deeply familiar with the math. Rep. Evan Jenkins (R-W.Va.), who in 2014 wiped out the state\u2019s last Democratic House member, said in January that he was \u201cstrongly considering\u201d a run against Manchin. A video tracker from America Rising, a PAC dedicated to opposition research on Democrats, shadows Manchin at his town halls, and in Matewan he shouted a question after the senator had shaken every hand and headed toward a waiting van.\n\n\u201cAre you going to pass new gun-control laws?\u201d asked the tracker.\n\n\u201cI really appreciate you coming here,\u201d said Manchin.\n\nThe question previewed the attack any Republican opponent will probably use in 2018, zinging Manchin for the background check bill he co-sponsored after the Sandy Hook massacre in Newtown, Conn. That might have been Manchin\u2019s low point of popularity. But November 2016 might have been Trump\u2019s high point. In Matewan, and in the rest of Mingo County, voters offered tempered praise for Trump. They\u2019re quicker to say what they didn\u2019t like about Clinton than what Trump has done in office.\n\n\u201cShe was flat-out against the mines,\u201d said Mike Land, 62, whose health insurance will run out if the miners\u2019 bill isn\u2019t passed by the end of April.\n\n\u201cHe needs to put the phone away,\u201d said Hubert Lowe, 63.\n\nIn November, 83.2 percent of Mingo County voters went for Trump. Four years earlier, 72.8 percent had gone for Manchin. Most of West Virginia had voted for both of them at one time or another. In that context, and in the extra context Manchin adds on the stump, the Gorsuch nomination is both a kindness to Trump and a fair deal for Democrats. The senator, recounting his conversations with the nominee, described a bargain any sane populist would make.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018You don\u2019t think I was Donald Trump\u2019s first choice?\u2019 \u201d said Manchin. \u201c \u2018I probably got chosen to come up here because they thought I would have a better chance of getting 60. If you all fight and stop me, I guarantee that what comes behind is going to be a lot different than I am.\u2019 \u201d\n\n[McCaskill swings to \u2018no\u2019 on Gorsuch]\n\nManchin\u2019s high-wire act is likely to continue. He sees the president\u2019s executive order lifting a rule preventing coal mining waste from impacting streams \u2014 Manchin was right by his side, in every camera shot \u2014 as good for the state. But he believes the Republicans\u2019 designs on health care would have been atrocious, much like the Republican-run legislature\u2019s passage of right-to-work legislation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awful what they\u2019re doing to the working man,\u201d Manchin said in the interview in Matewan. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing to union workers, what they\u2019re doing to wages, what they\u2019re doing to pensions.\u201d\n\nWhy, with all of that in front of them, did so many voters go Republican?\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t explain it,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cYou know what? I think it was just so tainted by Washington politics.\u201d\n\nThe interview was over. Manchin walked out of the van for a short indulgence \u2014 a tour of the small-town museum commemorating the 1920 coal miners\u2019 strike, when the stakes and risks were perfectly clear.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/stephen-bannon-earned-nearly-1-million-last-year-more-than-half-from-mercer-entities/2017/03/31/f8464ede-166c-11e7-ada0-1489b735b3a3_story.html", "text": "White House chief strategist Stephen K.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nNew documents released Friday night by the White House revealed hard numbers showing how President Trump, who campaigned as a champion of the working class, has surrounded himself with a circle of wealthy advisers.\n\nThe disclosures showed that Trump\u2019s top aides have generated millions of dollars from Wall Street, Hollywood, real estate and the media, holding a slew of investments that intensify the administration\u2019s challenge in navigating potential intersections between officials\u2019 personal finances and their policymaking roles.\n\nTogether, 27 White House officials had assets worth at least $2.3 billion when they joined the administration, according to an analysis of their filings by The Washington Post.\n\nThe list of well-heeled White House officials includes a number of high-profile advisers, such as Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who have hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate holdings, as well as numerous middle- and lower-level staffers who populate the West Wing.\n\nTop economic adviser Gary Cohn, for example, a former top Goldman Sachs executive, reported assets worth at least $250 million. Another top aide, Baltimore-based real estate developer Reed S. Cordish, had assets worth at least $197 million.\n\nJulia Hahn, the 25-year-old aide to chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, reported investments worth between $1.1 million and $2.5 million.\n\nThe new disclosures \u2014 filed by about 180 members of the Trump administration and released by the White House starting late Friday \u2014 show how Trump has tapped members of the financial elite to serve as his closest aides.\n\nThe White House on Friday held up the affluence of its staffers as a badge of honor.\n\n\u201cThe president has brought a lot of people into this administration, into this White House, in particular, who have been very blessed and very successful by this country and have given up a lot to come into the government by setting aside a lot of assets,\u201d said White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who filings show had assets worth between $2.9 million and $6.6 million.\n\nEarlier financial disclosures revealed that Trump\u2019s Cabinet \u2014 which includes two billionaires and several multimillionaires \u2014 is the richest in modern American history, a quality that he has trumpeted as a sign of their smarts.\n\n\u201cI want people that made a fortune,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Des Moines in December as he was building his Cabinet.\n\nBannon, his chief strategist, held assets worth between $11.8 million and $53.8 million. Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, earned nearly $850,000 in the past year and held assets worth between $10 million and as much as $39 million. White House General Counsel Donald F.

Kenneth Juster, the deputy director of the National Economic Council and former partner at the investment firm Warburg Pincus, reported minimum assets of at least $20.4 million.\n\nTrump, who last disclosed his finances during the campaign, is not required to release more details until next year.\n\nThe complex holdings of many top administration officials create potential conflicts of interest that the White House must now navigate, a process that is underway in consultation with the Office of Government Ethics.\n\nFinancial disclosure forms provide only a rough picture of financial wealth and liabilities. For some categories, the disclosure forms use broad ranges. The official filling out the form also has discretion in assigning value to assets such as real estate and artwork.\n\nOn Friday, White House officials cited the complex assets of Cohn as an example of how onerous the ethics process is for wealthy individuals joining the government.\n\nHis finances were described in 41 pages that detailed the assets accumulated from his 25 years at Goldman Sachs. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index has previously listed his net worth at about $600 million.\n\nWhite House officials noted that Cohn is subject to a two-year ban on dealing with specific matters having to do with Goldman Sachs. However, as head of the economic council, Cohn will not be recused from policy issues that affect Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe filings show that Bannon earned at least $917,000 in the past 12 months, drawing at least $545,000 in the past year from four ventures backed by the wealthy Mercer family, underscoring how deeply enmeshed he has been with the influential Trump mega-donors\n\nHe was paid $191,000 in consulting fees by Breitbart News Network, where he served as executive chairman until joining the Trump campaign in August. That is a significant drop from 2013, when Bannon reported on a rental application that he was making $750,000 at the website.\n\nLast year, Bannon earned $167,500 more for consulting and directing by Glittering Steel, the production company he launched with Rebekah Mercer that financed the documentary \u201cClinton Cash.\u201d\n\nCambridge Analytica, a data science company that worked for Trump\u2019s campaign, paid Bannon $125,333 in consulting fees for his work as vice president and secretary of the board. And the Government Accountability Institute, an investigative think tank whose president wrote the book \u201cClinton Cash,\u201d gave Bannon a $61,539 salary as chairman.\n\n[Read the White House staff financial disclosures.]\n\nBannon was also paid $100,000 in directing fees from a production company affiliated with the advocacy group Citizens United.\n\nAnd he reported earning between $50,001 and $100,000 from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, stemming from a partnership he formed with the French banking giant in 1996. Bannon, who specialized at the time in media investment banking, sold his firm \u2014 Bannon and Co. \u2014 to a subsidiary of the French bank in 1998. The French company worked closely with Bannon on a variety of deals, including one in which Bannon represented PolyGram, a music and film company that was sold to Seagram\u2019s.\n\n[Stephen K. Bannon, architect of antiglobalist policies, got rich as a global capitalist]\n\nThe strategist had significant cash reserves as he headed into the White House, reporting at least $1.1 million in three different U.S. bank accounts.\n\nThe forms show how Breitbart News has served as a pipeline for the White House, with the site\u2019s payments to Bannon and two other staffers, Bannon aide Hahn and National Security Council aide Sebastian Gorka, totaling more than $246,000 over the past year.\n\nThe disclosures also show that Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, have property and investment holdings worth as much as roughly $740 million. That includes more than $600 million worth of Kushner real estate in New York and New Jersey as well as other assets, much of which Kushner says he has divested.\n\nBetween January 2016 and March 2017, Kushner\u2019s filings show, Ivanka Trump earned between $1 million and $5 million on Trump International Hotel Washington, the luxury hotel project that opened last year in a government-owned building near the White House. The value of Ivanka Trump\u2019s stake in the hotel was estimated at between $5 million and $25 million, filings show.\n\nKushner, who in January stepped down as chief executive of his family\u2019s real estate firm, Kushner Companies, will remain a beneficiary of most of the business\u2019s real estate ventures through a series of trusts. In essence, he will no longer officially have management control of the company but will retain a large financial interest.\n\nThe Kushner company has taken out loans from Wall Street giants Goldman Sachs, Blackstone and Deutsche Bank, the German financial giant that is also President Trump\u2019s biggest lender, filings show. The company also borrowed money from the French bank Natixis and Israel\u2019s biggest bank, Bank Hapoalim, now under investigation by the Department of Justice, according to documents.\n\nKushner\u2019s filing shows he also has up to $95 million in borrowed money, much of it in the form of unsecured lines of credit held jointly with his father, from lenders including Deutsche and one of Israel\u2019s largest banks, Israel Discount Bank.\n\nIvanka Trump, who this week was officially named assistant to the president, will no longer serve in management roles but will continue to receive money from her fashion-merchandising brand and her family\u2019s private company, the Trump Organization. The payments will come as fixed payments from the Trump family\u2019s luxury brokerage, T International Realty, and two real estate subsidiaries, the filings show.\n\nIvanka Trump, like her father, had moved her clothing and jewelry companies into a trust valued at more than $50 million, disclosures show. The trust is overseen by two of her in-laws and can be revoked at any time.\n\nKushner\u2019s filing, like his father-in-law\u2019s disclosure, offers lofty valuations for Kushner real estate holdings that may be higher than what they would be appraised for or sell for on public markets.\n\n[The Mercers and Stephen Bannon: How a populist power base was funded and built]\n\nAmy Brittain, Tom Hamburger, Rosalind S.

Bannon, chief strategist to President Trump, at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., in late 2016. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nStephen K. Bannon was running an investment banking company in Beverly Hills when his partner called with urgent news: a potential $10 billion deal was about to unfold in New York City involving a company they hoped to continue representing \u2014 and they didn\u2019t want to be left out of the action.\n\nBannon, then in his mid-40s, told his business partner to meet him at the Los Angeles airport in an hour. Soon, they appeared at the Manhattan offices of PolyGram, a worldwide music company that they had previously represented in a film deal and now was for sale.\n\nBefore long, Bannon came up with an angle. He had represented Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, in a prior deal, and now he proffered the royal-family member, one of the world\u2019s wealthiest Arabs, as a bidder. PolyGram was impressed and eventually paid Bannon a sizable fee for work on the overall deal.\n\n\u201cThose out of the room are out of the deal,\u201d Bannon, now 63, said in an interview, recalling the 1998 meeting. \u201cOnce you make your way into the room, you stay.\u201d\n\nYears before Bannon became the architect of an anti-globalist revolution \u2014 working as chief strategist under President Trump to weaken free-trade deals, restrict immigration from a number of majority-Muslim nations and slam corporations that move jobs overseas \u2014 he made his fortune as the quintessential global capitalist.\n\nAn examination of Bannon\u2019s career as an investment banker found that the Bannon of the 1980s and 1990s lived what looks like an alternate reality from the fiery populist of today who recently declared that \u201cglobalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia.\u201d\n\nWith stints at Goldman Sachs and his own firm, Bannon was a creature of corporatism, wealth-building and international finance. His company received crucial financial backing from banks in Japan and France, and one of his key clients was the Saudi prince. It all was managed from the unlikely setting of an office steps away from the elite shopping district of Rodeo Drive.\n\n(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nBannon, in two interviews for this report, acknowledged that he relied heavily on foreign financing in eight years of running a firm eventually known as Bannon & Co.\n\nBut he said the world in which he once operated, and made millions, had been changed by banks that now look out for themselves rather than their clients \u2014 and by multinational corporations that undermined the working class.\n\n\u201cWe always were the financier of entrepreneurs, of which I\u2019m a huge believer, and I\u2019m not a believer in the corporatist mentality,\u201d he said.\n\nBy his telling, this is the sentiment that led to the Bannon of today, the one who helped transform the far-right Breitbart News site into a platform for nationalism and then joined forces with Trump to upend much of Republican ideology.\n\nToday, Bannon functions as a counterweight in the White House to an array of fellow Trump advisers who inhabit his former world, top officials from Goldman Sachs as well as other Wall Street veterans who embrace a more traditional brand of GOP policies such as free trade.\n\nYet in many respects, it is Bannon\u2019s experience in their world that has positioned him for the struggle.\n\n\u201cI have lived all over the world, worked all over the world, financed with great partners all over the world,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cI\u2019m not some angry guy sitting there.

He landed a summer job at the company\u2019s New York City office and then a full-time position upon graduation. He arrived in 1985 to work on mergers and acquisitions.\n\nBannon \u201cwas unusual insofar as he was a bit older and he came from a military background, and that fact was core to his persona. . . . [He was] independent minded, with strong points of view,\u201d said John L. Thornton, a former president of Goldman Sachs who steered the bank in an international direction, and whom Bannon considered as his mentor.\n\nBannon served in the U.S. Navy, in two deployments between 1978 and 1980. (Courtesy of the Bannon family)\n\nBannon\u2019s main task during his first three years at Goldman Sachs was to respond to a boom in hostile takeovers. Goldman Sachs took the side of companies under attack from corporate raiders and leveraged buyout firms. Bannon had to come up with strategies to protect companies from unwanted suitors.\n\n\u201cA takeover is a very intense time. It is like you are going to battle,\u201d said Scot Vorse, who attended Harvard with Bannon and worked with him at Goldman Sachs and Bannon & Co. \u201cIt was crazy. I worked many, many weeks in excess of 100 hours, and I know Steve did that often. At 10 p.m., you have 150 people walking around a floor with a piece of pizza and cup of coffee.\u201d\n\nAfter three years and a promotion to vice president \u2014 a title that was given to many Goldman Sachs employees \u2014 Bannon moved to the company\u2019s Los Angeles office and was given the mission of drumming up business. He cold-called companies, looking to represent them as they considered splitting up or acquiring new businesses.\n\nA turning point came in 1989, when Bannon said he persuaded Goldman Sachs to invest heavily in a fledgling company called Qualcomm, which was working on cellular telephone technology. Bannon said he did not receive extra compensation from the deal, which he said made a huge profit for Goldman Sachs. While he said he made about $450,000 annually at the time, that was a \u201cnight and day\u201d difference, compared with what he might have made at a firm that paid him a huge fee for the deal. The philosophy of Goldman Sachs was to pay generously but not to provide the highest compensation until executives were made into partners, which could take years.\n\n\u201cIt was a huge effort to get it done,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cI thought about it: \u2018I will get all the grief if this deal doesn\u2019t work out and none of the upside if it does well.\u2019 . . . That investment was worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201d\n\nSo in 1990, Bannon started his own firm.\n\nHe said the move was not about money. \u201cIt has always been about doing something I want to do and proving to myself I could do it,\u201d he said. \u201cStarting Bannon & Co. was a huge risk. People thought I was insane.\u201d\n\nBannon stayed in California, he said, because he was focused on valuing intellectual property such as the movie industry \u2014 as opposed to the hard assets in the oil and gas business \u2014 and he believed there were big profits to be made as \u201cthe media and entertainment industry was just about to globalize.\u201d\n\nBannon wanted to do big deals, but he didn\u2019t have the financing. So he began to explore options overseas, including Japan, where investors were eager to get involved in Hollywood projects.\n\nHe struck a five-year deal with a major Japanese bank, Nissho Iwai, which he said supplied millions of dollars.\n\nRelying on foreign money became a model for Bannon\u2019s work. \u201cOur forte was working with American companies to work with foreign investors,\u201d Bannon said.\n\nBannon set up shop in Beverly Hills with Vorse, his former classmate and Goldman Sachs colleague. But much of his time was spent abroad in places such as Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\nOne of the company\u2019s early successes involved a sale of television properties that wound up giving Bannon and his partners a huge payoff from future airings of what was then a little-known situation comedy: \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d\n\nBy 1996, with the Japanese deal having run its course, Bannon & Co. entered a partnership with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, a giant French investment company. The joint venture, which allowed Bannon to retain control over his company, was called Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Bannon.\n\nAt the same time, Bannon\u2019s global aspirations were solidified through a deal in which he got to know Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who today is the world\u2019s 45th wealthiest person, with a net worth of $18 billion, according to Forbes magazine. The prince declined to comment.\n\nThe prince, a nephew of the Saudi king, headed the United Saudi Commercial Bank and had major investments in companies including Euro Disney, Citibank and Saks Fifth Avenue. He made much of his fortune trading tens of millions of dollars on U.S. stock markets. He also made two purchases of properties that he has said \u201cbailed out\u201d Trump: the 1991 purchase of Trump\u2019s yacht; and a $325 million purchase \u2014 in 1995, with a Singapore investor \u2014 of the Plaza Hotel.\n\n\n\nBillionaire Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, center, relaxes with his daughter Reem and son Kalid on his yacht, which he bought from President Trump.

(Barry Iverson/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images)\n\n***\n\nBannon said that starting in 1992, he met with the prince at least a dozen times, including in Beverly Hills and New York City, and possibly at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe prince co-owned a firm with pop star Michael Jackson called Kingdom Entertainment. In 1996, Bannon advised the prince on Kingdom\u2019s purchase of a 50 percent stake in Landmark Entertainment, a Hollywood-based company that produced music and television programs and developed theme parks. Bannon remained in touch with the prince, meeting him at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills, in which the prince owned a stake, Vorse said. In addition, Vorse traveled to Riyadh to meet with the Saudi prince.\n\n\u201cAlwaleed was very savvy,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cHe was a client for five or six years. . . . He had great ambitions. He wanted to be the Walt Disney of the Middle East.\u201d\n\nIn 1998, the prince became an important part of one of Bannon\u2019s biggest deals, when Vorse heard a rumor that a suitor wanted to buy PolyGram in what was expected to be a $10 billion deal.\n\n\u201cWe show up in New York,\u201d Vorse said. \u201cWe march into their executive suites. We say, \u2018We are here to help; can we hang out in your conference room til you need us?\u2019 It was almost like we were white-collar squatters. We moved into the conference room.\u201d\n\nA couple of possible bidders, including the Canadian conglomerate Seagram\u2019s, were lined up when Bannon proposed the prince as an alternative.\n\nWhen a PolyGram executive questioned Bannon\u2019s relationship with the prince, Bannon responded that he should \u201ccall the prince\u2019s main guy\u201d to check it out, Vorse said. A short while later, the PolyGram president signaled to Bannon and Vorse with \u201cthe big thumbs-up,\u201d Vorse said.\n\nIn the end, the prince didn\u2019t buy PolyGram, but his work led him to be retained by the company, and Bannon said the prospect of an alternative bidder helped boost the price by 20 percent.\n\nBannon said he received \u201ca big fee,\u201d though he declined to disclose the amount.\n\nAs a result of this and other deals, Bannon\u2019s company was ranked as the world\u2019s fourth most valuable media investment bank, ahead of firms with thousands more employees, according to Vorse.\n\nSoon, Bannon agreed to sell his company for an undisclosed amount to a subsidiary of his French partner, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, a move that eventually put an end to his role at the company he created.\n\nWhile it is not possible to independently verify Bannon\u2019s profits during this time, he said the deals and the sale of the company made him very wealthy. He said he had far exceeded whatever he was likely to have earned by staying with Goldman Sachs. During his 14 years in investment banking, Bannon was invariably described by friends as a country-club type of Republican, trim, athletic and movie-star handsome. A number of former colleagues said that they don\u2019t recognize the Bannon of today, either in his rhetoric or disheveled appearance.\n\nBannon has said he was fundamentally changed by the impact of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe crisis prompted Bannon to say that Wall Street no longer operated in the way he was taught, by working to build companies and watch out for a client\u2019s interest. The financial crisis, he said, was caused by those whose main motivation was to make as much money as possible for oneself, a \u201cfinancialization\u201d of Wall Street that put bankers\u2019 profits over those of everyday investors. \u201cIt was before all these quants and mathematicians really came to Wall Street,\u201d Bannon said in a French documentary about Goldman Sachs.\n\nHe said he was further infuriated by the taxpayer bailouts of major banks, which were engineered by the former chief executive of Goldman Sachs, Henry M. Paulson Jr., who was President George W. Bush\u2019s treasury secretary.\n\nBannon has also said that he took a hard turn to the right because his father, who worked for AT&T, lost money selling the company\u2019s stock in the wake of the financial crisis.\n\nBannon began using some of his fortune to produce movies that reflected a darker worldview. His films, such as \u201cGeneration Zero,\u201d portrayed the United States as sliding into a cultural and financial decline. Bannon channeled his anger into support for the tea party movement and, later, into pressing an anti-globalist message as chairman of Breitbart News.\n\nBannon has said Breitbart News is \u201cthe platform for the alt-right,\u201d referring to a small movement that seeks a whites-only state. Bannon, however, has said he is not a white nationalist but a \u201cstrong American nationalist.\u201d Bannon\u2019s views eventually were embraced by Trump, who was an avid reader of Breitbart News and had been interviewed by Bannon on a radio program.\n\nTrump hired Bannon in August 2016 as his campaign\u2019s chief executive, and the former investment banker helped steer the self-described multibillionaire to the presidency with a populist message.\n\nWhile Bannon shaped Trump\u2019s agenda, his former client, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, was aghast at Trump\u2019s proposal to have a \u201ctotal and complete and shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d The prince said on Twitter \u2014 in which he owned a $1 billion stake \u2014 that Trump\u2019s proposal was a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d Trump tweeted back that he was a \u201cdopey prince.\u201d\n\nBannon said he has not talked with the prince in years, and he said that his views on Islam are misunderstood. \u201cI don\u2019t have any issue with Islam,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a problem with radical Islam.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s victory changed the prince\u2019s outlook, and the prince again took to Twitter, this time to congratulate the new president. That was just the beginning of an effort by the Saudis to court the new president, and they were rewarded with a March 14 meeting in the Oval Office with Trump and Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a son of Saudi King Salman bin Abdul Aziz.\n\nBannon, whose principle for decades has been to be in the room when a deal is being made, was by Trump\u2019s side during the meeting.\n\n\n\nBannon walks from then-President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s plane on Dec. 1, 2016, in Indianapolis, on the way to their meeting with Carrier Corporation. Bannon\u2019s business experience stretches back decades.

(Steve Helber/AP)\n\nJens Soering, a convicted double murderer whose innocence claims have drawn support from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and a detective who investigated the case more than 30 years ago, has lost another round with the Virginia Parole Board.\n\nThe board rejected Soering\u2019s request for parole, the prisoner learned Friday. In addition to parole, Soering has been seeking a full pardon from Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D). The pardon request is still under consideration, said Brian Moran, McAuliffe\u2019s secretary of public safety and homeland security.\n\n\u201cHis claim of innocence is still being processed and investigated by [the] parole board,\u201d Moran said by text message.\n\nThe board alone decides on requests for parole, but it makes recommendations to the governor on pardon petitions.\n\nThis was Soering\u2019s 12th go-round with the board but the first to follow two developments that he and supporters thought would boost his chances for release. One was a German documentary last year that raised new questions about his conviction. The other was a new analysis of evidence indicating that Soering was not the source of type-O blood found at the scene, as prosecutors had contended at his 1990 trial.\n\n\u201cObviously I\u2019m extremely disappointed and very surprised,\u201d Soering said in a telephone interview from Buckingham Correctional Center in central Virginia. \u201cI\u2019m not giving up the fight. I\u2019m innocent. The state has done me a great, great harm for 31 years, and today\u2019s decision is just another one in an enormously long line of horrible injustices.\u201d\n\n[In 1985, a gruesome double murder rocked Virginia. Was the wrong man convicted?]\n\nA German diplomat\u2019s son, Soering is serving two life sentences for the 1985 slayings of a girlfriend\u2019s parents in central Virginia. At the time of the murders, he and his girlfriend, Elizabeth Haysom, had been honors students at the University of Virginia.\n\nSoering initially confessed to the crime but later said he was only trying to protect Haysom from Virginia\u2019s electric chair under the mistaken belief that he had diplomatic immunity because of his father\u2019s position. He was convicted in a sensational 1990 trial that drew international press and gavel-to-gavel coverage on local cable television.\n\nHaysom pleaded guilty to being an accessory before the fact, contending that she helped plan the murders but did not physically take part. She is serving a 90-year sentence at Fluvanna Correctional Center for Women near Charlottesville.\n\n[Jens Soering says new blood analysis proves his innocence in 31-year-old case]\n\nSoering converted to Catholicism in prison and went on to write a string of books on religion, meditation, prison reform and his own criminal case. He has attracted a large and devoted group of supporters, who have pressed for his release for decades. They include actor Martin Sheen, who wrote the foreword to Soering\u2019s latest book, which was published in March by Lantern Books.\n\nIn 2010, the German Embassy and Richmond\u2019s Catholic bishop convinced then-Gov. Tim Kaine (D) to approve his transfer to a German prison, on the condition that he serve at least two years there. But Kaine\u2019s action \u2014 which he later justified as a way to save the commonwealth incarceration costs \u2014 caused an uproar and was reversed by his Republican successor, Robert F. McDonnell.\n\nIn the years since, Merkel personally pressed for Soering\u2019s transfer during a visit with then-President Barack Obama.\n\nA new blood analysis performed last summer, which indicates that a male other than Soering was the source of the type-O blood found at the home of Derek and Nancy Haysom, won Soering a notable convert: Chuck Reid, a former Bedford County sheriff\u2019s deputy who was originally assigned to the case. He began speaking out about his belief that Virginia had locked up the wrong man. But others remain convinced of Soering\u2019s guilt. Among them is Maj. Ricky Gardner, who was also on the case from the start. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. But he dismissed Reid\u2019s misgivings in interviews last year.\n\n\u201cIn recent years,\u201d he said in an email last year, \u201csome people have based their feelings of Soering\u2019s innocents on what-ifs and vague hypothesis and not on the facts/evidence presented at his trial.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/03/31/a-brief-history-of-how-america-feels-about-donald-trump/", "text": "This isn\u2019t the article I planned to write.\n\nWhat I had wanted to do was to see if Donald Trump\u2019s use of exclamation points bore any relationship to how he might be faring in the polls. That was prompted by a tweet from my colleague Chris Ingraham, who separately is breaking out Trump\u2019s enthusiasm in that regard. As it turns out, there isn\u2019t a correlation: no correlation to his primary polling, his general polling, his favorability polling or his approval polling. Or, for that matter the relative lead or deficit in that polling or net favorability or approval.\n\nTo check that, though, I ended up pulling all of that data. And, as it turns out, the data by itself is interesting.\n\nFor example, here is the actual primary and general polling average, the daily average favorability ratings and the daily Gallup rating Trump has seen since he announced his candidacy in June 2015.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that at no point, save for a few individual days of favorability ratings, has Trump been above 50 percent. Trump\u2019s favorability ratings ticked up after the election, but even so remained under 50 percent. His polling average in the primary was never above 50 percent, nor was it ever above 50 percent in the general. Trump was also the only candidate in the modern era of presidential primaries to win despite earning less than 50 percent of the vote in both the primary and the general.\n\nIf we look at those relative values, the picture is slightly different. This shows Trump\u2019s lead in the primary average, deficits in the general and net favorability or job approval over time.\n\nDuring the general election, he almost always trailed. His favorability was almost always underwater, often significantly. His Gallup approval rating started about even and then trended down.\n\nThe primary, though, was a different story. The Republican presidential primary has been the apex of Trump\u2019s political strength so far, with a consistent national lead that powered him through the those contests (although often only narrowly). Put another way: Trump has only being doing well when the pool of people being considered consists only of Republicans.\n\nIn Gallup\u2019s weekly averages since inauguration, it\u2019s Republicans that have kept his approval ratings as high as they are.\n\nOnly a third of independents approve of how he\u2019s doing. Only 8 percent of Democrats agree.\n\nIt\u2019s enough to make anyone tweet angrily."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/seeking-central-role-on-immigration-attorney-general-jeff-sessions-plots-border-visit-to-arizona/2017/03/30/34fc8596-1550-11e7-833c-503e1f6394c9_story.html", "text": "Attorney General Jeff Sessions, seen here at the White House on Tuesday, wants the Justice Department to have a greater role in immigration enforcement. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Justice Department is seeking to play a more muscular role in the Trump administration\u2019s immigration enforcement strategy, a move that is alarming immigrant rights advocates who fear Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s hard-line ideology could give Justice too much clout in determining policy.\n\nTo highlight the department\u2019s expanding role, Sessions is considering making his first trip to the southern border in mid-April to Nogales, Ariz., a busy border crossing region that features a major patrol station and already has miles of fencing and walls designed to keep out illegal immigrants from Mexico. Aides emphasized that his itinerary is still being developed and the stop in Nogales \u2014 which would come as Sessions travels to a conference of state police officials from around the country 200 miles away in Litchfield Park \u2014 is still tentative.\n\nIf he follows through, the border visit would come at a time when President Trump is asking Congress for billions of dollars to begin construction on a longer and larger wall between the United States and Mexico, a central campaign promise.\n\nIn recent weeks, Sessions has taken steps to increase his department\u2019s focus on immigration.\n\nHe signed on to a letter released Friday with Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly backing the practice of arresting undocumented immigrants at courthouses, saying officials had to resort to such measures when states wouldn\u2019t cooperate on immigration enforcement.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's White House Senior Adviser Stephen Miller worked for Attorney General Sessions on immigration reform when Sessions was in the Senate. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nOn Thursday, Sessions announced he is expanding a program to deport undocumented immigrants convicted of crimes after they serve their prison sentences, with the hope that the Justice Department can move more people straight from prison to their home countries rather than first moving them to immigrant detention facilities.\n\nJustice said it would expand to 20 the number of prisons participating in the Institutional Hearing Program, which has immigration judges come directly to prisons or has the inmates participate in deportation hearings via video.\n\n\u201cWe owe it to the American people to ensure that illegal aliens who have been convicted of crimes and are serving time in our federal prisons are expeditiously removed from our country as the law requires,\u201d Sessions said in a statement.\n\nEarlier this month, Sessions used the release of a Federal Justice Statistics report on arrests and prosecution to highlight cases involving immigration offenses and he also issued a statement in support of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement report that listed cities that fail to comply with enforcement orders.\n\nLast week, Sessions appeared in the White House briefing room to issue a threat to those cities that his agency could withhold federal law enforcement grants if they do not start to cooperate.\n\nSessions\u2019s activism has alarmed immigrant rights advocates concerned the department will play too powerful a role in a policy area that is typically the responsibility of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\u201cI think we want clarity over who\u2019s running immigration policy,\u201d Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said in an interview Thursday in Washington. Garcetti signed a directive two weeks ago prohibiting all city employees from using public resources to aide federal civil immigration actions.\n\n\u201cDOJ can give some opinions, but it\u2019s not primarily in their jurisdiction,\u201d Garcetti said. \u201cSo I know Senator Sessions has been very engaged, interested and involved in this area, but is he empowered by this administration beyond his formal responsibilities?\u201d\n\nSessions, a former Republican senator from Alabama, was one of Congress\u2019s fiercest border hawks, and he helped scuttle former president Barack Obama\u2019s 2013 immigration reform effort on Capitol Hill that featured a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. One of his former Senate staffers, Stephen Miller, is Trump\u2019s senior policy adviser.\n\nKelly, a former Marine general with little experience in immigration issues, has also signaled that he will pursue a tougher stance on enforcement at DHS. He issued a pair of memos in February aimed at implementing Trump\u2019s executive orders to broaden the pool of undocumented immigrants prioritized for removal and beef up other border security measures.\n\nBut legal experts said Sessions could significantly restructure the Justice Department by ramping up the number of immigration judges sent to the border to speed up hearings and by pursuing more criminal prosecutions against immigrants in the United States beyond those associated with drug cartels and human smugglers that past administrations have focused on.\n\nThe Sessions Justice Department also could move to strip some protections from undocumented immigrants, such as how much time they have to find a lawyer; more robustly defend DHS enforcement policies that are challenged in court; and use the Office of the Special Counsel to aggressively prevent employers from discriminating against American workers by hiring undocumented workers, said Leon Fresco, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cI think they will be in\u00adcred\u00adibly active,\u201d said Fresco, who helped draft the 2013 immigration bill while serving as an aide to Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). The only thing that could slow Sessions, he added, was \u201cfinding enough individuals with expertise and the willingness to speed these issues along.\u201d\n\nIf Sessions follows through, it would represent a sharp break from the policies of his predecessors in the Obama administration. In 2010, the Justice Department, then led by Eric H. Holder Jr., sued Arizona over a state law that granted broad immigration enforcement powers to local law enforcement agencies. The Supreme Court in 2012 upheld a lower court\u2019s ban on key provisions in the law.\n\nIn January, Holder was hired by the California Legislature to represent the state in potential legal fights with the Trump White House.\n\n\u201cI believe there is nothing wrong, legally, morally or intellectually, with a lawful system of immigration that serves the national interest. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d Sessions said in a speech to a conference of state attorneys general last month.\n\n\u201cPeople who come here unlawfully, who commit crimes, are going to be out of here,\u201d he added, punching a finger in the air for emphasis. \u201cThe law says that they have to be deported and we\u2019re going to insist that that happens.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s budget proposal outlines how Sessions could turn his rhetoric into action.\n\nIt calls for the Justice Department to hire 75 more immigration judge teams to speed removal proceedings, along with 60 more border enforcement prosecutors and 40 more deputy U.S. marshals to apprehend and transport those in the country illegally.\n\nThe budget also calls for an additional $171 million to buy short-term detention space, much of which will likely be used to house undocumented immigrants.\n\n\u201cImmigration is one of their top priorities, permeating every part of their agenda, and every part of the federal government and agencies,\u201d Marielena Hincapi\u00e9, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, said of the Trump White House.\n\nSessions is \u201cvery much aligned with their ideology,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is very knowledgeable. He\u2019s worked on these issues for decades now and has very strong opinions. He\u2019s finally in a position of power to use the department toward his vision and use the attorney general role as a bully pulpit.\u201d\n\nIn Nogales, Sessions would tour a border region that was once viewed as the most porous section, leading authorities to build the border walls and fences. In 2013, a bipartisan group of senators, led by John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Schumer, visited the area during the immigration reform deliberations.\n\nDuring the tour, McCain wrote on Twitter that they saw a woman scale the 18-foot bollard fence and drop down to the U.S. side of the border before she was apprehended by patrol agents. Some advocates suggested that the event was staged to support Republican calls for additional border security spending.\n\nThe Nogales barriers have had mixed results, officials said. Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, emphasized that any single-layered fencing is \u201cdefeatable.\u201d\n\nOverall, Judd said, \u201cwe do not think a 2,000-mile wall, a great wall of the United States, is necessary. But we 100 percent support a wall in strategic locations that allow us to dictate the crossing points.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/03/31/the-latest-attempt-to-validate-trumps-wiretapping-claim-an-obama-official-who-left-in-2015/", "text": "\n\nEvelyn Farkas on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on March 2. (MSNBC)\n\nThis article has been updated.\n\nIt has been tricky for President Trump and his allies to retroactively figure out how to explain his tweets about then-President Barack Obama wiretapping Trump Tower. Trump himself has pointed in various directions \u2014 random news reports, a headline in the New York Times, etc. \u2014 and his allies have, over time, embraced a variety of other theories. The most likely explanation continues to be the one that emerged shortly after he first tweeted the allegation: He\u2019d read a Breitbart article summarizing a claim made by radio host Mark Levin and ran with it in an unfounded direction.\n\nTerrible! Just found out that Obama had my \"wires tapped\" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017\n\nI'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017\n\nA hallmark of Trump\u2019s public persona, though, is that he is never (or only very, very rarely) wrong. Many of his supporters, asked to choose between what Trump says and what the media says in response, are similarly inclined to side with and try to rationalize what Trump has argued.\n\nTwo weeks ago, that rationalization took the form of embracing the vague assertions of Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), whose announcement that he\u2019d seen not-very-exculpatory documents quickly metastasized into a political problem for Nunes himself as it became clear that the trigger for his seeing those documents was someone in the administration.\n\nThis week, a new and unlikely hero: Evelyn Farkas.\n\nFarkas is a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia/Ukraine/Eurasia who served in that role from 2012 until she resigned at the end of October 2015. On March 2, she appeared on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d discussing a New York Times article about how the Obama administration had tried to ensure that evidence of Russia\u2019s involvement in the election would not be lost under Trump.\n\nHOST MIKA BRZEZINSKI: You actually knew about this attempt to get and preserve information and, full transparency, were doing some work yourself. Tell us about that. FARKAS: Well, I was urging my former colleagues, and, frankly speaking, the people on the Hill \u2014 it was more, actually, aimed at telling the Hill people: Get as much information as you can, get as much intelligence as you can, before President Obama leaves the administration, because I had a fear that somehow that information would disappear with the senior people that left. So it would be hidden away in the bureaucracy. That the Trump folks, if they found out how we knew what we knew about their, the staff, the Trump staff\u2019s dealing with Russians, that they would try to compromise those sources and methods, meaning we would no longer have access to that intelligence. So I became very worried, because not enough was coming out into the open, and I knew that there was more. We have very good intelligence on Russia. So then I had talked to some of my former colleagues, and I knew that they were trying to also help get information to the Hill. BRZEZINSKI: A lot going on today. FARKAS: But that\u2019s why you have the leaking.\n\nTo defend President Trump's wiretapping claims, White House press secretary Sean Spicer brought up statements Obama official Evelyn Farkas, who left the administration in 2015, made on television in recent weeks. (Reuters)\n\nDuring his daily news briefing on Thursday, press secretary Sean Spicer twice referred to those comments from Farkas, which had been featured on conservative radio and on Fox News\u2019 website the day prior.\n\n\u201c[I]f I can go back for a second to something that the Obama administration\u2019s Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense noted very clearly on the record,\u201d Spicer said, \u201cthat they were engaged in an effort to spread information about Trump officials that had come up in intelligence. That\u2019s not \u2014 that is several networks. Evelyn Farkas made that proclamation about what was going on during the Obama administration regarding the Trump team. So that is something that they made very clear on the record.\u201d\n\nAsked about it by radio host Hugh Hewitt, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus called it \u201cincredible.\u201d\n\n\u201c[I]t\u2019s so cavalier and unbelievable that I just wonder whether this person knows what the heck she\u2019s talking about,\u201d Priebus said.\n\nThe headline on the Fox News story summarized the defense: \u201cFormer Obama official discloses rush to get intelligence on Trump team.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that we\u2019re a few steps removed from the Trump tweets themselves. Trump\u2019s wiretapping claims were somehow validated by what Nunes had seen \u2014 granting Trump the flexibility that \u201cwiretapping\u201d didn\u2019t necessarily mean an actual wiretap but instead broad surveillance and that \u201chis phones\u201d meant communications systems that may not have been actual phones and may not have been actually his and may not have been actually at Trump Tower. But then the administration was forced to defend how Nunes got that information in the first place, which is how we end up at Farkas: It wasn\u2019t necessarily someone at the White House who leaked that information to Nunes (though reporting suggests that it was).\n\nSpicer again:\n\n[I]f you look at Obama\u2019s Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense that is out there, Evelyn Farkas, she made it clear that it was their goal to spread this information around, that they went around and did this. And she said, \u201cThat\u2019s why there are so many leaks.\u201d They have admitted on the record that this was their goal \u2014 to leak stuff. And they literally \u2014 she said on the record \u201cTrump\u2019s team.\u201d There are serious questions out there about what happened and why and who did it. And I think that\u2019s really where our focus is in making sure that that information gets out.\n\nThat\u2019s not really what Farkas said. She said that she had encouraged people in the administration and on Capitol Hill to investigate links between the Trump campaign and Russia in the window before Trump took office and to protect that information from the incoming administration, lest the methods used to collect it be compromised and the information buried. That concern that the truth be known, she said, is why information was being leaked \u2014 and she hoped what wasn\u2019t leaked was protected.\n\nUpdate: Farkas spoke to The Post\u2019s Karen De Young on Thursday night, saying that she \u201cdidn\u2019t give anybody anything except advice.\u201d In an interview with the Daily Caller, she said, \u201cI had no intelligence whatsoever, I wasn\u2019t in government anymore and didn\u2019t have access to any.\u201d\n\nTo some extent, this is all framing. If you\u2019re inclined to believe that Trump was unfairly targeted by the Obama administration, you will read Farkas\u2019s comments as Spicer does. If you are inclined not to, you may have a different interpretation.\n\nIt\u2019s critical to remember here, though, that Farkas wasn\u2019t a part of the administration. She\u2019s someone who had access to information about Russia while she worked for the Defense Department, but she left that role before Trump won a single vote in a single primary. She certainly still knew people within the administration, and she mentions them. But the only thing she attributes to people who still worked for the administration is that they were \u201ctrying to also help get information to the Hill\u201d \u2014 precisely what the Times story said.\n\nThis is mostly sleight of hand. The question of why Trump tweeted what he did has largely been answered, with even Nunes admitting that there\u2019s no evidence Trump was wiretapped. The question of how Nunes got his information is still a bit uncertain, but it\u2019s coming into focus. It seems pretty clear, though, that \u2014 unless your question is the already-answered one of whether or not there was any investigation into Trump at all \u2014 what someone who didn\u2019t work for Obama at all during 2016 said two days before Trump\u2019s tweets didn\u2019t have much to do with any of it."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/russia-investigation-has-a-new-front-inside-the-white-house/2017/03/31/e74c8bfc-162b-11e7-833c-503e1f6394c9_story.html", "text": "Russia\u2019s interference in the presidential campaign began as a story of a hostile adversary attempting to tamper with an American election. It soon expanded into troubling questions about possible collusion between associates of President Trump\u2019s campaign and the Russians. Today it has moved directly into the White House.\n\nThat this has become, in addition to everything else, a White House story is due to a self-inflicted wound, created by President Trump with his tweets accusing then-President Barack Obama of (illegally) ordering a wiretap of Trump Tower. Attempts to prove that allegation, or at least muddy what has been repeatedly debunked, now have snared others and the questions today include what did White House officials do and why did they do it?\n\nIt is still too early draw conclusions about where all these threads will lead. That\u2019s true about long-standing questions of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians \u2014 still not proven \u2014 as well as the new question about how and why White House officials used House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) to try to cast doubt on those who doubted Trump\u2019s tweets about Obama.\n\nIt is not too early, however, to know that the investigations are months and months away from completion. And what is now known has not only deeply compromised the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation into the Russia affair, but also raised questions that White House officials seem unable or unwilling to answer \u2014 but which investigators will eventually have to answer.\n\nAdded to all that is the statement from the attorney for former national security adviser Michael Flynn, saying that his client has a story to tell and is prepared to testify before investigative panels in exchange for immunity, even if investigators are not prepared to make such a deal. The president applauded Flynn in a Friday morning tweet and described the investigations as a witch hunt by Democrats and the media to obscure or diminish his victory in the election. That assertion is belied by the seriousness of the machinery that is moving forward at the FBI and on Capitol Hill.\n\n(Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Russia issue will remain a cloud over the White House until those investigations are complete. White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who is in the unenviable position of having to publicly defend his boss\u2019s wildest statements, has said the White House is not consumed by these inquiries, but the president keeps undercutting that assertion with his tweets. The tweets about Obama damaged his credibility, and his aides have damaged their own in attempting to explain his accusations.\n\n[White House officials tied to files shared with Rep. Nunes]\n\nThe Nunes episode illustrates the compounding nature of the problem. When Nunes rushed to the White House more than a week ago to brief the president on what he said was sensitive new information \u2014 not bearing on the Russia investigation \u2014 that showed that Trump officials had been caught up incidentally in surveillance and perhaps unmasked illegally, he set off a chain of events that continues to reverberate.\n\nAt the time, Spicer was asked whether anyone in the White House had been involved in supplying the intelligence information to Nunes. \u201cI don\u2019t know why he would come up to brief the president on something we gave him,\u201d Spicer said. He added, \u201cI\u2019m not aware of it, but it really doesn\u2019t pass the smell test.\u201d\n\nNow it is the odor of apparent complicity that the White House is smelling. For days, no one at the White House would answer the easily answerable question of who had cleared Nunes into the White House compound to view sensitive intelligence information. Then on Thursday, shortly before Spicer\u2019s briefing, the New York Times reported that two White House officials have been involved in helping to provide Nunes with the information. The Washington Post later named a third person who was involved in handling the material.\n\nAt his briefing, before taking any questions about the Times\u2019s revelations, Spicer announced that the White House had invited the chairs and ranking members of the House and Senate Intelligence committees to come to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. to look at some new information bearing on the question of whether \u201cinformation collected on U.S. individuals was mishandled and leaked\u201d that had been found \u201cin the ordinary course of business.\u201d He offered no answers about possible White House involvement with Nunes.\n\nRep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee asked the obvious question in response to Thursday\u2019s revelations. If members of the National Security Council staff had unearthed material in the normal course of business bearing on the handling of intelligence material, why was it left to Nunes to brief the president? As Schiff put it, \u201cWhy all the cloak-and-dagger stuff?\u201d\n\nView Graphic Team Trump\u2019s ties to Russian interests\n\n[Flynn offers testimony in exchange for immunity]\n\nThere are other curious aspects to the most recent revelations. Ezra Cohen is the National Security Council staff person who was involved in helping Nunes gain access to the intelligence information. Cohen was brought to the National Security staff by Flynn and named to the sensitive position of senior director for intelligence.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, who replaced Flynn as national security adviser, sought to move Cohen out of his position. Cohen appealed to White House senior adviser Jared Kushner and chief strategist and senior counselor Stephen K. Bannon and remained in place. Keeping Cohen in his post would have been a favor to Cohen and thus also to Flynn.\n\nKeeping Flynn happy could be important to Trump. The retired lieutenant general was forced to resign as national security adviser in February after misleading Vice President Pence about the nature of his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the transition. Initial reports about his departure said that Flynn had made the decision to step down voluntarily. The next day, the story changed: Trump had lost confidence in Flynn and asked for the resignation.\n\nFlynn was unhappy with that characterization and made his feelings known to the White House, according to one knowledgeable official. A day later, the president offered kind words for Flynn in public, calling him \u201ca wonderful man\u201d who had been \u201ctreated very, very unfairly\u201d by the media. Once again on Friday, the president came to Flynn\u2019s defense as the investigation deepens.\n\nTrump\u2019s original tweets accusing Obama of wiretapping seemed designed to create a diversion from the main investigation into what happened during the election, and they certainly have done that. But he unintentionally set the White House on a path that has led to this moment.\n\nConfronted by flat-out denials from FBI Director James B. Comey and key congressional leaders that Obama had ordered wiretapping, White House officials first sought to redefine the words in the president\u2019s tweets to suggest he only meant some kind of surveillance. Then Nunes entered the picture, acting as an ally of the president, to suggest something like that had taken place, though neither he nor anyone at the White House has described exactly what information he viewed.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the questions about what White House officials did and why remain secondary to the larger issue of Russia\u2019s interference and whether Trump associates were involved. That\u2019s the principal focus of the FBI and the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is moving forward with its work despite all the controversy involving the House committee and the White House.\n\nBut the cascade of questions for the White House are important and legitimate. Having created this new front in the expanding controversy, the president and his aides will now be forced to endure continued and justifiable scrutiny over what they have done to add to the mystery."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trump-i-look-very-much-forward-to-meeting-chinas-president/2017/03/31/bfb6d220-162e-11e7-bb16-269934184168_video.html", "text": "- President Trump criticized jobs \"going to China and other places,\" during a meeting with manufacturers on March 31.

Here's what he and President Donald Trump said about immunity in 2016. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\nAs far as spin goes, President Trump\u2019s tweet about his former national security adviser Michael Flynn on Friday morning isn\u2019t terrible.\n\nMike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 31, 2017\n\nGet that? Flynn is only seeking immunity \u2014 as was reported on Thursday evening \u2014 because the Democrats and the media are whipping up a rigged witch hunt and Flynn can\u2019t trust the process.\n\nThat spin runs contrary to the assumptions of many fervent opponents of the president. As readily as Trump, Flynn and his allies rushed to criticism when aides to Hillary Clinton sought immunity in the probe of her email server, Trump\u2019s opponents seized on the suggestion of an immunity deal as evidence that Flynn necessarily had secrets to hide.\n\nThe truth is probably far more subtle than that, according to Todd Bussert, a federal criminal defense attorney in Connecticut who spoke with The Washington Post by phone Friday morning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for anybody who\u2019s the subject of a federal investigation to want immunity before speaking to federal authorities,\u201d Bussert said. \u201cEven if they\u2019ve done nothing wrong, there\u2019s this fear that something they say could be used against them.\u201d\n\nBut, of course, it\u2019s not usually in the government\u2019s interest to grant that immunity. For one thing, the government is in the business of prosecuting those guilty of crimes, not simply in hearing their stories. For another, granting someone immunity doesn\u2019t guarantee that they will tell the truth \u2014 having immunity may make people more likely to couch or frame their words in whatever way they wish.\n\nWhen immunity is granted, it\u2019s often with an eye toward reeling in a bigger fish \u2014 which is why Trump critics have seized on the idea. But as Bussert noted in our conversation, that also makes Flynn\u2019s request for immunity sort of an all-or-nothing deal: Either he\u2019s got something that can take down the president or he has nothing that will take down anybody, since there aren\u2019t many bigger fish than a top adviser to the president of the United States.\n\nThe government isn\u2019t going to simply give immunity just to hear a confession. That\u2019s not how such agreements work anyway; prosecutors only grant immunity once they know what information the person has. \u201cYou would have a difficult time seeing a scenario whereby they would be willing to look the other way if they think he engaged in criminal misconduct,\u201d Bussert said. \u201cThey might say, \u2018Come in and help yourself. Come in to a cooperation agreement and we\u2019ll help you at sentencing \u2014 but we\u2019re not going to simply let you walk away from this.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut, he added, \u201cWhat a congressional committee might feel could be completely different.\u201d And that\u2019s key.\n\nRemember: Defense attorneys generally are quick to advise clients not to talk to prosecutors at all. That Flynn\u2019s attorney publicly demonstrated his willingness to \u201ctell his story\u201d under the cover of immunity gives us a hint of what the strategy might be. As Alex Whiting also noted at the blog Just Security, Flynn\u2019s attorney may be hoping that Congress, not prosecutors, grant him immunity before he tells them anything. Congress can\u2019t make Flynn immune from prosecution, but lawmakers can make his testimony immune from being used against him \u2014 as has famously been done in the past.\n\n\n\nOliver North addresses the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington on Feb. 9, 2012. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nIn 1990, a federal appeals court vacated three convictions against Oliver North, a former Reagan administration official who had been caught in the Iran-contra scandal several years earlier. Convicted of bribery, destruction of documents and obstructing a congressional inquiry, he received a suspended sentence. Those convictions were overturned, however, because North had been granted immunity for his testimony before Congress as part of its investigation into the scandal. While that testimony wasn\u2019t used as part of North\u2019s criminal prosecution, the court determined that it may have tainted the evidence that was included. In 1991, the convictions were thrown out.\n\n\u201cEveryone familiar with these proceedings has recognized the difficulties presented by the grant of immunity by Congress,\u201d prosecutor Lawrence Walsh told the New York Times when the appeals court decision was announced.\n\nFlynn\u2019s attorney may be hoping to do the same thing. Get a blanket immunity from a congressional committee. Tell the committee what you know, which may or may not be anything of any significance. Let that immunity then muddy the waters around any criminal inquiry. Since the North incident, Bussert said he wasn\u2019t aware of any fixes that could prevent the same thing from happening again \u2014 after all, we\u2019re talking about two independent branches of government. \u201cStrategically,\u201d he said, \u201cit makes sense.\u201d\n\nIf Flynn wants to get immunity from a congressional committee, one thing that might help is the perception that he\u2019s being targeted unfairly out of political motivations. If the Republicans who run investigatory committees are convinced that there\u2019s an unfair effort to impugn Flynn, they might be more willing to grant him immunity so that he can speak freely without worrying about partisan repercussions.\n\nYou know what might help reinforce that concern among Republicans? A tweet to that end from a Republican president."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/what-you-need-to-know-about-trumps-feud-with-the-freedom-caucus/2017/03/30/5f6ba662-15ab-11e7-bb16-269934184168_video.html", "text": "- President Trump on March 30 tweeted that he would \u201cfight\u201d the House Freedom Caucus in the 2018 midterm elections after the group blocked the health-care bill.

The decision has upended the political dynamic on Capitol Hill, giving Democrats a stronger hand in upcoming debates over the federal budget, potential talks over revamping the tax code and transportation funding \u2014 all major priorities for Trump.\n\nBut Democratic senators can only slow, not stop, Republicans from confirming Gorsuch, a 49-year-old judge on the Denver-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit whose nomination has united GOP lawmakers behind Trump as nothing else so far this year.\n\nOn Thursday, two moderate Democrats facing GOP pressure to support Gorsuch, Sens. Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.) and Joe Manchin III (W.Va.), said that they would back him. But an additional 32 Democrats oppose Gorsuch and plan to filibuster him, according to a Washington Post whip count \u2014 meaning that the judge will need 60 votes to clear a procedural hurdle before a final confirmation vote scheduled for later next week.\n\nView Graphic How Gorsuch\u2019s judicial experience compares with his Supreme Court predecessors\n\n[How many votes Democrats need to block Neil Gorsuch\u2019s Supreme Court nomination]\n\nRepublicans hold 52 seats in the Senate, not enough votes to defeat a filibuster but enough to invoke the \u201cnuclear option\u201d that would change Senate rules and allow Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation \u2014 and others after it \u2014 to proceed on a simple majority vote.\n\nSenators fearful of ending long-standing traditions tried in recent days to ward off a bitter floor fight but failed to launch talks on a compromise. In the interview, Schumer said he doubted that an agreement could be reached.\n\n\u201cThe deal would be, \u2018We won\u2019t change the rules on the next one,\u2019 but the nuclear option is always available,\u201d he said. \u201cSo how do you solve that?\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and other Republicans have said that Gorsuch will be confirmed \u201cno matter what\u201d \u2014 a threat to change Senate rules to do so.\n\nBut Schumer said it is \u201cabsurd\u201d that Republicans believe they need to change the chamber\u2019s rules to confirm Gorsuch. Schumer warned that Republicans face an \u201cuphill slog\u201d that became more difficult after Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation hearing.\n\nOver three days last week, Gorsuch spent nearly 20 hours answering approximately 1,200 questions from members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, according to aides helping him with his confirmation. He has also provided 70 pages of written responses to questions from senators of both parties, those aides said. As of Thursday, Gorsuch had met with nearly 80 senators \u2014 including seven this week, but aides declined to specify with whom he met with in recent days.\n\n(The Washington Post)\n\n[Neil Gorsuch\u2019s Supreme Court nomination is on track to change the Senate \u2014 and further divide the country]\n\nRegardless, Gorsuch \u201cdid not convince people he was independent and thoughtful and down the middle,\u201d Schumer said \u2014 a sentiment echoed by other Democrats in recent days.\n\nThroughout history, the overwhelming majority of Supreme Court nominees have received a substantial majority of votes for confirmation. No Supreme Court nominee has ever been blocked by a single-party filibuster. Abe Fortas, nominated to be chief justice in 1968, was the only nominee for the court to get blocked on the so-called cloture vote, by a bipartisan coalition that had enough votes to defeat his nomination outright.\n\nIn the nearly 50 years since, just two justices \u2014 William Rehnquist and Samuel A. Alito Jr. \u2014 have been the only nominees to face a cloture vote. Rehnquist faced one when he was first nominated in 1971 and when he ascended to chief justice in 1986.\n\nRepublicans are increasingly agitated with Democratic attacks on Gorsuch. On Thursday, one of his staunchest defenders, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), called him \u201cone of the finest men to ever serve on the bench in the history of this country\u201d and used an interview on Fox News to denounce \u201cgarbage\u201d Democratic attacks on Gorsuch\u2019s record.\n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) described the Democratic opposition as \u201can escalation\u201d of years-long partisan feuds over the composition of federal courts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like the Hatfields and McCoys; the feud\u2019s been going on for so long that people have forgotten what the initial causes were,\u201d Cornyn said on Wednesday. \u201cBut it did start back in the George W. Bush administration when this whole idea of filibustering judges with requiring 60 votes was cooked up. And, unfortunately, we\u2019ve been through 15 years of that, and this is just the latest incarnation of that fight.\u201d\n\nConservative organizations, including the National Rifle Association, are spending millions of dollars to pressure the 10 Democratic senators facing reelection next year in states that Trump won.\n\nWith Manchin and Heitkamp on board, attention will turn to others, including Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), who told donors in recent days that a decision on Gorsuch \u201cis really hard,\u201d according to a recording obtained by the Kansas City Star.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be people in this room that are going to say, \u2018No, no, no. You cannot vote for Gorsuch,\u2019 \u201d McCaskill said in the recording, which was verified by her office. \u201cLet\u2019s assume for the purposes of this discussion that we turn down Gorsuch, that there are not eight Democrats that vote to confirm him and therefore there\u2019s not enough to put him on the Supreme Court.

As a candidate, Trump vowed to select from a list of 21 names provided by the conservative Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) \u201canecdotally suffered\u201d from online Russian campaigns against him during his presidential bid.\n\nRyan\u2019s office was not aware of an effort against him, according to a spokeswoman. Rubio said later Thursday that his campaign staff had been \u201ctargeted\u201d twice \u201cfrom an unknown location in Russia,\u201d once in July 2016 and again at 10:45 a.m. Wednesday. Both attempts were unsuccessful, he added, without providing further details.\n\nThe revelations widen the scope of politicians who have become the subject of Russian-backed hacking operations and online smear campaigns, allegedly a central part of a Kremlin strategy to spread propaganda in the United States and undermine its democratic institutions.\n\nClint Watts, a senior fellow with the Foreign Policy Research Institute\u2019s Program on National Security, talks with reporters after his testimony on March 30. (Susan Walsh/AP)\n\nWatts and others who spoke to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday are not involved in ongoing probes of Russia\u2019s alleged efforts to sway the 2016 elections and possible campaign links to the Kremlin. They argued that such meddling is only one example of what Russia plans to do with the arsenal of hacking and influence tools it has been building for years.\n\n\u201cRussians could not do this if they started in 2016,\u201d said Roy Godson, an expert in Soviet and Russian \u201cactive measures\u201d \u2014 tools of political warfare used to influence world events \u2014 and emeritus professor of government at Georgetown University. \u201cFor many, many decades we did not take this stuff very seriously, and they were able to take enormous advantage.\u201d\n\nExperts noted several deficiencies in U.S. defenses against Russian cyberattacks, including the lack of a cybersecurity policy, poor defense coordination between the public and private sector, and almost no reliable government system to shoot down false propaganda when it arises.\n\nThey stressed that there was a false sense of complacency in government, with information technology expert Thomas Rid of King\u2019s College London highlighting a close and surprising example: The security chips on congressional staffers\u2019 identification badges, he said, are fake.\n\nThe badge \u201cdoesn\u2019t actually have a proper chip. It has a picture of a chip,\u201d Rid said. \u201cIt\u2019s only to prevent chip envy. That tells you there\u2019s a serious IT security problem.\u201d\n\nExperts stressed Russia has no political allies in the United States and will, as Watts put it, attack or discredit \u201cpeople on both sides of the aisle . . . solely based on what they want to achieve in their own landscape, whatever the Russian foreign policy objectives are. They win because they play both sides.\u201d\n\nHe also said that President Trump\u2019s actions in particular \u2014 such as calling attention to conspiracy theories and tweeting about them \u2014 are helping Russian propaganda succeed in the United States.\n\nSenate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.), right, sits next to the panel\u2019s top Democrat, Sen.

Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), stood side by side in a rare news briefing to offer an update on the status of their investigation.\n\nThey did so as the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s probe has effectively ground to halt, with Democratic members accusing the Republican chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), of undermining the investigation by working on Trump\u2019s behalf.\n\nExperts suggested that Congress has no time to sort out its political differences before addressing the Russian threat. They warned that Russia, having successfully deployed an Internet army to affect an American election, will probably look for future political targets and exploit new technologies to sow more discord in the electoral process and more distrust among citizens of the country\u2019s democratic institutions.\n\n\u201cSomewhere in their cache right now there\u2019s tremendous amounts of information laying around they can weaponize against other Americans,\u201d Watts warned.\n\nThe witnesses said Russia\u2019s \u201cactive measures\u201d date at least to 2009, when fake, Russian-owned social-media accounts began popping up online. Those accounts \u2014 meant to look as if they belong to Americans, pictures and all \u2014 amount to an easily deployable influence army critical to spreading Russian propaganda, the witnesses argued.\n\nIn 2014, they began to work on \u201cinfluence campaigns\u201d more intently, and by 2015 they had \u201ctied hacking and influence together at the same time,\u201d Watts said, specifically referring to the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the later release of that information publicly.\n\nIn just March and April of 2016, Rid added, Russians targeted at least 109 full-time Hillary Clinton campaign staffers, as well as several DNC staffers.\n\nExperts said they have no way of knowing which attacks were carried out by automatic \u201cbots\u201d and which were not, imploring lawmakers to seek more detailed data from social-media companies.\n\nThey also urged lawmakers to think about ways Russia could exploit new technologies, drawing particular attention to virtual reality, the simulated worlds in which people can interact through a headset or helmet with people and places that seem real but aren\u2019t.\n\n\u201cAnybody who could set up the reality is going to have a very decided advantage in politics and other areas,\u201d Godson said.\n\nThe experts encouraged investigators to follow the trail of Russian money, through oligarchs, and to \u201cfollow the trail of dead Russians,\u201d Watts said, referring to a string of prominent Russians who have recently died or been killed, to find clues about how Russian money is laundered.\n\nFinally, they warned that the intelligence community has to change its way of thinking and focus on what is going on in public arenas such as social media as much as they do on closed secure transactions, since the spread of propaganda is such a critical part of Russia\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cMost of this influence came online. They essentially duplicated an old active-measure system without setting foot in the United States,\u201d Watts said. \u201cWhen it comes to open source, we miss what\u2019s right in front of our nose.\u201d\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/tracking-trumps-promises-is-he-donating-his-presidential-salary/2017/03/31/a2dd8562-1594-11e7-bb16-269934184168_video.html", "text": "- Since the election, President Donald Trump has pledged that he will donate his $400,000 per year presidential salary to charity.

Chris Christie (R) found a role within the Trump administration after all. On Wednesday, it was announced that he would lead a White House commission aimed at fighting drug addiction \u2014 particularly the rise in opioid abuse, which has become a genuine crisis in the United States.\n\nThere are scores of stories detailing the extent to which opioids have reshaped public health and law enforcement, but one detail from a story on Thursday morning stood out for me.\n\nThe district attorney for Kings County, N.Y. \u2014 better known as Brooklyn \u2014 announced 37 arrests for distribution of a range of drugs, including the opioid heroin. The head of the NYPD\u2019s detective squad, Robert Boyce, also spoke at the news conference, and he laid out an unexpected statistic.\n\n\u201cAn excess of 1,200 overdosed last year. We only had 355 murders last year, so you can do the numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the leading crisis in the city.\u201d\n\nThat ratio \u2014 overdose deaths to murders \u2014 is an interesting way of considering the scale of the crisis. With that in mind, I pulled data on opioid deaths in each state from 2006 to 2015 (the most recent year available, though not all states have data) as well as the number of murders in each state over the same period.\n\nThe trend is clear. In 2006, 27 of the 49 states for which there is data had more opioid deaths than murders. By 2014, that number was 45 \u2014 with only five states recording more murders than deaths from opioids. Data are available for 26 states from 2015; in each, the number of opioid deaths was higher than the number of murders.\n\nHowever, not all states are equal. Using the most recent figures for each state, it\u2019s clear that the Northeast has been more heavily affected than other parts of the country.\n\nBut even that is a relatively recent development. New Hampshire\u2019s spiking opioid problem \u2014 up from 98 deaths in 2008 to 451 in 2015 \u2014 and relatively low number of murders means that it has experienced the largest spike in the ratio between the two. Other states with high opioid-death-to-murder ratios have also seen big upticks in the past few years.\n\nWhen he was on the campaign trail running for president, Christie frequently spoke about addiction. He would often mention a friend of his from law school who\u2019d gotten addicted to opioids after a back injury and who eventually died of an overdose. As governor, Christie attended his friend\u2019s funeral. In New Jersey, the ratio of opioid deaths to murders in 2014 was relatively low: 2.4 overdoses for every homicide.\n\nChristie\u2019s campaign for the presidency wasn\u2019t successful, but he\u2019ll at least now have a chance to tackle this issue."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/sen-rubio-talks-about-attempted-hacking-on-his-campaign-aides/2017/03/30/7ebe5d9e-157d-11e7-bb16-269934184168_video.html", "text": "- Sen.

Do you support gay marriage? How do you feel about women in politics? Do we spend too much fighting crime? That sort of thing. The results are broken down by various demographic groupings, allowing for a fascinating look at how America has evolved.\n\nConsider, for example, attitudes about the press. It is by now common knowledge that confidence in the press has waned over time. Every year, Gallup releases an assessment of how much Americans trust the media; it has been sinking lower over time. Thanks to the GSS, though, we can see a longer trend \u2014 and when, exactly, that trust started to evaporate.\n\nIn the GSS, the question is posed as being about how much confidence the respondent has \u2014 a great deal, only some, or hardly any. In the 1970s, respondents generally said \u201conly some.\u201d But in the 1990s, patterns shifted and \u201chardly any\u201d shot up. In the 2016 GSS, released this week, \u201chardly any\u201d was the response of a plurality of people.\n\nNotice the pattern of \u201chardly any\u201d since 2004, though. During presidential election years \u2014 marked with vertical lines \u2014 the \u201chardly any\u201d response is up. During midterms, it\u2019s down.\n\nWhy? Republicans.\n\nWhile confidence among members of both parties has declined over time, the Republican pattern is interesting: Up during a presidential election, down during the off-year. Only in the 2012-2014-2016 period does that hold for Democrats. (Notice, too, the increase among independents over that time period.)\n\nNotice, though, where that variation comes into play. Conservative Republicans are pretty consistently skeptical of the press. Moderate Republicans, though, see big swings from cycle to cycle. There are fewer of them, so variability can increase more easily. But much of that cycle-to-cycle swing is clearly from these moderates.\n\nThere are a number of unanswered questions here. Why the sudden surge in distrust in the early 1990s? Why are moderate Republicans more likely to distrust the media during a presidential election year? Your theories are welcome.\n\nOne question we can answer though: There doesn\u2019t seem to be a link between education levels and confidence in the press. Overall, those without a college degree are generally more likely to have confidence in the press. When broken out by party, education level doesn\u2019t make much difference.\n\nThese data also suggest something else. The candidacy of Donald Trump and his constant assertions of media bias don\u2019t seem to have made Republicans significantly more skeptical of the media than they normally \u2014 or than they would normally be during a presidential election year. Instead, it seems safer to assume that he was simply playing to their existing concerns.\n\nThe General Social Survey was funded primarily by the National Science Foundation and conducted through in-person interviews with a random national sample of roughly 1,900 adults in the spring of 2016. Overall results carry a margin of sampling error of roughly 2.5 percentage points; the error margin for subgroups is larger."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/03/30/41-of-the-50-counties-where-insurance-rates-rose-the-most-since-2012-voted-for-trump/", "text": "\n\nProtesters gather across the Chicago River from Trump Tower to rally against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, on Friday in Chicago. (Charles Rex Arbogast/AP)\n\nIn late 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid put into words one of the tacit assumptions that powered Democratic support for the Affordable Care Act: It would help Democratic senators at the polls the following year.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be good for them,\u201d Reid said about Obamacare. \u201cBy that time, there will be a lot of people on it that have already signed up. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nIt was not fine. The Democrats were blown out in the 2014 elections and Reid lost his majority. While it was true that the Affordable Care Act had kicked in and people had gained insurance, that didn\u2019t translate to electoral success \u2014 at least then.\n\nAs it turns out, it didn\u2019t necessarily help much in 2016, either.\n\nData released from the Census Bureau this week shows a broad drop in the number of uninsured people across the country from 2014 to 2015. Most counties saw a decline. Most counties also then went on to vote for Donald Trump for president, despite his regular insistence that he\u2019d quickly rip Obamacare out by the roots.\n\nIf we plot the results of the election by county from those that saw the biggest drop in the percentage of the population that was uninsured since 2012 to those that saw the smallest drop \u2014 or, in a few cases, an increase \u2014 it\u2019s obvious that there\u2019s no strong correlation. There\u2019s an even mix of counties that voted for Hillary Clinton or Trump scattered throughout.\n\nWe can look at that same data another way, plotting the 2016 results against the decrease in the percentage of uninsured people from 2012 to 2015.\n\nA big cloud like that generally suggests that there\u2019s no strong correlation between the data on the two axes.\n\nNotice the bottom part of that cloud, though. The dots at the bottom (and drifting out past the lower boundary) are those counties that saw the biggest drops in the percentage of uninsured people over that four-year period. And nearly all of them voted for Trump.\n\nIn fact, 41 of the 50 counties that had the biggest drops backed Trump, by an average margin of 53 percentage points.\n\nThe link here, in part, is that the drops in the percentage of uninsured were bigger in counties with smaller populations \u2014 and counties with smaller populations are also generally counties that are more rural and more Republican. But the assumption Reid made that more coverage would equal more Democratic votes didn\u2019t happen in those places.\n\nIf we combine the vote totals from counties that saw different levels of decline in the percentage of uninsured people, there\u2019s more of a correlation. Clustered into chunks of 15 million to 20 million voters, those places that saw bigger drops in the number of uninsured people collectively were more favorably inclined to Clinton.\n\nBut, of course, this also means that we\u2019re starting to loop in cities with big populations and a Democratic lean.\n\nWhat it took for Obamacare to become a political asset, it seems, may have been Trump\u2019s election. The prospect of actually losing that insurance has spurred the policy to be viewed much more positively in recent months.\n\nWhether that will eventually bear the political fruit that Reid once assumed remains to be seen."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/burr-and-warner-in-the-spotlight-and-arm-in-arm-on-russia-probe/2017/03/30/4ed7ae3e-153f-11e7-833c-503e1f6394c9_story.html", "text": "Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.), right, and Sen.

The House Intelligence Committee has unraveled as its chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), has come under fire for having an unplanned classified briefing on White House grounds and refusing to share his information with panel members.\n\nBurr and Warner set out to send the exact opposite message in previewing their own investigation. Ostensibly explaining the scope of their inquiry, their more important challenge was to show that there would be an adult, bipartisan review of what happened last year.\n\nThey stood shoulder to shoulder, so they were always in the frame together. Burr began by declaring that he would not answer any questions about the House probe, an indirect way of dismissing that partisan effort.\n\nHe promised that the single biggest question his panel would try to answer was what, if any, knowledge Trump had of the Russian plot.\n\n\u201cWe know that our challenge is to answer that question for the American people,\u201d he said.\n\nIf successful, Burr and Warner will have overcome the odds in this partisan era. That they even have a chance is based largely on a personal relationship that is rare in today\u2019s Senate.\n\n(Reuters)\n\nNunes admits meeting with source of Trump surveillance documents on White House grounds\n\nTheir backgrounds couldn\u2019t be more different. Burr grew up in Winston-Salem, N.C., the son of a minister. He played football at Wake Forest University and then spent 17 years selling lawn equipment before winning a House seat in 1994. Warner grew up in Connecticut, was valedictorian at George Washington University and went to work on Capitol Hill. He spun off his expertise in telecommunications to become a cellphone chief executive worth $200 million or more.\n\nThey came together in the Senate through their mutual friendship with former senator Saxby Chambliss (Ga.), the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee before Burr. Chambliss served with Burr in the House before they were elected to the Senate, forming a rat pack with future House speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio).\n\nWarner became friends with Chambliss through their shared hatred of the Treasury\u2019s debt. They led a long effort to craft a $2 trillion plan of slashed spending and increased taxes, the sort of plan that aggravated both parties\u2019 leadership.\n\nIt went nowhere \u2014 but it created a real bond.\n\nDrawn into Chambliss\u2019s circle, Warner befriended Burr. The multimillionaire regularly ribs Burr for wearing Kirkland Signature shirts purchased at Costco, and they sometimes travel together. Last March, Burr and Warner were leading a delegation through Europe when terrorists struck in Brussels.\n\nIn 2014, as Burr gave generously to other Republican candidates, he declined to donate any money from his political action committee to Republican Ed Gillespie in his campaign against Warner. In 2016, Warner returned the favor, declining to donate to Burr\u2019s opponent.\n\nBoth those campaigns irritated their respective party leaders because of their retro approach to politics. Democrats thought Warner spent too much time courting rural voters who had become conservatives, while Republicans disparaged Burr\u2019s slow-starting campaign as he thought voters didn\u2019t pay attention until the final months.\n\nWith their narrow victories, each came away feeling vindicated \u2014 and also with a sense of freedom from leadership.\n\nThen history threw them together through random acts of more senior senators.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, Warner expected to take over the Rules Committee, overseeing trivial matters. Instead, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) jumped to top spot on the Appropriations Committee, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) left her perch on the intelligence panel to claim Leahy\u2019s place on the Judiciary Committee.\n\nA turf war breaks out in the Senate: Who will investigate Russia\u2019s connections to the Trump campaign?\n\nNow, instead of doling out office space through the Rules Committee, Warner is serving as Burr\u2019s wing man on the Intelligence Committee, co-leading the most politically charged congressional investigation in at least 30 years.\n\n\u201cWhen we started this, we saw the scope and what was involved. I said it was the most important thing I\u2019d ever taken on in my public life,\u201d he said Wednesday.\n\nBut senior senators in both parties, as the revelations mounted in December and January, tried to steal the investigation away from the Intelligence Committee, believing that its secretive practices provided the wrong platform for reassuring the public.\n\nThere were also whispers of doubt about the panel\u2019s leaders.\n\nTogether, Burr and Warner plowed ahead. They have seven full-time investigators handling the inquiry and have set out to interview 20 key witnesses, starting with the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who has played a key advisory role in the campaign and the West Wing.\n\nWith the House investigation stalled amid partisan rancor, Burr and Warner now have the chance to unravel the Russia mystery and demonstrate that bipartisanship can happen in this era.\n\n\u201cThe committee will go wherever the intelligence leads us,\u201d Burr said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get it right,\u201d Warner responded.\n\nRead more from Paul Kane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/devos-compares-school-choice-to-ride-sharing-apps/2017/03/30/d02e7b32-1555-11e7-bb16-269934184168_video.html", "text": "- In a speech on March 29, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said school choice will expand options for students like ride-sharing apps did for commuters.

That said, USA Today reported Wednesday that a gun rights coalition announced at the tail end of the presidential campaign that it expects to leverage Don Jr.\u2019s relationship with the White House to convey policy priorities to the president.\n\n\u201cAs it was explained to me, this whole thing is about providing policy and legislative recommendations for the new administration through Donald Trump Jr.,\u201d said John Boch, co-chairman of the gun rights coalition and head of the nonprofit Guns Save Life, Inc.\n\nRep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) echoed the assumption that Don Jr. would provide political capital. \u201cThe best of all worlds would be that I get either Donald Trump Jr. or Chris Cox to say the coalition \u2026 actually supports the bill that I\u2019m promoting,\u201d he told the newspaper.\n\nEric Trump. (Trump\u2019s son.) Eric Trump\u2019s been tasked with helping Don Jr. lead the Trump Organization. Last week, it was reported that he would still maintain contact with his father \u2014 as you might expect \u2014 but that the contact probably would include regular updates on how the business is doing.\n\nForbes\u2019s Dan Alexander spoke to Eric Trump, who said that there was a \u201cclear separation of church and state that we maintain\u201d in regard to isolating his father from the business. And yet, he would provide Trump with updates \u201con the bottom line, profitability reports and stuff like that\u201d every quarter or so.\n\n\u201cI talk to him a lot. We\u2019re pretty inseparable,\u201d Eric Trump said.\n\nLara Trump. (Eric Trump\u2019s wife and the president\u2019s daughter-in-law.) On Wednesday, it was announced that Lara Trump would take a new position as well, serving as a senior consultant to a company called Giles-Parscale, which does Web design and digital marketing. You may know the name Parscale from the campaign. Brad Parscale served as Trump\u2019s go-to digital strategist, working with the campaign on the development of its online advertising.\n\nLara Trump\u2019s background is in television, having served as a producer for \u201cInside Edition.\u201d Her role with Giles-Parscale?

Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) is under fire from Democrats who say the House intelligence committee chair should recuse himself from the committee's investigation into Russia, because he's too close to President Trump. Can Nunes retain his credibility as the investigation plays out? (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nThis timeline has been updated.\n\nThe New Yorker\u2019s Ryan Lizza laid out a compelling case on Tuesday evening for why he thinks that the White House was likely aware of what Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) was up to last week.\n\nNunes, as you probably now know, is the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and, in that role, in charge of one of the investigations into how Russia may have tried to influence the 2016 election and, further, if anyone associated with President Trump\u2019s campaign was involved. Over the course of the past week, though, Nunes has imperiled that position. On March 22, he suddenly told the press that he\u2019d seen intelligence suggesting that some Trump associates had been caught up in government surveillance \u2014 which, we were left to assume, might mean that Trump\u2019s March 4 tweets about having been wiretapped by former president Barack Obama had some validity.\n\nSince Nunes didn\u2019t actually share that intelligence, since he later amended his description of what he\u2019d seen and since the manner in which he alerted the public to what he\u2019d discovered can at best be described as unorthodox, the story quickly became about Nunes instead of what he alleges he learned. As reporters dug into the story, we learned that Nunes actually reviewed those documents within the White House complex (though not at the White House itself).\n\nLizza\u2019s piece fleshes out the timeline further, including a conversation Lizza had with an administration staffer at the beginning of last week suggesting that the White House and Nunes would offer the same argument in defense of Trump\u2019s (false) assertion.\n\nHere are the key points of what Nunes and White House officials said and did.\n\nSaturday, March 4. Trump tweets.\n\nTerrible! Just found out that Obama had my \"wires tapped\" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017\n\nFriday, March 10. National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster tells a National Security Council staffer named Ezra Cohen-Watnick that he will be reassigned to a new position, according to Politico. Cohen-Watnick is close to Trump advisers Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner and asks to keep his position as intelligence director with the NSC, a position he was given under McMaster\u2019s predecessor, Michael Flynn.\n\nSunday, March 12. Trump reportedly intervenes on Cohen-Watnick\u2019s behalf at Bannon and Kushner\u2019s request.\n\nWednesday, March 15. While answering question from reporters about his committee\u2019s investigation, Nunes \u2014 who served on the executive committee of Trump\u2019s presidential transition team \u2014 tells NBC\u2019s Kasie Hunt that \u201cit\u2019s very possible\u201d that associates of Trump\u2019s may have been swept up in what\u2019s called \u201cincidental collection.\u201d That would mean that their communication was inadvertently observed as authorities were surveilling someone else. Imagine if you\u2019re reading through someone\u2019s email looking for information. Emails sent to or from other people from that account would be viewed by you incidentally.\n\nThis is apparently what happened to former national security adviser Michael Flynn. His communications with Russia\u2019s ambassador were revealed because the ambassador was under surveillance, not, it seems, because Flynn was.\n\nMarch 15, evening. In an interview with Fox News\u2019s Tucker Carlson, Trump explains how he \u201clearned\u201d about the wiretapping after \u201creading about things\u201d and having \u201cbeen seeing a lot of things.\u201d\n\nHe then makes a comment that\u2019s more resonant after the Nunes mess.\n\nNow, for the most part, I\u2019m not going to discuss it, because we have it before the committee and we will be submitting things before the committee very soon that hasn\u2019t been submitted as of yet. But it\u2019s potentially a very serious situation.\n\nHe later adds:\n\nBut, we will be submitting certain things and I will be perhaps speaking about this next week, but it\u2019s right now before the committee, and I think I want to leave it. I have a lot of confidence in the committee. \u2026 I think you\u2019re going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks.\n\nThis sort of \u201cyou\u2019ll see\u201d argumentation from Trump is not uncommon. Consider his allegations that millions of people voted illegally, a claim that\u2019s patently false. Trump\u2019s method of rebutting the fact that he has no evidence for the claim is to suggest that more will come out eventually. But here Trump says specifically that \u201cwe will be submitting certain things,\u201d which is a slightly different assertion.\n\nMonday, March 20, morning. \u201c[S]hortly before the start of the hearing,\u201d Lizza writes, \u201ca senior White House official told me, \u2018You\u2019ll see the setting of the predicate. That\u2019s the thing to watch today.\u201d The predicate, Lizza writes, was incidental collection. \u201cThe White House clearly indicated to me that it knew Nunes would highlight this issue,\u201d Lizza writes, adding that he was told, \u201cIt\u2019s backdoor surveillance where it\u2019s not just incidental, it\u2019s systematic. Watch Nunes today.\u201d\n\nMarch 20, 10 a.m. The hearing begins. There don\u2019t appear to have been any documents submitted by the president.\n\nNunes\u2019s second question addresses the issue of incidental collection of intelligence.\n\nWere the communications of officials or associates of any campaign subject to any kind of improper surveillance? The Intelligence Community has extremely strict procedures for handling information pertaining to any U.S. citizens who are subject even to incidental surveillance, and this Committee wants to ensure all surveillance activities have followed all relevant laws, rules, and regulations. Let me be clear: we know there was not a wiretap on Trump Tower. However, it\u2019s still possible that other surveillance activities were used against President Trump and his associates.\n\nNunes also encouraged \u201canyone who has information about these topics to come forward and speak to the Committee.\u201d\n\nTuesday, March 21, afternoon or evening. According to the Daily Beast, Nunes and a staffer are traveling in an Uber when Nunes gets a \u201ccommunication on his phone\u201d \u2014 an email or text message, presumably \u2014 and the congressman suddenly exits the car. The precise timing on this isn\u2019t clear; in later interviews, Nunes says that it was still daylight. It\u2019s also not clear where exactly he got out of the car.\n\nWhat is now clear is where he went: The Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the grounds of the White House.\n\nNunes was there, he says, to view sensitive information in a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF \u2014 a room that offers special protections against electronic or other forms of surveillance. In total, he said he saw \u201cdozens\u201d of reports.\n\nHe was doing so within the White House grounds, he said, because the information he was viewing was coming from the executive branch; namely, it seems, an intelligence agency. While there is an SCIF available to the House Intelligence Committee, it\u2019s part of the legislative branch and, Nunes says, therefore wasn\u2019t a place where the documents could be reviewed. \u201c[T]he source could not simply put the documents in a backpack and walk them over to the House Intelligence Committee space,\u201d a spokesman for Nunes told the Huffington Post.\n\nTo gain access to the building, Nunes would need to have been cleared by a White House staffer. On Wednesday, press secretary Sean Spicer said he is looking into who it may have been \u2014 something that those familiar with the process suggest should only take a few moments of effort. Nunes described his source for the information to Bloomberg\u2018s Eli Lake as an \u201cintelligence official.\u201d\n\nA report from the New York Times on Thursday, though, suggests that Nunes was provided access to the information with the help of two White House staffers. One was Michael Ellis, the Times reports, who works in the office of the White House counsel and who used to work for Nunes. The other was Ezra Cohen-Watnick who, the Times says, had been reviewing the reports to which Nunes was granted access after Trump\u2019s initial tweet.\n\nWednesday, March 22, around 1 p.m. Nunes first offered a brief statement to reporters on Capitol Hill before heading to the White House and briefing Trump on what he\u2019d learned.\n\nI recently confirmed that on numerous occasions, the intelligence community incidentally collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition. Details about people associated with the incoming administration \u2014 details with little apparent foreign intelligence value \u2014 were widely disseminated in intelligence community reporting. I have confirmed that additional names of Trump transition team members were unmasked. To be clear, none of this surveillance was related to Russia, or the investigation of Russian activities, or of the Trump team.\n\nMarch 22, just after 1:30 p.m. During an interview with Time\u2019s Michael Scherer, Trump mentions the statement from Nunes, who had not yet arrived to brief him. (The time here is via Scherer.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you the front page story, and just today I heard, just a little while ago, that Devin Nunes had a news conference, did you hear about this, where they have a lot of information on tapping,\u201d Trump said. \u201cDid you hear about that?\u201d\n\nScherer had not. \u201cWhat I\u2019m talking about is surveillance,\u201d Trump said, after saying that he hadn\u2019t meant literal wiretapping. \u201cAnd today, Devin Nunes just had a news conference. Now probably got obliterated by what\u2019s happened in London.\u201d (A terrorist attacked people near Parliament.) \u201cBut just had a news conference, and here it is one of those things.\u201d\n\nHe later added, \u201cDevin Nunes had a news conference. I mean I don\u2019t know, I was unable to see it, because I am at meetings, but they just had a news conference talking about surveillance.\u201d\n\nMarch 22, 1:45 p.m. During his news briefing, Spicer mentions the Nunes comments and quotes from his statement, which he says he saw as he was walking out to begin the briefing. He said, too, that Trump was at that time wrapping up a phone call with British Prime Minister Theresa May.\n\n\u201cThe media has more information than we do at this point,\u201d Spicer said. He later added: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of questions that I think his statement raises, and I hope that we can continue to get to the bottom of. But right now, we just don\u2019t \u2014 we\u2019re not there yet. I think that there are a series of questions that need to get answered as to what happened, why it happened, and hopefully we will be able to share more with you going forward.\u201d\n\nMarch 22, 3 p.m. After meeting with Trump, Nunes answered questions from the White House driveway.\n\nAsked why he told the possible target of his investigation about information potentially related to that investigation, Nunes reiterated that what he\u2019d seen was unrelated to Russia. \u201cThe president needs to know that these intelligence reports are out there, and I have a duty to tell him that,\u201d Nunes said. He indicated that the information he\u2019d seen may have come from confidential Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants, which, if true, may open him up to an ethics probe.\n\nLater, Nunes\u2019s Democratic colleagues on the House Intelligence Committee expressed their anger at Trump being informed before they were. For his part, Trump told reporters that he felt \u201csomewhat\u201d vindicated by what Nunes had told him.\n\nThursday, March 23. Answering a question during his daily briefing, Spicer says that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t really seem to make a ton of sense\u201d that Nunes would have gotten information from the administration on Tuesday and come back on Wednesday to share it with the president. \u201cI don\u2019t know why he would come up to brief the president on something that we gave him,\u201d Spicer said.\n\nMonday, March 27. Spicer changes his tune.\n\n\u201cCan you say factually, absolutely flatly, that it is not possible that Chairman Nunes came to brief the president on something that he obtained from the White House or the administration?\u201d a reporter asks.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say 100 percent that I know anything what he briefed him on,\u201d Spicer replied. \u201cWhat I can tell you through his public comments is that he has said that he had multiple sources that he came to a conclusion on. So to the degree to which any of those sources weighed on the ultimate outcome of what he came to a decision on, I don\u2019t know. And that\u2019s something that, frankly, I don\u2019t even know that he discussed with the president.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s possible?\u201d the reporter asked. \u201cAs far as you know right now, it\u2019s possible?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything is possible,\u201d Spicer said.\n\nDemocrats on the House Intelligence Committee say they want to move forward with the investigation into Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election, with or without Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) as chairman. (Jayne Orenstein,Ashleigh Joplin/The Washington Post)\n\nTuesday, March 28. After nearly a week during which most of the timeline above is revealed \u2014 and after scheduled Intelligence Committee hearings are canceled \u2014 Nunes says that he would \u201cnever\u201d tell his colleagues on the committee who his source was.\n\nWednesday, March 29.

Catherine Fuller was killed in Washington in 1984. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nThe justices of the Supreme Court more closely resembled jurors in a murder trial Wednesday, absorbed in the details of a horrific killing that shocked Washington three decades ago.\n\nThey were considering whether federal prosecutors withheld crucial evidence in the case of Catherine Fuller, who was killed inside a garage tucked into an alley near Eighth and H streets NE on Oct. 1, 1984. She had set out for the store with $50 in a change purse tucked in her bra, and her nearly naked body was found severely beaten and sodomized with a metal pipe.\n\nThe Supreme Court usually takes cases to advance broader principles of the law. But the questions Wednesday were detailed inquires about recanted testimony and trial strategy, and Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Sonia Sotomayor seemed to return to their former roles trying crimes.\n\nSixteen boys and young men, and one teenage girl, were arrested for the murder. They ranged in age from 16 to 26 and were known as the Eighth and H Street Crew. Each of the 13 ultimately charged initially claimed innocence. Eight of the male defendants were convicted, and seven were sentenced to 35 years to life in prison.\n\n[32 years after murder, one man wants justice. Another just wants an ending.]\n\nFuller\u2019s death helped cement the image of the nation\u2019s capital as a violent and dangerous place in the minds of Washingtonians and others across the country. The killing drew notoriety not only for its brutality but because police linked it to the rise of crews, or violent gangs of youths.\n\nThe hour of oral arguments recalled a different era in Washington, when H Street was known for its latest murder rather than its most recent restaurant opening. \u201cThe community here was basically under siege,\u201d said the government\u2019s lawyer in the case, Deputy Solicitor General Michael R. Dreeben.\n\nInterest in the case was revived by stories in The Washington Post and changes in the testimony of some witnesses, and the revelation that prosecutors had information about another man who some had seen at the crime scene. Those convicted said prosecutors should have told their attorneys about then-19-year-old James McMillan, who had committed robberies in the neighborhood, including an attack on D.C. Council member Nadine Winter.\n\nThe lead prosecutor on the case at the time said he investigated the tip and dismissed the information as not relevant enough to turn over to defense attorneys.\n\nLower courts have agreed. The question for the Supreme Court is whether there is a reasonable chance that the withheld information would have made a difference.\n\nBut questions about whether the lower courts made a mistake \u2014 the usual fare for a Supreme Court hearing \u2014 did not come until the 57th minute of the hour-long arguments.\n\nInstead, justices asked detailed questions about trial strategy, recanted testimony and the extended jury deliberations that came after the sensational six-week trial.\n\nSotomayor questioned whether defense lawyers could have turned McMillan into a believable alternative for the crime when two of the attackers admitted their guilt.\n\nWashington lawyer John S. Williams said the men had other crimes pending and made deals with the government to lessen their culpability.\n\n\u201cThe argument would be McMillan is the most likely alternative perpetrator,\u201d Williams said, explaining the defense strategy. \u201cHe is the reason that you should have doubt about this prosecution\u2019s case. These witnesses are flawed. These witnesses had motivations to give testimony. There are reasons to doubt them, and McMillan is the obvious reason why they are all lying.\u201d\n\nMcMillan, now 51, is serving a life sentence for the 1992 beating death of a woman in the same neighborhood as Fuller\u2019s murder. He has repeatedly denied his involvement in the Fuller case.\n\nAlito was skeptical the information about McMillan would be enough to shake the accumulated testimony, which featured confessions and the eyewitness testimony of a 14-year-old who saw the beginning of the attack.\n\nCases about whether prosecutors have turned over evidence that might be material and favorable to the defense, required under the court\u2019s 1963 decision in Brady v. Maryland, are fact-specific. And the justices displayed such familiarity with the case that Dreeben sounded more like a prosecutor as he described the moments before the gang spotted Fuller and attacked her.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re standing in the park,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re singing the Chuck Brown song. Catlett is singing it. Steve Webb is banging out the beat. . . . Someone points across the street . . . says, \u2018Let\u2019s go get that one.\u2019 \u201d (Timothy Catlett and Steven Webb are two of the convicted.)\n\nJustice Elena Kagan said she was not sure of Dreeben\u2019s argument that the information about McMillan would have made no difference.\n\nWithout an alternative theory, the accused became a \u201ccircular firing squad,\u201d accusing one another, she said.\n\n\u201cIt would have been a completely different trial\u201d if there were a way to blame someone else, she said.\n\nDreeben noted that while prosecutors were under no obligation to turn over to the defense the information it had on McMillan, the Justice Department now operates under different rules than it did then. Under current policy, the department goes beyond the standards set by the Supreme Court, he said.\n\nAmong those in the crowded courtroom was one of the men convicted in the case, Christopher Turner. He was released on parole from prison in 2010 after serving nearly 26 years. He watched the proceedings from the second row, and he and his attorneys declined comment afterward."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/comey-weve-never-had-absolute-privacy/2017/03/29/71166f40-14e4-11e7-bb16-269934184168_video.html", "text": "Trump says the U.S. 'has enough roles' in the world"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/senate-president-maryland-is-not-going-to-become-a-sanctuary-state/2017/03/29/f1e80bac-14c0-11e7-ada0-1489b735b3a3_story.html", "text": "A Maryland bill to limit police cooperation with federal immigration authorities, criticized this week by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, will not pass the state Senate unless it is revised, the head of that chamber said Wednesday.\n\nThe Trust Act, as the legislation is known, would prohibit local and state police from assisting with federal immigration-enforcement efforts by stopping or questioning individuals about their country of origin or immigration status. It would also bar most Maryland jurisdictions from detaining undocumented prisoners past their release date, unless federal agents who want to deport them have a warrant or court order describing probable cause.\n\nThe House passed the legislation last week. But Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. (D-Calvert) said the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, which is deciding whether to advance the measure, will not approve it in its current form.\n\n\u201cMaryland is not going to become a sanctuary state,\u201d Miller told reporters, using a loosely defined term for a jurisdiction that in some way limits cooperation between local and federal authorities on immigration issues. The Trump administration has said it will withhold federal funding from sanctuary jurisdictions, but it has not clearly defined what rules would have to be in place for a jurisdiction to qualify for such a sanction.\n\n\u201cOur churches are not sanctuaries, our colleges are not sanctuaries, our cities are not sanctuaries, and our state is not going to become a sanctuary state,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI haven\u2019t lobbied anybody in the committee, but I definitely will tell you the committee is not going to vote to allow Maryland to become a sanctuary state.\u201d\n\nMiller\u2019s comments come just over a week after the reported rape of a Rockville High School student, allegedly by two students who are undocumented immigrants. The case has become embroiled in the national debate over immigration policy; when asked about it last week, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the incident shows why it is important for local police to assist federal authorities with immigration enforcement.\n\nProponents of the Trust Act have dismissed such comments about the bill, saying that nothing in it would preclude federal-local cooperation in connection with that type of serious crime.\n\nDel. Kathleen M. Dumais (D-Montgomery), who co-sponsored the Trust Act and defended it during floor debates, said this week that the legislation \u201ccertainly does not make Maryland more at risk for crime and violence\u201d and that \u201canyone who commits a crime or violence in Maryland should be and is prosecuted to the full extent of the law, regardless of immigration status.\u201d\n\nThe measure would allow Frederick and Harford counties to continue their participation in a special federal program that uses local police to help with immigration enforcement.\n\nAdvocates say the legislation would protect undocumented immigrants who pose no threat to communities and ensure that they can report crimes to police without fear of deportation.\n\nMiller expressed sympathy with that point of view but also echoed some of the concerns raised by Trump officials about whether the legislation would hinder law enforcement efforts.\n\n\u201cI want our citizens to be free to walk the streets of our state without getting questions in terms of where they\u2019re from. I want them to be able to go to church. I want them to be able to go to school. I want them to be able to report crimes without fear of being arrested,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in terms of hampering law enforcement, in terms of hampering the judicial system, Maryland is not going to become a sanctuary state.\u201d\n\nGov. Larry Hogan (R) has vowed to veto the Trust Act if it reaches his desk, describing the measure as \u201can outrageously irresponsible bill\u201d that would \u201cendanger our citizens.\u201d\n\nA Washington Post-University of Maryland poll this month found that 71 percent of Marylanders say immigration enforcement should be left to federal authorities, while 25 percent say local police should take an active role in such matters.\n\nSeventy-five percent of respondents said people in the country illegally would be reluctant to inform police of crimes if local law enforcement became more active in identifying individuals for deportation.\n\nThe poll was conducted March 16 to 19 among a random sample of 914 Maryland residents and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-the-trump-white-house-celebrating-womens-history-month-can-be-awkward/2017/03/29/8f2f66d6-14a7-11e7-ada0-1489b735b3a3_story.html", "text": "As Women\u2019s History Month draws to an end, first lady Melania Trump proclaimed at a Wednesday award ceremony that \u201cwherever women are diminished, the entire world is diminished with them.\u201d Soon after, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said at a briefing that the \u201cpresident made women\u2019s empowerment a priority throughout the campaign.\u201d And later in the afternoon, President Trump attended a women\u2019s empowerment panel and jokingly asked whether anyone had heard of Susan B.

This is a president who bragged during a conversation with an \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d host that he could grab women without their permission, who allegedly burst into the dressing rooms of beauty pageant contestants and who was accused by 11 women before the election of inappropriately touching or kissing them.\n\nTrump \u2014 who lagged Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton badly among female voters in November \u2014 has leaned heavily on men for his top Cabinet and administration posts.

The juxtaposition has also inspired widespread jeering on the left, where many view Trump\u2019s past and his policy agenda as out of step with women\u2019s interests.\n\n[Republicans warn that Trump\u2019s critique of Clinton\u2019s \u2018look\u2019 fuel accusations of sexism]\n\n(The Washington Post)\n\nDuring the \u201cDay Without a Woman\u201d strike on March 8, comedian and late-night host Samantha Bee \u2014 a vocal Trump critic \u2014 tweeted a photo of Trump sitting in the Oval Office surrounded by 12 men with the message: \u201cThe Trump WH is so feminist, EVERY day is Day Without a Woman.\u201d\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, a spokeswoman for the president, rolls her eyes at such criticisms, asking why there are not tweets and articles about events where the president is surrounded by only women. She pointed to a White House panel Wednesday afternoon that brought together more than 200 women and girls, including Sanders and her young daughter.\n\nSanders said that for decades, Trump has given women positions of power in his businesses and, now in the White House, frequently asks the women on his staff what they think.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent a pretty good deal of time around him, and he has been nothing but respectful and deferential,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nTrump has included a number of women in senior positions, including the formal announcement Wednesday that his eldest daughter, Ivanka, will hold an unpaid job as assistant to the president. Ivanka Trump already has a West Wing office and is expected to focus on issues related to women, especially those in the workplace.\n\nOn March 1, Trump signed a proclamation designating the month as a time to honor \u201ccelebrated women pioneers and leaders in our history, as well as those unsung women heroes of our daily lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have tremendous respect for women and the many roles they serve that are vital to the fabric of our society and our economy,\u201d Trump tweeted a week later, on the same day when many women skipped work in protests. \u201cOn International Women\u2019s Day, join me in honoring the critical role of women here in America & around the world.\u201d\n\n(The Washington Post)\n\nThroughout the month, the White House has invited groups of women to meet with the president to discuss helping small-business owners and health care. These events nearly always feature Ivanka Trump, who along with her husband, Jared Kushner, is among his closest advisers.\n\nMelania Trump has also been involved during the month and was the keynote speaker at the State Department\u2019s International Women of Courage event Wednesday that honored women from Bangladesh, Botswana, Colombia, Congo, Iraq, Niger, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Sri Lanka, Syria, Turkey, Vietnam and Yemen.\n\n\u201cThe time for empowering women around the world is now,\u201d Trump said in her remarks. \u201cFor wherever women are diminished, the entire world is diminished with them. However, wherever women are empowered, towns and villages, schools and economies are empowered, and together we are all made stronger with them.\u201d\n\nSpicer repeated the quote at his daily media briefing and gave the first question of the afternoon to April Ryan, the White House correspondent for American Urban Radio Networks. A day before, Spicer had grown frustrated with a question that Ryan had asked and at one point told her: \u201cPlease, stop shaking your head again.\u201d\n\n[Women, Hillary Clinton among them, stand up for April Ryan and Maxine Waters]\n\nThe comment angered many women who found Spicer\u2019s comment patronizing, including Clinton, who brought it up during a speech at the Professional BusinessWomen of California conference in San Francisco.\n\n\u201cToo many women, especially women of color, have had a lifetime of practice taking precisely these kinds of indignities in stride,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cBut why should we have to? And any woman who thinks this couldn\u2019t be directed at her is living in a dream world.\u201d\n\nSpicer defended Trump\u2019s record on women during the briefing.\n\n\u201cThe president made women\u2019s empowerment a priority throughout the campaign, speaking out on affordable child care and paid family leave, investing in women\u2019s health, and the barriers faced by female entrepreneurs and business owners,\u201d Spicer said.\n\nSoon after, Emily\u2019s List \u2014 which supports Democratic women running for office who favor abortion rights \u2014 emailed reporters with the subject line \u201cNice try, Sean.\u201d The email included links to articles about Trump\u2019s campaign paying women less than men, Trump suggesting he backed punishment for women who have abortions, Trump\u2019s attacks on a former beauty pageant contestant and his taped comments to \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d in 2005.\n\nAt the Wednesday afternoon panel, Vice President Pence said that \u201cthis is a president who has advanced the interests of women.\u201d\n\nAs Trump addressed the group, he marveled at how his wife\u2019s \u201cpoll numbers went through the roof last year\u201d and recognized the women serving in his administration, strong female leaders throughout history and some of the women he had met over the past month.\n\n\u201cSo as a man, I stand before you as president, but if I weren\u2019t president, I wouldn\u2019t be happy to hear that statement \u2014 that would be a very scary statement to me because there\u2019s no way we can compete with you,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo I would not be happy. Just wouldn\u2019t be happy.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/hill-republicans-trying-to-avert-a-shutdown-need-democrats--and-trump/2017/03/29/411dd038-14b4-11e7-ada0-1489b735b3a3_story.html", "text": "Congressional Republicans are working aggressively to craft an agreement intended to keep the government open past April 28, but their bid to avert a shutdown hinges on courting Democrats wary of President Trump and skirting the wrath of hard-line conservatives and Trump himself.\n\nThe murky path forward on government funding sparked unease Wednesday within the business community and at the Capitol, where Republicans speculated that Trump\u2019s request for money to build a wall along the border with Mexico and $30 billion in new defense spending may need to be delayed to avoid a shutdown.\n\nSeveral Republicans said Wednesday that there is little appetite within their ranks to engage in a protracted showdown over Trump\u2019s call to begin funding a border wall in the near-term spending bill, which Democrats and some conservative Republicans oppose. And they said Trump\u2019s wishes would gravely threaten any deal.\n\n\u201cIt would blow up the great opportunity,\u201d said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.). \u201cI\u2019m convinced.\u201d\n\nInstead, leaders are hoping to put together a spending bill that can win approval from enough Democrats to render negotiations with most intransigent conservatives unnecessary. Blunt and others said it is certain they will need Democratic support: Republicans hold a 52-48 advantage in the Senate, meaning they will need at least eight Democrats to reach the 60 votes necessary to pass the spending bill in that chamber.\n\n(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t pass anything without them,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), a top deputy to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\n\nIn the House, Democratic support would be critical in neutralizing any opposition from the roughly three dozen members of the conservative Freedom Caucus, many of whom have routinely opposed previous spending bills.\n\nBut for the moment, neither House nor Senate Democratic leaders have committed to supporting a spending plan. Bipartisan committee negotiations are underway, and crucial elements of an agreement remain unfinished. Democrats, too, bring their own challenges to the negotiating table. They are under pressure from their liberal base to oppose virtually everything that Trump and Republicans do \u2014 especially, in the case of the budget, funding for a border wall. But they and most of their supporters also favor keeping government open, and they are vulnerable to being accused of hypocrisy if they are seen as playing a part in causing a shutdown after years criticizing Republicans for doing the same.\n\nMeanwhile, several congressional aides said that Republicans are agitated by the lack of clarity from White House officials over a strategy to avert the awkward theater of a Republican-driven shutdown on the watch of a Republican president.\n\nIt also remains unclear whether opposition from the Freedom Caucus \u2014 or from Trump himself \u2014 could derail Republicans\u2019 plans. The hard-line conservatives in the House were an enormous factor last week in the defeat of the American Health Care Act, and the fallout for Trump and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) has ruptured the chamber's dynamics and made many GOP members unsure of whether major legislation can find sufficient Republican support.\n\nEqually unclear is the role these conservatives intend to play in the next rounds of policy and budget battles. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have a government shutdown,\u201d Ryan said in an interview with CBS scheduled to air Thursday, according to a tweet from Norah O\u2019Donnell.\n\nTrump allies in the House said Wednesday that the president should not allow Republican leaders to shape the spending agreement and urged him to make a firm demand that the wall be funded. \u201cEverything to do with a shutdown carries some risk, but we should take the risk because Trump has a mandate to build the wall,\u201d Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) said.\n\nTrump\u2019s response to any emerging deal on spending will be another significant factor, congressional aides said. If he does not support the measure, it could be in jeopardy.\n\nWhite House aides on Wednesday played down their earlier call for Congress to include the border wall and spending cuts in the near-term spending bill as nothing more than an early-stage negotiation. Aides acknowledged that Congress has control over the spending process; a request for $33 billion in funds for defense and border protection, plus $18 billion in cuts to help offset those funds, was merely \u201cplanting flags,\u201d according to one White House official with knowledge of the negotiations.\n\nNone of that, however, precludes the possibility of Trump declining to give his blessing to a spending plan if it lacks his requests.\n\nThe uncertainty has left top Democrats prepared for the seemingly promising spending talks to fall apart.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in their hands now,\u201d Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), the minority whip, said in an interview.\n\nYet there is also room for agreement.\n\nDemocrats have said privately that they would be open to approving some spending on border security and defense, as long as it does not directly fund construction of the wall, said several Senate Democratic aides who were granted anonymity to speak about ongoing negotiations. But those funds would have to be narrowly tailored, because Senate Democrats have vowed to block any attempt to start construction on the wall.\n\n\u201cSenate Democrats are prepared to fight this all the way,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said at an event highlighting their opposition Tuesday.\n\nDemocrats \u201cwill do everything possible to make sure that U.S. taxpayer moneys do not go to build a wall,\u201d said Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), adding later: \u201cAt the end of the day, he should keep his word and make someone else pay for it \u2014 not the United States taxpayer.\u201d\n\nDemocrats also remain opposed to granting fresh funding for new hires at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but they could support supplies for Border Patrol agents such as drones or sensors that aid enforcement, the aides said.\n\nOne option lawmakers have to keep the government open past April 28: pass a \u201cclean,\u201d short-term resolution that holds the budget to current spending levels, although leaders in both parties said they would prefer to pass an omnibus spending bill that would allow them to make changes.\n\nSenate Appropriations Committee member Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said committee members plan to wrap up work Wednesday on the early elements of a spending framework that would boost defense and border spending.\n\nThat additional spending could be paid for by using special war funds that are not subject to spending caps that the budget is otherwise required to adhere to. That would give leaders flexibility to add defense funds without worrying about breaking a bipartisan agreement reached in 2015 that requires Congress to give equal funding to defense and nondefense programs.\n\nCornyn added that the goal for now remains avoiding a shutdown \u2014 \u201cabsolutely\u201d \u2014 and seeing if Republicans can avoid having to pass a \u201cclean\u201d continuing resolution that lacks new appropriations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not there yet, but it could happen,\u201d Cornyn said of the likelihood of a clean spending measure becoming at some point next month the only legislation that could pass both chambers.\n\nEd O\u2019Keefe and Karen Tumulty contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-administration-still-plans-to-undo-parts-of-the-aca-tom-price-testifies/2017/03/29/236f633a-14a5-11e7-9e4f-09aa75d3ec57_story.html", "text": "Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price signaled Wednesday that the Trump administration is still intent on dismantling parts of the Affordable Care Act even if Republicans lack the votes to rewrite it. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nIn his carefully calibrated testimony before House appropriators, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price made one thing clear Wednesday: The administration is still intent on dismantling parts of the Affordable Care Act even if Republicans lack the votes to rewrite it.\n\nTime and time again, Price invoked the pledge he has made repeatedly to lawmakers since President Trump selected him for his post. \u201cWhat we\u2019re committed to is making sure the American people have access to affordable coverage,\u201d he told Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (Conn.), the top Democrat on the Appropriations subcommittee on labor, health and human services, education, and related agencies.\n\nBut under intense questioning from Democrats, Price outlined how his department could make insurance plans cheaper by scaling back several federal mandates, including what the ACA currently defines as \u201cessential benefits\u201d in coverage. And he refused to say whether the administration will keep providing cost-sharing subsidies for insurers participating in the federal marketplace. The multibillion-dollar infusion is critical to maintaining the system\u2019s stability, insurers say.\n\nAt one point, DeLauro asked Price whether the administration wanted to \u201crepeal or strengthen and improve\u201d the 2010 health-care law.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the current law has harmed many individuals,\u201d the secretary said.\n\n\u201cSo you will continue to move at repeal, is what I gained from that conversation,\u201d she replied.\n\nEven before House Republicans withdrew legislation last week that would have jettisoned key aspects of the ACA, White House officials had pledged to pursue a \u201cphase two\u201d through executive action. This stage could cover everything from how aggressively the government promotes enrollment under the law to what sort of financial support it gives to prop up the ACA marketplace.\n\nWhile House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) is encouraging factions from the GOP\u2019s moderate and conservative wings to negotiate a possible health-care compromise, several individuals briefed on the leadership\u2019s plans said there is no immediate interest in bringing a revised bill up for a House vote.\n\nRyan said in a CBS News interview Wednesday that if Republicans don\u2019t unite, Trump would \u201cjust go work with Democrats to try and change Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s hardly a conservative thing,\u201d he said.\n\nInsurers are particularly anxious to know whether the cost-sharing subsidies that help lower-income people to afford their out-of-pocket costs, which House Republicans have challenged in court as illegal, will continue. According to the Congressional Budget Office, those federal payments will total $7 billion this year and $10 billion in 2018.\n\nPrice noted that as secretary he is now the named defendant in the lawsuit, and \u201cI\u2019m not able to comment.\u201d\n\n(Reuters)\n\nAshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan, said the House GOP is \u201cactively working with the administration\u201d on options for resolving the suit and possibly appropriating the subsidies. \u201cNo decisions have been made,\u201d she said.\n\nRep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), who chairs the panel before which Price testified Wednesday, said he was open to providing the funds but that it would have to be a House leadership decision. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the right thing to do, I think. Otherwise you\u2019re going to have insurance companies exiting the market,\u201d Cole said.\n\nMichael Adelberg, a health-care principal at FaegreBD Consulting, considers the subsidies \u201cthe single most important action\u201d the administration can take to stabilize the marketplace. Refusing to pay them will bring \u201csignificant premium increases,\u201d Adelberg said in an email. \u201cSome insurers will drop out, and the remaining insurers will have to seek large rate increases.\u201d\n\nMolina Healthcare chief executive Mario Molina said recently that the cost-sharing funds are a major uncertainty hanging over his company\u2019s ability to participate in the marketplaces going forward. Another is enforcement of the individual mandate that compels Americans to provide proof of insurance on their taxes.\n\n\u201cIf the president chooses not to enforce the mandate, he\u2019s going to drive up the cost for many, many people,\u201d Molina said, noting that premiums would probably rise 15 percent if it is not enforced. If cost-sharing reductions are eliminated, he added, premiums would rise an additional 10 to 12 percent.\n\nPrice indicated Wednesday that the individual mandate remained in place, telling the panel, \u201cSo long as the law\u2019s on the books, we at the department are obliged to uphold the law.\u201d\n\nBut the president offered leeway in enforcing the mandate hours after his inauguration in January, when he signed an executive order instructing agencies \u201cto minimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens\u201d associated with the ACA, in part by acting to \u201cwaive, defer, grant \u00adexemptions from or delay\u201d its rules.\n\nRepublicans urged the secretary to use the available levers available to pare back requirements that have led to more comprehensive \u2014 and costly \u2014 health plans under the ACA.\n\n\u201cYou do have the ability to make regulatory changes that would dramatically lower the cost of insurance for Americans?\u201d asked Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.).\n\n\u201cFourteen hundred and forty-two times the ACA said \u2018the secretary shall\u2019 or \u2018the secretary may,\u2019 \u201d Price replised.\n\nOn several occasions, Price suggested he may define how much insurers would have to cover under the category of essential benefits, which includes maternity and newborn care as well as substance abuse and mental-health treatment.\n\nAsked by Rep. Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.) whether maternity care \u201cshould be a covered benefit under federal law,\u201d Price said consumers should make that decision in the coverage they choose, \u201cnot the kind that the government forces them to buy.\u201d\n\nWhen Lowey pressed him on whether women should be able to access contraception without having to pay an insurance co-pay \u2014 another ACA mandate \u2014 Price made the same point.\n\n\u201cAgain, this is one of those areas where we think individuals ought to have access to the kind of coverage that they want, not the kind of coverage that the government forces them to buy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe administration is likely to face resistance from the opposition party in making those changes. After House Democrats met behind closed doors Wednesday morning on Capitol Hill to formulate a health-care strategy, key members said they were focused on blocking any steps the administration might take to weaken the law while continuing to blame its shortcomings on Democrats.\n\n\u201cWhat we will do is lay out for the American people exactly what steps [Trump] can and probably will take to try to undermine the law, so they understand when he takes those actions . . . that he is the one taking away health-care coverage from millions of Americans,\u201d said Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Democratic Caucus.\n\nCarolyn Johnson contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/who-is-source-d-the-man-said-to-be-behind-the-trump-russia-dossiers-most-salacious-claim/2017/03/29/379846a8-0f53-11e7-9d5a-a83e627dc120_story.html", "text": "(Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\nIn June, a Belarusan American businessman who goes by the name Sergei Millian shared some tantalizing claims about Donald Trump.\n\nTrump had a long-standing relationship with Russian officials, Millian told an associate, and those officials were now feeding Trump damaging information about his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Millian said that the information provided to Trump had been \u201cvery helpful.\u201d\n\nUnbeknownst to Millian, however, his conversation was not confidential. His associate passed on what he had heard to a former British intelligence officer who had been hired by Trump\u2019s political opponents to gather information about the Republican\u2019s ties to Russia.\n\nThe allegations by Millian \u2014 whose role was first reported by the Wall Street Journal and has been confirmed by The Washington Post \u2014 were central to the dossier compiled by the former spy, Christopher Steele. While the dossier has not been verified and its claims have been denied by Trump, Steele\u2019s document said that Millian\u2019s assertions had been corroborated by other sources, including in the Russian government and former intelligence sources.\n\nThe most explosive allegation that the dossier says originally came from Millian is the claim that Trump had hired prostitutes at the Moscow Ritz-Carlton and that the Kremlin has kept evidence of the encounter.\n\nBy his own evolving statements, Sergei Millian is either a shrewd businessman with high-level access to both Trump\u2019s inner circle and the Kremlin, or a bystander unwittingly caught up in a global controversy.\n\nAn examination of Millian\u2019s career shows he is a little of both. His case lays bare the challenge facing the FBI as it investigates Russia\u2019s alleged attempts to manipulate the American political system and whether Trump associates participated.\n\nIt also illustrates why the Trump administration remains unable to shake the Russia story. While some of the unproven claims attributed in the dossier to Millian are bizarre and outlandish, there are also indications that he had contacts with Trump\u2019s circle.\n\nMillian told several people that during the campaign and presidential transition he was in touch with George Papadopoulos, a campaign foreign policy adviser, according to a person familiar with the matter. Millian is among Papadopoulos\u2019s nearly 240 Facebook friends.\n\nTrump aides vehemently reject Millian\u2019s claims to have had close contact with Trump or high-level access to the president\u2019s company.\n\nMillian did not answer a list of detailed questions about his interactions with Trump and his role in the Steele dossier, instead responding by email with lengthy general defenses of Trump\u2019s election as \u201cGod\u2019s will\u201d and complaining that inquiries about his role are evidence of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and \u201cMcCarthyism.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny falsifications, deceit and baseless allegations directed against any US President is damaging to the national security interests of the United States,\u201d he wrote in one email. \u201cPublishing slanderous stories about the President\u2019s decency and offensive material about the first family is malicious propaganda and a threat to the national security in order to destabilize the integrity of the United States of America and stir civil disorder aiming at reducing its political influence in the world.\u201d\n\n(Jason Aldag,Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\nIn late January, Millian appeared on Russian television, where he denied knowing information that could be damaging to Trump. \u201cI want to say that I don\u2019t have any compromising information, neither in Russia nor in the United States, nor could I have,\u201d he said, speaking in Russian. \u201cWithout a doubt it is a blatant lie and an effort of some people \u2014 it\u2019s definitely a group of people \u2014 to portray our president in a bad light using my name.\u201d\n\nThe dossier, decried by Trump as \u201cphony stuff\u201d and \u201cfake news\u201d and derided by Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin as \u201crubbish,\u201d consists of a series of reports compiled by Steele over the course of several months before the election.\n\nMillian, identified in different portions of the dossier as \u201cSource D\u201d and \u201cSource E,\u201d is described as a \u201cclose associate of Trump.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the salacious allegations that gained widespread attention, the dossier attributed other claims to Millian. For instance, Steele wrote that Millian asserted that there was a \u201cwell developed conspiracy of cooperation between [Trump] and Russian leadership,\u201d claiming the relationship was managed for Trump by former campaign chairman Paul Manafort. A Manafort spokesman said \u201cevery word in the dossier about Paul Manafort is a lie.\u201d\n\n\n\nFBI Director James B. Comey, left, and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers appear before the House Intelligence Committee on March 20. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nSome of those who know Millian described him as more of a big-talking schmoozer than a globe-trotting interlocutor. They say he\u2019s a self-promoter with a knack for getting himself on television \u2014 like the time he appeared on a 2013 episode of the Bravo reality show \u201cMillion Dollar Listing,\u201d where he attempted to broker a sale with a Russian-speaking client who agreed to pay $7 million in cash for a luxury New York unit.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an opportunist. If he sees an opportunity, he would go after it,\u201d said Tatiana Osipova, who was a neighbor of Millian\u2019s when he lived in Atlanta and who in 2006 helped him found a trade group, the Russian American Chamber of Commerce in the USA. Osipova now lives in St. Petersburg but has remained in touch with Millian. \u201cHe\u2019s a fun guy, a smart guy. But always talking. He talks so much s---.\u201d\n\nMillian\u2019s original name was Siarhei Kukuts, but those who know him say he changed it because he wanted something that sounded more elegant. He told ABC News in July that he changed his name to honor his grandmother, whose last name he said was Millianovich. He has also at times gone by the name Sergio Millian.\n\n\u201cMy general impression of him was that he just wanted to be important. Nobody really knew what he or the chamber were doing, but he presented himself with grandeur,\u201d said Nadia Diskavets, a New York photographer who was also a founding member of the Russian American Chamber of Commerce but has not been in touch with Millian recently. \u201cSo I always took everything he said with a grain of salt.\u201d\n\nAnother acquaintance referred to him in a similar way, saying he exaggerated his connections with Trump and with the Russians. \u201cHe\u2019s too small of a fish to deal with Russian people,\u201d she said. \u201cThey will smell his smallness from miles away.\u201d\n\nBorn in Belarus, Millian, 38, attended a university in Minsk. A Russian-language version of his biography that was posted on the Russian American Chamber of Commerce\u2019s website says he studied to be a military translator.\n\nHe arrived in the early 2000s as a young, single professional in Atlanta, which has a large \u00adRussian-speaking community. Friends there said he worked in real estate, and, according to one r\u00e9sum\u00e9 posted online, he opened a translating business whose clients included the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nFriends said that Millian founded the Russian American Chamber of Commerce as a way to forge business ties between the United States and Russia and as a personal networking opportunity.\n\nMillian\u2019s affiliation with the group also appears to have boosted his profile in Russia. He hosted events in the United States and abroad on the chamber\u2019s behalf and, after moving to New York, began being interviewed repeatedly by Russian-language news outlets as an expert on U.S.-Russia relations. He traveled to Moscow in 2011 courtesy of a Russian government cultural group later investigated by the FBI for allegedly recruiting spies, though there is no evidence that the inquiry involved Millian.\n\nMillian\u2019s account of his relationship with Trump has shifted over time. As the Republican candidate was rising in the spring of 2016, a time before there was close scrutiny of Trump\u2019s ties to Russia, Millian used his media appearances to describe deep connections with the New York real estate mogul.\n\nHe told the Russian state-operated news agency RIA Novosti last April, for instance, that he met Trump at a Miami horse-racing track after \u201cmutual associates\u201d had organized a trip for Trump to Moscow in 2007.\n\nFrom there, Millian said, he entered into a business arrangement in which he says he helped market a Trump-branded condominium complex in Hollywood, Fla., to international investors, including Russians.\n\nMillian\u2019s description of the Miami event appears to match up with a picture he posted on Facebook that appears to show him posing with Trump and the project\u2019s developer, Jorge P\u00e9rez \u2014 the only evidence that Millian ever met Trump.\n\nA spokesman for P\u00e9rez said his company has no record of paying Millian in connection with the project, and P\u00e9rez declined to comment further.\n\nA White House spokeswoman said, \u201cSergei Millian is one of hundreds of thousands of people the president has had his picture made with, but they do not know one another.\u201d\n\nMillian, however, promoted ties he claimed to hold with Trump\u2019s company.\n\nA 2009 newsletter posted to the website of the Russian American Chamber of Commerce reported that the group had \u201csigned formal agreements\u201d with the Trump Organization and P\u00e9rez\u2019s company \u201cto jointly service the Russian clients\u2019 commercial, residential and industrial real estate needs.\u201d\n\nIn the interview with RIA Novosti, Millian boasted that when he was in New York, Trump introduced him to his \u201cright-hand man,\u201d Michael Cohen, a longtime Trump adviser \u2014 a claim that Cohen has denied.\n\n\u201cHe is the chief attorney of Trump, through whom all contracts have to go,\u201d Millian told the Russian news outlet, adding, \u201cI was involved in the signing of a contract\u201d to promote Trump\u2019s real estate projects in Russia.\n\n\u201cYou can say that I was their exclusive broker,\u201d Millian continued in Russian. \u201cBack then, in 2007-2008, Russians by the dozens were buying apartments in Trump\u2019s buildings in the U.S.A.\u201d\n\nAsked in the April interview how often he spoke to Trump or his associates, Millian responded: \u201cThe last time was several days ago.\u201d\n\nMillian told people last year that he was in touch with Papadopoulos, whom Trump had described in a March 2016 Washington Post editorial board interview as a member of his foreign policy team and an \u201cexcellent guy.\u201d\n\nPapadopoulos received attention during the campaign largely because of reports that he had exaggerated his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and cited among his accomplishments that he had participated in a Model United Nations program for college and graduate students.\n\nBut, according to foreign news reports and officials, he conducted a number of high-level meetings last year and presented himself as a representative of the Trump campaign. He told a group of researchers in Israel that Trump saw Putin as \u201ca responsible actor and potential partner,\u201d according to a column in the Jerusalem Post, while later he met with a British Foreign Office representative in London, an embassy spokesman said. He also criticized U.S. sanctions on Russia in an interview with the Russian news outlet Interfax.\n\nPapadopoulos did not respond to questions about contacts with Millian. But Papadopoulos said by email that his public comments during the campaign reflected his own opinions and that some of his energy policy views run counter to Russian interests. \u201cNo one from the campaign ever directed me to discuss \u2018talking points,\u2019 \u201d he said. In a separate email, he accused The Post of relying on \u201cinnuendo\u201d and \u201cunsubstantiated claims by irrelevant sources.\u201d\n\nNeither Millian nor a White House spokeswoman responded to questions about Papadopoulos. The person familiar with the contacts, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, did not provide details.\n\nOver the summer, as Trump prepared to accept the Republican presidential nomination, Millian traveled to Russia. He posted pictures on his Facebook page showing that he attended a \u00adRussian government-sponsored summit in St. Petersburg in June. One photograph shows him with Russia\u2019s minister for energy. Another shows him chatting with Russian aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, who is close to Putin. A spokeswoman for Deripaska declined to comment. A spokesman for the Russian Embassy did not respond to questions about Millian.\n\nLater in the summer, Millian continued boasting of his Trump connections.\n\nHe told ABC News that he had been the \u201cofficial broker\u201d for the Trump-branded condo building and described Trump\u2019s affinity for working with Russians. He pointed to \u201chundreds of millions of dollars that [Trump] received from interactions with Russian businessmen.\u201d\n\nMillian added that Trump \u201clikes Russia because he likes beautiful Russian ladies \u2014 talking to them, of course. And he likes to be able to make lots of money with Russians.\u201d\n\nMillian told ABC that he was \u201cabsolutely not\u201d involved with Russian intelligence. But when asked whether he had heard rumors to that effect, Millian replied, \u201cYes, of course.\u201d\n\nMillian also said that, at times, he talked about U.S. politics with top Russian officials. \u201cUsually if I meet top people in the Russian government, they invite me, say, to the Kremlin for the reception, of course I have a chance to talk to some presidential advisers and some top people,\u201d Millian said.\n\nWhile Cohen has said he has never met Millian, the two did interact last year over Twitter. Millian was, for a time, one of about 100 people that Cohen followed and they tweeted at each other on one occasion in August after Cohen appeared on television.\n\nCohen later unfollowed Millian, telling The Post that he had mistakenly thought Millian was related to a Trump Organization employee with a similar last name.\n\n\u201cHe is a total phony,\u201d Cohen said in an interview. \u201cAnything coming out of this individual\u2019s mouth is inaccurate and purely part of some deranged interest in having his name in the newspaper.\u201d\n\nCohen said he did not believe Trump was in Russia in 2007, as Millian claimed in April.\n\nCohen said it was possible that, like other brokers in Florida, Millian might have attempted to sell units at Trump Hollywood. But, he said, Millian never held an exclusive deal at the project or any contract with the Trump Organization.\n\nSpeaking with The Post over the phone from his New York office in a January interview, Cohen also read aloud from a lengthy email he said Millian had sent him shortly before the election that contradicted his earlier public statements.\n\n\u201cI met Mr. Trump once, long time ago, in 2008, pretty much for a photo opportunity and a brief talk as part of my marketing work for Trump Hollywood, after my brokering service was signed. Now, to say that I have substantial ties is total nonsense,\u201d Cohen said, reading from an email he said Millian wrote after media coverage that mentioned him.\n\nIn the email, Millian suggested holding a news conference to clear up the matter, Cohen said. Cohen said he rejected the idea, accusing Millian via email of \u201cseeking media attention off of this false narrative of a Trump-Russia alliance\u201d despite having met Trump only one time, \u201cfor a 10 second photo op.\u201d\n\nCohen, who left his job at the Trump Organization in January to become Trump\u2019s personal attorney, said this month that he could not release a copy of Millian\u2019s email because he no longer has access to the company\u2019s email system.\n\nIn South Florida, where Millian claimed to have had a contract to sell units at Trump Hollywood, there is little evidence that he played a major role.\n\nDaniel Lebensohn, whose company BH3 took over for the Related Group in 2010 after P\u00e9rez\u2019s company struggled to complete the project, said his company\u2019s records show no sign that Millian sold any units in the building.\n\nTwo Florida-based real estate brokers who specialize in the Russian market and have sold units in Trump Hollywood were equally mystified.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of him,\u201d said Olga Mirer, who has traveled back and forth to Russia over the past decade brokering deals at Trump Hollywood and other Florida buildings.\n\n\n\nMiss Universe 2013, Gabriela Isler of Venezuela, left, and pageant owner Donald Trump point to each other while posing for a photo after the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow on Nov. 9, 2013.

We\u2019ve listed them in alphabetical order.\n\nSusan B. Anthony\n\nAs above: Feminist icon who envisioned a world where women won elected office.\n\nFrederick Douglass\n\nAt a Black History Month event in February, Trump offered high praise for Douglass, who, Trump said, \u201cis an example of somebody who\u2019s done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I notice.\u201d\n\nDouglass was an abolitionist and newspaper publisher, which Trump may not have known before praising him.\n\nThe American flag\n\nIn 2008, before he ran for office, Trump learned from Stephen Colbert why there were 13 stripes on the flag: to honor the 13 original American colonies.\n\nThe Irish\n\nDuring a ceremony shortly before St. Patrick\u2019s Day, Trump praised immigrants from the Emerald Isle.\n\n\u201cIrish Americans played a vital role in preserving our union during its hour of greatest need,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo true. Played a very, very big role.\u201d\n\nSpecifically: During the Civil War, when Irish soldiers fighting for the Union helped subdue the Confederate rebels who sought to rip America in two.\n\nAbraham Lincoln\n\nThe first Republican president, which \u201cmost people don\u2019t even know.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s that moment\u2014 Trump: \"Most people don\u2019t even know\" Lincoln was a Republican, says PACs should take out an ad to promote that. pic.twitter.com/Hw9LrWqUFB \u2014 Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) March 22, 2017\n\n(There\u2019s polling on this one. Most people did know that.)\n\nSouth Carolina\n\n\u201cSouth Carolina has a long very, very proud military tradition and history,\u201d Trump said during an event at a Boeing plant in the state last month.\n\nIncluded in that history: South Carolina\u2019s effort at self-determination following its secession in 1861, an event undone when its Confederate soldiers were defeated in battle by brutal Union soldiers from the North.\n\nRosie the Riveter\n\nEarlier this month, Trump made sure that those who watched his weekly address were familiar with this obscure assembly-line worker.\n\nAmong the workers building B-24 bombers at the Willow Run plant during World War II was one tough lady. You might have heard of her: they called her Rosie the Riveter. And when Rosie\u2019s country called her, she answered the call.\n\nIf you hadn\u2019t heard of her before, you have now.\n\nSpace program\n\n\u201cAlmost half a century ago,\u201d Trump said at a signing ceremony for NASA, \u201cour brave astronauts first planted the American flag on the Moon. It was a big moment in our history.\u201d\n\nDonald J. Trump\n\nBeneficiary of a historic electoral movement in November 2016, according to his official presidential biography: \u201cMillions of Americans rallied behind his message of rebuilding our country and disrupting the status quo \u2014 this was a truly national victory and a historic movement.\u201d\n\nThat line follows this one: \u201cHe also won 306 electoral votes, the most for a Republican since George H.W.

Last week, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) went a step further, saying \u201cno longer does the Congress have credibility to handle this alone\u201d and calling for a select committee or independent commission to take over the investigation.\n\nBurr said his committee is dedicating seven staff members to the Russia investigation and is \u201cwithin weeks\u201d of completing a review of \u201cthousands of pages\u201d of documents provided by the intelligence community. Burr said his panel expects to request \u2014 and receive \u2014 more documents as the investigation continues.\n\nBurr said he has not coordinated with the White House on the investigation and insisted that although he advised Trump during his campaign \u2014 and voted for him \u2014 he could conduct the probe objectively.\n\nMost of the initial 20 interviews the committee will conduct, according to Warner, are with officials who put together a report released in January that stated Russia interfered in the 2016 elections with the purpose of trying to improve Trump\u2019s chances of winning. Burr said that five of those interviews have been set, and the remaining 15 will be scheduled in the next 10 days.\n\nWhile Warner and Burr did not disclose additional people they hoped would testify before the committee, they hinted that list may include Michael Flynn, who resigned as national security adviser over the controversy surrounding his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and his failure to fully disclose those discussions to Vice President Pence.\n\nAnother possible witness could be former acting attorney general Sally Yates, who earlier this year alerted the White House that public statements made by administration officials regarding Flynn\u2019s contact with Kislyak were incorrect and could have exposed the national security adviser to future blackmail by the Russians.\n\nThe Washington Post reported this week that the Trump administration tried to prevent Yates from testifying before the House Intelligence Committee in a meeting initially scheduled for Tuesday of this week. Nunes canceled that hearing last week.\n\nThe administration has denied it sought to muzzle Yates.

All four reportedly have had contact with Russian officials, Russian oligarchs or organizations, such as WikiLeaks, that are wrapped up in the Kremlin\u2019s 2016 meddling efforts.\n\nBurr said the committee would conduct interviews only when it \u201cdetermines we\u2019re ready\u201d and only \u201cif they\u2019re even pertinent to the issues we need to look into.\u201d\n\nHe added the committee \u201cwill conduct an interview with Mr. Kushner when the committee decides it\u2019s time to set a date, because we know exactly the scope of what needs to be asked of Mr. Kushner.\u201d\n\nWhile the committee leaders declined to comment on the House panel\u2019s probe at their news conference, Warner told reporters earlier in the day that if Nunes was onto something with the information he gleaned from his White House visit, it was a mystery to every other intelligence investigator in the Capitol.\n\n\u201cNone of us, Republican or Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, has any idea what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d Warner said.

Thanks to Mapzen for help in creating it.)\n\nThere is a lot of territory that falls into that category, as you can see if you zoom out on the map above or as seen below. Everything between that orange line and that black line: ceded.\n\nThere have been any number of articles exploring this admittedly weird part of the United States. In August, a writer for the Rio Grande Guardian described swapping houses with a neighbor to get a sense of what life on the other side of the wall was like. In 2011, Liz Goodwin of Yahoo News covered Texans who lived on the south side of the wall, including some in Brownsville. \u201cTechnically, we\u2019re in the United States,\u201d one homeowner told Goodwin \u2014 though he noted that U.S. Border Patrol seemed to focus on defending the wall, not the actual border.\n\nThe number of people living in that gray area is hard to establish. Census tract data doesn\u2019t break down that finely, and, for the most part, the area between the wall and the border is uninhabited because it\u2019s a flood plain, as mentioned above.\n\nTo build the wall, the federal government would need to exercise eminent domain over a lot of territory owned by Americans. While Texas\u2019s attorney general is perfectly comfortable with allowing the government to seize private land for its construction, some landowners are likely to disagree. (Particularly given that the border region is generally pretty Democratic.) Building the wall in Mexico would certainly avoid irritating those landowners.\n\nIt would, however, irritate Mexico.\n\nTrump\u2019s long-promised pledge to have the Mexican government pay for the wall was never realistic, and, as president, he has offered no plan to make that happen. It seems perhaps more unlikely that he will persuade a foreign nation to allow the United States to construct on its property, particularly given that the point of the wall is, among other things, to block the movement of people from that nation. Trump could theoretically get Mexico to \u201cpay\u201d for the wall by cutting off aid and funding to the country. But there\u2019s essentially no way he could get Mexico to give up its territory.\n\nZinke\u2019s overall point is correct: Building the wall involves balancing a lot of concerns and problems. How do you build in the mountains? Where do you run through environmentally sensitive areas? And how do you deal with the river? In the past, the river has been dealt with by isolating some small group of Americans on the other side of the barrier. In the future, it\u2019s almost certain that the same compromise will be reached.\n\nRead more:\n\nIn fight with Trump, Mexico has plenty of ways to punch back\n\nTrump supporter thought president would only deport \u2018bad hombres.\u2019 Instead, her husband is being deported."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/christie-trump-and-i-believe-addiction-is-a-disease/2017/03/29/2beecf9e-14a2-11e7-bb16-269934184168_video.html", "text": "- At the White House, March 29, Gov.

Ryan (R-Wis.) gives a news conference at the Capitol on March 24 after President Trump\u2019s health-care bill was pulled from the House floor. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nAs Donald Trump worked his way toward the delegate margin he needed to avoid a fight at the Republican National Convention last year, there was one last roadblock. One year ago today, the contest was by no means settled, and if one of Trump\u2019s remaining presidential opponents \u2014 Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) or Ohio Gov. John Kasich \u2014 could amass enough delegates by eking out wins in the last dozen states to vote, they might be able to keep Trump from hitting that critical threshold. And one state, more than any other, seemed as though it probably would help that effort: Wisconsin.\n\nWisconsin, after all, was a state in which the Republican establishment had a strong foothold. The chairman of the Republican National Committee hailed from there, as did House Speaker Paul D. Ryan. And, sure enough, the sober Republican voters of Wisconsin handed Trump a setback, in resounding fashion. Cruz won the state by 13 points. It was the last contest that Trump would lose, going on to romp through the Northeast.\n\n[House GOP has high hopes, but not high likelihood, of reviving health-care bill]\n\nOne thing we\u2019ve noticed, though, is that Ryan \u2014 and the Republican establishment that he represents \u2014 has consistently been viewed less positively than Trump himself, even before Trump secured the nomination. On a national level, more than half of Republicans told NBC and SurveyMonkey in May that they trusted Trump to lead the Republican Party more than they did Ryan. That wasn\u2019t true in Wisconsin, it\u2019s safe to assume, given that Ryan\u2019s net favorability (those viewing him positively minus those viewing him negatively) among Republicans in his home state in early August was plus-72 to Trump\u2019s plus-31.\n\nBut, as the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel pointed out Tuesday, that has changed. Since the state\u2019s primary, Wisconsin Republicans have grown more and more fond of the man who would become the leader of their party, and this month, for the first time, Trump\u2019s approval ratings match Ryan\u2019s. On net, Trump is viewed more positively.\n\nNationally, the gulf is even wider at this point, according to a new CBS News poll.\n\nOn net, Trump has a plus-72 rating from Republicans. Ryan is at plus-32.\n\nAgain, Trump has been more popular with Republicans than Ryan has for a long time. But now that sentiment has spread even to Ryan\u2019s home turf, that bastion of the Republican establishment, that Alamo of the traditional GOP.\n\nThe Trump takeover is complete."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/neil-gorsuchs-supreme-court-nomination-is-on-track-to-irreparably-change-the-senate--and-further-divide-the-country/2017/03/29/dc57011e-13d3-11e7-ada0-1489b735b3a3_story.html", "text": "Judge Neil Gorsuch testifies last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee during his confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nSens. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.) are not usually partisan firebrands, particularly on presidential appointments.\n\nBack in 2013, Wicker helped temporarily defuse a showdown over Republican filibusters of President Barack Obama\u2019s nominees to the judiciary and agencies. More than a decade ago, Carper voted to confirm President George W. Bush\u2019s first Supreme Court nominee and opposed Democratic efforts to filibuster the other.\n\nNow, with about 10 days left in the showdown over President Trump\u2019s first Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch, both Wicker and Carper have turned dour in their outlook for what the battle means for the Senate \u2014 and the country.\n\nWicker is all but certain that Democrats have enough votes to block Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation next week with a filibuster \u2014 by demanding a procedural step that takes 60 votes to clear. That, in turn, probably would prompt the Republicans to change the rules unilaterally to allow Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation, and all other Supreme Court picks thereafter, by a simple majority.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a done deal,\u201d Wicker said Tuesday. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it\u2019s headed.\u201d\n\n(The Washington Post)\n\n[Gorsuch may fall short of votes needed for smooth confirmation]\n\nCarper agreed, explaining that he would rather see Republicans eliminate supermajority thresholds for Supreme Court nominees, further poisoning the already toxic atmosphere in Washington, than do anything to support Gorsuch.\n\nThe purpose of the rule is to promote bipartisanship and consensus, which in turn creates legitimacy and buy-in for policy and governance. If the filibuster goes away, so does yet another layer of collegiality in Congress \u2014 and another way to shore up Washington\u2019s credibility.\n\nIt would be the second time in 3\u00bd years that the Senate majority has breached the long-held standard of first clearing a two-thirds majority vote to alter the chamber\u2019s rules. The first time Democrats, then led by Harry M. Reid (Nev.), ended 60-vote filibusters for all nominees except those for the Supreme Court.\n\nIf they all contribute to taking the next step, both parties will have completed their hypocritical march to the opposite side of this issue over the past decade. Democrats, after years of demanding speedy passage of Obama\u2019s nominees, now clamor for scrutiny and supermajorities. Republicans have quickly adopted the old Democratic talking points. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who at times has played the role of custodian of his chamber\u2019s rich history, will have made the same move that led to what he called in 2013 \u201ca sad day in the history of the Senate.\u201d\n\nAnd once both sides are guilty of breaching that standard on nominations, it would seem to be only a matter of time before a future majority obliterates filibusters on other legislation.\n\nSen. Robert P. Casey Jr. (Pa.), one of the first Democrats to declare his support for a filibuster of Gorsuch, said that the likelihood that the judge will not win 60 votes proves that he is outside the mainstream. \u201cIf you\u2019re a consensus pick, you should be able to get 60 votes,\u201d Casey said.\n\n(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nIn reality, Gorsuch\u2019s hearings last week unfolded without any new revelations and followed the playbook of hearings for the four justices confirmed this century. The majority asked soft questions to bolster his case, and the minority asked tough questions and demanded, unsuccessfully, that he predetermine how he would rule on hot-button issues.\n\nIn another time, Gorsuch easily might have been considered the consensus candidate that Casey described.\n\nAs a result, there is a sense of raw politics in Democrats\u2019 growing opposition to Gorsuch, because liberal anti-Trump activists are pushing Democrats to oppose every Trump move.\n\nWith most centrist voters not paying attention to procedural fights over confirmations, some Democrats think the bigger political penalty would be to disappoint their base by allowing an easy confirmation this time.\n\nRepublicans misjudged Casey, hoping he would come around to supporting Gorsuch because of his congeniality \u2014 and because Trump won his state. The Democrat cited Gorsuch\u2019s rulings against federal agencies in their regulatory decisions.\n\nAnd Carper said he cannot forgive Republicans for never even holding a hearing on the first nominee for the current court vacancy \u2014 Judge Merrick Garland, whom Obama nominated after Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016.\n\n\u201cI have a very hard time getting over what was done to Merrick Garland, a very hard time,\u201d Carper said Tuesday. \u201cThat\u2019s a wrong that should be righted, we have a chance to do that, and it won\u2019t be by confirming Judge Gorsuch the first time through.\u201d\n\nInterviews with Wicker, Carper and half a dozen other senators who could anchor something called the \u201cReasonable Caucus\u201d delivered few signs of compromise ahead. If those assessments are right, by the end of next week Republicans will have triggered the \u201cnuclear option,\u201d as the potential rule change is known by insiders.\n\nAs the Gorsuch nomination proceeds, this man is taking credit: Mitch McConnell\n\nNo concrete attempts have been made to convene the bipartisan huddles that have sometimes worked in previous fights over the state of the Senate.\n\n\u201cNot that I\u2019ve seen,\u201d said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the co-leader of the bipartisan Gang of 14 that averted a similar showdown in 2005. McCain said that the environment is too polarized now and that the old personalities \u2014 powerful chairmen, often war heroes, willing to buck their leadership \u2014 have been replaced by a less social, more timid crop of senators.\n\n\u201cWe just have a different environment around here,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t sit down and talk the way they used to.\u201d Asked whether he considered that depressing, McCain went on: \u201cIt is, it really is.\u201d\n\nMcCain is one of just three left from the 2005 gang, and the other two, Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), have both adopted a hard-line tone toward Democrats on the matter of Gorsuch, whom they consider highly qualified.\n\nCollins, the leading moderate Republican, had supported holding a vote on Garland. But now she thinks Democrats need to move on because Trump won the election.\n\n\u201cThat is in the past, and it is not fair to Judge Gorsuch to deny him a straight up-or-down vote based on what happened with Merrick Garland,\u201d she said Tuesday.\n\nCollins doesn\u2019t see a bipartisan pact coming together and said lawmakers should fight over the next vacancy on the court: \u201cI think it would be wise of the Democrats to vote for him and live to fight another day.\u201d\n\nSchumer\u2019s dilemma: Satisfying the base while protecting his minority\n\nSome Democrats have suggested privately that they first must demonstrate that they have the votes to block Gorsuch and then commence negotiations to avoid the nuclear showdown. But even moderate Democrats such as Carper are not showing much willingness to support a deal that would put Gorsuch on the court in exchange for the possibility of filibustering the next nominee.\n\n\u201cNot much of a prize,\u201d he said.\n\nThat would set the filibuster in motion. And almost like Cold War generals mapping out war games, Republicans say they would be compelled to respond in kind. Otherwise Democrats would have set a new precedent for blocking a Supreme Court nominee.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let that happen,\u201d Wicker said.\n\nRead more from Paul Kane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/clinton-defends-april-ryan-criticizes-everyday-sexism/2017/03/29/52101042-1485-11e7-bb16-269934184168_video.html", "text": "- Hillary Clinton said reporter April Ryan was \"patronized\" and cut off while asking a question during the White House press briefing March 28.

The places most affected by that boom in automation \u2014 that introduction of robots, if you will \u2014 were also places that in 2016 were more likely to support Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe NBER analysis, conducted by MIT\u2019s Daron Acemoglu and Yale\u2019s Pascual Restrepo, determined estimates of the number of robots introduced to a region between 1993 and 2007 for every 1,000 workers. Unsurprisingly, the region where that happened the most was Michigan, where the automotive industry in particular heavily automated its production processes.\n\n(Our thanks to Acemoglu and Restrepo for sharing their data.)\n\nThat Michigan is so dominant in that map means that we can miss some more subtle gradations. By depicting the robot metric in buckets, we can see broader trends: The relatively large introduction of robotic workers throughout the Midwest and Rust Belt and along the Gulf Coast.\n\nThe NBER paper determined its figures using \u201ccommuting zones,\u201d clusters of counties that share a common labor market. We went back and compiled numbers from the 2016 election for those counties, allowing us to correlate robot-introduction with 2016 voting patterns. Interestingly, the average number of robots introduced per every thousand workers over the 14-year period being considered was higher in areas where the 2016 vote was closer.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.\n\nIf we compare the number of robots introduced per 1,000 workers with the margin between Trump and Clinton in each of those 700-plus clusters, we notice that most of the zones where more than one robot was introduced for every thousand workers ended up backing Trump over Clinton. The most notable exception is in the commuting zone at the center of Michigan, where nearly five robots were introduced for every 1,000 workers but \u2014 aided by the results in the home county of the University of Michigan \u2014 ended up backing Clinton.\n\nAs is usually the case with election data that\u2019s linked to counties, all zones are not created equal. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote thanks to there being a lot more voters in the zones she won. Below, we\u2019ve scaled the data points according to the total number of votes cast in each zone.\n\nIf we take this electoral data and relate it to the buckets we introduced in that second map, the effect is clear. There\u2019s a correlation between the extent to which robots were introduced in a commuting zone and the extent to which the zone voted against Hillary Clinton.\n\nBelow, pitting Clinton against Trump, with data points again sized relative to the number of votes cast in each zone. The diagonal line is the trend in the data \u2014 up and to the right, meaning that as a zone had more robots introduced from 1993 to 2007, it was also more likely to vote for Trump in 2016.\n\nIt holds true for the primary, as well. While data from the primary is a bit flukier, given that many states use low-turnout caucuses or may only offer results by congressional district. But again that diagonal line, up and to the right.\n\nThis is a very good example of the old saying \u201ccorrelation does not equal causation\u201d \u2014 that is, just because there\u2019s a link between the number of robots introduced and the 2016 results doesn\u2019t mean that the robots led to those results. But given that the NBER research links automation to job loss \u2014 each robot per 1,000 workers cost an estimated 6.7 jobs \u2014 and given that job loss (particularly in the Midwest) has broadly been cited as a driving factor for support for Clinton\u2019s opponents, these findings are at least logically consistent.\n\nThis study also reinforces another point that complicates President Trump\u2019s stated desire to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.: Manufacturing job loss stems to some significant degree from automation, not outsourcing. (The Brookings Institution looked specifically at that point.) It will be a lot easier, one can safely assume, to convince Ford or Chevy to build a new plant in Michigan instead of Mexico. It will likely be harder to convince them to staff it with humans instead of robots \u2014 and if they don\u2019t, there might be political implications for Trump moving forward."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-panels-russia-probe-effectively-put-on-hold/2017/03/28/7a6ceedc-13f6-11e7-833c-503e1f6394c9_story.html", "text": "The House Intelligence Committee\u2019s probe of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, including potential ties between the Trump team and the Kremlin, is effectively on hold, after its chairman said the panel would not interview more witnesses until two intelligence chiefs return to Capitol Hill for a still-unscheduled private briefing.\n\nCommittee Chairman Devin Nunes\u2019s declaration Tuesday that \u201cuntil [FBI Director James B.] Comey comes forward, it\u2019s hard for us to move forward with interviews and depositions\u201d comes as an indefinite stop order on a roster of expected interviews and testimony, from top Trump campaign surrogates to top intelligence and law enforcement officials serving during the election and transition period.\n\nLate last week, Nunes (R-Calif.) canceled an open hearing scheduled for Tuesday that would have featured testimony from former director of national intelligence James R.

Many of the cuts would be aimed at key priorities for Democrats, such as money for global reproductive health education, but they also take aim at more broadly popular agencies including the National Institutes of Health and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nMulvaney also outlined $3 billion in trims to education programs, including Pell grants for low-income college students, and $1.2 billion in cuts to NIH research programs.\n\nA partial government shutdown would begin April 29 if Congress doesn\u2019t pass the short-term spending bill. Democrats did not rule out some increases to war-related military spending, but they have signaled they will not support the White House\u2019s proposed spending cuts or the money for the border wall. Their support is necessary in the Senate, where the spending bill needs 60 votes and Republicans control just 52 seats.\n\n\u201cThey are asking for something that is going to be deeply damaging,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wa.) \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight back with everything we have.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other senators avoided making any direct commitment on whether the border wall would be included in the upcoming spending bill.\n\n\u201cDemocrats and Republicans . . . are working together on this, and we fully anticipate getting an outcome prior to the end of April,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nIn addition, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) told reporters Tuesday that he expects that there will be a bipartisan spending bill and that a vote to fund the wall would happen in a separate, supplemental bill sometime later this year.\n\n\u201cI would suspect the border wall is in the supplemental,\u201d Blunt said.\n\n[Trump\u2019s path forward only gets tougher after health-care fiasco]\n\n[Senate Democrats prepare for spring battle over border wall]\n\nDemocrats also scoffed at the idea that the White House would ask Congress to cut widely supported domestic programs to pay for the wall despite Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to make Mexico pay.\n\n\u201cCutting cancer research, slashing affordable housing and programs to protect the environment, and making middle-class taxpayers pay for a wall that Mexico was supposed to pay for?\u201d said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (Vt.), the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. \u201cThese may be the Trump administration priorities, but they aren\u2019t the priorities of the American people.\u201d\n\nRepublicans in Congress had generally hoped to avoid any serious conflict over the must-pass spending bill and leave the bigger budget battle for later this year. GOP Senate leaders in particular had planned to speed through the spending votes quickly after confirming Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee.\n\nThe White House proposal would almost certainly derail those plans. Even those who like the defense spending increases weren\u2019t interested in forcing a shutdown fight now.\n\n\u201cUltimately I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the direction the Appropriations Committee is going to move,\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said. \u201cIn the end, the Congress is responsible for spending the money.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans played down the conflict as a normal part of a negotiation over spending priorities. It is common for White House budget officials to send Congress a list of proposed cuts to offset new spending priorities. But rarely do the cuts target popular programs such as medical research at the National Institutes of Health in exchange.\n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) told reporters Tuesday that Congress had just voted the previous year to increase funding for NIH and other research. Cornyn said the difference of priorities was to be expected, but he gave no suggestion that Trump\u2019s spending requests would be entertained.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re becoming very aware of how hard the legislative process is,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cI look at it as a conversation.\u201d\n\nBecause of a transcription error, an earlier version mistakenly attributed a quote by Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/karen-pence-is-the-vice-presidents-prayer-warrior-gut-check-and-shield/2017/03/28/3d7a26ce-0a01-11e7-8884-96e6a6713f4b_story.html", "text": "(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nDuring the first of Vice President Pence\u2019s two unsuccessful races for Congress, he rode a single-speed bicycle more than 250 miles around his district, much of it accompanied by his wife, Karen, along for the journey.\n\nDuring their time in the Indiana governor\u2019s mansion, the Pences installed twin treadmills upstairs in their residence.\n\nAnd during his years as a House member in Washington, after he had finally won on his third attempt, Mike Pence proudly displayed an antique red phone on his desk \u2014 a Christmas gift from his wife for which only she had the number, a hotline straight from her to him.\n\nMore than a decade later, even as cellphones were the norm, Mike Pence had that same red phone installed in his statehouse office \u2014 a reminder, both physical and symbolic, of the direct and enduring connection between Mike and Karen Pence.\n\nNow, as second lady, Karen Pence, 60, remains an important influence on one of President Trump\u2019s most important political allies. She sat in on at least one interview as the vice president assembled his staff, accompanied her husband on his first foreign trip and joins him for off-the-record briefings with reporters, acting as his gut check and shield.\n\nOn the vice president\u2019s visit last month to Germany and Belgium, the Pences quietly toured Dachau concentration camp, often holding hands, and huddled together on the Air Force Two ride home to debrief on the trip. When Mike Pence, 57, ventured to the back of the plane to chat off the record with reporters, his wife accompanied him, bearing a silver tray of cookies and standing by his side for the 20-minute conversation.\n\n[Pence plays role of Trump\u2019s ambassador to nervous Republicans]\n\n\u201cAs governor, Mike Pence had a very tight inner circle, and Karen Pence was very much a part of that,\u201d said Brian Howey, publisher of Howey Politics Indiana, a nonpartisan political newsletter in the state. \u201cI would characterize her as the silent, omnipresent partner. You knew she was there, you knew there was some considerable influence she wielded, but, boy, she was not public about it.\u201d\n\nOver the years, Karen Pence has repeatedly said that one of her \u201chard and fast rules\u201d is that she never weighs in on or attempts to influence policy.\n\n\n\nPence, through a spokeswoman, declined interview requests for this profile. (Her spokeswoman did, however, say she would be open to participating in a story that focused solely on her art therapy initiatives and other passions).\n\nFriends and aides, meanwhile, say she is the Pence family \u201cprayer warrior,\u201d a woman so inextricably bound to her husband that even then-candidate Trump understood her importance and consulted her in critical campaign moments.\n\nWhen Trump called to offer Mike Pence the No. 2 slot, the businessman knew Karen Pence was by his side and asked, \u201cI hear Karen is there, too? Can I talk to her?\u201d And nearly three months later, when an Access Hollywood tape revealed Trump talking crudely about women, Trump called his running mate to apologize and then asked him to hand the phone to his wife, so he could apologize personally to her, too.\n\nThough aides said Karen Pence was among those most upset by the tape, they stressed that she also emerged privately as one of Trump\u2019s staunchest defenders overall.\n\n\u201cShe was a major part of our campaign, and she just never flinched,\u201d said Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president. \u201cKaren Pence was one of the biggest pro-Trump people and Trump defenders there was \u2026 She has a great sense of people and saw at events and rallies the enthusiasm and support for Mr. Trump.\u201d\n\nBorn Karen Sue Batten in Kansas, she grew up just north of downtown Indianapolis, where she met Steve Whitaker, her first husband, in high school, where she was valedictorian and president of the Speech Club. In a telephone interview, Whitaker recalled few details about his 21-year-old bride. The marriage ended, he said, after they simply grew apart as he, then a medical student, spent long hours at the hospital.\n\n\n\nMike Pence, center, and Karen Pence campaign at Parkside Elementary School in Columbus, Ind., in 2004. (Joe Harpring/Associated Press)\n\nIn fact, he added, the last time he saw her was more than three decades ago, when they ran into each other on the street in Indianapolis. He didn\u2019t know who she was married to \u2014 or that her husband was Trump\u2019s running mate \u2014 until shortly before the election.\n\n\u201cWe were kids,\u201d said Whitaker, now the chief medical officer of a Seattle-based biopharmaceutical company. \u201cWe probably didn\u2019t necessarily know what we were doing.\u201d\n\n[Conservative women\u2019s group knocked for giving \u2018Working for Women\u2019 award to Mike Pence]\n\nLater, after dating Mike Pence for eight months, Karen engraved a small gold cross with the word \u201cYes\u201d and slipped it into her purse to give him when he popped the question.\n\nHe did, just a month later, as the two were feeding the ducks at a local canal. He hollowed out two loaves of bread, placing a small bottle of champagne in one and the ring box in the other for her to discover as she tore off pieces, according to local news reports. (They later got the bread shellacked, as a keepsake, a local paper noted).\n\nThe Pences were married in a Roman Catholic church in 1985 but later became evangelical Christians.\n\nIn 2002, Mike Pence told the Hill that he never eats alone with a woman other than his wife and that he won\u2019t attend events featuring alcohol without her by his side, either.\n\nSupporters and critics alike cite her as a force behind her husband\u2019s socially conservative stances, including his opposition to gay marriage and the religious freedom law he signed as governor of Indiana, which opponents worried would allow business owners to discriminate against gays and lesbians by citing religious concerns.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get a dime between them,\u201d said Ken Blackwell, senior fellow at the Family Research Council and a senior domestic policy adviser on the Trump transition team. \u201cIt is not him seeking her approval, but his doing a sort of gut check with what they have learned together and come up through together in terms of their shared Christianity.\u201d\n\nIn 1991, Karen Pence, then an elementary-school teacher, penned a letter to the editor in the Indianapolis Star, complaining that the paper\u2019s \u201cChildren\u2019s Express\u201d section had featured an article that \u201cencourages children to think they\u2019re gay or lesbian if they have a close relationship with a child of the same sex\u201d or admire a teacher of the same gender.\n\n\u201cI only pray that most parents were able to intercept your article before their children were encouraged to call the Gay/Lesbian Youth Hotline, which encourages them to \u2018accept their homosexuality\u2019 instead of reassuring them that they are not,\u201d she wrote.\n\nFriends of Pence \u2014 who say she quietly held a small Bible study group during her time in the governor\u2019s mansion \u2014 say her faith has sustained her through challenging periods, from when she and Mike first had trouble getting pregnant to the vagaries of politics, including her initial reluctance to support his third attempt to win a congressional seat.\n\n[In Mr. Pence\u2019s new neighborhood, not exactly the welcome wagon]\n\nVicki Lake, the wife of the Pences\u2019 former pastor, recalled a visit from Karen Pence one day at her Greenwood, Ind., home. As Pence was leaving, Lake recalled, \u201cShe grabbed my hands, and we prayed together in my laundry room.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of person she is, a person who believes in prayer, a godly mother and wife,\u201d Lake said. \u201cIn fact, when Mike was a congressman, Karen would send out prayer requests to people \u2014 to pray for them as a family, that God would give them the strength to do all that they had to do.\u201d\n\nMarilyn Logsdon, who met Karen Pence when they were elementary-school teachers in the late 1980s and later served on her charitable board when she was the first lady of Indiana, recalled her friend beginning meetings with prayer. \u201cShe would say, \u2018Before we look at these grants, let\u2019s just ask God for wisdom and discernment,\u201d Logsdon said.\n\n\n\nKaren Pence, second from right, talks to U.S. Marine Corps 1st Lt. Talia Bastien at her residence on the grounds of the U.S. Naval Observatory. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nPence has stayed close with many of the women she met in church, as a teacher and through her children\u2019s play groups, all of whom describe her as a loyal friend. Lake, who has a disease that hinders her red blood cell production, says Pence often prays for her hemoglobin count. \u201cI personally get an occasional text asking me, \u2018How are your numbers?\u2019 \u201d she said.\n\nLake also remembers a lunch at the Cheesecake Factory in Greenwood with Pence, who ordered a salad-to-go for a friend after the two women had finished their meal. \u201cNow this is the governor\u2019s wife,\u201d Lake said, \u201cand she was going to stop by her house and drop off this salad for a friend.\u201d\n\nAs Indiana\u2019s first lady, Pence became the first governor\u2019s wife in modern memory to keep her own office suite on the second floor of the statehouse, just down the hall from her husband.\n\nShe reached out to all her living predecessors for tips and advice on the job, eventually settling on her own dictum: The role was hers to mold as she saw fit. Pence, who minored in art at Butler University and still paints watercolors, combined her interests in art, education and families, becoming the honorary chair of the art therapy program for Indiana\u2019s Riley Hospital for Children and serving on the board of Tracy\u2019s Kids, an art therapy program at children\u2019s hospitals in the Washington area.\n\nNow, as second lady, she expects art therapy to be one of her big initiatives, along with work supporting military families. On Thursday, Pence hosted roughly two dozen female service members at her residence for a small reception in honor of Women\u2019s History Month.\n\n\u201cI just want you to know how much we appreciate you, and I think a lot of times, people in the military, men and women, aren\u2019t told enough how much we appreciate you,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we are saying thank you to you.\u201d\n\nIn Washington, Pence is repeating many of her routines. She has begun reaching out to her counterparts and, like her predecessors, plans to keep an office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where her husband\u2019s team works.\n\nShe hired as her chief of staff Kristan King Nevins, who previously served as first lady Barbara Bush\u2019s chief of staff and also worked for the CIA, where her portfolio included counterproliferation, counterterrorism and cyberoperations in the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nIn the governor\u2019s office, Pence accompanied her husband on trips abroad, including to Germany and Japan. And almost exactly a month into his vice presidency, she joined him on his first trip overseas to the Munich Security Conference \u2014 a practice that will likely be routine for future foreign travel.\n\n\u201cThey are in a strong, supportive marriage bound by common faith,\u201d said Peter Rusthoven, a lawyer active in Indiana Republican politics who has known the Pences for more than 25 years. \u201cI don\u2019t think they make decisions separately.\u201d\n\nIndeed, her prime allegiance remains to her husband, and the loyalty is reciprocal. Among all the frustrations Mike Pence has faced since becoming Trump\u2019s No. 2 \u2014 the Access Hollywood tape; the revelation that Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, lied to him about his contact with Russians; the failure of the health-care bill for which he lobbied \u2014 the most publicly outraged he has become involved an Associated Press story that published his and his wife\u2019s private AOL email addresses.\n\nMike Pence\u2019s team demanded that the AP take down Karen\u2019s private email, and when it didn\u2019t, the vice president tweeted that his wife was owed an apology.\n\nThe email accounts, naturally, were all-but-matching his-and-hers emails, exactly the same but for the first initials.\n\nAlice Crites contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-weighs-deportation-case-after-an-attorney-dished-out-bad-advice/2017/03/28/ef6bfae2-13f2-11e7-9e4f-09aa75d3ec57_story.html", "text": "Justice Sonia Sotomayor, shown Feb. 2 in Brooklyn, said Tuesday there was \u201cprejudice in the advice and prejudice in the decision to ... move forward\u201d in the drug-plea case of Jae Lee. (Kathy Willens/AP)\n\nEveryone agrees that Jae Lee pleaded guilty to a drug charge and now faces deportation to South Korea because of bad lawyering.\n\nThe Tennessee restaurateur, who came to the United States as a child in 1982, was told if he took the plea he\u2019d serve a year in prison. But his lawyer Larry Fitzgerald told him there was no chance that a longtime legal permanent resident like him would be deported. Fitzgerald was wrong.\n\nBut does Fitzgerald\u2019s mistake make any difference if the evidence against Lee was so strong that he almost certainly would have been convicted had he rejected the deal and gone to trial? As the appeals court that ruled against him noted, he would still be deportable.\n\nThe Supreme Court struggled with the issue Tuesday. Does Lee deserve a second chance, because of his lawyer\u2019s mistake, to either seek a plea deal that would not result in his deportation or roll the dice with a jury and hope that somehow he is not convicted?\n\nThe answer could be important, as the Trump administration promises a new vigor in deporting immigrants convicted of crimes.\n\nAssistant Solicitor General Eric J. Feigin reminded the justices that ineffectiveness of counsel must be shown not only to be bad advice to the client, but that the bad advice affected the ultimate consequences.\n\n\u201cA defendant can\u2019t prevail . . . if there\u2019s nothing constitutionally competent counsel could have done to create that chance\u201d of a better outcome, Feigin said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the case here where the lower courts found, in the words of the court of appeals, that (Lee) had no bona fide defense, not even a weak one, and stood to gain nothing from going to trial aside from a longer prison sentence.\u201d\n\nBut Feigin ran into stiff opposition from Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor.\n\n\u201cSo here we have a defense attorney who says: \u2018I didn\u2019t know the law. I told him he wouldn\u2019t be deported. And if I had known the law, I would have told him to go to trial,\u2019 \u201d Sotomayor said. \u201cSo this is both prejudice in the advice and prejudice in the decision to . . . move forward.\u201d\n\nAnd Kagan said she believed a judge could think it rational for Lee to take his chances--because if she were in his position, she would.\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t a judge find . . . that it is objectively reasonable to give up six or eight or nine months for a shot at staying in this country rather than being deported to a place that you don\u2019t know and where you have no ties?\u201d Kagan asked. \u201cI mean, you know, if somebody gave me that choice \u2014 sign me up.\u201d\n\nEven justices not as drawn to Lee\u2019s side said he had a sympathetic case. He\u2019s lived most of his life here, coming with his family to Brooklyn, and he has no ties to South Korea. He moved to Tennessee, and he\u2019s worked in restaurants in the Memphis area.\n\nHe began to use the drug ecstasy recreationally, and the government says he became a dealer. When police executed a search warrant in 2009, they found \u201c88 ecstasy pills, over $32,000 in cash, and a loaded rifle,\u201d Feigin said.\n\nWhen Fitzgerald began to negotiate a plea deal, Lee told him his top priority was not to be deported. Fitzgerald told him he should not worry. But when Lee was assigned to a facility, he discovered it was a detention camp and he would be deported.\n\nLee tried to get a second chance. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit ruled against him, somewhat reluctantly. Other courts have ruled for immigrants in such cases.\n\n\u201cThe plea resulted in mandatory banishment from the United States,\u201d said John Bursch, who argued Lee\u2019s case before the justices. \u201cNo one seriously doubts that if Mr. Lee knew the truth about his plea, he would have rejected it.\u201d\n\nBut some justices said ruling for Lee would create havoc in lower courts, as judges would have no standards on which to decide when a lawyer\u2019s bad advice affected the outcome of the proceeding.\n\nJustice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said Bursch was asking the court to \u201cadopt a purely subjective standard.\u201d\n\nNo, Bursch said.\n\n\u201cWhat is your standard?\u201d demanded Justice Anthony M. Kennedy.\n\nBursch said it was \u201cwhether there was a reasonable probability the defendant would not have pleaded guilty.\n\n\u201cEven if it\u2019s irrational?\u201d asked Justice Stephen G. Breyer.\n\nThe problem with the 6th Circuit\u2019s decision, Bursch said, was that it looked only at the likelihood of success at trial. There are other factors that should be considered as well, such as the prospect of getting a better plea deal, he said.\n\nThe case is Lee v.

Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), a Freedom Caucus member, said Tuesday that he and other authors of various Obamacare repeal bills were discussing plans to force votes on their measures using a procedural shortcut known as a discharge petition.\n\nIf a discharge petition reaches 218 signatures, the speaker is forced to put it to a vote on the House floor.\n\n\u201cWe will find out who is truly for repeal of Obamacare and who is not,\u201d Brooks said.\n\nBrooks said that he preferred to force a vote on a 2015 ACA repeal bill, which passed Congress but was vetoed by President Barack Obama. But he said he also was considering filing a discharge petition on his own bill \u2014 a one-line repeal of the ACA.\n\nBesides the internal politics of the House GOP, the Republican health-care push faces other major obstacles. Trump signaled Friday he would move on and not expend any further political capital on the effort, Senate Republicans remain deeply wary of the House approach, and recent polls show public opinion running strongly against the now-dormant GOP bill.\n\nRyan said he was focused for the time being on getting his fellow Republicans to work as a team.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to retrench into our corners or put up dividing lines,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI don\u2019t want us to become a factionalized majority. I want us to become a unified majority, and that means we\u2019re going to sit down and talk things out until we get there, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nBut other House leaders were more willing to make bold claims. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) told reporters Tuesday that Democrats who celebrated the bill\u2019s failure last week were being \u201cpremature.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re closer today to repealing Obamacare than we\u2019ve ever been before and surely even closer than we were Friday,\u201d Scalise said. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to keep working. This issue isn\u2019t going away.\u201d\n\nKaroun Demirjian contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/trump-moves-decisively-to-wipe-out-obamas-climate-change-record/2017/03/27/411043d4-132c-11e7-9e4f-09aa75d3ec57_story.html", "text": "(The White House)\n\nPresident Trump on Tuesday took the most significant step yet in obliterating his predecessor\u2019s environmental record, instructing federal regulators to rewrite key rules curbing U.S. carbon emissions.\n\nThe sweeping executive order \u2014 which the president signed with great fanfare in the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Map Room \u2014 also seeks to lift a moratorium on federal coal leasing and remove the requirement that federal officials consider the impact of climate change when making decisions.\n\nThe order sends an unmistakable signal that just as President Barack Obama sought to weave climate considerations into every aspect of the federal government, Trump is hoping to rip that approach out by its roots. The president did not utter the words \u201cclimate change\u201d once, instead emphasizing that the move would spur job creation in the fossil fuel industry.\n\n\u201cOur administration is putting an end to the war on coal,\u201d he said, accompanied onstage by more than a dozen coal miners, Vice President Pence and three Cabinet members. \u201cWe\u2019re ending the theft of American prosperity, and rebuilding our beloved country.\u201d\n\nSome of the measures could take years to implement and are unlikely to alter broader economic trends that are shifting the nation\u2019s electricity mix from coal-fired generation to natural gas and renewables. The order is silent on whether the United States should withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, under which it has pledged to cut its greenhouse gas emissions between 26 and 28 percent by 2025 compared to 2005 levels, because the administration remains divided on that question.\n\nThe order comes after several moves by Trump to roll back Obama-era restrictions on mining, drilling and coal- and gas-burning operations. In his first two months as president, Trump has nullified a regulation barring surface-mining companies from polluting waterways and set aside a new accounting system that would have compelled coal companies and other energy firms to pay more in federal royalties.\n\nThe administration also has announced it will reconsider stricter fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks and has approved two major oil pipelines, Dakota Access and Keystone XL, that Obama had halted.\n\n[As Trump halts federal action on climate change, cities and states push on]\n\nAccelerating fossil-fuel production on federal lands and sidelining climate considerations could lead to higher emissions of the greenhouse gases driving climate change and complicate a global effort to curb the world\u2019s carbon output. But Trump has repeatedly questioned whether climate change is underway and emphasized that he is determined to deliver for the voters in coal country who helped him win the Oval Office.\n\nThe president thanked the miners onstage twice during the ceremony, and as they gathered around him when he signed the executive order, he looked up and remarked, \u201cYou know what it says, right? You\u2019re going back to work.\u201d\n\nU.S. coal jobs, which number about 75,000, have been declining for decades. A senior administration official who briefed reporters Monday evening did not predict how many jobs might be spurred by this shift in policy.\n\nStill, Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) and other administration supporters said the change in policy would have a tangible impact on the economy. \u201cThis order is a clear sign to the country that Trump is serious about unleashing this country\u2019s energy dominance,\u201d Inhofe said in a statement.\n\nLegal fight possible\n\nThe centerpiece of the new presidential directive, telling the Environmental Protection Agency to begin rewriting the 2015 regulation that limits greenhouse-gas emissions from existing power plants, will trigger a laborious rulemaking process and a possible legal fight.\n\nThe agency must first get permission from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, where the rule is tied up in litigation, to revisit the matter. Then, agency officials will have to justify reaching the opposite conclusion of the Obama EPA, which argued it was technically feasible and legally warranted to reduce carbon pollution by about one-third by 2030, compared with 2005 levels.\n\n\u201cSo, for the president, even if he would like to revoke the Clean Power Plan, he doesn\u2019t have legal authority to do that,\u201d said Jeffrey Holmstead, a partner at the Bracewell law firm who opposes the Obama-era rule. Holmstead, who headed the EPA\u2019s air and radiation office under President George W. Bush, said he thinks the agency can justify reversing the regulation. But \u201cthey have to justify why they have changed,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile environmental groups decried Trump\u2019s move, mining officials welcomed it as an important course correction in federal energy policy.\n\n\u201cThis rule was an unlawful attempt to radically transform the nation\u2019s power grid, destroying valuable energy assets and leaving our economy more vulnerable to rising power prices \u2014 all for an insignificant environmental benefit,\u201d said Hal Quinn, president and chief executive of the National Mining Association.\n\nEnvironmentalists vowed to fight the executive order in court and press ahead with their goals on the state level.\n\nDavid Doniger, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council\u2019s climate and clean-air program, said unwinding the Clean Power Plan will not happen quickly, no matter what the president wants. \u201cTearing the rules down require going through the same process it took to build them up,\u201d Doniger said. \u201cWe will make them face the music at every step.\u201d\n\nChristopher Field, a professor at Stanford University\u2019s Wood Institute for the Environment, said in an email that the directive carries long-term risks, rather than immediate ones. \u201cSome are risks from eroding the position of U.S. companies in the clean energy sector,\u201d Field said. \u201cOthers are from the loss of irreplaceable natural heritage that is put in jeopardy by ill-conceived policies.\u201d\n\nThe president will also instruct the Interior Department to rewrite a 2015 rule, currently stayed in court, that imposes restrictions on hydraulic fracturing on federal and tribal lands. The directive will also make it easier to flare methane in oil and gas operations on federal land, by triggering the review of a rule the Interior Department finalized in November.\n\nMore immediate actions\n\nOther aspects of the executive order can take effect immediately, though it is unclear how quickly they will translate into greater coal extraction. One section overturns a 2016 White House directive to consider climate change when agencies conduct reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act, a sweeping law that informed any federal decisions that have a significant environmental impact.\n\nAnother provision instructs Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management to lift a freeze on federal coal leasing. That moratorium has been in effect since December 2015.\n\nTom Sanzillo, director of finance for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said in an interview that the move \u201cbecomes a largely politically symbolic measure for right now\u201d because other, lower-carbon sources of energy are out-competing coal. He noted that U.S. coal consumption has declined 27 percent since 2005, from 1.02 billion tons to 739 million tons in 2016, its lowest level in nearly four decades.\n\n(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to reverse the fundamental economic law here,\u201d Sanzillo said. \u201cThere\u2019s no market signal that\u2019s telling them they should be mining more coal.\u201d\n\nStill, regulatory relief could make some coal firms, nearly 50 of which have filed for bankruptcy since 2012, somewhat more economically viable. Some of the sector\u2019s biggest companies \u2014 including Arch Coal, Peabody Energy and Alpha Natural Resources \u2014 are just now emerging from bankruptcy protection.\n\nEthan Zindler, head of U.S. research at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said in an email that solar and wind are competitive with coal in some parts of the country and that natural gas ranks as the lowest-cost source of electricity generation overall. The sector that could suffer the greatest hit from the elimination of the Clean Power Plan is nuclear energy, which provides about a fifth of U.S. businesses\u2019 and households\u2019 power.\n\n\u201cMany of the 100 or so U.S. plants are aging, and approximately a third are economically uncompetitive today,\u201d Zindler said. Without stricter federal emissions limits, he added, \u201cthere may be little to stop the retirement of these plants in coming years and their replacement with a combination of gas/wind/solar.\u201d\n\nNational Rural Electric Cooperative Association CEO Jim Matheson, whose group challenged the Clean Power Plan in federal court, said in an interview that he does not anticipate many of his members will start building new coal-fired plants. But for those who have already invested heavily in keeping their coal plants operating, he said, \u201cIt has given them much greater flexibility to maintain more reasonably-priced and affordable power for our consumers.\u201d\n\nSeparately, Trump has instructed federal officials to abandon the practice of factoring in the impact of climate change \u2014 what is dubbed \u201cthe social cost of carbon\u201d \u2014 in their policymaking decisions. That calculus, which is currently set at $36 per ton of carbon dioxide, aims to capture the negative consequences of allowing greenhouse-gas emissions to continue to rise. But some conservatives have criticized it as too sweeping.\n\nFederal officials will return to the traditional cost-benefit analysis outlined in a 2003 Office of Management and Budget guidance, which appears to put the cost associated with carbon emissions at zero.\n\nAs Trump seeks to scale back federal limits on greenhouse gas emissions, states and cities are likely to take on a larger role in charting the course forward.\n\nAn analysis by the Rhodium Group, an economic consulting firm, found that Trump\u2019s forthcoming executive order would slow the country\u2019s shift away from carbon-emitting sources of energy. It found after Trump\u2019s action, the United States would be 14 percent below its 2005 emissions levels by 2025, compared to 21 percent below that mark had current Obama-era policies remained in place.\n\nAll three West Coast governors and a handful of mayors issued a statement within minutes of the order\u2019s signing, vowing to press ahead with their own policies to cut carbon emissions. In an interview, California Gov. Jerry Brown (D), said his state would fight to maintain strict carbon standards in court, and would participate in U.N. climate talks to help foster further action overseas.\n\n\u201c Gutting the Clean Power Plan is a colossal mistake, and defies science itself,\u201d Brown said. \u201cErasing climate change may take place in Donald Trump\u2019s mind, but nowhere else.\u201d\n\nTim Profeta, who directs Duke University\u2019s Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions, said regulators from more than half-dozen states in the Southeast are now talking about how to chart their own path forward. Having met for nearly three years, the group stopped discussing how to comply with the Clean Power Plan after November\u2019s election, but it is still talking.\n\n\u201cWe are now talking about the evolution of the power sector in an environment of uncertainty,\u201d Profeta said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the beginning of states taking control of their destiny.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/03/28/trump-has-given-fox-news-more-than-5-million-in-free-social-media-advertising/", "text": "We\u2019ve become accustomed to tweets like this from President Trump.\n\nOver the weekend, an enormous amount of energy was spent trying to figure out why Trump tweeted that particular thing. What triggered the proposal? Why did he think this was something his 27 million followers should watch? Was it tied to Fox News Channel host Jeanine Pirro\u2019s subsequent disparagement of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.)?\n\nEventually, Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, dismissed that latter notion. Priebus said the tweet stemmed from the fact that Trump \u201cloves Judge Jeanine and he wanted to do Judge Jeanine a favor.\u201d There you go. Mystery solved.\n\nExcept that our familiarity with Trump\u2019s tweets about what he\u2019s watching on television tends to blind us from the subtext to that explanation. On this occasion, politics weren\u2019t underlying Trump\u2019s tweet, Priebus said. Instead, it\u2019s simply the president of the United States \u2026 trying to promote a commercial program as a favor to a friend.\n\nUh, okay.\n\n\n\nThen-President-elect Trump is interviewed by Chris Wallace of \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d in 2016. (Richard Drew/Associated Press)\n\nAs it turns out, there\u2019s an established valuation to such tweets. As you\u2019re probably aware, there\u2019s a robust economy built on getting celebrities to tweet positive things about products. You see Kim Kardashian posting a photo of some new lipstick on Instagram and you can be pretty confident that the lipstick company paid some go-between to get her to do that.\n\nOne such go-between is a company called Captiv8, which both tracks and builds brand-celebrity advertising deals. The company has even developed estimates of the value to a brand for getting a sponsored social-media item on various platforms for celebrities (or \u201cinfluencers,\u201d which is the term for platform-specific celebrities) with various audience sizes. Someone with follower counts the size of Trump\u2019s for example, could expect the following payments for sponsored posts, according to Captiv8\u2019s Krishna Subramanian.\n\n\u2022 Twitter: $60,000 per tweet\n\n\u2022 Instagram: $150,000 per post\n\n\u2022 Facebook: $187,000 per post\n\nIn other words, that tweet from Trump promoting Pirro\u2019s show was more than a favor to Pirro and her employer, Fox News. It was, essentially, a gift worth $60,000.\n\nWith these metrics in mind, we went back through Trump\u2019s social-media posts since he announced his candidacy to see how often he actively encouraged people to watch or buy particular programs or products. Although the list of those posts that appears at the bottom of this article is probably incomplete, it gives a sense of the value that Trump has provided to news networks.\n\nBy our estimates, Trump has provided Fox and its affiliated networks (Fox News, Fox Business) with more than $5 million in free advertising. In second place is NBC and its affiliate MSNBC, at $2 million \u2014 thanks mostly to a big push for his 2015 \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d appearance.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Trump\u2019s promotion of his media appearances \u2014 by far his most common sort of promotion \u2014 was stacked before and through the Republican primaries. As the general-election campaign kicked into gear, that promotion was largely focused on his Fox News appearances.\n\nCaptiv8\u2019s Subramanian notes that Trump may not have demanded the full $5 million from Fox News \u2014 or anyone else. Celebrities can adjust their rates up or down. \u201cYou can get someone who will take a lower rate to work for a brand that they like more,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthose price points are a pretty good range for where people fall, including the Kardashians.\u201d\n\nAlthough no social-media company connects brands to celebrities to have the celebrities disparage them, Subramanian figured that the hit to a company\u2019s value from a negative post would be damaging, perhaps to the extent that a positive tweet or Facebook post was helpful. In other words, Trump\u2019s 52 tweets about the \u201cfailing @nytimes\u201d could be thought of as the equivalent of $3.1 million in bad publicity.\n\nAll of this should be considered in light of the mutually beneficial relationship Trump enjoys with the media. Last March, the New York Times calculated that Trump had been the beneficiary of the equivalent of about $2 billion in advertising by dint of his ability to generate free media attention to what he was doing. Mind you, that was still eight months before the election, so who knows how it grew.\n\nWith that in mind, the $11 million in free social-media attention he gave to Fox, NBC, CBS, ABC and CNN is a pretty cheap return on investment. Captiv8 could only hope for that kind of return on investment.\n\nThe social-media posts considered for this analysis. We included only direct appeals to watch programs before they aired or clear suggestions that followers do so.\n\nJun. 18, 2015. Tweet about NBC.\n\nJun. 30, 2015. Tweet about Fox.\n\nJul. 20, 2015.

Aides to both said the White House has not reached out since the Republican bill failed. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nIn the wake of the collapse of his first major legislative push on health care, President Trump and his aides have suddenly begun talking about reaching out to skeptical Democrats to breathe new life into his flagging administration.\n\nBut there\u2019s little evidence that any outreach by the administration has occurred \u2014 and many Democrats warn it may already be too late.\n\nThe abrupt talk of bipartisanship comes after two months in which Trump alienated Democrats with personal attacks and polarizing policies, both of which have made the road to cooperation more politically risky for the minority party. And Trump\u2019s halting overtures to moderate Democrats and unions early in the administration have produced little, if anything, in the way of policies or legislation.\n\n\u201cThe president needs to find a new presidency within himself,\u201d Rep. Joseph Crowley (N.Y.), the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said Tuesday. \u201cSuggesting that he\u2019s going to negotiate with us, and simultaneously asking for cuts in the budget that will hurt our constituents tremendously, or cutting funding for \u2018sanctuary cities,\u2019 or going after the undocumented in a way that\u2019s causing unbelievable stress in our communities, is not going to work.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer said Monday that in the days after the Republicans\u2019 health-care bill failed the president and his aides received calls from Democrats offering to work with the administration. But the White House declined to provide details on who called or what the president might do to bring Democrats to the table.\n\nPresident Trump, seen at the White House on March 27, is a dealmaker and open to negotiating with Democrats, some say. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nOne of the few Democrats that Trump talked with on health-care issues was Zeke Emanuel, an architect of President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, who has met with Trump three times since the election. Their last meeting, which came five days before Republicans pulled their health bill from the House floor, was cited by Spicer as evidence of the White House reaching out to Democrats.\n\nBut Emanuel said in an interview that there was no discernible change in the legislation as a result of the meetings. \u201cPrior to the vote on the Republican health-care bill, I had spoken to the president and his staff,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the best of my knowledge, none of my ideas had been incorporated into the bill.\u201d\n\nFor their part, congressional Democrats offer a conditional response to the president\u2019s overtures: We\u2019re willing to work on bipartisan legislation, but we won\u2019t rubber-stamp Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nA Senate Democratic leadership aide said Democrats are open to cooperating with Trump on issues where they might have common cause, such as infrastructure and trade. But, the aide noted that Trump would have to be willing to buck Republican orthodoxy to fulfill some of the more populist promises he made on the campaign trail \u2014 something that so far he has been unwilling to do.\n\nSpeaking on the Senate floor Monday, Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the two sides could work together on health care only if Republicans and the administration stop trying to repeal Obamacare \u2014 something that has been a legislative priority for Republicans since the day Obama signed the ACA into law.\n\nThe sentiment was echoed by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in an interview Monday with NBC News. \u201cWe\u2019re willing to listen,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cWe always want to work with the president, but my message to the president is, \u2018First do no harm.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAides to both Pelosi and Schumer said the White House has not reached out on health care since the Republican bill failed Friday.\n\n(The Washington Post)\n\nIn his first weeks in office, Trump signaled to Democratic members of the Congressional Black Caucus that he might be open to legislation that would allow the government to negotiate prescription drug prices, and he has also held meetings at the White House with union leaders on infrastructure, trade and jobs.\n\nBut none of those discussions has materialized into legislation. Instead, Democrats have been irked by Trump\u2019s decision to push a controversial immigration travel ban targeting Muslim-majority countries, his proposal for sharp cuts in the federal budget and his penchant for criticizing Democratic lawmakers in cutting personal terms.\n\nAnd the decision to proceed with an overhaul of the health-care system through the arcane reconciliation process \u2014 which would not require any Democratic votes for the bill to become law \u2014 might have already sealed his fate on that issue.\n\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s just a notion, because he realizes he can\u2019t get a majority of Republicans,\u201d Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said, referring to the health-care debate. \u201cIt\u2019s not very serious yet. He\u2019d have to come our way on policy, and there\u2019s no sign he wants to do that yet.\u201d\n\nMore broadly, Schatz added: \u201cThere\u2019s no indication that he strays from right-wing orthodoxy. All we\u2019ve learned is that in addition to having unacceptable ideas, he has a political shop that can\u2019t get them done.\u201d\n\nRichard Hohlt, a longtime Republican consultant, said he believes that Trump, a consummate dealmaker who is not particularly ideological, is certainly open to negotiating with Democrats.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s pragmatic and wants to get things done, and there\u2019s two ways to get things done,\u201d Hohlt said. \u201cOne is you reach out to Republicans, one is you reach out to Democrats, or maybe you reach out to both. Every president I\u2019ve worked with since Reagan has always reached out to both. The idea that you only reach out to one party has never been done in the 45 years I\u2019ve been in Washington. Though now things, of course, are more difficult because of polarization.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter on Tuesday, the president reiterated his criticism of the conservative Freedom Caucus, a group of about 30 hard-liners that did not deliver much-needed votes for the Republican health-care bill.\n\nBut even without most of the Freedom Caucus, there probably are not enough moderate Democrats in the House to give Trump a majority he needs to govern. Only 12 Democrats sit in congressional districts that Trump won.\n\nWith the Republicans\u2019 failure to advance their bill on Friday, the Democratic Party has caught a whiff of blood, said Jim Manley, a longtime Democratic strategist who was an aide to former Senate majority leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.).\n\n\u201cDemocrats don\u2019t have anyone to negotiate with right now,\u201d Manley said. \u201cTrump has proven he can\u2019t handle the Republican Congress. . . . Not only are there not strong leaders able to cut any deals within the House, but at 37 percent [job-approval rating], the president is very weak right now.\u201d\n\nMany Democrats also say there is little reason to trust that the president is serious. The White House\u2019s sudden notes of conciliation stand in stark contrast to Trump\u2019s own comments since his election. Trump has routinely disparaged Democrats \u2014 calling Schumer the \u201chead clown\u201d in one tweet \u2014 and began blaming them for the demise of the Republican health plan almost as soon as GOP leaders pulled the bill from the floor.\n\n\u201cI think the losers are Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, because now they own Obamacare,\u201d Trump said on Friday afternoon.\n\nSince his inauguration, Trump has met with Schumer twice and Pelosi once \u2014 at a White House reception for lawmakers in which he aired his bogus claim that more than 3 million undocumented immigrants caused him to lose the popular vote by casting illegal ballots.\n\nDemocrats have long endorsed reforms on prescription drugs, and they say that if infrastructure and tax changes are done in a bipartisan way, they could get on board.\n\n\u201cThere is an opening on infrastructure, but they have to stop this extreme ideological approach to things,\u201d Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s got to be more than tax cuts, because tax cuts don\u2019t build roads in rural America.\u201d\n\nBut before then, more pressing issues loom. Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, \u00adfaces the threat of a filibuster in the Senate, and Trump is likely to face renewed tensions with conservative Republicans in the House on government funding. Both issues underscore the incentives for Trump and his team to successfully build bridges with Democrats.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s team needs to better focus on governing and getting broad based support for the Gorsuch nomination and a continuing resolution to keep the government open \u2014 including support from Senate Democrats in cycle and moderate House Democrats (both of them),\u201d Scott Reed, chief strategist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/rep-devin-nuness-credibility-questioned-as-russia-investigation-goes-on/2017/03/28/fd1afe7a-13d6-11e7-bb16-269934184168_video.html", "text": "- Rep.

The order will instruct federal regulators to rewrite Clean Power Plan rules that curb U.S. carbon emissions, as well as halt other environmental regulations. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nOn Tuesday, a week after the end of the sixth-warmest winter in the continental United States in recorded history, President Trump will announce a series of actions meant to unwind or dramatically halt Barack Obama\u2019s efforts to fight climate change.\n\nWhat does this mean? What will the effects be? Can Trump keep his promises on energy job creation? Allow us to answer those questions in the form of a FAQ.\n\n1. Do scientists believe that humans are causing the climate to warm? Do Americans?\n\nClimate scientists are in near-universal agreement that human activity \u2014 mostly the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil \u2014 are producing gases that remain in the atmosphere. There, they act like a sort of blanket, preventing heat from escaping into space and slowly \u2014 as in, over the course of decades \u2014 making the Earth warmer.\n\nThe main contributor to climate change over time has been burning coal for the production of electricity, which releases carbon dioxide, among other things. Over the past few decades, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased steadily; since the advent of the Industrial Age, it\u2019s increased exponentially.\n\nIn correlation with that, global temperatures have risen higher and higher. The long-term effects of that increase are likely to include higher sea levels (as ice caps melt and water expands), more severe precipitation events and extended droughts.\n\nClimate change became a fraught political subject about 20 years ago, with the landmark climate agreement known as the Kyoto Protocol. President George W. Bush\u2019s decision to step away from the agreement and, a few years later, Al Gore\u2019s documentary film \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth\u201d helped push climate change squarely into the political arena. Over the past decade, the subject has been one of the most partisan in American politics.\n\nOver the past few years, though, views have shifted. Recent polling from Gallup shows that concern about climate change has surged, with Americans accepting that human activity is causing the shift and that the long-term effects of climate change have already begun. Just this week, Gallup reported that half the country now identifies as \u201cconcerned believers\u201d \u2014 people who accept climate science and are worried about addressing it.\n\nPresident Trump is not among that group.\n\n2. What does Trump plan to do?\n\nThe Post\u2019s Juliet Eilperin and Brady Dennis detailed precisely what the Trump plan constitutes.\n\nThere are three main components. First, Trump hopes to dismantle a rule advanced by the Obama administration that would reduce carbon dioxide emissions from coal-burning power plants. The Obama administration also had a rule affecting newly constructed power plants, limiting allowable carbon dioxide levels, but that didn\u2019t affect older plants. What\u2019s more, many older plants still in use were made exempt from key provisions of the 1970 Clean Air Act, under the assumption they would eventually be replaced. In many cases, they weren\u2019t.\n\nSecond, Trump wants to promote fossil fuel extraction, in an effort to make American energy independent and to fulfill a campaign pledge to bolster the coal industry. As part of that effort, Trump will remove a moratorium on coal leasing by the government, allowing federal land to be used for coal mining.\n\nThird, Trump wants to strip consideration of the long-term effects of climate change from routine government decision-making.\n\n3. Can Trump save the coal industry?\n\nTrump can probably tack a few years onto the lifespan of the coal industry, but he almost certainly can\u2019t revive it as a viable economic engine for communities where it was once prominent.\n\nBetween 1985 and 2000, the number of people working in the coal industry in the United States fell from 178,000 to 71,000. There are a lot of reasons for that decline, including the increased use of automation and that extracting coal from the same mine necessarily becomes harder over time, as easily accessible seams are tapped out. From 2000 to 2012 or so, the industry saw a brief resurgence. But then it collapsed, falling from about 90,000 employees to 50,000 or so. (Few of those employees are actually miners, for what it\u2019s worth.)\n\nThe blame for that recent collapse has been placed largely on Obama\u2019s regulatory actions. Charles Murray, a fervently conservative coal mining executive, told the Guardian this week that he considered Obama\u2019s regulatory actions to be \u201cfraudulent\u201d and the Obama administration\u2019s effort to protect waterways from mining an attempt to \u201cdestroy our nation\u2019s underground coalmines and put our nation\u2019s coalminers out of work.\u201d A 2012 study estimated that a fifth of streams in southern West Virginia had been polluted by coal mining; Trump overrode Obama\u2019s protection rule.\n\nBut that said, Murray was also realistic about the fate of the industry. When he spoke with the president at the White House last month, he said he told Trump to \u201ctemper his expectations\u201d about restoring coal jobs. \u201cHe can\u2019t bring them back,\u201d Murray said.\n\nWhy? There\u2019s a hint in another comment Murray made to the Guardian, which was that \u201cwe do not have a climate change or global warming problem, we have an energy cost problem.\u201d There\u2019s another big factor in coal\u2019s recent decline that ties into our next question.\n\n4. Will Trump help the United States become energy independent?\n\nOver the course of his presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly decried the inability of fossil fuel companies to drill on government property. The impression he gave was of a fossil-fuel industry hampered by government to the point of ineffectiveness.\n\nIn fact, the fossil fuel industry thrived under Barack Obama for one simple reason: Improvement in horizontal drilling techniques, which led to the fracking boom and surges in production of oil and natural gas from 2005 on.\n\nThe boom in new natural gas production meant that prices fell dramatically. While extracting natural gas releases the potent greenhouse gas methane into the atmosphere, it burns much more cleanly than coal. That and the cheap price led a number of power producers to transition from burning coal to burning gas in their facilities \u2014 and that hurt the coal industry. In 2015, a third of American energy was produced with coal and a third was produced with natural gas. Twenty years prior, more than half of the electricity production in the United States came from burning coal and only 13 percent from gas. That change, for Charles Murray, would be an energy cost problem.\n\nBut Murray is also worried about another American energy growth industry: wind and solar energy. As of the end of last year, America produces more energy from wind than from the use of hydroelectric dams \u2014 and wind, of course, doesn\u2019t produce any greenhouse gas emissions at all. Wind receives some subsidies from the government, which Trump has criticized in the past (though not when asked about them by an Iowa voter whose husband works in the wind industry). That, too, is an energy cost problem to folks like Charles Murray \u2014 though advocates of renewable energy would be quick to point out that the failure to regulate the release of carbon dioxide for decades was its own sort of economic gift to the coal industry.\n\nThe broader point \u2014 and the answer to the question \u2014 is that the American energy mix is evolving quickly. The fracking boom meant that net petroleum imports to the United States in 2015 made up about a quarter of all consumption, the smallest percentage in nearly half a century. Complete energy independence is unlikely for a number of reasons, but lower fuel prices, increased American production and shifting energy systems make \u201cenergy independence\u201d look somewhat different than it used to.\n\n5. Will Trump\u2019s actions make climate change worse?\n\nThe United States has consistently been the biggest per capita producer of greenhouse gases. We are not, however, the biggest emitter of them overall.\n\nPer capita carbon dioxide emissions in metric tons, 1960-2013\n\nTotal carbon dioxide emissions in millions of kilotons, 1960-2013\n\nData from the World Bank.\n\nFor years, this was a point of argument against the United States taking action to address climate change: It\u2019s a global problem and China pollutes more than we do, so why should we limit ourselves economically when China doesn\u2019t?\n\nIn 2014, Obama announced a landmark agreement with China to do exactly that. Obama also committed the United States to a more sweeping climate agreement, the 2015 Paris Accord \u2014 an agreement from which Trump once said he would withdraw but which isn\u2019t included in his new actions.\n\nGlobally, the trend is clear: movement away from traditional fossil-fuel-burning power plants \u2014 particularly coal-burning ones \u2014 and toward cleaner and renewable sources. That\u2019s also the trend in the United States, for reasons beyond government regulatory actions.\n\nSo, while Trump can unwind Obama\u2019s climate legacy to some extent, the economic and political forces that have spurred those underlying shifts are largely beyond his control. His efforts will likely mean that the United States\u2019 greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 which were lower for much of Obama\u2019s administration largely because of the economic slowdown \u2014 may tick upward. But the good news for that majority of the country worried about the threat of climate change is that Trump mostly can\u2019t touch that broader global trend."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-reverses-texas-ruling-on-death-row-inmates-mental-ability/2017/03/28/c921acca-13bf-11e7-833c-503e1f6394c9_story.html", "text": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday threw out the standards Texas used to decide that a convicted murderer was not intellectually disabled and thus eligible for execution, continuing a trend of the justices narrowing how states can make such determinations.\n\nThe court decided 15 years ago in Atkins v. Virginia that executing what it referred to as the \u201cmentally retarded\u201d violated the Constitution\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. That decision generally left it up to the states to set the standards for such designations.\n\nBut in 2014, the court stuck down Florida\u2019s guidelines as too rigid. And on Tuesday, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that the process Texas uses creates \u201can unacceptable risk that persons with intellectual disability will be executed.\u201d\n\nIn a 5-to-3 decision written by Ginsburg, the court sent back the case of Bobby James Moore, who fatally shot store clerk James McCardle in a botched robbery in 1980. Moore\u2019s decades-long trip through the appeals courts has been marked by conflicting opinions on whether he is intellectually disabled.\n\nTexas\u2019s Court of Criminal Appeals eventually determined that he was not. But the Supreme Court concluded that this decision improperly relied on outdated medical standards, borderline IQ scores and a list of unique-to-Texas factors that Ginsburg termed an \u201cinvention . . . untied to any acknowledged source.\u201d\n\n[High court reviews Texas standards for determining intellectual disability]\n\n\u201cTexas cannot satisfactorily explain why it applies current medical standards for diagnosing intellectual disability in other contexts, yet clings to superseded standards when an individual\u2019s life is at stake,\u201d Ginsburg wrote. She was joined by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.\n\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. dissented from the decision, along with Justice Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr.\n\nRoberts said the majority \u201ccrafts a constitutional holding based solely on what it deems to be medical consensus about intellectual disability. But clinicians, not judges, should determine clinical standards; and judges, not clinicians, should determine the content of the Eighth Amendment,\u201d which forbids cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nMoore\u2019s attorney at the Supreme Court, Washington lawyer Cliff Sloan, said the ruling contained a lesson for states. \u201cThe Supreme Court has made clear that no state may assess intellectual disability in a manner that would allow for the execution of someone who has intellectual disability under current medical standards,\u201d Sloan said in a statement.\n\nIt was the second time this term that the Supreme Court has ruled for a Texas death-row inmate. Last month, the court ruled that Duane Buck\u2019s death sentence was infected by racial prejudice because of testimony that he might pose a future risk because he is black.\n\n[Court says race-based testimony discriminated against black inmate]\n\nIn Moore\u2019s case, Ginsburg said the Texas court followed the \u201caccepted, uncontroversial\u201d process for determining intellectual disability: whether the subject had low IQ test scores, an inability to learn basic skills and adapt behavior to changing circumstances, and whether these deficits began when the person was a minor.\n\nBut she said the Texas court was too rigid in relying on Moore\u2019s IQ results, which were slightly higher than 70, generally considered a dividing line. Scores are imperfect, she said, as the court had found in the 2014 Florida case.\n\n[Supreme Court strikes down Florida law on mentally impaired inmates]\n\nGinsburg noted Moore\u2019s deficiencies \u2014 that at 13 he had trouble understanding the days of the week, that he failed every class before dropping out of school, that he had lived on the streets as a teenager.\n\nThe Texas court had seen Moore\u2019s survival as a test of his adaptive strengths. He played pool for money and mowed lawns. The Texas court and Roberts in his dissent noted that Moore provided the firearms for the robbery, that he wore a disguise and that he fled to Louisiana to escape capture.\n\nAfter a Texas judge, following years of court proceedings, found Moore intellectually disabled, the Court of Criminal Appeals overruled. It said the lower court should have used the 1992 standards contained in a decision it issued on determining such disability, not on current standards.\n\nThe Moore case has drawn attention because of Texas\u2019s use of additional standards to judge a person\u2019s adaptive behavior, another way of saying whether a person can go about daily life as others would.\n\nA Texas judge likened the factors to the \u201cLennie\u201d standard, a reference to Lennie Small, the gentle but deadly fictional farmhand in John Steinbeck\u2019s \u201cOf Mice and Men.\u201d\n\nThe judge wrote that most Texas citizens might agree that Lennie should be exempt from execution because of his lack of reasoning skills but that other killers might not be exempt.\n\nGinsburg did not mention the Lennie standard but said the Texas factors \u201care an outlier, in comparison both to other states\u2019 handling of intellectual-disability pleas and to Texas\u2019 own practices in other contexts.\u201d\n\nRoberts and the dissenters agreed with the majority\u2019s concern about one of the specific factors used by Texas, saying that the adaptive-behavior standards \u201care an unacceptable method of enforcing\u201d the court\u2019s decision in Atkins.\n\nThe case is Moore v.

Ryan told Republican donors Monday that he intends to continue pushing for an overhaul of the nation\u2019s health-care system by working \u201con two tracks\u201d as he also pursues other elements of President Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u201cWe are going to keep getting at this thing,\u201d Ryan said three days after intraparty opposition forced him to pull the American Health Care Act after it became clear it did not have enough Republican votes to pass.\n\nOn an afternoon call with donors to his Team Ryan political organization, he continued: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to just all of a sudden abandon health care and move on to the rest. We are going to move on with rest of our agenda, keep that on track, while we work the health-care problem. . . . It\u2019s just that valuable, that important.\u201d\n\nRyan (R-Wis.) did not disclose details of what the next iteration of health-care reform might look like, but he suggested that a plan was being developed in time to brief the donors at a retreat scheduled for Thursday and Friday in Florida. His remarks indicated that Republicans may be trying to regroup more quickly than Ryan had suggested they would on Friday, when he declared Obamacare \u201cthe law of the land\u201d for the foreseeable future.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re in Florida, I will lay out the path forward on health care and all the rest of the agenda,\u201d Ryan said in the call Monday, according to a recording obtained by The Washington Post. \u201cI will explain how it all still works, and how we\u2019re still moving forward on health care with other ideas and plans. So please make sure that if you can come, you come \u2014 it will be good to look at what can feasibly get done and where things currently stand. But know this: We are not giving up.\u201d\n\n(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nTrump said Friday that he wanted to move on to the rest of his agenda \u2014 tax reform, in particular \u2014 and that he was content to leave the Affordable Care Act in place and let it \u201cexplode.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the Democrats \u2014 when it explodes, which it will soon \u2014 if they got together with us and got a real health-care bill, I\u2019d be totally open to it, and I think that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition, White House press secretary Sean Spicer left the door open at Monday\u2019s briefing to further efforts. \u201cWe\u2019re at the beginning of a process,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen the end of health care.\u201d\n\nRyan did not take questions on the roughly 10-minute call. Zack Roday, a spokesman for the speaker\u2019s political operation, declined to comment. AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for the speaker\u2019s office, said Ryan huddled with Trump at the White House on Monday and also met separately about the coming legislative agenda with Vice President Pence, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say we\u2019re having these conversations,\u201d she said. \u201cWe look forward to talking with our members on Tuesday when we get back.\u201d\n\n[Divisions threaten Trump\u2019s hope of winning his next big legislative battle: Taxes]\n\nThe call Monday came at the most challenging moment of Ryan\u2019s 17-month tenure as speaker: the failure of the American Health Care Act, for which he played the central role in assembling and promoting, throws into doubt the Republican Party\u2019s basic ability to govern even with unified control of the White House and Congress.\n\nSpeaking to the donors Monday, Ryan gave an explanation similar to the one he offered reporters on Friday \u2014 where he said that \u201cmoving from an opposition party to a governing party comes with growing pains.\u201d\n\nBut he was more forthright in seeming to lay the blame on the members of the House Freedom Caucus, the hard-right bloc that was a crucial factor in the health-care bill\u2019s demise.\n\n\u201cBasically . . . 90 percent of our members of the conference were there and ready to go and be a governing party and were happy with where we were, and around 10 percent were still in what I would call \u2018opposition party mode,\u2019 \u201d Ryan said on the call. \u201cAbout 10 percent of our people, a particular bloc, just weren\u2019t there yet, even with the president\u2019s involvement.\u201d\n\nWhile Freedom Caucus members played a central role in opposing the bill, Ryan did not mention a significant group of moderate Republican who also had qualms about the proposal. The Post has counted at least 25 GOP members not considered aligned with the hard right who had announced they were opposing or leaning against the plan.\n\nIn a Sunday interview with ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said he still considered the bill to be \u201cin the negotiation process\u201d and that conservatives and moderates would \u201ccome together, hopefully in the coming days, to find consensus.\u201d\n\nBut it remained unclear how the GOP health-care push could be salvaged. Trump has turned his sights on the hard right, tweeting Sunday that \u201cDemocrats are smiling in D.C. that the Freedom Caucus, with the help of Club For Growth and Heritage, have saved Planned Parenthood & Ocare!\u201d\n\nOne Freedom Caucus member, Rep. Ted Poe (R-Tex.), announced Sunday that he was resigning from the group out of disgust for how it handled the issue, raising the prospect that the group could crack up after foiling Trump and Ryan on a front-burner item.\n\n\u201cI think that there was nothing that could be added to the bill that the Freedom Caucus would ever vote yes on,\u201d Poe told CNN on Monday. \u201cI got the opinion that there\u2019s some members of the Freedom Caucus, they would vote no against the Ten Commandments if they came up for a vote.\u201d\n\nThere was no indication that there would be any further Freedom Caucus defections \u2014 nor evidence that the moderates who abandoned the bill could be wooed back.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a founder and former chairman of the group, said he had no regrets about killing the bill.\n\n\u201cThe lesson here is don\u2019t try to pass a bill that only 17 percent of the country approves of \u2014 that\u2019s a problem,\u201d he on MSNBC Monday. \u201cWhen no one likes the legislation, you have to do it different.\u201d\n\n[With AHCA defeat, some Democrats see chance to push for universal coverage]\n\nGOP House members who returned to Washington on Monday split on whether the bill had any near-term prospects.\n\nRep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) said he had been \u201cslammed\u201d over the weekend by constituents angry that the bill had failed: \u201cWe maybe make a few tweaks and change it, but I still think it\u2019s valid. Bring it up. We worked too hard on this.\u201d\n\nBut Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) said he did not believe the fundamental politics of the issue had changed or that his colleagues could stomach another internecine battle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an open wound right now \u2014 ask the Freedom Caucus,\u201d Collins said. \u201cI\u2019m guessing we\u2019ve all moved on, because it\u2019s not going to do any good to open the wound again.\u201d\n\nRyan acknowledged on the call that he leads a deeply divided conference that is threatening to descend into open infighting. By pulling the bill Friday, Ryan said, he moved to \u201clet a little pressure off the system, let some nerves cool a little bit and then get back talking with each other while we work on this issue and all the other issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cNinety percent of our conference was very, very upset with about 10 percent, and I didn\u2019t want things being done and said that people would regret,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I sent folks home for the weekend to just kind of soak in what had happened, appreciate the situation and start over and get back to work again.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, tensions remained evident. Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.) rose in a closed-door meeting of House Republicans Thursday night to lambaste Meadows and the Freedom Caucus, only to be talked down by colleagues wary of sparking an intraparty shouting match.\n\nBut Scott let loose in a tweet Saturday: \u201cMark Meadows betrayed Trump and America and supported Pelosi and Dems to protect Obamacare.\u201d\n\nAnd then there are the tensions between Ryan and Trump, a fraught relationship dating back to the presidential campaign that was once again cast into doubt Saturday when Trump asked his 27 million Twitter followers to tune in to the Fox News show of Jeanine Pirro \u2014 who proceeded to call for Ryan\u2019s removal as speaker.\n\nIn a Fox News interview Sunday, Priebus said the tweet and Pirro\u2019s call were \u201ccoincidental\u201d and that Trump was \u201chelping out a friend\u201d by promoting Pirro\u2019s show.\n\nRyan did not mention the episode in the call Monday, but he said he had spoken to Trump \u201cfour or five times this weekend . . . and we see it the same way: We\u2019re completely united on how we move forward and where we go from here and how we need this effort moving.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a strange way, this really merged our teams \u2014 our team in the House with the president\u2019s team \u2014 even more closely,\u201d he said at another point in the call. \u201cI think the White House, the president in particular, has a much, much clearer understanding of just the dynamic that we have in the House Republican Conference. And so that, if anything, is very helpful that he really now appreciates the challenges we have of governing and of becoming a governing party.\u201d\n\nPhilip Rucker contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/federal-employees-are-suspicious-of-trumps-new-government-efficiency-initiative/2017/03/27/71b92d0c-1322-11e7-ada0-1489b735b3a3_story.html", "text": "Federal employees and their advocates reacted skeptically Monday to the establishment of a new White House campaign to overhaul the federal bureaucracy using private-sector practices, warning that the approach is too simplistic to have long-lasting effects.\n\nGovernment workers and those who have recently left federal jobs said the new White House Office of American Innovation \u2014 led by Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser \u2014 has a worthwhile mission to make a bureaucracy long known for inefficiency more nimble and less costly.\n\nBut these employees doubt that valuable ideas can come from yet another White House task force with the goal of fixing government. They said they worry this initiative will lean exclusively on the corporate world for ideas rather than inviting experts inside government to share theirs. And these employees suggested that the real aim was to farm out work to private companies, costing taxpayers the same \u2014 or even more \u2014 than keeping it in-house.\n\n[Trump taps Kushner to lead a SWAT team to fix government with business ideas]\n\nThe new office is envisioned as a White House power center staffed with consultants and former business executives who put a particular emphasis on using technology to help transform the government of 2.1 million civilian employees.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I\u2019m hearing is, this is reinventing government version two, or three, or four,\u201d said Bill Valdez, president of the Senior Executives Association and a longtime Energy Department official, referring to similar \u201cSWAT\u201d teams set up by the Clinton, Bush and Obama White Houses to make government operate more like a business.\n\nValdez said he is optimistic that Trump\u2019s \u201creal chops\u201d in business and Kushner\u2019s \u201cenergy\u201d might lead to good ideas, and he wrote a letter to Kushner on Monday \u201coffering the help of the SES as they go about their journey.\u201d\n\nBut Valdez cautioned that the Trump innovators may not realize that government has many rules dating back to the dawn of the civil service in 1883 that will make it harder to bring private-sector practices to government.\n\nFor one thing, political appointees in the government might be surprised if they seek to hire friends or business associates who they consider the best candidates for jobs. \u201cIn general, the rules about nepotism are unfamiliar to people who join the federal government from the private sector, where you can hire whomever you want,\u201d Valdez said.\n\nThe sprawling and troubled veterans\u2019 care system is expected to be among the first targets of the innovation office, which was first disclosed by The Washington Post. That focus alarms some critics of the new office, who fear the recommendation will be a push for more private care outside the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very concerned that this \u2018reimagining\u2019 effort is another name for dismantling VA,\u201d said Marilyn Park, legislative representative on VA issues for the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union.\n\nThe agency still is recovering from a scandal over staff coverups of long patient wait lists for doctors\u2019 appointments and struggling with a backlog of appeals when veterans are denied claims for benefits. President Trump promised during his campaign to give veterans more access to doctors outside the system, a change unions and some veterans groups have denounced as the first step toward privatization.\n\nSome VA employees said they welcome more attention from the White House after years of questions about proper oversight of the decentralized system of hospitals and clinics.\n\n\u201cThe more people looking at VA, the better for the veterans,\u201d said Joseph Colon, a health systems specialist in the office that is in charge of credentials for the medical staff at the VA Caribbean Health Care System in Puerto Rico. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of poor decisions made at the local level.\u201d\n\nOther employees said they don\u2019t trust the administration to steer clear of possible conflicts of interest when engaging private companies to help make government work better.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned this administration may cherry-pick certain government functions that could be personally beneficial to their supporters,\u201d said Steven Lenkart, executive director of the National Federation of Federal Employees, which represents 110,000 blue- and white-collar workers. The union also is concerned that a \u201clopsided focus\u201d on disabling offices that enforce environmental or labor regulations will come out of the office.\n\n\u201cThe excuse will be, it\u2019s for the efficiency of government,\u201d Lenkart said.\n\nAt the Social Security Administration, budget cuts of 10 percent since 2010 and a surge in applications for disability benefits have resulted in a backlog of appeals for hearings when applications are rejected.\n\nWitold Skwierczynski, president of AFGE\u2019s National Council of Social Security field operations locals, said the innovation office might conclude that the appeals backlog \u2014 with an average 550-day wait for a hearing \u2014 could be whittled down if hearings were conducted on the Internet.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do a disability hearing over the Internet,\u201d he said.\n\nTeresa Gerton, who served in the Obama administration as deputy assistant secretary for policy at the Labor Department, overseeing veterans employment and training, said it will be tempting for the new office to replace people with computers to save money.\n\n\u201cThe thinking will be, if we can just automate services, customers will interact with government workers or all you need is a Web portal and you can find a job,\u201d Gerton, now president of the National Academy of Public Administration, said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not true.

(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nJudge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, may fall short of the votes needed for smooth passage in the Senate next week, potentially dashing Republican hopes for an easy victory after the stinging defeat of the American Health Care Act last week.\n\nGorsuch needs 60 votes to clear a procedural hurdle required of high-court confirmations in the Senate, but Republicans, who hold just 52 seats, may not have the votes in a chamber that is divided deeply along partisan lines.\n\nRepublicans do, however, have the votes to choose the \u201cnuclear option\u201d \u2014 to change the rules and allow Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation \u2014 and others after it \u2014 to proceed on a simple majority vote. That would upend a long-standing Senate tradition that forces the governing party to seek bipartisan support.\n\n\u201cI think this is tragic,\u201dsaid Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who added in an interview on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d that he doubts that Gorsuch will be able to get the 60 votes needed to end a filibuster threatened by some Democrats. But he also said Republicans will most certainly choose to end the practice.\n\nWith relations between Democrats and Republicans already strained, the brewing fight over Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation and how it could change the way the Senate does business is likely to make the partisan rancor even more intense in the coming days. While Republicans need at least eight Democrats to join with them to block a filibuster, no Democratic senator has announced plans to back Gorsuch.\n\n(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\n[Rulings offer glimpse into what kind of justice Gorsuch would be]\n\nGorsuch, 49, has been on the Denver-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit for the past decade. Trump nominated him to fill the seat made vacant when Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016. Republicans say that Gorsuch will be confirmed despite Democratic opposition \u2014 a threat that suggests they are prepared to make the change allowing a simple majority vote.\n\nA final vote on Gorsuch is still more than a week away. On Monday, the Judiciary Committee delayed a vote on Gorsuch for one week at the request of Democrats. Republican leaders are hoping to confirm him by April 7, when a two-week congressional recess is scheduled to begin, so that Gorsuch can join the court by late April for the final cases of its term that ends in June.\n\nDemocrats have called that timetable rushed, noting that since the 1980s it has taken 29 days on average between the start of a Supreme Court confirmation hearing and a final confirmation vote.\n\nCoons\u2019s prediction came after consultations with senators in both parties about brokering a deal that would lead to Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation without upending current Senate traditions, according to multiple senators and aides familiar with his negotiations.\n\nThe hope was to find a bipartisan group of rank-and-file senators who could negotiate a deal that would again steer the Senate away from partisan brinkmanship on federal court vacancies. A group of 14 senators from both parties warded off a similar impasse in 2005 \u2014 but just three members of that \u201cGang of 14\u201d remain in office. And Coons signaled Monday that he has found little appetite for a new agreement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of senators concerned about where we\u2019re headed,\u201d he told MSNBC. \u201cThere\u2019s Republicans still very mad at us over the 2013 change to the filibuster rule. We\u2019re mad at them for shutting down the government, they\u2019re mad at us for Gorsuch, and we\u2019re not headed in a good direction.\u201d\n\nDemocrats used the nuclear option in 2013 to change how the Senate confirms executive-branch nominees and lower-level federal judges, against the strong objections of Republicans.\n\n[No bipartisan \u2018gang\u2019 to save the Senate this time on Supreme Court fight]\n\nFour years later, Democrats are finding there is little upside to cooperating with Trump and Republicans. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) last week announced plans to filibuster Gorsuch. Others including Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Al Franken (D-Minn.) and Tom Udall (D-N.M.) followed suit. No Democrat has announced support for Gorsuch, and some moderates say they are still mulling a final decision.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) said he is planning to meet with Gorsuch again before deciding. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) said in a statement that she is \u201cin the process of reviewing\u201d the nomination and will not make a final decision for several days. Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) had no comment about his plans when asked on Monday. Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) also said that he had not decided but added that he would not be splitting his votes by voting to end a filibuster but then voting against Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation. \u201cMy cloture vote and vote for him will be the same,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nThe White House and Senate Republicans are hoping that a multimillion-dollar ad campaign bankrolled by conservative legal groups can help put pressure on Manchin, Heitkamp, Donnelly and seven other Democrats facing reelection next year in states that Trump won in November. Two of those 10 Democrats \u2014 Sens. Robert P. Casey Jr. (Pa.) and Bill Nelson (Fla.) \u2014 have said in recent days that they will vote against Gorsuch.\n\nIf the pressure campaign doesn\u2019t work, GOP aides privately hope that senior Democrats can prevail upon colleagues to at least help break a filibuster to preserve Senate tradition. White House press secretary Sean Spicer cited comments by Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), who has served on the Judiciary Committee since 1979 and told the Vermont political website VTDigger over the weekend that while he is opposed to Gorsuch, \u201cI am not inclined to filibuster.\u201d\n\nMany Democrats know that supporting Gorsuch would cost them support back home.\n\nAt a town hall meeting Sunday afternoon in Rhode Island, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) was welcomed with a standing ovation for his role in the Gorsuch hearings as a member of the judiciary panel.\n\nThe senator said Gorsuch had failed to win over any Democrats with evasive answers on issues such as campaign finance and gerrymandering. One constituent, holding a sign showing her support for Merrick Garland \u2014 President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, who was blocked by Republicans last year \u2014 asked whether Republicans would really blow up the filibuster to get Gorsuch through.\n\n\u201cThey can, but by all rights, 60 votes ought to be the standard,\u201d Whitehouse said. \u201cWhen he doesn\u2019t get 60 votes, that\u2019s going to give Mitch McConnell a tough choice. He\u2019ll have to either change the candidate or change the rules. And it\u2019s not going to be easy for him to change the rules, because a lot of people in his caucus will push back. We have to have the vote, show this guy can\u2019t get 60, and see where it goes from there. In the crucible of the Senate, sometimes good things can emerge.\u201d\n\nOver a few rounds of questions, Whitehouse raised the possibility that Gorsuch would be blocked and Republicans would start over with a more moderate nominee. In a short interview after the speech, Whitehouse said he was confident that more than 40 Democrats would hang together. \u201cIf four, or five, or two, or no Democrats want to support him, the result is the same \u2014 not 60,\u201d Whitehouse said. \u201cThis is a problem [Republicans] should have seen when they picked a nominee off of a list from special-interest groups.\u201d\n\nAsked about the possibility that the filibuster would be \u201cnuked,\u201d ripping it away from Democrats in future fights, Whitehouse chuckled. \u201cTo my mind, there\u2019s no reason to lose a fight in order to save yourself for a later fight,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just face the same fight later, plus you\u2019ve already lost.\u201d\n\nSen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said Monday: \u201cThe R\u2019s are going to do what the R\u2019s are going to do. I\u2019m going to make my decision based on the merits. What we learned in the Garland case is that they\u2019re going to do whatever they want to do. The way I look at it is that the Supreme Court is the only office that requires a 60-vote threshold.

Larry Hogan (R) has vowed to veto \u2014 \u201cmakes the state of Maryland more at risk for violence and crime.\u201d\n\nSessions appeared at the daily White House news briefing to warn that the Justice Department will begin using federal law to prevent any \u201csanctuary cities\u201d from receiving much coveted federal grants for state and local law enforcement.\n\nIn response to a question about the alleged rape of a 14-year-old Rockville High School student by two undocumented immigrants also enrolled at the school, Sessions specifically cited the Maryland Law Enforcement and Trust Act, which passed the House of Delegates last week and is awaiting Senate action.\n\n\u201cWell, you know, Maryland is talking about a state law, to make the state a sanctuary state,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cThe governor is opposed to that, I\u2019m glad to hear.\u201d\n\n[Attorney General Jeff Sessions repeats Trump threat that \u2018sanctuary cities\u2019 could lose Justice Department grants]\n\n(Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cThat would be such a mistake,\u201d he said of the bill. \u201cI would plead with the people of Maryland to understand that this makes the state of Maryland more at risk for violence and crime, that it\u2019s not good policy.\u201d\n\nDel. Kathleen M. Dumais (D-Montgomery), who is a co-sponsor of the legislation and defended it during floor debates, said the measure does not prevent corrections officers or local law enforcement from cooperating with federal agents when undocumented immigrants have committed serious crimes.\n\n\u201cBefore criticizing proposed legislation, I suggest that Attorney General Sessions take time to actually read the bill,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Trust Act certainly does not make Maryland more at risk for crime and violence. Anyone who commits a crime or violence in Maryland should be and is prosecuted to the full extent of the law, regardless of immigration status.\u201d\n\nThe Trust Act is similar in many respects to uncodified policies for handling illegal immigrants in place in Montgomery County and other Maryland suburbs.\n\nIt would bar the use of local or state resources to assist in enforcement of federal immigration law. It would also prohibit most Maryland jurisdictions from holding undocumented prisoners for 48 hours past their release date, something federal authorities sometimes request in the form of a detainer \u2014 although the prohibition would not apply if federal agents have a warrant or court order describing probable cause.\n\nMontgomery officials have long contended that such an approach, which was recommended by a 2014 Maryland state attorney general\u2019s opinion, does not put the county in the same \u201csanctuary\u201d category as localities like San Francisco that have far more stringent rules about collaboration.\n\nThe proposed state legislation would allow the two Maryland counties that participate in a special federal program to use local police to help with immigration enforcement \u2014 Frederick and Harford counties \u2014 to continue to do so. It also bars establishment of a state registry for Muslims.\n\nJosh Hicks contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/senate-panel-plans-to-interview-trump-son-in-law-kushner-in-russia-probe/2017/03/27/84fe10ae-12f9-11e7-ada0-1489b735b3a3_story.html", "text": "The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee acknowledged Monday that he had made a secret visit to the White House last week to view intelligence files he then cited as proof of potentially improper spying activity against President Trump, casting new doubt on the independence of a congressional investigation into Russian election interference.\n\nThe admission by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) triggered calls among Democrats for his removal as chairman of the House panel and bipartisan appeals for an independent probe of Kremlin meddling in the 2016 election and potential connections between Russia and Trump associates.\n\nThe committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), called late Monday for Nunes to \u201crecuse himself from any further involvement in the Russia investigation\u201d and all \u201coversight matters pertaining to any incidental collection of the Trump transition,\u201d noting Nunes was a member of Trump\u2019s transition team.\n\nNunes has denied any wrongdoing and dismissed calls for him to step down Monday night, saying on Fox News that \u201cI\u2019m sure that the Democrats do want me to quit because they know that I\u2019m effective at getting to the bottom of things.\u201d\n\nThe development coincided with the disclosure that Trump\u2019s son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, had privately met in December with the chief executive of a Russian bank being targeted by U.S. sanctions and that Kushner has agreed to discuss such contacts with the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\n(Reuters)\n\nTrump administration officials sought to play down the significance of both developments, describing Kushner\u2019s contacts as inconsequential and refusing to answer questions about the Nunes visit. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into who he met with or why he met with them,\u201d White House press secretary Sean Spicer said.\n\nTrump, in his response, sought to pressure the House committee, arguing that the panel should be probing Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s ties to Russia instead of those of his campaign advisers.\n\nIn a pair of evening tweets, Trump wrote that the \u201cTrump Russia story is a hoax\u201d and listed a string of financial and other connections the Clintons have had over the years with Russia. He asked why the House Intelligence Committee is not investigating the former president and former secretary of state.\n\nNunes\u2019s meeting with a source and his review of intelligence material apparently occurred in a secure space for handling classified files within the Eisenhower Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House. Nunes returned to the White House the next day \u2014 bypassing colleagues on the House committee \u2014 supposedly to brief Trump on what he had learned.\n\nThe attempts to keep such matters hidden from public view, however, added to the perception that the Trump administration has failed to be forthcoming about contacts with Russia and is working with allies on Capitol Hill to blunt congressional probes.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s top Democrat said that House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) should remove Nunes to salvage that chamber\u2019s investigation of Moscow influence. \u201cIf Speaker Ryan wants the House to have a credible investigation, he needs to replace Chairman Nunes,\u201d Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said.\n\nSchiff said: \u201cThere was no legitimate justification for bringing that information to the White House instead of the committee. That it was also obtained at the White House makes this departure all the more concerning.\u201d\n\n(Reuters)\n\nAsked about Nunes\u2019s White House visit, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said, \u201cNot good. It\u2019s not a confidence builder.\u201d He said \u201cwe\u2019re rapidly getting\u201d to the point where a select committee or independent commission is needed to conduct the investigation into Russian meddling.\n\nNunes said in an interview Monday that no one in the Republican leadership had asked him to step aside, and he defended his actions as part of an attempt to investigate potential misconduct by U.S. spy agencies against Trump associates.\n\n\u201cEverybody is worried by process and they should be worried about what I\u2019ve actually said about what I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Nunes said, when asked whether it was proper for him to visit the White House under those circumstances. \u201cWhy all the worry about where I saw information? We go to the White House all the time, our job is providing oversight of the executive branch.\u201d\n\nNunes had previously refused to say how or where he had seen classified files he cited in a hastily arranged news conference last week, saying that he had obtained troubling evidence that U.S. spy agencies \u201cincidentally collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition.\u201d\n\nAt a time when the White House was struggling to defend Trump\u2019s baseless accusation that he had been wiretapped under orders issued by then-President Barack Obama, the Nunes assertion helped shift public attention and, to some, cast Trump as a victim of espionage abuse.\n\nIn reality, Nunes appeared to be referring to legitimate intelligence operations against foreign individuals who were either in contact with Trump associates or mentioned them in conversations that were monitored as part of routine U.S. surveillance. Nunes reiterated Monday that he has seen no evidence of illegality.\n\nCurrent and former national security officials described Nunes\u2019s trip to the White House complex, apparently late in the evening after he had slipped away from his staff, as highly unusual. Doing so would ordinarily require Nunes and the person he met with to have been cleared in advance and accompanied by an escort \u2014 requirements that seemed to undercut White House claims to have no information about the encounter.\n\n\u201cHow in\u00adcred\u00adibly irregular,\u201d said Matt Olsen, who served in the Obama administration as the head of the National Counterterrorism Center and the general counsel at the National Security Agency. \u201cThe only explanation you\u2019re left with is that this is all being orchestrated by the White House.\u201d\n\nNunes again declined to disclose with whom he met, citing the need \u201cto protect people who bring information to the committee, and I\u2019m going to protect my source.\u201d His office said he met the source on the White House grounds.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee is authorized to handle classified information and routinely meets with officials \u2014 including whistleblowers \u2014 from U.S. spy agencies.\n\nNunes spokesman Jack Langer said that because of limitations on House computer systems, Nunes could not have used secure facilities at the Capitol to review the files. He added that \u201cthe White House grounds was the best location to safeguard the proper chain of custody and classification of these documents.\u201d\n\nNunes has said that the documents include references to Trump advisers and associates but do not pertain to Russia. In the past few days, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former campaign advisers Carter Page and Roger Stone volunteered to make themselves available for interviews with the Senate and House Intelligence committees.\n\nOn Monday, officials from the White House and Senate said that Kushner had also offered himself for an interview with the Senate Intelligence Committee, at a date yet to be determined. The development was first reported by the New York Times.\n\nA senior congressional official said Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) spoke with the White House counsel \u201csome weeks ago\u201d to warn that the panel would be seeking to speak with administration officials, including Kushner. The White House indicated to the committee over the weekend that Kushner would be willing to participate.\n\nThe White House had previously disclosed that Kushner met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak at Trump Tower in December, a session also attended by former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was fired for lying about the nature of his contacts with Kislyak.\n\nOn Monday, the White House acknowledged a previously undisclosed meeting between Kushner and Sergey N. Gorkov, chief of Russian government-owned Vnesheconombank. The bank, which handles Russia\u2019s pension funds and deals with development activity for the state, including foreign debts and investments, has been under U.S. sanctions since July 2014, in response to Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine.\n\nThe bank also has been tied to Russian intelligence services.\n\nIn early 2015, one of the bank\u2019s New York-based employees, Evgeny Buryakov, was arrested and accused of being an unregistered spy for Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service, working with two Russian diplomats who were also secretly acting as spies. According to the U.S. government, they collected information about U.S. sanctions against Russia, and American efforts to develop alternative energy resources.\n\nBuryakov pleaded guilty in March 2016 to conspiring to act as an agent of a foreign government, though he never admitted to being an employee of Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service.\n\nSpicer defended Kushner\u2019s meetings, saying that he was the \u201cofficial primary point of contact\u201d with foreign governments and officials during the campaign and transition period.\n\nRobert Costa and Devlin Barrett contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/an-incomplete-history-of-the-filibuster/2017/03/27/7017e096-1337-11e7-bb16-269934184168_video.html", "text": "- Filibustering has been around for more than a century as a last-ditch obstruction tool for senators to stop or delay legislation.

(Julio Cortez/AP)\n\nOne of President Trump\u2019s metrics to demonstrate just how successful he was in the 2016 election is to note how many counties he won. His official biography on the White House website, for example, self-consciously states that Trump \u201cwon the election on November 8 of 2016 in the largest electoral college landslide for a Republican in 28 years\u201d \u2014 a period that includes two successful Republican candidacies, including George W. Bush\u2019s in 2000 \u2014 and that he \u201cwon over 2,600 counties nationwide, the most since President Reagan in 1984.\u201d Only then does he mention that he won more than 62 million votes, excluding the fact that his opponent won nearly 66 million.\n\nIf you can\u2019t see the problem with that data point about counties, allow me to present another example.\n\nFor the New York Post, Salena Zito explains why she thinks that Trump doesn\u2019t need to worry about his low approval ratings \u2014 ratings that hit 36 percent over the weekend, according to Gallup, and are now lower than Barack Obama ever registered in his eight years in office.\n\nWhy should Trump ignore those approval ratings? \u201cBecause in American politics, geography is everything,\u201d Zito writes.\n\nLive in an urban, minority or college setting, and Donald J. Trump is underwater in the polls in a big way; he gets a frosty 29 percent approval rating in the cities, 35 percent approval in the urban suburbs, in the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal survey.\n\nBut, live in the second ring of suburbs outside the cities, or the exurbs or the third and fourth rings that comprise rural America, and the president gets a 53 percent to 59 percent job approval rating in the same poll.\n\nThis is bad advice.\n\nIt is clearly true that Trump is more popular in rural areas. This isn\u2019t a new development; it was true during the election, too. According to exit polling, he won 61 percent of the vote in rural areas to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 34 percent. In urban areas, Clinton prevailed 60 percent to 34 percent.\n\nBut here\u2019s a secret about urban and rural areas: More people live in urban areas, which is why they are urban. Last November, twice as many voters lived in urban areas as rural areas.\n\nWe can look at this another way.\n\nThe correlation between a county\u2019s election results and the percentage of the population in that county that lives in a rural area looks like this.\n\nLooking at this, someone noticing the clear correlation between rural percentage and support for Trump might offer the advice that those areas are significant from an electoral standpoint.\n\nIf we weight those results by the number of votes in each county, though, the picture shifts dramatically.\n\nWe can flip that scale: The percentage of a county\u2019s population that lives in an urban area is a good guide to how it voted in 2016. (In fact, the density of the urban population was a better predictor of the election results than the percentage that lives in a rural area.)\n\nThe point to all of this being: There are a lot of counties that don\u2019t have a lot of people, and a few counties that have a ton. Recommending that a national politician worry about lots of counties instead of lots of voters is not good advice.\n\nWhere Zito is closer to the mark is in considering suburban and exurban areas. About half the voters in 2016 lived in areas they defined as suburban, with Trump leading among them 49 percent to 45 percent. The Census Bureau doesn\u2019t define suburban areas, as such. It does define an urban cluster, which is a lower-density urban area, generally encompassing small towns. (The voting patterns in those places are less correlated to population.) Most of the larger suburban areas you might think of are considered urban for the purposes of the census. It\u2019s not clear how or whether the suburban areas in the NBC-Wall Street Journal poll overlap with the exit poll boundaries.\n\nOh, incidentally? That NBC-Journal poll was conducted more than a month ago, well before Trump\u2019s recent slide. How he\u2019s faring with those suburban and exurban voters now isn\u2019t addressed in Zito\u2019s piece.\n\nRegardless, there\u2019s a bigger point worth making. Relying on counties to validate claims of broad support has another flaw in terms of Trump: He lost the popular vote. It was about 78,000 votes in three states that handed Trump the White House while he lost nationally by nearly 3 million. This is hardly the sort of thing that should inspire someone to assume that he\u2019s doing very fine electorally.\n\nIf Trump\u2019s goal is simply to be viewed positively by someone, sure, he\u2019s doing fine. If his goal is to be viewed positively by a majority of Americans or to be confident of reelection, assuring him that it\u2019s enough to rely on relatively positive ratings from exurban and rural voters is, at best, a disservice.\n\nEspecially given that even among Republicans and independents, Trump\u2019s approval rating slipped 5 and 9 points, respectively, according to Gallup. Even if Trump held 100 percent approval in rural America, that trend is legitimately something to worry about."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-debating-limits-on-where-patent-suits-can-be-filed/2017/03/27/6cf5c19a-1322-11e7-833c-503e1f6394c9_story.html", "text": "If your company is being sued for patent infringement, there\u2019s an awfully good chance you\u2019ll need to get familiar with Marshall, Tex., population around 25,000.\n\nThe Eastern District of Texas is where a stunning number of patent cases are born \u2014 nearly 45 percent of the nation\u2019s total, according to an amicus brief filed at the Supreme Court.\n\nOne U.S. district judge, Rodney Gilstrap, who presides over the federal courthouse in Marshall, received about one-quarter of all the patent cases initiated between 2014 to 2016 \u2014 more than were assigned to all federal judges in California, New York and Florida combined, according to Mark A.

Breyer, adding \u201cI don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s good, bad, or indifferent.\u201d\n\nJames W. Dabney, a New York lawyer representing a company called TC Heartland, said, right or wrong, it was contrary to a Supreme Court ruling that is 60 years old. He contends that a patent suit must be filed in the place where the alleged infringer is headquartered or where it has a regular and established place of business.\n\nInstead, the Indiana-based Heartland was sued in Delaware, the district with the second highest number of patent suits, about 10 percent. Kraft Heinz alleges that Heartland\u2019s liquid water enhancers infringe on Kraft\u2019s MiO.\n\nCompanies like to sue in places such as East Texas and Delaware, because those courts are seen as \u201cpatent-friendly,\u201d with rules on speed, discovery and dismissal of claims that favor patent-holders. Critics say they also encourage costly litigation and settlements.\n\nKraft\u2019s lawyer at the Supreme Court, William M. Jay, told the court that Congress is looking at the situation. But if there\u2019s a problem, he said, it is not one that should be settled with his company\u2019s case.\n\nThe justices acknowledged that their case from 1957 seemed definitive. The problem is that Congress has altered the law about legal venues twice since then, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has basically rewritten the rules from what the Supreme Court set.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan noted the unusual nature of the case. Usually when the Supreme Court rules, \u201cwe can be pretty confident that Congress is acting against the backdrop of that decision,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think that that would be an odd thing to say in this case, given that for 30 years the Federal Circuit has been ignoring our decision and the law has effectively been otherwise.\u201d\n\nUnder the Federal Circuit rules, patent lawsuits can be filed wherever a company has even minimal sales of its products. Heartland, for instance, shipped a relatively small portion of its water enhancer for sale in Delaware, but two lower courts ruled that was enough to keep the case there, rather than transferred to Indiana.\n\nDabney told the court there was no reason to adhere to the Federal Circuit\u2019s ruling. \u201cThis court has again and again and again stood up for its authority to declare what the law is,\u201d he said.\n\nThe case is TC Heartland v.

Last week, they were celebrating Trump\u2019s reaching 37 percent, a low for his presidency that was already lower than the lowest Obama ever got. After Trump recovered somewhat, another plunge: Gallup now estimates he\u2019s at 36 percent.\n\nWhen that 37 percent figure came out, we urged caution, because we are boring scolds. But also because we pointed out that these daily figures (which are actually running three-day averages) were volatile and because of whom Gallup polls. We suggested, instead, that you consider the weekly average from Gallup, which gives a better sense of the long-term trend.\n\n1 of 91 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 See what President Trump has been doing since taking office View Photos The beginning of his term has featured controversial executive orders and frequent conflicts with the media.

Sure, he\u2019s now seen a daily low that suggests he\u2019s pretty unpopular. But last week he hit a new low as well of 39 percent \u2014 after all the volatility is smoothed out. That\u2019s lower than Obama ever saw during any single week.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, we pointed out last week that the results of approval polling varied depending on whether you were looking at likely voters. Gallup, which compiles approval ratings of all Americans, consistently had lower approval ratings than other pollsters because Trump\u2019s base of support tends to be more likely to vote (to Hillary Clinton\u2019s eternal consternation).\n\nThe running average compiled by Huffington Post Pollster, though, shows Trump slipping lower among multiple pollsters. If we compare Gallup\u2019s results with those from the two pollsters with whom he\u2019s consistently performed the best \u2014 Rasmussen Reports (which polls likely voters) and Politico-Morning Consult (which uses registered voters) \u2014 even the numbers from those two pollsters have declined. His most recent rating from Rasmussen compiled by Pollster is the same as the high registered by Gallup. The trend, though, is that Gallup polls (all Americans) have had low, flat approval, and Rasmussen/Politico have seen higher-but-dropping approval.\n\nBy looking at weekly numbers, we can also get a better sense of who\u2019s souring on Trump. Below, the week-by-week approval ratings from a number of demographic groups, including Republicans and four groups that saw the biggest approval declines.\n\nA drop of five percentage points among Republicans isn\u2019t ideal, but it\u2019s not that huge a deal. A drop of nine points among independents, though, is a loss of more than one-fifth of Trump\u2019s support from that group over the last two months. That\u2019s a brutal decline that may start to make Republicans nervous about how he could affect their electoral prospects over the long-term. Among those who identify as independents ideologically (as opposed to their partisan identification), the drop was 11 points, a loss of nearly a third of all support from that group since Jan. 20.\n\nOther groups saw less-steep but still-important drops, like those Republicans. White voters have dropped under 50 percent support as has support from regular churchgoers. Those without a college degree \u2014 a bastion of Trump support \u2014 have dropped from 48 percent to 42 percent.\n\nThat\u2019s the actual bad news for Trump, not a momentary fluctuation in a volatile poll number. Approval ratings don\u2019t mean a thing except in terms of the extent to which Trump can demonstrate desire to do what he wants in the White House. Trump\u2019s claim to a mandate was already historically weak, given the extent to which he lost the popular vote. But since then, his support has eroded, among the regular-voting constituencies at the core of Republican politics and among the independents needed to shore up any party\u2019s electoral position.\n\nIf Trump\u2019s goal is to encourage Republicans to stand with him in the wake of the health-care disaster, it\u2019s the weekly poll from Gallup and the trend from Rasmussen and Politico that will be most likely to discourage them from doing so."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/03/27/trumps-idea-to-run-the-government-like-a-business-is-an-old-one-in-american-politics/", "text": "Jared Kushner is President Donald Trump's son-in-law but he's also one of his key confidants.

That was Ross Perot, who used the \u201clike a business\u201d idea in nearly every campaign appearance.

The term appeared and then faded a few times, but surged in the 1980s under President Ronald Reagan.\n\nIn 1981, after Reagan took office, candidates for executive office rolled out the line of argument. John Brown, former Kentucky governor, promised that his state could be run like a business. Kathy Whitmire, the first woman to lead the city of Houston, described her administration as \u201crepresent[ing] the idea that Houston can be managed like a business.\u201d\n\nBut, again, this didn\u2019t start in the Reagan era. In 1978, Fob James ran for governor of Alabama on the same promise. In 1961, New York governor Nelson Rockefeller declared that big government was \u201chere to stay\u201d \u2014 but that the state needed to run more like a big business.\n\n\n\n(New York Times)\n\nWe can rewind further. In 1909, a man named Franklin MacVeagh was appointed secretary of the treasury by President William Taft. And guess what MacVeagh promised.\n\n(New York Times)\n\nHow did he do? Public debt continued to trend downward during Taft\u2019s administration, before spiking, thanks to World War I.\n\nTwo years prior to MacVeagh, the New York Times praised the government of Galveston, Tex. \u2014 the \u201ccity of the new idea\u201d \u2014 for running \u201clike a large business establishment\u201d that was \u201cno longer the loafing place for idlers and politicians.\u201d\n\n(New York Times)\n\nOf course, it\u2019s easy to rethink your city government after it has been obliterated by a hurricane.\n\nBut that contrast \u2014 streamlined business versus wasteful politics \u2014 has been the point of the comparison since its inception, exaggerating both the inefficiency of government and the efficiency of business. (Trump, for example, has not always operated his own businesses with unfailing efficiency and effectiveness.) Government has never been able to fully adopt the brutal efficiencies of business because government isn\u2019t a business \u2014 the desired outcome isn\u2019t profitability \u2014 and government can\u2019t be brutal, since saving money by, say, not paying for Medicare would make for some effective campaign ads by opponents in an election year.\n\nWhich isn\u2019t to say (1) that government can\u2019t be made more effective and (2) that Trump\u2019s team can\u2019t be the one to do it. It\u2019s just to say that it\u2019s been tried before."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trumps-transition-who-is-jared-kushner/2016/11/17/6a624872-acf2-11e6-8f19-21a1c65d2043_video.html", "text": "- Jared Kushner is President Donald Trump's son-in-law but he's also one of his key confidants.

Now the White House is defending his own frequent outings. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post)\n\nInvariably, whenever we look at how much time President Trump spends at the golf courses that bear his name, we incur one of two responses \u2014 or both.\n\n1. The president is entitled to time off.\n\n2. Why shouldn\u2019t he go to properties that bear his name?\n\nTo which the appropriate responses are: (1) He is. However! and (2) For at least one very good reason.\n\nOr, to go into a bit more detail:\n\nCan\u2019t the president take time off?\n\nSure! The president, like anyone else, is entitled to some down time. And, of course, the president \u2014 unlike anyone else \u2014 never really gets any. He\u2019s always on duty, always available as needed.\n\nWhen we point out that Trump is playing a lot of golf (as we did on Sunday), the point isn\u2019t that he should only be either sitting at a desk making presidential decisions or asleep. The point is that Trump himself, piggy-backing on the anti-Barack-Obama Republican rhetoric of the past eight years, repeatedly insisted that \u2014 unlike Obama \u2014 he wasn\u2019t going to spend time playing golf if he was elected president.\n\nOne example:\n\nWATCH: Trump last year: If I'm POTUS I don't think I'd see any of my golf courses again, I just want to stay in WH and \"work in my ass off\" pic.twitter.com/4nOtG7BavO \u2014 Yashar (@yashar) March 27, 2017\n\nAnother:\n\n@BarackObama played golf yesterday.

Trump has likely played once every 5.5.\n\nBut we don\u2019t really know that, because the Trump White House is unusually coy about when he is or isn\u2019t playing golf. He\u2019s made at least a dozen visits to Trump-branded golf courses (and other Trump properties) since he became president, but we only know for sure that he played golf on some of those occasions.\n\nThe White House press office has only confirmed that Trump has played golf on a few occasions, preferring \u2014 as press secretary Sean Spicer did last week \u2014 to imply that Trump was instead holding important meetings. On Sunday, Trump spent only a brief period of time at his club in Sterling, Va. \u2014 not enough to play a full round. Usually he\u2019s at his golf clubs and unaccounted for for hours, more than enough time to play 18 holes. (The smart money is on Spicer noting during an upcoming press briefing that Trump visited his club this weekend without playing golf.)\n\nHow sensitive are the White House and its allies about Trump\u2019s golfing? It apparently bears a news update from the Trump-friendly Fox News when Trump doesn\u2019t head to his club in Florida for the weekend.\n\nNews Alert: @POTUS spending weekend working at the White House. pic.twitter.com/kAtZVQE2Mr \u2014 Fox News (@FoxNews) March 26, 2017\n\nMind you, this wasn\u2019t true: He almost certainly played golf on Saturday, given social media posts showing him puttering around the course on a golf cart.\n\nWe can here apply the parent-of-a-small-child test to Trump\u2019s golfing. If the White House thinks it\u2019s no big deal for the president to play golf, why is it so eager to minimize his doing so?\n\nWhy shouldn\u2019t the president go to Trump-branded properties?\n\nThe chart above shows the regularity with which Trump heads to Trump-branded properties \u2014 doing so about once every three days over the course of his presidency.\n\nWhy\u2019s that worth noting? In part because it\u2019s the president using his office to tacitly (if not explicitly) promote his personal business. Trump repeatedly promised a clean break from his personal businesses once he got to the White House, but documents show that he still benefits from the Trump Organization financially. As The Post\u2019s Rosalind Helderman and Drew Harwell wrote last month, \u201che retains ownership of the business and will personally benefit if the business profits from decisions made by his government.\u201d\n\nEven when he doesn\u2019t directly receive payment, he is still reinforcing a symbiotic relationship with his private brand. Last week, the government approved Trump\u2019s continued ownership of the Trump hotel that sits a few blocks from the White House, because he wouldn\u2019t receive money from it directly while in office. (The Trump Organization leases the building from the government, with the stipulation that no elected official can benefit from it.) Trump critics point out that the property still benefits from its relationship with the president \u2014 who has visited the property several times since being elected president, effectively helping to promote the property that his business still operates.\n\nThen there\u2019s the question of how much government money is spent on Trump properties. We\u2019ve looked at this before, estimating that each trip to Mar-a-Lago in Florida costs the government some $2 million. While most of that cost is spent on transportation, the amount that is paid to the Trump Organization isn\u2019t clear. There are reports that the Secret Service and the Department of Defense sought space in Trump Tower, where they would be paying Midtown Manhattan rental costs to the Trump Organization.\n\nPut another way, it\u2019s not less problematic that he\u2019s going to his own properties, it\u2019s more problematic \u2014 at least in terms of concerns about potential conflicts of interest. There\u2019s also a prohibition in Article II of the Constitution, setting the president\u2019s salary for a term and stating that \u201che shall not receive within that period any other emolument\u201d \u2014 payment \u2014 \u201cfrom the United States, or any of them.\u201d\n\nIn this hyper-partisan age, we are constantly reminded that prohibitions and priorities are far more subjective than we may have thought, allowing someone to, say, rail against a president who plays golf for recreation and then, later, to play golf nearly every weekend of his own presidency. It is also clear that, despite partisan protestations, there is a reason to point out such hypocrisies as well as potential (or obvious) conflicts of interest.\n\nIn the future, at least, complaints about the media doing so can be redirected to this article, saving everyone arguing about this issue some modicum of time."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/03/27/how-do-americans-feel-about-single-payer-health-care-its-complicated/", "text": "\n\nKaren Vermilya waits to enter the \u201cOur First Stand: Save Health Care\u201d rally at Macomb Community College in Warren, Mich., in January. (Rachel Woolf/Getty Images)\n\nIn the wake of the collapse of the Republican health-care proposal on Friday, there was an instantaneous effort by the progressive left to pick up the fumble and return it for a touchdown. As The Washington Post\u2019s Dave Weigel reported, some Democrats quickly saw the failure as an opportunity to advance a long-held objective: a national, single-payer, health-care system matching those in countries such as Canada and Britain.\n\nThat effort was bolstered by tweets like this one, from progressive filmmaker Michael Moore.\n\nWe now have to begin the final fight for free universal health care for all. Remember this poll: the majority AGREE! https://t.co/8z1Ha1vl7R \u2014 Michael Moore (@MMFlint) March 25, 2017\n\n\u201cRemember this poll,\u201d he tweeted, \u201cthe majority AGREE!\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not that simple.\n\nMoore links to an article from The Post published in May, as the Democratic nominating contest was wrapping up. That article looked at polling from Gallup that presented respondents with a series of nonexclusive options for how the American health-care system might move forward: federally centralized health care, a repeal of the Affordable Care Act (i.e., Obamacare) or keeping Obamacare as the system.\n\nOf those three, federally funded health care \u2014 that is, single-payer \u2014 was the most popular, with 58 percent support.\n\nAs is usually the case, members of the two parties were widely split on the choices. Single-payer emerged as the most popular in part because Republicans disliked it less than keeping Obamacare in place. (Fifty-five percent of Republicans opposed single-payer.)\n\nAt a town hall meeting in Vermont on Saturday, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) announced plans to introduce legislation pushing for single-payer. Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), who plans to introduce similar legislation in the House, was realistic about such an effort\u2019s chances, saying that \u201cin this Congress, we won\u2019t pass it, but I think we have to do keep the goal out there.\u201d Given the results above and Republican control of Congress, Welch is clearly right.\n\nBut of recent polling on single-payer, Gallup\u2019s results were the most generous.\n\nA few months earlier, CBS News had asked about the idea (thanks mostly to Sanders having raised it during his campaign). Democrats, particularly Democrats who\u2019d voted in or planned to vote in the party\u2019s primaries, supported the idea of single-payer. Republicans broadly did not, and independents were, at best, split.\n\nIn CBS\u2019s polling, under 50 percent of respondents approved of the idea. It\u2019s worth noting, though, that the numbers had improved very slightly from when CBS asked in 2014. Then, the split was 43 to 50 against. Last year, the split was 44 to 47.\n\nA more recent poll, conducted by the Associated Press and the NORC Center, offered much less favorable views of the issue. Asked if they support a single-payer system, 38 percent of respondents said they did \u2014 again with a big partisan split. But in this case, only 51 percent of Democrats favored the proposal.\n\nThose results dropped dramatically when respondents were asked if they supported single-payer \u201cif it would result in large increases in government spending.\u201d At that point, only a quarter of respondents supported the idea \u2014 including a little over a third of Democrats.\n\nOne problem with polling on single-payer, and one reason that the results above vary so widely, is that the idea itself isn\u2019t complicated but the ramifications may be. That point about costs, for example, resulted in a big shift in responses \u2014 and it\u2019s an argument that would certainly be made by the legislation\u2019s opponents. (Analysis of Sanders\u2019s single-payer plan last year found that the senator from Vermont had likely underestimated the expense his proposal would incur.) That Gallup poll didn\u2019t introduce the idea that costs might increase substantially.\n\nOf course, none of these polls discussed the possible benefits for the system, either. Such details matter. While Republicans broadly support repealing Obamacare, support from the party for the specific proposal Republicans were hoping to pass last week was under 50 percent. Reports about the likely effects of the legislation clearly influenced members of the party (and nearly everyone else) against it.\n\nThere aren\u2019t a lot of things that are universally agreed upon in American politics (infrastructure spending being one exception). A single-payer proposal certainly isn\u2019t. The hope for Sanders and others on the left probably isn\u2019t be that poll Moore cited but the one from CBS showing a small, slow change, which is the point Welch was making. To continue the analogy with which we started: Recovering the fumble itself might be progress, even if you can\u2019t score right away."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trump-turns-to-tax-reform-after-health-care-defeat/2017/03/27/df2287fc-12f1-11e7-bb16-269934184168_video.html", "text": "- After Republicans withdrew their health-care plan on March 24, President Trump announced he would shift focus to tax reform. \"We will probably start going very very strongly for the big tax cuts and tax reform, that'll be next,\" he said.

Bannon helped finance an alternative media ecosystem that amplified Trump\u2019s populist themes during last year\u2019s campaign.\n\nThe Mercers\u2019 attendance at the two-day Heartland conference offered a telling sign of the low-profile family\u2019s priorities: With Trump in office, the influential financiers appear intent on putting muscle behind the fight to roll back environmental regulations, a central focus of the new administration.\n\nOn Thursday, the father and daughter joined Heartland Institute President Joseph Bast at his table for the keynote luncheon speech, held in a ballroom of the Grand Hyatt Hotel. They listened intently as Patrick J. Michaels, director of the Cato Institute\u2019s Center for the Study of Science, argued that the Obama administration erred in finding that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health.\n\nThe Mercers\u2019 presence indicates that the wealthy family is continuing to support the work of the Heartland Institute \u2014 a group that embraces views that have long been considered outlier positions by the scientific community, but that are ascendant in Trump\u2019s Washington.\n\nHedge fund executive Robert Mercer speaks on the phone during a climate change conference hosted by The Heartland Institute in Washington this week. (Oliver Contreras for The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cMany of the people who are now prominent in the Trump administration attended our conferences, even spoke at our conferences, read our publications,\u201d Bast said in an interview. \u201cI think we\u2019re seeing the fruit of a decade of hard work on this issue.\u201d\n\n[The Mercers and Stephen Bannon: How a populist power base was funded and built]\n\nHalf a dozen Trump transition officials and administration advisers attended the gathering, including Myron Ebell, director of energy and global warming policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, who headed Trump\u2019s EPA transition team.\n\nEbell, who has regularly challenged various aspects of the scientific consensus that humans are driving the warming of the planet, received Heartland\u2019s \u201cSpeaks Truth to Power Award.\u201d\n\nDuring a session Friday titled \u201cResetting Climate Policy\u201d that the Mercers attended, Ebell thanked \u201cthe people in this room and people like you around the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the people who have worked persistently against global warming alarmism that made this election result possible,\u201d he added.\n\nBut exactly where the Mercers stand on climate change \u2014 and the scope of their environmental agenda \u2014 remains a mystery.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen approached by a Washington Post reporter at the event, Rebekah Mercer declined to be interviewed.\n\nThe Heartland Institute has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the Mercer family\u2019s foundation, which gave the group more than $5 million between 2008 and 2015, according to tax filings. But the size of the Mercers\u2019 contributions dropped sharply in recent years, from $885,000 in 2014 to $100,000 in 2015.\n\nHeartland officials declined to comment on the Mercers\u2019 support, saying they do not discuss their donors.\n\nDuring the same two-year period, the Mercer foundation contributed $500,000 to Berkeley Earth, a nonprofit research organization whose founder, Richard Muller, is a physicist and onetime climate change skeptic who declared in 2012 that his research shows that humans are indeed driving global warming.\n\nBerkeley Earth set out in 2010 to reanalyze the highly influential surface temperature data kept by scientific institutions such as NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \u2014 data that document considerable global warming and have come under fire from climate change doubters. The ultimate Berkeley Earth analysis, however, largely vindicated the original temperature records, reporting that concerns raised by doubters \u201cdid not unduly bias the record.\u201d\n\nIn an interview Friday, Muller said that Robert Mercer contacted him after Muller gave a speech about big data and climate science at Renaissance Technologies, Mercer\u2019s hedge fund.\n\n\u201cHe has been very supportive of our work and never once did he indicate to us that he had a hope for outcomes in what we did,\u201d Muller said. He added that Berkeley Earth continues to receive funding from Mercer, whom he described as \u201cvery open.\u201d\n\nThe Mercers appeared deeply immersed in the arguments showcased at the Heartland conference. They attended half a dozen panels over two days, including one billed as a discussion of how climate science shows that \u201cnature, not human activity, is the chief driver of changes to the earth\u2019s climate.\u201d Before Thursday\u2019s keynote speech, Rebekah Mercer, wearing her signature diamond-studded glasses, chatted animatedly with Bast, while her famously taciturn father sat next to her, quietly eating his salad.\n\nThe Heartland Institute has been challenging various aspects of the scientific consensus on human causation of global warming for years through gatherings such as last week\u2019s International Conference on Climate Change . The group also helps organize the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change, which offers a contrary view to the leading authority on climate change, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nIn 2012, Heartland paid for a Chicago billboard that read, \u201cI still believe in Global Warming. Do you?\u201d alongside a picture of Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, triggering major backlash and criticism.\n\nBast, the group\u2019s president, said at the time that the billboard was intended \u201cto be an experiment,\u201d noting that it got people\u2019s attention.\n\nKenneth Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said Heartland \u201chas a long history of promoting \u2018alternative facts\u2019 about climate change as well as crank climate denialist theories that are far out of the mainstream scientific consensus.\u201d\n\nKimmell said the fact that key Trump administration officials are embracing some of their theories is alarming.\n\n\u201cIt is distressing to see us going backwards on basic climate science,\u201d he said.\n\n[As Trump administration grants approval for Keystone XL pipeline, an old fight is reignited]\n\nIn a statement, Bast called the union \u201cone of the environmental advocacy groups most responsible for politicizing climate science. I\u2019m not at all surprised that they disapprove of an open objective debate over the causes and consequences of climate change.\u201d\n\nSeveral organizations that have received funding from the Mercer foundation helped sponsor the Heartland conference, including the Media Research Center, the Heritage Foundation and the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise, a small group based in Bellevue, Wash., whose vice president once vowed to \u201cdestroy environmentalists by taking their money and their members.\u201d\n\nThe gathering drew about 300 people to the Grand Hyatt, whose corridors buzzed with chatter about carbon levels and \u201cfake\u201d climate science. A man marketing the film \u201cClimate Hustle\u201d bore a sign that read, \u201cHello, My Name is Al Gore.\u201d\n\nThe overarching theme of the two-day gathering: that fossil fuels and elevated levels of carbon dioxide actually benefit human health, the environment and regional stability.\n\nIn a session titled \u201cFossil Fuels and World Peace,\u201d speakers said that fossil fuels and climate change could help boost food production. Craig Idso, chairman of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, said that without fossil fuels, the world risks \u201cchaos and mass starvation.\u201d\n\nClimate research, however, suggests many possible risks to crops, such as wheat and corn, as a result of warming and associated consequences such as drought in some regions.\n\nIdso did not deny climate change, but embraced it. \u201cIt will be next to impossible to meet the challenge of feeding Earth\u2019s population without a rise in the Earth\u2019s temperature,\u201d he said. \u201cCO2 is not a pollutant. It is the very elixir of life.\u201d\n\nThroughout the conference, speakers repeatedly accused climate change scientists of manipulating their studies to produce results supporting their theories.\n\nRep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.), chairman of the House science committee, who issued a subpoena to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientists over a study finding that there had been no slowdown or pause in global warming, told the group that it\u2019s time for \u201cgood science, rather than politically correct science.\u201d\n\nSteven Milloy, publisher of JunkScience.com, said the government has \u201cperverted science.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no science going on in NOAA or NASA or EPA,\u201d said Milloy, who served on the Trump EPA transition team, to chuckles and applause. \u201cThere is no such thing as climate science.\u201d\n\nEbell warned attendees that getting their agenda through will not be easy, swiping at Secretary of State Rex Tillerson as \u201cpart of the swamp\u201d that likes to attend international climate meetings. And he noted that Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, reportedly support the United States remaining in the Paris climate accord.\n\nHe urged those in the room to press for several top priorities: making a 31 percent budget cut to the EPA, overturning the agency\u2019s finding that carbon dioxide endangers public health and withdrawing from the Paris climate accord, an issue on which the administration has not yet adopted an official policy.\n\n\u201cYou add all these up,\u201d he said, \u201cand it changes the entire direction of the country.\u201d\n\nBrady Dennis and Steven Mufson contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/watch-pac-runs-thank-you-ads-for-vote-that-never-happened/2017/03/27/3285fea2-12ce-11e7-bb16-269934184168_video.html", "text": "- Conservative PAC American Action Network released a series of ads thanking members of Congress for voting to replace the Affordable Care Act with the American Health Care Act, which did not occur.

Viewed internally as a SWAT team of strategic consultants, the office will be staffed by former business executives and is designed to infuse fresh thinking into Washington, float above the daily political grind and create a lasting legacy for a president still searching for signature achievements.\n\n\u201cAll Americans, regardless of their political views, can recognize that government stagnation has hindered our ability to properly function, often creating widespread congestion and leading to cost overruns and delays,\u201d Trump said in a statement to The Washington Post. \u201cI promised the American people I would produce results, and apply my \u2018ahead of schedule, under budget\u2019 mentality to the government.\u201d\n\nIn a White House riven at times by disorder and competing factions, the innovation office represents an expansion of Kushner\u2019s already far-reaching influence. The 36-year-old former real estate and media executive will continue to wear many hats, driving foreign and domestic policy as well as decisions on presidential personnel. He also is a shadow diplomat, serving as Trump\u2019s lead adviser on relations with China, Mexico, Canada and the Middle East.\n\n[Jared Kushner proves to be a shadow diplomat on U.S.-Mexico talks]\n\nJared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law, center, arrives for a Feb. 15 event at the White House with wife, Ivanka, left, and Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, right. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThe work of White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon has drawn considerable attention, especially after his call for the \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state.\u201d But Bannon will have no formal role in the innovation office, which Trump advisers described as an incubator of sleek transformation as opposed to deconstruction.\n\nThe announcement of the new office comes at a humbling moment for the president, following Friday\u2019s collapse of his first major legislative push \u2014 an overhaul of the health-care system, which Trump had championed as a candidate.\n\nKushner is positioning the new office as \u201can offensive team\u201d \u2014 an aggressive, nonideological ideas factory capable of attracting top talent from both inside and outside of government, and serving as a conduit with the business, philanthropic and academic communities.\n\n\u201cWe should have excellence in government,\u201d Kushner said Sunday in an interview in his West Wing office. \u201cThe government should be run like a great American company. Our hope is that we can achieve successes and efficiencies for our customers, who are the citizens.\u201d\n\nThe innovation office has a particular focus on technology and data, and it is working with such titans as Apple chief executive Tim Cook, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff and Tesla founder and chief executive Elon Musk. The group has already hosted sessions with more than 100 such leaders and government officials.\n\n\u201cThere is a need to figure out what policies are adding friction to the system without accompanying it with significant benefits,\u201d said Stephen A. Schwarzman, chief executive of the investment firm Blackstone Group. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for the private sector to at least see where the friction is, and to do that very quickly and succinctly.\u201d\n\nSome of the executives involved have criticized some of Trump\u2019s policies, such as his travel ban, but said they are eager to help the administration address chronic problems.\n\n1 of 94 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 See what President Trump has been doing since taking office View Photos The beginning of his term has featured controversial executive orders and frequent conflicts with the media.

We don\u2019t agree on everything,\u201d said Benioff, a Silicon Valley billionaire who raised money for Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign.\n\nBut, Benioff added, \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that Jared will be collaborative with our industry in moving this forward. When I talk to him, he does remind me of a lot of the young, scrappy entrepreneurs that I invest in in their 30s.\u201d\n\nKushner\u2019s ambitions for what the new office can achieve are grand. At least to start, the team plans to focus its attention on reimagining Veterans Affairs; modernizing the technology and data infrastructure of every federal department and agency; remodeling workforce-training programs; and developing \u201ctransformative projects\u201d under the banner of Trump\u2019s $1 trillion infrastructure plan, such as providing broadband Internet service to every American.\n\nIn some cases, the office could direct that government functions be privatized, or that existing contracts be awarded to new bidders.\n\nThe office will also focus on combating opioid abuse, a regular emphasis for Trump on the campaign trail. The president later this week plans to announce an official drug commission devoted to the problem that will be chaired by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R). He has been working informally on the issue for several weeks with Kushner, despite reported tension between the two.\n\nUnder President Barack Obama, Trump advisers said scornfully, some business leaders privately dismissed their White House interactions as \u201cNATO\u201d meetings \u2014 \u201cNo action, talk only\u201d \u2014 in which they were \u201clectured,\u201d without much follow-up.\n\nAndrew Liveris, chairman and chief executive of Dow Chemical, who has had meetings with the two previous administrations, said the environment under Trump is markedly different.\n\nAfter he left a recent meeting of manufacturing chief executives with Trump, Liveris said, \u201cRather than entering a vacuum, I\u2019m getting emails from the president\u2019s team, if not every day, then every other day \u2014 \u2018Here\u2019s what we\u2019re working on.\u2019 \u2018We need another meeting.\u2019 \u2018Can you get us more input on this?\u2019 \u201d\n\n[Inside Trump\u2019s fury: The president rages at leaks, setbacks and accusations]\n\nKushner proudly notes that most of the members of his team have little-to-no political experience, hailing instead from the world of business. They include Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council; Chris Liddell, assistant to the president for strategic initiatives; Reed Cordish, assistant to the president for intergovernmental and technology initiatives; Dina Powell, senior counselor to the president for economic initiatives and deputy national security adviser; and Andrew Bremberg, director of the Domestic Policy Council.\n\nIvanka Trump, the president\u2019s elder daughter and Kushner\u2019s wife, who now does her advocacy work from a West Wing office, will collaborate with the innovation office on issues such as workforce development but will not have an official role, aides said.\n\nPowell, a former Goldman Sachs executive who spent a decade at the firm managing public-private job creation programs, also boasts a government pedigree as a veteran of George W. Bush\u2019s White House and State Department. Bremberg also worked in the Bush administration. But others are political neophytes.\n\nLiddell, who speaks with an accent from his native New Zealand, served as chief financial officer for General Motors, Microsoft and International Paper, as well as in Hollywood for William Morris Endeavor.\n\n\u201cWe are part of the White House team, connected with everyone here, but we are not subject to the day-to-day issues, so we can take a more strategic approach to projects,\u201d Liddell said.\n\nLike Kushner, Cordish is the scion of a real estate family \u2014 a Baltimore-based conglomerate known for developing casinos and shopping malls. And Cohn, a Democrat who has recently amassed significant clout in the White House, is the hard-charging former president of Goldman Sachs.\n\nTrump\u2019s White House is closely scrutinized for its always-evolving power matrix, and the innovation office represents a victory for Wall Street figures such as Cohn who have sought to moderate Trump\u2019s agenda and project a friendly front to businesses, sometimes in conflict with the more hard-line conservatism championed by Bannon and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus.\n\n[Inside Trump\u2019s White House, New York moderates spark infighting and suspicion]\n\nThe innovation group has been meeting twice a week in Kushner\u2019s office, just a few feet from the Oval Office, largely barren but for a black-and-white photo of his paternal grandparents \u2014 both Holocaust survivors \u2014 and a marked-up whiteboard more typical of tech start-ups. Kushner takes projects and decisions directly to the president for sign-off, though Trump also directly suggests areas of personal interest.\n\nThere could be friction as the group interacts with myriad federal agencies, though the advisers said they did not see themselves as an imperious force dictating changes but rather as a \u201cservice organization\u201d offering solutions.\n\nKushner\u2019s team is being formalized just as the Trump administration is proposing sweeping budget cuts across many departments, and members said they would help find efficiencies.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s doing what is necessary to have a prudent budget, and that makes an office like this even more vital as we need to get more out of less dollars by doing things smarter, doing things better, and by leaning on the private sector,\u201d Cordish said.\n\nGinni Rometty, the chairman and chief executive of IBM, said she is encouraged: \u201cJared is reaching out and listening to leaders from across the business community \u2014 not just on day-to-day issues, but on long-term challenges like how to train a modern workforce and how to apply the latest innovations to government operations.\u201d\n\nTrump sees the innovation office as a way to institutionalize what he sometimes did in business, such as helping New York City\u2019s government renovate the floundering Wollman Rink in Central Park, said Hope Hicks, the president\u2019s longtime spokeswoman.\n\n\u201cHe recognized where the government has struggled with certain projects and he was someone in the private sector who was able to come in and bring the resources and creativity needed and ultimately execute in an efficient, cost-effective, way,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cIn some respects, this is an extension of some of the highlights of the president\u2019s career.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/trump-shifts-blame-for-health-care-collapse-to-far-right/2017/03/26/de1a6d6c-1237-11e7-833c-503e1f6394c9_story.html", "text": "Rep.

Ted Poe (R-Tex.), resigned from the group and took a swipe at its opposition to the Trump-backed health-care bill.\n\n\u201cSaying no is easy; leading is hard,\u201d he said.\n\n(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nThe rising tensions followed a flurry of finger-pointing after Friday\u2019s decision by Trump and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) to pull the health-care measure, effectively ending for now the GOP\u2019s years-long quest to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement.\n\nNot long ago, many Republican leaders, even as they were wary of Trump\u2019s background and style, had considered his presidency a chance to unify the party around passing a long-sought policy agenda.\n\nBut now, in the health-care bill\u2019s raw aftermath, Republican leaders are learning that the Trump presidency is doing little, if anything, to heal their party.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been here before,\u201d said Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), the co-chairman of the centrist Tuesday Group. \u201cThe only difference is now we have a Republican president, and some people thought the fever might break a little bit. But apparently not.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s attack Sunday had the look of a coordinated effort.\n\nHis tweet appeared at 8:21 a.m. as official Washington prepared to tune into Sunday news shows: \u201cDemocrats are smiling in D.C. that the Freedom Caucus, with the help of Club For Growth and Heritage, have saved Planned Parenthood & Ocare!\u201d\n\nLess than an hour later, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus appeared on television to echo his boss\u2019s sentiments, saying his missive hit \u201cthe bull\u2019s eye.\u201d\n\nAs if to rub salt in the GOP\u2019s wound, Priebus hinted that Trump may simply start looking past the Republican majority and try forging more consensus with moderate Democrats in future legislative battles. Priebus pointed to the Freedom Caucus and the Tuesday Group for heavily resisting the health-care bill.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be chasing the perfect all the time,\u201d Priebus said during an appearance on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cI mean, sometimes you have to take the good and put it in your pocket and take the win.\u201d\n\nAlthough Trump targeted conservative opponents of the bill Sunday, he has also shown signs of frustration with its moderate critics. On NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Dent acknowledged that Trump told him in a private meeting that he was \u201cdestroying the Republican Party\u201d and that he \u201cwas going to take down tax reform,\u201d as first reported by the New York Times magazine.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet came a day after a strange episode that prompted speculation that he was seeking to undermine Ryan\u2019s standing.\n\nTrump encouraged his Twitter followers Saturday to watch Jeanine Pirro, one of his favorite Fox News Channel hosts, that night.\n\nOn her program, Pirro said that Ryan should resign as speaker, adding that despite his \u201cswagger and experience,\u201d he presided over a failed effort that allowed \u201cour president in his first 100 days to come out of the box like that.\u201d\n\nPriebus, in his Sunday appearance, dismissed the episode as a coincidence, and Trump has said in recent days that he has a good relationship with Ryan.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t blame Paul Ryan,\u201d Priebus said on Fox News. \u201cIn fact, he thought Paul Ryan worked really hard. He enjoys his relationship with Paul Ryan, thinks that Paul Ryan is a great speaker of the House.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, the episode served to highlight the challenges ahead for Ryan in attempting to regain control over the House GOP and maintain a working rapport with the White House.\n\nDoug Heye, a GOP strategist and former congressional aide, said Republicans\u2019 inability to forge consensus on health care shook the party to the core.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see where we can be successful, and it leads to a lot of questions as to whether Republicans can govern, even with a Republican in the White House,\u201d he said.\n\nWhite House budget director Mick Mulvaney, a Republican former congressman who helped found the Freedom Caucus, was at a loss Sunday to explain why so many of those members were not prepared to vote for the health-care bill.\n\nSpeaking on \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Mulvaney said that conservatives were not the only ones to blame, saying, \u201cIt was a bizarre combination of who was against this bill, some folks in the Freedom Caucus and then moderates on the other end of our spectrum.\u201d\n\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who heads the Freedom Caucus, responded to the tweet without any animosity toward the president.\n\n\u201cI mean, if [Democrats are] applauding, they shouldn\u2019t, because I can tell you that conversations over the last 48 hours are really about how we come together in the Republican Conference and try to get this over the finish line,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week with George Stephanopoulos.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for the Freedom Caucus did not comment on Trump\u2019s tweet or Poe\u2019s departure. It was unclear whether Trump\u2019s statement had a direct effect on Poe\u2019s decision to leave the caucus.\n\nThe tweet directed at the Freedom Caucus was \u201ca reminder that nothing goes without notice,\u201d said one Trump associate with direct knowledge of White House strategy.\n\nThe Trump associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak for the White House, said that Trump was disappointed in Meadows and others in the caucus and wanted to remind them that he can use his powers to make their lives more difficult if they are not with him in the future.\n\nThe Club for Growth and Heritage Action for America, which is an affiliate of the Heritage Foundation, a longtime conservative think tank, are known for staking out positions that are often at odds with those of GOP leaders.\n\nHeritage Action on Sunday defended the House Freedom Caucus\u2019s decision not to support the health-care legislation while striking a conciliatory tone with the president.\n\nThe bill \u201chad no natural constituency and was widely criticized by conservative health-care experts because it left premium-increasing provisions of Obamacare in place,\u201d said Dan Holler, a spokesman for Heritage Action. \u201cWe now have the opportunity to reset the debate, and conservatives are eager to work with the administration and congressional leadership as things move forward.\u201d\n\nThe Club for Growth did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe House GOP bill would have repealed and replaced key parts of the Affordable Care Act. It came under consistent criticism from both ends of the political spectrum. Ryan and Trump pulled the bill Friday afternoon after deciding it could not pass \u2014 after weeks of negotiations with conservative and centrist Republican members of the sizable GOP House majority.\n\nAlthough Ryan\u2019s job doesn\u2019t appear to be in jeopardy, his ability to shepherd the rest of the Republican agenda through his chamber is in doubt.\n\nSome Freedom Caucus members are wary of efforts that would add to the federal deficit. But in a sign that Meadows may be willing to compromise on tax reform, he said that tax cuts don\u2019t necessarily have to be paired with spending cuts or revenue increases.\n\n\u201cDoes it have to be fully offset? My personal response is no,\u201d he said on ABC.\n\nSince Friday, Trump aides have been talking increasingly about reaching out to moderate Democrats for help not only on another health-care bill but also on other priorities. But prospects for such cooperation remain difficult.\n\nThere has been virtually no outreach to Democrats about a tax package. Although Democrats like the idea of infrastructure spending, the parties have different visions of how it should be paid for.\n\n\u201cIf he aims a proposal aimed at the middle class and the poor people . . . we could work with them. But I don\u2019t think they\u2019re headed in that direction, and they\u2019re going repeat the same mistake\u201d they made with the health-care bill, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) predicted of tax reform on \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nAides and advisers to Trump say it\u2019s clear that he will need support from some Democrats, particularly in the Senate, to move parts of his agenda forward beyond tax reform.\n\nMichael Steel, who was a senior aide to then-Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), said Trump is at a crossroads as he takes up tax reform.\n\n\u201cThe president is going to have a choice: to reach out to moderate Democrats and work in a bipartisan fashion; or to reach out to recalcitrant Republicans in his own party that he wasn\u2019t able to get this time,\u201d Steel said.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/health-care-win-has-democrats--and-their-voters--wanting-more/2017/03/26/8a2e4142-1237-11e7-833c-503e1f6394c9_story.html", "text": "About 400 constituents showed up at a town hall meeting Sunday in Rhode Island with Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, Sen. Jack Reed and Rep. James Langevin. (Stan Godlewski/For The Washington Post)\n\nAt their first town meeting since the Republicans\u2019 surprise surrender on the Affordable Care Act, progressives in blue America celebrated \u2014 then asked for more. Rhode Island\u2019s two Democratic senators, joined by Rep. Jim Langevin, told several hundred happy constituents that the next step in health reform had to mean expanded coverage, provided by the government.\n\n\u201cWe have to look harder at a single-payer system,\u201d said Langevin (D-R.I.), using a term for universal coverage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m old enough to have voted for a single-payer system in the House,\u201d said Sen. Jack Reed, Rhode Island\u2019s senior senator.\n\n\u201cThe very best market-based solution is to have a public option,\u201d Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said.\n\nProgressives, emboldened by Republicans\u2019 health-care failure, are trying to shift the political debate even further to the left, toward a long-standing goal that Democrats told them was unrealistic. They see in President Trump a less ideological Republican who has also promised universal coverage, and they see a base of Trump voters who might very well embrace the idea.\n\n(Reuters)\n\nThe weekend after the implosion of the GOP\u2019s American Health Care Act brought that into the open. In several TV interviews, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) promised to reintroduce a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d bill when the Senate returns to work. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) held a town hall in her San Francisco district where she happily egged on protesters demanding a plan like Sanders\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI supported single payer since before you were born,\u201d said Pelosi, who has argued since the passage of the Affordable Care Act that it could be a bridge to European-style universal coverage. (The House passed a bill with the \u201cpublic option\u201d jargon to describe a Medicare-style national plan that could work as a competitor against private insurers.)\n\nIn the glow of victory, Democrats spent the weekend thanking activists who showed up at Republican town halls, worked congressional phone lines and made the AHCA politically untenable for many Republicans \u2014 especially moderates. Activists also had succeeded in getting most Senate Democrats on the record against Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch.\n\n[Who is to blame for the failure of the health-care overhaul? The finger-pointing begins.]\n\nIn Rhode Island, where Democrats hold every major office, activists have been pushing the local party to the left. Sanders won the state\u2019s 2016 primary, and the Working Families Party, which endorsed him, has held weekly organizing meetings to find targets for activists. Gov. Gina Raimondo (D-R.I.), a former venture capitalist, has pitched a version of the free public college tuition plan Sanders ran on. Whitehouse, who emerged in the Gorsuch hearings as a key critic, was even protested after he\u2019d voted for several Trump Cabinet nominees.\n\n\u201cThat was key,\u201d said David Segal, a former Rhode Island legislator and executive director of the progressive group Demand Progress. \u201cFifteen hundred people showed up to demand that a senator who\u2019s generally seen as progressive be more progressive.\u201d\n\nBut health care was the issue with the most apparent running room for the left. Since January, Democrats and activists had held events that promoted the Affordable Care Act \u2014 which for the first six years since its passage had been a loser in polls \u2014 by presenting people who\u2019d been helped by the law. In the three weeks that the American Health Care Act was debated in public, even some conservative allies of the president argued that it had become politically impossible to scale back health coverage.\n\nSen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) listens to questions from the audience during a town hall Sunday in Coventry, R.I. (Stan Godlewski/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe victory of a Republican candidate who promised \u201cinsurance for everybody,\u201d and who once favored universal insurance, made some Democrats ask if an idea once dismissed as socialism might have some bipartisan openings in the post-ideological era of Trump.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump staked out the high moral ground by calling for a feasible system of universal healthcare to replace Obamacare,\u201d wrote Newsmax publisher Christopher Ruddy, a Trump friend, 11 days before AHCA crashed to earth. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t retreat from that no matter how much the establishment GOP dislikes it.\u201d\n\nIn response, elected Democrats have felt freer to make health-care demands, despite controlling no branch of government. The windup often suggests that Republicans are right, and that the health-care system must be tweaked.\n\n\u201cWe have ideas, they have ideas, to try to improve Obamacare,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a Sunday interview with ABC News. \u201cWe never said it was perfect. We always said we\u2019d work with them to improve it.\u201d\n\nOn the details, Democrats now argue that Trump should move to the left. Asked where Democrats might work with the president to fix health care, Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) suggested \u201cexpanding Medicaid in states that haven\u2019t expanded it yet\u201d \u2014 anathema to Republicans and conservative groups that fought against it. (Medicaid expansion is optional-only because of the 2012 National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius decision, which was argued by conservatives and struck down small parts of the ACA.) Sanders, who couldn\u2019t get all of his colleagues in the Democratic caucus to endorse a prescription drugs importation bill, said he believes that this Republican president might.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump said a whole lot of stuff on the campaign trail,\u201d Sanders said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. \u201cOne of the things he talked about was lowering the cost of prescription drugs. There is wonderful legislation right now in the Senate to do that. President Trump, come on board. Let\u2019s work together.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats remain skittish about the threat of being tarred by ideological conservatives in tough elections. Saving the Affordable Care Act from repeal united Democrats and healed divisions between the party\u2019s base and its politicians. The next health-care debate might not do that. The only Democrats facing elections soon are candidates for open House seats in deep-red districts, and few have endorsed single payer.\n\nInstead, they\u2019ve cautiously discussed fixes that might be worked out between the parties. Jim Thompson, a candidate for an open seat in Kansas, said after the AHCA\u2019s collapse that parties should \u201csit down and find a plan that expands coverage, lowers costs, and brings us together.\u201d Jon Ossoff, whose bid for an open seat in Georgia has become surprisingly competitive, has run TV ads saying he opposes repeal but favors tweaks to the law. \u201cBoth parties should sit down and deliver more affordable health care choices,\u201d he said after Friday\u2019s debacle.\n\nThat approach reflects how, despite Friday\u2019s setback, Republicans have long benefited from attacking a \u201cgovernment takeover\u201d of health care. And most special-election Democrats aren\u2019t ready to test whether the landscape has changed.\n\n\u201cObamacare\u2019s ongoing collapse is a case study in what occurs with a top-down, government centered approach to healthcare,\u201d said National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Jesse Hunt. \u201cCandidates who advocate for a Bernie-style single payer system do so at their own peril.\u201d\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped the Democrats\u2019 base, just as Republicans demanded years of fealty to a repeal message, from seeking more on health care. The Coventry town hall, which filled most of the city\u2019s largest high school auditorium, was a target-rich environment for local groups trying to get signatures to support expanded health care. J. Mark Ryan, 49, who led the local chapter of Physicians for a National Health Program, walked from row to row with cards that people could sign if they wanted the state to pass a single-payer bill.\n\n\u201cAny Republicans who are interested in being re-elected should be interested in this, too,\u201d he said.\n\nMichael Fuchs, 55, got Whitehouse to sign a different card, for a campaign simply to get Rhode Island to endorse the \u201cessential health benefits\u201d that were negotiated away in the final version of the AHCA. Doing so, he pointed out, would protect the state\u2019s customers even if Republicans made a successful run at the law. But in the long run, he, too, wanted national health insurance.\n\n\u201cWe could at least lower the buy-in age for Medicare to 55,\u201d he said.\n\nOver more than two friendly hours, the elected Democrats got the most applause when they swerved left on health care.\n\n\u201cThe very best market-based solution is to have a public option,\u201d Whitehouse said. Paraphrasing Benjamin Franklin, he said that a government-managed insurer would reveal what games private insurers had been playing. \u201cThe best way to show that a stick is crooked is to put a straight stick next to it. If you do that, the private sector can\u2019t manipulate the market by withdrawing.\u201d\n\nBut as the town hall went on, activists demanded to know if Whitehouse could go further. After several rounds of questions about the need to investigate Russia\u2019s involvement in the 2016 election, and the need to filibuster Gorsuch, Ryan, with the physician group, asked the senator if he could get behind universal coverage.\n\n\u201cWhy not endorse it this year?\u201d Ryan asked.\n\nIn the spirit of the weekend, Whitehouse didn\u2019t rule it out. \u201cWe already do it for the people we care the most about \u2014 our veterans and our seniors,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/03/26/nearly-one-out-of-every-three-days-he-has-been-president-trump-has-visited-a-trump-property/", "text": "The Washington Post's Jenna Johnson and Aaron Blake explain why President Trump spends so much time at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, and how he uses it as a second White House.

He has done so on 21 of the 66 days he has been in office, meaning that for the equivalent of three full weeks of his just-over-nine weeks as commander in chief, he has spent all or part of a day at a Trump property \u2014 earning that property mentions in the media and the ability to tell potential clients that they might be able to interact with the president.

I\u2019m not going to have time to go play golf,\u201d he said in August \u2014 he has made 14 visits to his own golf courses since becoming president, likely playing golf on at least 12 of those occasions.\n\nBelow, a breakdown of Trump\u2019s visits to his properties. They include:\n\n\u2022 Trump International Hotel in Washington.\n\n\u2022 Trump National Golf Club in Potomac Falls, Va.\n\n\u2022 Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla.\n\n\u2022 Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla.\n\n\u2022 Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Fla.\n\nUpdate: Missed that Trump actually visited two of his courses on Feb. 11 \u2014 Trump International in West Palm Beach and Trump National in Jupiter. His golf game with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took place at the latter on that day.\n\nTrump has announced that he plans to host the Chinese president at Mar-a-Lago next month.\n\nThe one occasion on which he went to a golf course but clearly didn\u2019t play golf came Sunday, when he made a relatively short visit to Trump National during which, his team says, he held three meetings. Last week, press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump\u2019s visits to golf courses didn\u2019t necessarily mean he was playing golf.\n\nPresident Trump criticized former president Barack Obama for golfing too often.

So, just because he heads there, it doesn\u2019t mean that that\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nOn every occasion, save the visit Sunday, Trump has spent multiple hours at the club, usually out of view of the media.

Ryan (R-Wis.) to pull the American Health Care Act from the House floor Friday afternoon, after it became clear to him and President Trump that they did not have enough Republican votes to pass it.\n\nSome top Republicans interviewed Saturday singled out Ryan for blame, arguing that he did not sufficiently represent the views of conservative lawmakers or interest groups, who had pressed for a fuller repeal of the law. But some blamed Trump or his aides for not smoothing out the differences, a sentiment that has been stronger privately than in public. Still others found fault with various GOP factions and interest groups, on the right and in the middle, who opposed the bill.\n\nAll of this puts pressure on Trump, Ryan, the hard-right House Freedom Caucus and the moderate Republicans who voted against the bill to shore up their relationships and show the nation that they can achieve real successes together.\n\n(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cPaul Ryan is a really smart policy guy, and we saw that on display,\u201d Club for Growth President David McIntosh said in an interview Saturday. \u201cBut he lacks the legislative skills to put together a coalition to get the bill through.\u201d The Club for Growth circulated a memo Saturday arguing that \u201cconservatives saved Republicans from voting for their own version of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nOther Republicans argued that groups such as the Club for Growth and the hard-right House Freedom Caucus are at fault for stubbornly opposing the bill and continually demanding a more aggressive attack on the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cQuite frankly, I think we had a group of people that are traditionally \u2018no\u2019 on everything. And they vote as a bloc. And so you\u2019ve got to penetrate that bloc. And so we\u2019ve got figure out how to do that,\u201d said Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.).\n\n\u201cI sometimes wonder with some of my colleagues, though, if they wrote the bill themselves, whether they could get to yes, you know?\u201d said Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.). \u201cBecause it\u2019s about protecting their brand or protecting their voting record or protecting their purity with an outside group.\u201d\n\nThe bill also had its fair share of critics from the more moderate wing of the party \u2014 which has led some to conclude it\u2019s not about Ryan or Trump but the hard-to-reconcile nature of the GOP right now.\n\n\u201cThis is not a failure of leadership; it\u2019s a failure of follow-ship,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a frequent defender of both Ryan and Trump.\n\nThat still puts the burden on Ryan to figure out how to manage a new dynamic within his conference, with right and left flanks willing to buck him.\n\nView Graphic Which Republicans forced Trump to pull the health-care bill\n\n[A new dynamic in the House GOP: Right and left flanks willing to buck leadership]\n\n\u2018We\u2019re a no\u2019\n\nThe discord started weeks ago but reached a critical point Thursday night, when the members of the Freedom Caucus sat in the Capitol before Ryan, White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and budget director Mick Mulvaney, who had helped found the group of Republican hard-\n\nliners two years ago.\n\nWith the bill \u2014 and the rest of Trump\u2019s legislative agenda \u2014 hanging in the balance, Ryan polled the room: Would they support the bill after changes that would partially, but not entirely, meet their demands?\n\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the group\u2019s chairman, spoke up: \u201cI speak for the group. We\u2019re a bloc. And we\u2019re a no.\u201d\n\nThe meeting sealed the fate of the AHCA, which would be pulled from House consideration less than 24 hours later, and brought to a head months of simmering frustrations between each of the parties \u2014 the Freedom Caucus, the House GOP leadership and the Trump administration.\n\nFreedom Caucus members bristled at many of the talking points Ryan used as he blitzed conservative radio and television shows to project Republican unity on health care. One that particularly grated, according to several members of the group, was his repeated claim that Republicans had \u201crun on\u201d the health-care plan in 2016, because it was sketched out in Ryan\u2019s \u201cA Better Way\u201d policy agenda.\n\nWhile some caucus members participated in listening sessions about health care, the policy provisions that ultimately were included in the plan were written largely by Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, then the House Budget Committee chairman, as well as Ryan\u2019s own policy staff and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.). The plan included provisions that many hard-liners considered unacceptable \u2014 such as the inclusion of a refundable tax credit, something they saw as a new federal entitlement.\n\nMichael A. Needham, the president of Heritage Action for America, a group that opposed the bill, said that a \u201cblame game\u201d is a distraction from the need to forge a better replacement.\n\n\u201cThe problem with this bill wasn\u2019t that it would be sound health policy if only it wiped away one set of benefit mandates,\u201d said Needham. \u201cIt was that it was not designed from the ground up to circumvent Obamacare\u2019s regulatory architecture. We would be very eager to be involved in crafting legislation that achieves that objective while navigating the relevant procedural hurdles.\u201d\n\nHouse leaders insisted that they were constrained by the special budget procedures they needed to follow to get the bill through the Senate without Democratic support. That prompted policy trade-offs that left some conservatives fuming. And the leaders faulted the Freedom Caucus hard-liners \u2014 and outside groups encouraging them \u2014 for ignoring that reality and constantly shifting their demands.\n\nThe sense that the bill was simply bad policy was shared by many of the centrist Republicans who opposed it \u2014 as well as the Democrats who united against it.\n\nSecond-string backing\n\nSince the defeat, Trump and Ryan have declined to say anything indicating that they blame each other. That has not stopped some Republicans from musing that Trump\u2019s less-than-full-throated support for Ryan and the bill along the way helped embolden critics to believe he was on their side.\n\nWhile Trump supported the bill and sought to build support for it, he also sent confusing signals suggesting that he might be open to changes. It was Ryan who introduced it, championed the details and served as chief salesman. He also took most of the public heat from critics.\n\nStill, Republicans have been less willing to criticize Trump publicly. One top Republican who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly likened the dynamic to a football game in which Ryan was the struggling starting quarterback, and fans were chanting for Trump to come off bench to relieve him. When Trump did engage, the Republican said, \u201cWhatever good he did was amplified, because it makes a bad start look better.\u201d\n\nAnd like a second-string player, Trump took less grief for the eventual loss.\n\n\u201cI think he follows a pattern,\u201d said Paul A. Gosar (R-Ariz.), a member of the Freedom Caucus. \u201cHe trusts the people that are around him, and I don\u2019t know that the people around him and the people that he trusted actually did him service in this.\u201d\n\nA senior White House official said Saturday that the biggest lesson learned is that Trump and his aides must drive the process from the beginning. It was a mistake to come on board with the House plan rather than present Trump\u2019s own initiative, this official said.\n\nThe official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly about White House strategy, said that when he is ready, Trump will offer his own plan on tax reform in a bid to have more control over the process.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to line up commitments earlier,\u201d the official said. \u201cOf course we\u2019re going to look at these things.\u201d\n\nThe White House also was caught off guard by the response of lawmakers who had repeatedly voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Trump aides never expected so many lawmakers in this category to decline to support this bill.\n\n[Trump\u2019s path forward only gets tougher after health-care fiasco]\n\nSome White House staffers and Trump advisers have pinned blame for the debacle on White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, who is close to Ryan and who encouraged Trump to embrace the House bill, according to several Trump associates, not all of whom say the criticism is fair.\n\nFor many Republicans, it was a problem of timing. They felt House GOP leaders rushed ahead in crafting the bill to repeal and replace the ACA, needlessly trying to hold a final vote on Thursday, the law\u2019s seventh anniversary.\n\n\u201cReally, are we in the Hallmark card business?\u201d asked Rep. Mark Amodei (R-Nev.) hours before the bill was officially pulled Friday. Amodei held both Ryan and Trump culpable for the mess.\n\nTrump and some Republicans have sought to blame Democrats for not joining their effort \u2014 a claim Democrats say is outrageous. And they have embraced another potential path forward on health-care reform, predicting that the current laws will collapse under their own weight and that some Democrats finally will join their calls for repeal.\n\n\u201cObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry!\u201d Trump tweeted Saturday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think one party is going to be able to fix this by themselves,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) at a town hall meeting a few hours later. \u201cSo here\u2019s what I think should happen next: I think the president should reach out to Democrats.\u201d\n\nBut the Republican failure has only emboldened Democrats to defend the ACA.\n\n\u201cIf they would denounce repeal . . . then we\u2019ll work with them on improving it and making it better,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). \u201cThey can\u2019t continue to want to repeal.\u201d\n\nAs they quickly filed out of a meeting Friday where GOP leaders officially announced the bill was doomed, many with dejected facial expressions, Republican House members said it was on them to work out their differences during this period of one-party control \u2014 and acknowledged it would not be easy.\n\n\u201cThis is a learning experience. I want to learn from this experience. I hope my colleagues will learn from this experience,\u201d said Rep.

That\u2019s as true for President Trump as for other presidents who suffered early setbacks. But without some serious stocktaking inside the White House after the failed effort to replace the Affordable Care Act, there could be more trouble ahead for the most unorthodox president of modern times.\n\nThe debacle Trump and the Republican Party just experienced is no doubt an especially searing experience for a president whose self-image depends on successes and who bragged on the campaign trail that he would produce so many victories in office that people would get \u201ctired of winning.\u201d\n\nIn his Oval Office remarks after Republicans pulled the health-care bill Friday afternoon, he said he had learned some lessons from the process that produced such a major defeat. The next weeks and months will demonstrate whether that was empty talk or something real \u2014 and whether he and the Republicans can make the transition from opposition party to governing majority.\n\nThe president has an opportunity to adjust, adapt and ultimately to recover, if he\u2019s prepared to undertake a sober analysis of what happened on health care, and more broadly, how to operate as president. Ultimately, the presidency is about more than signing executive orders, holding listening sessions in the White House or taking the show on the road for campaign-style rallies before boisterous crowds of devoted supporters.\n\nPresident Trump has tried to set a fast pace in his first months in office, moving from issue to issue with breakneck speed as he sought to demonstrate that he was keeping his campaign promises. It was almost as if he intended to prove that he would keep them all by the end of his first 100 days in office. Instead, he has taken only partial steps at best, racking up a report card of mostly incompletes.\n\n(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nSave for his nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, which has been from start to near-finish the smoothest undertaking of the administration, the inventory of his first months in office includes few true success stories and certainly no important legislative achievements. Meanwhile, the presidency is clouded by the FBI investigation into the alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible links between Trump associates and Russians.\n\n[The closer who couldn\u2019t close the deal]\n\nThe health-care fight highlighted one of the basic contradictions of Trump\u2019s presidency. He and the Republican Party have never been on the same page, and the long-standing tensions between Trump and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) symbolize those differences. The two men seemingly worked together as best they could during the health-care fight. They had no other choice.\n\nBoth said nice things about the other in the wake of the defeat. But the background sniping from Trump allies toward Ryan continues, led by Breitbart News, which was once under the leadership of Stephen K. Bannon, the White House chief strategist and senior counselor. It is a reminder that the Trump-Ryan relationship is a political marriage that will remain fragile at best. Ryan\u2019s agenda has never been Trump\u2019s agenda. Trump\u2019s primary constituency, grounded in the alienations and aspirations of middle-aged and older white working-class voters, is not the same as that of Ryan and establishment Republicans.\n\nA president benefits from having a strong speaker and vice versa, as former president Barack Obama and then-House speaker Nancy Pelosi proved. So Trump and Ryan will be inextricably linked for as long as both hold their offices. The question is the degree to which Trump decides to change the terms of that alliance.\n\nTrump won the election with significant support from conventional Republican voters, but the animating message of his candidacy was anything but Republican orthodoxy. Instead, it was an anti-establishment, nationalist populism, best articulated over time by Bannon but also instinctively embraced by candidate Trump in his early campaign.\n\nWhether on trade or immigration or America\u2019s place in the world, candidate Trump was at odds with the party whose nomination he captured. But the early days of his administration seemed more an expression of the kind of conventional conservatism that he demolished. The health-care fight highlighted some of the conflicts inherent in those differences.\n\n(Alice Li,Jayne Orenstein/The Washington Post)\n\n[Freedom Caucus might not be Ryan\u2019s only problem in the House]\n\nCandidate Trump and his campaign team never produced a serious plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. His promise to get rid of Obamacare was a political rallying cry and little more. But to the extent that he was asked about his priorities for health care, he often emphasized his desire to see everyone covered. \u201cInsurance for everyone,\u201d he told The Washington Post\u2019s Robert Costa in January.\n\nIn office, whether by design, indifference or because his administration was disorganized, he ceded substantive control of the health-care effort to Ryan and congressional Republicans, who eventually were joined by Vice President Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. They produced legislation that struck at parts of Trump\u2019s most loyal constituency.\n\nBut Trump never seemed to care about the details of the complex measure. He spent hours cajoling and cheerleading but could not close the deal. In the end, lacking a substantive case, and with concessions to hard-line conservatives causing alarm among more moderate conservatives in swing districts, his only argument was that this bill was too important to fail. When it collapsed, he blamed the Democrats for the defeat, although he never made an overture to anyone in the opposition party.\n\nNow he is left to pick up the pieces and plot a new strategy. On health care, he tweeted Saturday, \u201cObamacare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry.\u201d Perhaps he can eventually reach accommodation with Democrats on a bill to repair the ACA, although they may not be anxious to throw him a lifeline right now and it\u2019s questionable how many House Republicans would go along.\n\nThe president indicated Friday that he is eager to move to tax reform, but tax reform is no less complex than health care \u2014 perhaps even more complicated without passage of the health-care bill. Some Republicans are suggesting he should look for a bipartisan path by combining a massive infrastructure initiative with a major tax cut, attracting both Democrats and Republicans. That raises the obvious question of whether Democrats would cooperate with a now-weakened president.\n\nHis other challenge could be keeping Republicans in line. His budget already has run into problems, and as congressional Republicans look toward 2018, they will act in their own self-interest rather than the president\u2019s.\n\nFor a host of reasons, he has had a rocky start. It is not in Trump\u2019s style to change course or habits. He has always believed he knows better than the conventional politicians he defeated in the election. But what might have worked in the campaign has not worked so well from the White House so far.\n\nTrump governs as the leader of a divided party in a nation divided. He has failed to broaden his support and therefore has no political safety net. The health-care debacle provides a political circuit breaker for the new administration, an event calamitous enough to make even the most self-confident of leaders stop and ask what happened \u2014 and what, if anything, can be done to set a fresh course."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/oklahoma-lawmaker-on-abortion-in-rape-and-incest-cases-god-can-bring-beauty-out-of-ashes/2017/03/25/2ed68864-116e-11e7-aa57-2ca1b05c41b8_video.html", "text": "- During a floor debate on a bill to prohibit abortion in cases when the fetus shows signs of Down Syndrome or another genetic disorder, Oklahoma state Rep.

It was filled with several different options and possible routes ahead, and dozens of Republicans agreed with their sentiment.\n\nThat left Republicans well short of the votes they needed to fulfill a seven-year promise to destroy the 2010 Affordable Care Act once they were fully in charge, delivering a stinging defeat to both Ryan and Trump.\n\nIt also suggested a new dynamic in which both the right and left flanks of the Republican conference are emboldened to challenge leadership. And that could make each future negotiation more difficult as the issue matrix gets more complicated and the pockets of internal GOP resistance continue to grow, not shrink, in the new era of Trump\u2019s Republican-controlled Washington.\n\nSome parts of these botched negotiations looked a lot like the recent past. Franks and his House Freedom Caucus cronies played the role of obstructionists who will buck party leaders no matter if it\u2019s John A. Boehner, Ryan\u2019s predecessor, or now Trump, as well. These ideologues gobbled up tons of attention, resulting in much care from Trump, Vice President Pence and top West Wing advisers.\n\n(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nBy lunchtime Friday, Franks still would not commit to publicly supporting the bill \u2014 even though he admitted it was far better than current law. \u201cOf course it is, yeah, it\u2019s a lot better than Obamacare, of course it is. There\u2019s not even any comparison,\u201d Franks said a few hours before the legislation went down in flames.\n\nFranks remained upset that conservative proposals were left out of the bill because they would have violated Senate budget rules, meaning that the proposal to replace the ACA was nowhere near to his liking.\n\n\u201cThat still is like putting dirt in ice cream,\u201d he said.\n\nOther parts of the negotiation, however, were new and quite different from the previous six years of Republican control of the House. Nothing capped this off more than the stunning announcement Friday morning from Frelinghuysen, just three months into his hold on the coveted Appropriations Committee gavel, that bucked leadership.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the legislation before the House today is currently unacceptable as it would place significant new costs and barriers to care on my constituents,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nA 22-year veteran whose family traces its establishment lineage to the Continental Congress, Frelinghuysen won his chairmanship uncontested with the blessing of Ryan and the leadership team. He\u2019s not someone who rocks the boat \u2014 he supported impeachment articles against President Bill Clinton \u2014 but his pronouncement Friday sent a jolt through the Capitol.\n\nHe also joined a long list of influential centrists who rejected the proposal on policy grounds, not out of fear politically. Frelinghuysen has received more than 60 percent of the vote in all but one election.\n\n(Alice Li,Jayne Orenstein/The Washington Post)\n\nIf anyone should back Ryan \u2014 he\u2019s a new committee chairman, he\u2019s safe back home \u2014 it would have been Frelinghuysen. Instead, he sent a message to a few dozen other Republicans who have more troubling districts that they, too, should break from the president and the speaker.\n\nIn some corners, Republicans saw the past week as a defining moment when lawmakers went from the hypothetical exercise of previous fiscal proposals, which they knew the White House of President Barack Obama would block, into the world of live ammunition in which these proposals could become law.\n\nThat gravity, among moderates and some mainstream conservatives as they saw Trump agree to concessions to the Freedom Caucus, altered votes. \u201cSometimes you\u2019re playing Fantasy Football and sometimes you\u2019re in the real game,\u201d said Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.), a Freedom Caucus member whom Trump had won over to support the bill.\n\nBy the time Ryan arrived at the White House, delivering the bad news about the whip count for the vote, those Republicans were doing just that. Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.), who brought Ryan into her suburban district outside Washington, broke against the bill, followed by Rep. David Joyce (R-Ohio).\n\nJoyce\u2019s district, a mix of suburbs and working-class towns east of Cleveland, actually went for Trump by more than 11 percentage points, as Joyce was reelected by a 25-percentage-point margin. In the past, his biggest political fear has been a primary challenge from the right, yet the slight hint of Trump-fueled challengers to those opposed to the bill did not sway Joyce.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich (R) had accepted expanded Medicaid funding as part of increasing insurance coverage through the ACA. Ryan\u2019s American Health Care Act would phase out the Medicaid coverage.\n\nJoyce made a simple, binary choice about Obamacare: \u201cThe American Health Care Act was not a better solution.\u201d\n\nThis new combination, with Ryan\u2019s right and left flanks willing to buck him and the new president, presents deep concern for the long-term effort to take up the more complicated effort to overhaul the corporate and individual tax codes.\n\nBefore they can even get there, however, Ryan faces an April 28 deadline to come up with a funding stream for the federal agency budgets through the end of the fiscal year. In previous federal spending fights, the Freedom Caucus has refused to lend a hand unless policy riders were attached. Democrats, who have been relied on in the past to backfill those lost conservative votes, have signaled they will not do so this time if the legislation includes funding for controversial measures such as Trump\u2019s request for funding to build a border wall.\n\nThat messy task falls to Frelinghuysen\u2019s committee \u2014 and it will become much more difficult for the new chairman to ask for loyalty votes on his legislation just a few weeks after he walked away from Ryan on the AHCA. Democrats believe this attempt, and failure, has left Republicans politically in charge of health care from now on. They can\u2019t complain about something if they can\u2019t come up with their own fix.\n\n\u201cIf it passes, they have to answer for it,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told reporters early Friday. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t pass, they have to answer for that as well.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans rejected that, but others took a more holistic view. Passing the Ryan legislation would have only led to a very messy fight in the Senate, setting up what might have been an even more contentious fight later in the spring between the two different pieces of legislation.\n\nSaid Rep. Mark Amodei (R-Nev.), who opposed the legislation: \u201cEven if it passes today, it\u2019s like \u2014 I wanna pick these words very carefully \u2014 the adolescent dance school will still continue in full view.\u201d\n\nRead more from Paul Kane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-closer-the-inside-story-of-how-trump-tried--and-failed--to-make-a-deal-on-health-care/2017/03/24/3e6353d6-0fdc-11e7-9d5a-a83e627dc120_story.html", "text": "(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nShortly after House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) unveiled the Republican health-care plan on March 6, President Trump sat in the Oval Office and queried his advisers: \u201cIs this really a good bill?\u201d\n\nAnd over the next 18 days, until the bill collapsed in the House on Friday afternoon in a humiliating defeat \u2014 the sharpest rebuke yet of Trump\u2019s young presidency and his negotiating skills \u2014 the question continued to nag at the president.\n\nEven as he thrust himself and the trappings of his office into selling the health-care bill, Trump peppered his aides again and again with the same concern, usually after watching cable news reports chronicling the setbacks, according to two of his advisers: \u201cIs this really a good bill?\u201d\n\nIn the end, the answer was no \u2014 in part because the president himself seemed to doubt it.\n\n\u201cWe were a little bit shy \u2014 very little, but it was still a little bit shy, so we pulled it,\u201d Trump said Friday afternoon in an interview with The Washington Post.\n\nFor Trump, it was never supposed to be this hard. As a real estate mogul on the rise, he wrote \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d and as a political candidate, he boasted that nobody could make deals as beautifully as he could. Replacing Obamacare, a Republican bogeyman since the day it was enacted seven years ago, was Trump\u2019s first chance to prove that he had the magic touch that he claimed eluded Washington.\n\n[Balz: A postponed health-care vote, a big GOP embarrassment and no good options ahead]\n\nBut Trump\u2019s effort was plagued from the beginning. The bill itself would have violated a number of Trump\u2019s campaign promises, driving up premiums for millions of citizens and throwing millions more off health insurance \u2014 including many of the working-class voters who gravitated to his call to \u201cmake America great again.\u201d Trump was unsure about the American Health Care Act, though he ultimately dug in for the win, as he put it.\n\nThere were other problems, too. Trump never made a real effort to reach out to Democrats, and he was unable to pressure enough of his fellow Republicans. He did not speak fluently about the bill\u2019s details and focused his pitch in purely transactional terms. And he failed to appreciate the importance of replacing Obamacare to the Republican base; for the president, it was an obstacle to move past to get to taxes, trade and the rest of his agenda.\n\nTrump\u2019s advisers thought he could nudge the bill over the finish line by sheer force of personality. \u201cHe is the closer,\u201d White House press secretary Sean Spicer boasted on Wednesday.\n\nBut by Friday, it was clear that the closer could not close.\n\n\u2018I couldn\u2019t get them\u2019\n\nTrump tried to orchestrate his own win.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump visits the Capitol Building on Tuesday to talk with House Republicans. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nHe cajoled and charmed uncertain members, offering flattery and attention to some and admonishment and the vague threat of political retribution to others. He invited members to the White House for bowling sessions, gave others rides on Air Force One (complete with \u00adlasagna) and grinned for pictures in the Oval Office, where he reminded lawmakers of his margins of victory in their districts.\n\nBut legislating, it turned out, was different from cutting deals to splash his name across skyscrapers. And less than 100 days into his administration, the president found himself a red-faced Don Quixote, railing against the intractable forces on Capitol Hill, where Republicans are wearied by years of infighting.\n\nThis account of Trump\u2019s work on the health-care bill \u2014 based on interviews with roughly three dozen White House aides and advisers, members of Congress, and other key figures in the debate \u2014 revealed a president in a constant state of negotiation. He remarked to friends and aides that it did not feel much different from his real estate transactions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same thing,\u201d he said Wednesday in the Oval Office. \u201cReally, it is.\u201d\n\nYet the man accustomed to acting unilaterally as a Manhattan developer faced a series of new and uncomfortable challenges. As president, he was selling the rare product on which he refused to emblazon his name \u2014 devoting himself to an issue for which he has little real passion or knowledge and operating as a dealmaker in an unfamiliar town full of conflicting loyalties.\n\nReflecting Friday on the failure, Trump said he thought he had cultivated a good relationship with the House Freedom Caucus \u2014 the band of hard-line conservatives who proudly oppose Ryan and other House leaders.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t get them,\u201d Trump said in The Post interview. \u201cThey just wouldn\u2019t do it. . . . I think they made a mistake, but that\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nAlluding to the long-running dramas on Capitol Hill, Trump added, \u201cThere are years of problems, great hatred and distrust, and, you know, I came into the middle of it.\u201d\n\n[\u2018Hello, Bob\u2019: President Trump called my cellphone to say that the health-care bill was dead]\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop the president from trying. Just two days before the bill was withdrawn by House leadership, Trump sat inside the Oval Office at dusk as his aides offered yet another blunt warning in a week full of them: The measure was likely to fail. Too many Republicans were opposed.\n\nStill in a suit jacket and striped red tie Wednesday evening, the president dialed Rep. Joe Barton, a wavering Republican from Texas, and placed the call on speakerphone. He put his finger to his lips to shush the clutch of advisers that always surrounds him. The president listened as the congressman ticked through his concerns, sipping from a glass of Diet Coke and jotting down notes with a thick, black Sharpie.\n\nNever one to get caught up in policy details, Trump concentrated his pitch on the big picture: winning. Trump said he wanted a win for Barton, for Texas, for their party, for the country \u2014 and, of course, for himself.\n\nWhen Barton told Trump that he could probably support the bill, with a few changes, the president smiled and winked at Vice President Pence, who stood hovering over the Resolute desk, and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who leaned forward to listen. As Trump wrapped up the call \u2014 \u201cTalk soon,\u201d he told Barton \u2014 Pence and Price silently punched their fists in the air. Barton was not an absolute yes but, for the moment, it was good enough.\n\nThen the president was on to the next call.\n\nThe self-described dealmaker\n\nThe White House had striven to ensure that its first real legislative push would be an organized, disciplined one. But as the bill began to falter, the chaos and turbulence that has become a hallmark of Trump\u2019s presidency emerged yet again.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump in the cab of an eighteen-wheeler truck while meeting with truckers and chief executives Thursday. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nOn Thursday, Trump appeared embarrassingly out of the loop; as the congressional whip efforts faltered, Trump was busy at the White House, greeting commercial truckers and climbing into the cab of a 18-wheeler to honk the horn.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very close vote,\u201d the president said, referring to what everyone else seemed to know had been delayed.\n\nTrump fashioned himself as the master dealmaker. His senior aides described him as \u201can extremely good listener\u201d and said his negotiating skills were the product of \u201ctotal natural talent,\u201d saying he could turn up the heat or the charm as needed.\n\nBut the negotiations over the bill\u2019s substance took place mostly at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. Trump had amicable meetings with members of all stripes but found himself caught in the middle of factional House GOP dramas that have been simmering for years. As one member of the House Freedom Caucus described it: \u201cWe\u2019re competing with Ryan. We like Trump.\u201d\n\n[Trump loyalists sound alarm over \u2018RyanCare,\u2019 endangering health bill]\n\nAs the talks stalled later that night, Trump\u2019s exasperation with the hemming and hawing of members escalated and he delivered an ultimatum: Go ahead with the vote no matter what on Friday, he said, all but daring fellow Republicans to vote against his first significant bill.\n\nThe president was finished negotiating, and his thinking was straight from \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d: If the White House continued to postpone the vote, the holdouts would gain leverage and learn the dangerous lesson that they could challenge Trump and win. Lawmakers wanting to oppose the president would have to do so publicly, in a vote, and face the consequences.\n\nYet in the end, Trump acquiesced to the preferences of House leaders, who did not want their members voting on a controversial measure if the outcome were in doubt. Realizing the health-care plan did not have the support to pass, Trump and Ryan decided Friday afternoon to pull the bill \u2014 news Trump announced in a phone call with The Post, before Ryan even had time to personally brief GOP members.\n\n\u201cJust another day,\u201d Trump said in the call. \u201cJust another day in paradise, okay?\u201d\n\n\u2018This is about policy\u2019\n\nAs the odds for success fluttered, Trump increasingly came to relish the fight, seeing the sprint for passage as a test of whether he could translate abilities from the boardroom to the Oval Office.\n\n\n\nMark Meadows (R-N.C.), chair of the House Freedom Caucus, after a meeting about the Affordable Care Act on Thursday. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\nAmong the lawmakers he courted most intensely was Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus. Trump brought him to the Oval Office, called him regularly and directed White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon to call or text him daily. Last weekend, Meadows even journeyed to Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s private Florida club, to huddle with Bannon and other aides about the bill.\n\nMeadows said his mantra in negotiating with Trump had been, \u201cIf this was about personalities, we\u2019d already be at \u2018yes.\u2019 He\u2019s charming, and anyone who spends time with him knows that. But this is about policy, and we\u2019re not going to make it about anything else.\u201d\n\nFor Meadows, a sticking point was essential health-benefit requirements under the current law for insurance companies, such as maternity and newborn care, and substance-abuse treatment, which he wanted removed and replaced with narrower rules.\n\nMeadows and other Freedom Caucus members met with Trump and Pence at the White House on Thursday, but they left without a deal, even after Trump had worked with them for weeks \u2014 leaving Trump\u2019s advisers exasperated with the ornery bloc.\n\nIt was not only the Freedom Caucus creating problems for Trump. A group of more moderate Republicans, known as the Tuesday Group, stood opposed to the bill, despite the president\u2019s pleadings.\n\nOne such member, Rep. Leonard Lance (R-N.J.), attended meetings at the White House and praised Trump\u2019s style, saying the president clearly \u201cknows Jersey.\u201d But, he added, the bill would harm his constituents who rely on Medicaid and there was nothing Trump could say to persuade him otherwise.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got this wit about him that I enjoy,\u201d Lance said, \u201cbut I\u2019m a \u2018no\u2019 vote.\u201d\n\nOn March 8, Trump met with a small group of conservative activists with hopes that their groups would get behind the bill. Someone with direct knowledge of the meeting described it as \u201ca \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 skit,\u201d with the president boasting about how \u201cgreat\u201d the bill was and his aides seconding his assessment \u201clike a Greek chorus.\u201d\n\nAfter the meeting, Trump posed for pictures with the activist leaders \u2014 from groups such as Tea Party Patriots, Americans for Prosperity and Club for Growth \u2014 in the Oval Office. He urged them to address the press corps on the way out with a statement of support for the bill. They spoke to reporters in the West Wing driveway, but were tempered and far more reserved than the president had hoped.\n\nAlong the way, the Trump administration kept finding signs of hesi\u00adta\u00adtion and doubt. In the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on Wednesday, Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.), a member of the Freedom Caucus, irritated top Trump deputies, including Pence, when he walked out of a meeting with the vice president, making a thumbs-down gesture as he departed.\n\n\u2018The salesman in sell mode\u2019\n\nWhile Trump turned on his charisma, Pence quietly worked behind the scenes. The vice president has been devoting at least one night a week \u2014 usually Wednesday \u2014 for get-to-know-you sessions with both lawmakers and their staffs at his residence.\n\n\n\nVice President Pence, left, and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price leave a meeting with members of the House Freedom Caucus on Friday. (Oliver Contreras/For The Washington Post)\n\nThis past Monday night, Pence hosted about a dozen leadership chiefs of staff. As a fire crackled at the Naval Observatory, the group dined on chicken with asparagus and a poached-pear dessert, and the vice president shared complimentary stories about what it was like to work with Trump.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, was candid about the political ramifications of not supporting the bill, which he likened to an act of betrayal, and pointedly reminded lawmakers of his popularity among the Republican base.\n\nTrump used one of his favorite trophies, the Oval Office, as a bargaining tool. He had so many lawmakers in and out in the days leading up to the vote that the stately room felt like a train station.\n\n[Trump to GOP critics of health-care bill: \u2018I\u2019m gonna come after you\u2019]\n\nTrump also sought leverage by surprising members with cold calls. Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) was at home near Richmond one day last week, moving boxes into his car, when his cellphone rang.\n\n\u201cSomeone came on with this very formal voice and said, \u2018Please hold for the president of the United States,\u2019 \u201d Brat recalled. But when Trump got on the line, the president could not have been less formal, Brat said. \u201cHe goes, \u2018C\u2019mon, Brat, what\u2019s going on with this thing?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I want you to be a success, but the price has to come down,\u2019 \u201d Brat said. \u201cBut he puts on the hard sell. He\u2019s selling. The salesman in sell mode. On that, he\u2019s the best. Humor, heart, personality.\u201d\n\nTrump ended the call with a plea: \u201cDave, c\u2019mon, we\u2019re going to get it right.\u201d But Brat was unmoved. \u201cI get it,\u201d he said he told the president, \u201cbut I couldn\u2019t get behind it.\u201d\n\nTrump was more effective with his call to Barton, who later described him as \u201ca political Rodney Dangerfield.\u201d The Texan had been skeptical from the start, but two days after talking to Trump, Barton was ready to join what he thought would be a majority in voting for the bill.\n\n\u201cThe choice is \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to vote \u2018no\u2019 and keep Obamacare. That\u2019d be a stupid damn vote.\u201d\n\nBut Barton never got the chance to cast his vote.\n\nDavid Weigel contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/gorsuch-may-have-clerked-for-kennedy-but-hearings-show-hes-more-like-scalia/2017/03/24/1b361efa-10ba-11e7-9d5a-a83e627dc120_story.html", "text": "If he\u2019s confirmed to the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch would be the first person to serve alongside a justice for whom he once clerked: Anthony M.

After Chairman Charles E.

Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) reminded Gorsuch that he was nominated by a man who once vowed that his choices for the court \u201cwould, for example, automatically overrule Roe v. Wade. And so I have felt that you had a responsibility to be, if anything, more forthcoming than judges or justices nominated in the past.\u201d\n\nBut Gorsuch was just as elusive as past nominees, who are always protected by the party in charge and pursued by senators in the opposition.\n\nGorsuch displayed the earnestness of an Eagle Scout and the politeness one might expect of a man who, as a government lawyer, wrote a thank you note to the military officials who gave him a tour of the detainee facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nEven as he was deep into it with one Democratic inquisitor, Gorsuch took time to be thankful.\n\n(Video: Reuters / Photo: Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cI appreciate the advice I\u2019ve gotten, thoughtful advice on a number of issues from senators across the spectrum,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re thoughtful people who care deeply about this country, and you care deeply about the judiciary, and I appreciate that.\u201d\n\n[Neil Gorsuch: Steadfast and occasionally surprising]\n\nBlumenthal and Sens. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) seemed more frustrated than flattered.\n\nSpecifically, they tried to get Gorsuch to say that a long line of cases establishing rights to contraceptives and abortion were correctly decided. He would do no more than say they are precedents and are afforded deference depending on how long ago they were decided, whether they had been reaffirmed by subsequent decisions and whether reliance on them had become part of public life.\n\n\u201cThe point of a precedent \u2014 I\u2019m trying to be as helpful to you as I can be here, Senator \u2014 is that it represents collective wisdom,\u201d Gorsuch said. \u201cAnd to say I agree or I disagree with a precedent of the United States Supreme Court, as a judge, that\u2019s an act of hubris that to me just doesn\u2019t feel like a judicial function.\u201d\n\nBlumenthal said other Supreme Court nominees, including Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Alito, had also been judges when they appeared before the committee and had not hesitated to say whether some of the cases at issue had been correctly decided.\n\nWithout a similar commitment, \u201cgay and lesbian Americans have to wonder\u201d whether the decisions that afforded them rights are safe, Blumenthal told Gorsuch. He added, \u201cMillions and millions of women who had apprehensions about Roe v. Wade and whether you would vote to overturn it will find very little basis for confidence.\u201d\n\nConservatives, too, were concerned when, at one point, Gorsuch called Roe \u201cthe law of the land.\u201d\n\nBut John Malcolm of the Heritage Foundation, one of the groups that supports Gorsuch and compiled for Trump the list of possible replacements for Scalia, said the nominee would have made a mistake to be more forthcoming.\n\n\u201cOnce you start talking about which precedents you like and which precedents you don\u2019t, you\u2019re toast,\u201d he said.\n\nMalcolm said he heard nothing during the hearings that made him doubt that Gorsuch is fit to be Scalia\u2019s successor. \u201cI think they\u2019re very, very similar,\u201d he said, especially in Gorsuch\u2019s embrace of originalism.\n\nThat also marks Gorsuch\u2019s most obvious difference with his old boss, Kennedy.\n\nIn a tribute to Scalia last year, Gorsuch said that originalism means \u201cfocusing backward, not forward, and looking to text, structure and history to decide what a reasonable reader at the time of the events in question would have understood the law to be.\u201d\n\nCarolyn Shapiro, a co-director of the Institute on the Supreme Court at the Chicago-Kent College of Law, notes how differently Kennedy answered questions about constitutional interpretation during his hearings nearly 30 years ago.\n\n\u201cThe words of the Constitution must be the beginning of our inquiry,\u201d Kennedy explained.

Ryan (R-Wis.) remains without a signature accomplishment as speaker, and the defeat undermines Trump\u2019s image as a skilled dealmaker willing to strike compromises to push his agenda forward.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, Trump deflected any responsibility for the setback and instead blamed Democrats. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get one Democratic vote,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame Paul,\u201d Trump added, referring to Ryan.\n\nTrump said he would not ask Republican leaders to reintroduce the legislation in the coming weeks, and congressional leaders made clear that the bill \u2014 known as the American Health Care Act \u2014 was dead.\n\nView Graphic Which Republicans forced Trump to pull the health-care bill\n\nShortly after the decision, Ryan told reporters his party \u201ccame really close today, but we came up short.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019re going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s done, DOA,\u201d said Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.), who drafted much of the legislation. \u201cThis bill is dead.\u201d\n\nInstead, Republican leaders said, they would wait for the Affordable Care Act to encounter fatal problems, believing that Democrats will then want to work with them to make changes.\n\n\u201cAs you know, I\u2019ve been saying for years that the best thing is to let Obamacare explode and then go make a deal with the Democrats and have one unified deal,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd they will come to us, we won\u2019t have to come to them.\u201d\n\nIt remains far from certain that Republicans, in control of the White House and both houses of Congress, will be able to credibly foist responsibility for the nation\u2019s health-care woes onto Democrats. What is certain is that Republicans continue to have difficulty turning their campaign promises into legislative action.\n\nFor seven years, GOP candidates have pledged to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which expanded Medicaid and created subsidized, state-based exchanges to expand health insurance coverage to 20 million Americans, decrying the taxes and government mandates it enacted.\n\n\u201cSince 2010, every Republican, with the exception of probably a handful, has campaigned from dogcatcher on up that they would do everything they could to repeal and replace Obamacare,\u201d White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Friday. \u201cTo get in and say you\u2019re going to do something else would not be fair to the American people.\u201d\n\n(Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\nBut in that time, the party never coalesced around a consensus alternative to the law, and the scramble to develop one after Trump\u2019s election revealed some of the reasons: Republicans were loath to repeal popular ACA provisions such as a requirement that insurers cover those with preexisting conditions and dependents up to age 26 but wanted to repeal the taxes and the individual mandate to have insurance that helped make those provisions possible.\n\nThe policy difficulties were amplified by an ideological cleavage within the House GOP. Conservative hard-liners chafed that the Ryan-drafted bill left too much of the ACA in place and enshrined a federal role in health insurance markets, while moderates feared that cuts to tax subsidies and Medicaid would leave their constituents uncovered and their states with gaping budget gaps.\n\nThe drama on Capitol Hill unfolded amid new evidence that public opinion was running against the bill: A Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday found that U.S. voters disapproved of the legislation 56 percent to 17 percent, with 26 percent undecided.\n\nSigns of trouble across the Republican spectrum were evident by midday Friday, as lawmakers streamed onto the House floor for a procedural vote.\n\nIn one stunning defection, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-N.J.) announced midday that the bill was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and that changes made late Thursday to placate conservatives \u201craise serious coverage and cost issues.\u201d\n\nHe was joined by rank-and-file members such as Rep. David Joyce (R-Ohio), a low-key appropriator, and Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.), a longtime Ryan ally who represents a competitive Northern Virginia congressional district.\n\nBut the White House and House leaders both saw the key bloc as the House Freedom Caucus, a group of roughly three dozen hard-line conservatives who made numerous demands of the bill since January \u2014 including a flat repeal of the ACA, a major reworking of the GOP bill\u2019s tax incentives and new Medicaid restrictions.\n\nMost of those demands were rejected, primarily due to the political reality of holding a Republican majority together in support of the bill.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus chairman, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), became a central player in the negotiations, however, and the group kept an open line to the White House \u2014 particularly with chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, who had been one of its founding members. The group made a final demand this week: The bill had to eliminate a set of ACA insurance mandates that, it argued, were a key factor in driving up premiums.\n\nIn a Thursday morning White House meeting, Trump made what would be his final offer: The bill would gives states the option to eliminate some of the mandates, 10 \u201cessential health benefits,\u201d but would leave others in place.\n\nThat afternoon, the Freedom Caucus met to reject the deal. Hours later, Mulvaney came to a closed-door House GOP conference meeting to deliver a final ultimatum, saying Trump was ready to move on if the bill failed Friday. Afterward, members lined up at microphones to deliver emotional pleas for party unity. Some were veiled critiques of the Freedom Caucus; others were less veiled.\n\nDuring the midday procedural vote Friday, Ryan asked Meadows if his group had changed its stance. It had not, Meadows told him \u2014 meaning as many as 20 hard-liners would oppose the bill. Twenty-two Republican no votes would sink the bill, and more than a dozen other members had announced their opposition by Friday afternoon.\n\nRyan left shortly after for the White House to tell Trump the bill would fail.\n\nMeadows declined to answer questions after the bill was pulled on Friday. But several Freedom Caucus members said they would not be cowed by Ryan or even Trump \u2014 a figure most of them had enthusiastically supported.\n\n\u201cYou know what? I came here to do health care right,\u201d said Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R-Ariz.), who was one of six Republicans who voted against the procedural measure.\n\n\u201cA no vote means we save Donald Trump from a Democratic majority in 2019,\u201d said Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.), one of Trump\u2019s most ardent congressional supporters.\n\nThe defeat has left the remainder of the Republican governing agenda in Congress in tatters. A proposed corporate tax overhaul favored by Trump and Ryan depended, in part, on the health-care legislation proceeding \u2014 creating both political momentum and fiscal space for dramatic action.\n\nBefore the bill was pulled Friday, Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.) called it the \u201cfirst big vote in the presidency of Donald Trump,\u201d one that would be \u201ca statement, not just about him and the administration but about the Republican Party and where we\u2019re headed.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo much about political power is about perception. And if the perception is that you can\u2019t get your first big initiative done, then that hurts the perceptions down the road about your ability to get other big things done,\u201d Byrne said.\n\nTrump had personally lobbied 120 lawmakers, either in person or on the phone, Spicer told reporters on Friday. The president, he said, had \u201cleft everything on the field.\u201d\n\nThe White House did not think that defeat would slow other parts of Trump\u2019s agenda, including tax reform and changes to immigration, Spicer added.\n\nVice President Pence, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price also engaged in last-ditch attempts to win over members Friday \u2014 including a midday huddle with Freedom Caucus members at the Capitol Hill Club, a GOP social hall next door to the headquarters of the Republican National Committee.\n\nThe heart of the argument made by GOP leaders was that keeping the Affordable Care Act would be a worse outcome than passing a potentially flawed replacement. That worked with some Republicans, but not all.\n\nRep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.), a Freedom Caucus member who said he would have voted for the bill, rejected the idea that the hard-liners were to blame.\n\n\u201cI thought we were constructive,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of the sensitivity of the issue, some of the normal compromise mechanism didn\u2019t quite get us there. That doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t get us there sometime in this Congress.\u201d\n\nAt the Capitol, a deflated Ryan said he would confer with fellow Republicans in the coming days about how to proceed, but he made clear health care would no longer be a central agenda item.\n\n\u201cMoving from an opposition party to a governing party comes with growing pains,\u201d Ryan told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re feeling those growing pains today.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoing big things is hard,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump said he had no problem waiting for Democrats to seek cooperation with Republicans on health care: \u201cI never said I was going to repeal and replace in the first 61 days.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Trump said repeatedly as a candidate and before his inauguration that he would work to repeal the ACA on his first day in office.\n\nDemocrats, completely sidelined as Republicans quarreled among themselves, quickly disputed Trump\u2019s accusations.\n\n\u201cThe blame falls with President Trump and with the Republicans,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement.\n\n\u201cSo much for the art of the deal,\u201d he added.\n\nKelsey Snell, Sean Sullivan, David Nakamura, David Weigel, John Wagner and Paul Kane contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-learns-that-deal-making-is-not-the-same-as-leadership/2017/03/24/34953772-10c5-11e7-9b0d-d27c98455440_story.html", "text": "President Trump has gotten a hard lesson from his first legislative debacle: Leadership takes more than being able to close a deal.\n\n\u201cI hope that Trump is going to learn from this that he has no choice except to be the chief legislator,\u201d said former House speaker Newt Gingrich. \u201cTrump has to start with the American people and come back to Congress. He can\u2019t start with arcane congressional procedures and go to the American people. That is exactly backward.\u201d\n\nNothing has more united Republicans over the past seven years than their vow to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut Trump provided little by way of specifics on how he intended to do that, beyond vague and sometimes contradictory statements.\n\nAs a candidate and as president, Trump stuck to glossy promises of a transformed medical system that would be \u201ca lot less expensive,\u201d provide \u201cgreat health care\u201d and \u201ctake care of everybody.\u201d\n\nView Graphic Which Republicans forced Trump to pull the health-care bill\n\nOutsourced to House Speaker Paul D.

Galston, a senior fellow in governance at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThey were there all along. It\u2019s not like this bill created them.\u201d\n\nTrump seemed a little taken aback by the hostility within his party, and particularly the resistance of the conservatives who call themselves the Freedom Caucus.\n\n(Alice Li,Jayne Orenstein/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cThere are years of problems, great hatred and distrust, and, you know, I came into the middle of it,\u201d he said in an interview with The Washington Post\u2019s Robert Costa.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s engagement at the end, to sell a bill that had been written in Ryan\u2019s office, came too late.\n\nIn retrospect, it is now apparent that more difficult and painstaking work should have been done on the front end, allowing input from various Republican factions into the bill\u2019s design and for aggressively making the case for it to a wary public.\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday showed just 17 percent of Americans saying they approved of the GOP bill. The Congressional Budget Office projected that 24 million fewer Americans would be insured 10 years from now if the legislation were enacted.\n\nAdding to the political challenge was the fact that the House bill was structured to conform to the legislative process, specifically to get around the threat of a filibuster in the Senate.\n\nMany of the proposals most popular among rank-and-file Republicans \u2014 such as allowing insurance companies to sell policies across state lines \u2014 were to be delayed.\n\n\u201cWe all learned a lot. We learned a lot about loyalty,\u201d Trump said after the decision to put the bill in limbo. \u201cWe learned a lot about the vote-getting process. We learned a lot about some very arcane rules in obviously both the Senate and in the House.\u201d\n\nIt was, in other words, business as usual.\n\nBut Trump was elected in part because he had promised not to abide by the normal way of doing things in Washington. \u201cTo have a process that said there\u2019s going to be Part 2 and Part 3 goes against the spirit of where we are now,\u201d Gingrich said.\n\nRyan blamed the result on \u201cthe growing pains of governing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were a 10-year opposition party, where being against things was easy to do. You just had to be against it,\u201d the speaker said. \u201cAnd now in three months\u2019 time we tried to go to a governing party where we actually had to get 216 people to agree with each other on how we do things.\u201d\n\nThe speaker insisted that the failure on health care should not be read as a prologue to what will happen with other big items on the GOP wish list.\n\n\u201cWe have even more agreement on the need and the nature of tax reform on funding the government, on rebuilding the military, on securing the border,\u201d Ryan said.\n\n[\u2018Hello, Bob\u2019: Trump called my cellphone to say the health-care bill was dead]\n\nBut history suggests that all of those are likely to demand a deep level of involvement and advocacy from the Oval Office.\n\nThe last president to achieve a major overhaul of the tax system, for instance, was Ronald Reagan in 1986. His Treasury Department began with a comprehensive, detailed proposal to back up his call for lower rates and a simplified system. But it still took nearly two years, major revisions and several near-death experiences to pull the legislation over the finish line.\n\nBack then, however, Republicans seeking to rewrite the tax code had significant numbers of Democratic allies. In the current polarized environment, the two parties rarely work together on anything.\n\nWith 237 votes in the House, Republicans have few to spare.\n\n\u201cWe need to get 216 people to agree with each other to write legislation, not 210, not 215,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nHe might have added one more: a president who is leading the way, rather than coming in at the close."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/what-happened-to-trumps-promise-to-repeal-and-replace-obamacare-on-day-1/2017/03/24/dd88afde-10e4-11e7-aa57-2ca1b05c41b8_video.html", "text": "- President Trump promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act \u201cimmediately\u201d and \u201con Day 1\u201d while on the campaign trail.

So that means they own Obamacare and when that explodes, they will come to us wanting to save whatever is left, and we\u2019ll make a real deal.\u201d\n\nThere was little evidence that either Trump or House Republicans made a serious effort to reach out to Democrats.\n\nStill, I wondered, why not whip some more votes this weekend and come back next week to the House with a revised piece of legislation?\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Trump said, \u201cwe could do that, too. But we didn\u2019t do that. It\u2019s always possible, but we pulled it.\u201d\n\nTrump brought up the vote count. \u201cWe were close,\u201d he said.\n\nHow close?\n\n\u201cI would say within anywhere from five to 12 votes,\u201d Trump said \u2014 although widespread reports indicated that at least three dozen Republicans opposed the measure.\n\n[There were at least three dozen Republicans opposed to the health-care bill\n\nThat must have hurt after all of his attempts to rally Republicans, I said. He made calls, had people over to the White House, invited House members on Air Force One.

We had great support among most Republicans but no Democratic votes. Zero. Not one.\u201d\n\nI mentioned to Trump that some of his allies were frustrated with Ryan. Did he share those frustrations, and would he be able to work with Ryan moving forward on plans to cut taxes and build an infrastructure package?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame Paul,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe then repeated the phrase: \u201cI don\u2019t blame Paul. He worked very hard on this.\u201d\n\nAnd again.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame Paul at all.\u201d\n\nAs he waits for Democrats, I asked, what\u2019s next on health care, if anything, policy-wise?\n\n\u201cTime will tell. Obamacare is in for some rough days. You understand that. It\u2019s in for some rough, rough days,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll fix it as it explodes,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to come to ask for help. They\u2019re going to have to. Here\u2019s the good news: Health care is now totally the property of the Democrats.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of premium increases, Trump said: \u201cWhen people get a 200 percent increase next year or a 100 percent or 70 percent, that\u2019s their fault.\u201d\n\nHe returned again to a partisan line on the turn of events.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, the biggest losers today are Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer,\u201d Trump said of the House minority leader and the Senate minority leader. \u201cBecause now they own the disaster known as Obamacare.\u201d\n\nOkay, I asked, they may own it, in his view, but he will at some point be tasked with shaping whatever comes forward as a partial replacement. What will that be? What kind of policy could he support?\n\n\u201cOh, lots of things can happen,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut the best would be if we could all get together and do a real health-care bill that would be good for the people, and that could very well happen.\u201d\n\nDoes Trump regret starting his agenda this year with health care?\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in a way I\u2019m glad I got it out of the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m a team player,\u201d Trump said of the Republican Party. \u201cI\u2019ve played this team. I\u2019ve played with the team. And they just fell a little bit short, and it\u2019s very hard when you need almost 100 percent of the votes and we have no votes, zero, from the Democrats. It\u2019s unheard of.\u201d\n\nWhat happened with the House Freedom Caucus, the hard-line conservatives he had wooed over and over again?\n\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s the big question,\u201d Trump said with a slight chuckle. \u201cDon\u2019t know. I have a good relationship with them, but I couldn\u2019t get them. They just wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nTrump alluded to long-running, simmering dramas on Capitol Hill, which he said had little to do with him, as a reason the Freedom Caucus could not back the bill.\n\n\u201cYears of hatred and distrust,\u201d he said. \u201cLong before me.\u201d\n\nWas Trump saying, perhaps, that the inability of Ryan and his team to work well with that caucus was part of why talks stalled?\n\n\u201cWell, look, you can say what you want,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut there are years of problems, great hatred and distrust, and, you know, I came into the middle of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they made a mistake, but that\u2019s okay,\u201d Trump said of the Freedom Caucus.\n\nAs we wrapped up, I tried to get some clarity. The president was blaming the Democrats and was willing to let the law \u201cexplode.\u201d Yet he also seemed to be teasing the possibility of doing something bipartisan down the road, a fresh start at some point.\n\nI asked: Would working on a bipartisan health-care deal a year from now be something he would find more agreeable than whipping the hard right?\n\n\u201cA lot of people might say that,\u201d Trump said, laughing. \u201cWe\u2019ll end up with a better health-care plan. A great plan. And you wouldn\u2019t need the Freedom Caucus.\u201d\n\nWhat about the moderates, the Tuesday Group?\n\n\u201cThey were great,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey were really great.\u201d\n\nHe turned once more to the Democrats.\n\n\u201cThey own it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve said that,\u201d I told him.\n\n\u201cThis is a process,\u201d Trump concluded, \u201cand it\u2019s going to work out very well.

When he offered a public statement a bit later, he\u2019d figured out the proper number:\n\nTrump: \"I never said 'repeal and replace it within 64 days.' \" \u2014 Matt Pearce (@mattdpearce) March 24, 2017\n\nTrump is correct: At no point in time did he pledge to repeal and replace Obamacare in 61 or 64 days. Instead, he pledged to demand a repeal on Day One \u2014 even if it took a special session of Congress to make it happen. He pledged on several occasions to repeal it \u201cimmediately.\u201d The message he conveyed to his voters was very much not that \u201cthis is something we will get to eventually\u201d but that this was something that would come first on the agenda.\n\nSome examples of what Trump said during the campaign and the presidential transition:\n\nInterview with ABC News, February 2016: \u201cI\u2019m going to work immediately to knock out Obamacare, and we are going to start taking care of our vets and the military.\u201d\n\nTwitter, February 2016:\n\nWe will immediately repeal and replace ObamaCare \u2013 and nobody can do that like me. We will save $'s and have much better healthcare! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2016\n\nCampaign website, March 2016: \u201cOn day one of the Trump Administration, we will ask Congress to immediately deliver a full repeal of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nCampaign website, August 2016: \u201cOne of my first acts as President will be to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare, saving another 2 million American jobs.\u201d\n\nRally in Ohio, September 2016: \u201cOn my first day I\u2019m going to ask Congress to immediately send me a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare.\u201d\n\nRally in Florida, October 2016: \u201cTogether we\u2019re going to deliver real change that once again puts Americans first. That begins with immediately repealing and replacing the disaster known as Obamacare. My first day in office, I am going to ask Congress to put a bill on my desk getting rid of this disastrous law and replacing it with reforms that expand choice, freedom, affordability.\u201d\n\nHe also said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be so easy.\u201d\n\nRally in Pennsylvania, November 2016: \u201cWhen we win on November 8th and elect a Republican Congress, we will be able to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare. I will ask Congress to convene a special session.\u201d\n\nAdviser Kellyanne Conway made the same argument in an Fox News interview, November 2016: Trump \u201calso has talked about convening a special session on January 20th after he is sworn in as President of the United States to do this very thing, to repeal and replace Obamacare\n\nInterview with the New York Times, January 2017: Trump said an Obamacare repeal vote would happen before his inauguration and replacement wold come \u201cvery quickly or simultaneously, very shortly thereafter.\u201d\n\nThere is one member of the administration who explicitly pledged a repeal of Obamacare on Day One. Mike Pence said it at a rally in Virginia in August 2016: On Day One, Trump \u201cis going to repeal every single Obama executive order, he is going to repeal Obamacare.\u201d\n\nBy insisting that he never promised quick action on Obamacare, Trump\u2019s trying to turn a loss into something more like a tie: The status quo is what it is and he will address it eventually. He\u2019s mastered the art of perception, including making it seem as though what he said in the past was perhaps a feint that\u2019s less important than what he\u2019s saying now.\n\nHe has not, however, mastered getting Congress to do what he wants."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trump-on-health-care-bill-we-couldnt-quite-get-there/2017/03/24/b93fee54-10d4-11e7-aa57-2ca1b05c41b8_video.html", "text": "- President Trump addressed his plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, saying he will let Obamacare \u201cexplode,\u201d before taking questions from the media on March 24 at the White House.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nI have not read Donald Trump\u2019s 1987 book \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d which is why I had a doorstop for breakfast. Over the course of 384 pages \u2014 including some glossy pages at the center of the paperback version with photographs from Trump\u2019s life and career \u2014 Trump spells out the principles that guided his success in the business world. To learn in detail what those are, you (or I) would have to read the book.\n\nOr we would have to read one of several distillations of that philosophy, which sprang up online after Trump announced his candidacy for the presidency of the United States.\n\nThere are, it seems, 11 core tenets to Trump\u2019s dealmaking. Trump would be among the first to admit that his ability to come out on top was not foolproof; he did, after all, also write a book called \u201cThe Art of the Comeback\u201d which doesn\u2019t get quite the same amount of play as the first. But it may gain new currency over the next few weeks as Trump and his Republican allies try to figure out a way forward after their big push to overhaul Obamacare, the American Health Care Act, flopped on Friday.\n\nWhy did the health-care bill founder? Perhaps in part because Trump \u2014 the guy who pledged during the campaign that only he could fix America\u2019s problems, largely by making the best deals \u2014 didn\u2019t adhere to those 11 key principles.\n\nTrump failed to uphold a number of these principles in the health-care fight. Let\u2019s walk through them.\n\nThink big.\n\nThink BIG! You are going to be thinking anyway, so you might as well think BIG! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 24, 2015\n\nStraightforward. Aim for a lot \u2014 perhaps more than you think you can achieve.\n\nDid Trump do this on health care? Not really. Trump seems to have offered little input at all into what the health-care bill looked like, given that it strays from some of the pledges he made on the campaign trail and after, like \u201cinsurance for everybody\u201d and protecting Medicaid.\n\nProtect the downside and the upside will take care of itself.\n\nWhen it comes to money, finance and even life, PROTECT THE DOWNSIDE AND THE UPSIDE WILL TAKE CARE OF ITSELF! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2013\n\nIn other words: If you can handle the worst-case scenario, you\u2019ll always end up with some sort of success.\n\nDid Trump do this on health care? We\u2019ll see. Trump\u2019s advocacy of the AHCA has already damaged how people view Trump. But lower approval may not be the worst-case scenario \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s probably hard to determine what the worst-case scenario in this enormously complicated fight might be. Trump may be sheltered from it, or may be positioning others to absorb the worst effects. But it\u2019s hard to see if that\u2019s the case at this moment.\n\nMaximize the options.\n\nLeave a number of deals open, so that you can pursue or abandon them as it makes sense.\n\nDid Trump do this on health care? Nope. The AHCA is and always has been the only game on the table for Republican leaders. There may be more options for restructuring Obamacare in the future, but the White House has gone all-or-nothing on the AHCA, explicitly. (Sean Spicer has said on at least one occasion that there is \u201cno Plan B.\u201d)\n\nOf course, there could be a whole new deal that emerges. But by having only one option on the table now, it meant there was no possible victory at hand once the AHCA collapsed.\n\nKnow your market.\n\nAnother straightforward tip. Know as much as you can about the arena in which you\u2019re fighting.\n\nDid Trump do this on health care? Again, no. Trump\u2019s never demonstrated a sense of how to move legislation through Congress, and at one point expressed surprise over the complexity of the health-care fight. Trump was not prepared to close this deal.\n\nUse your leverage.\n\nIt\u2019s always beneficial to negotiate from a position of power \u2014 but that means needing to know what power you hold in a relationship.\n\nDid Trump do this on health care? Yes. Trump doesn\u2019t have a lot of leverage over Congress, but he threatened to use his popularity against wayward Republicans. Granted, that threat is fairly hollow, but Trump did deploy it. What\u2019s more, he used the leverage of the office, calling members of the Republican caucus to the White House and forcing them to negotiate a solution. It didn\u2019t work, but he did it.\n\nEnhance your location.\n\nHere Trump twists the hoary old \u201clocation, location, location\u201d mantra in real estate on its head. The location of a property is important, but location can be somewhat subjective. Make the location itself more appealing and you make the property more appealing. Or, conversely, make the location less appealing and you might make the case for revamping it.\n\nDid Trump do this on health care? He and his allies tried. The latter is what Republicans tried to do. The location was the landscape of health coverage in the United States, and the AHCA the building that would replace the existing Obamacare structure. AHCA proponents argued that the location looked worse than they could demonstrate, but Americans weren\u2019t convinced.\n\nGet the word out.\n\nIf you don\u2019t publicize your successes, your competitors will be sure to belittle them. Get the word out! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2014\n\nTrump advocates for using the power of publicity to play up his successes and a vision of what he wants to accomplish.\n\nDid Trump do this on health care? Yes \u2014 but it may have backfired. Trump is always willing to promote what he\u2019s working on, and he did so with the AHCA, though more modestly than he promotes other things he\u2019s more interested in. The problem was that publicity was detrimental to perceptions of the bill, which is one reason Republicans hustled the bill as quickly as they did.\n\nFight back.\n\nWhen somebody challenges you, fight back \u2014 be tough! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 26, 2013\n\nSelf-explanatory.\n\nDid Trump do this on health care? Sort of. The problem with this fight is that Trump was fighting members of his own party. As mentioned above, he leveraged at least one threat, but the combination of his own apathy and his position within the party made his opponents less clear-cut than they might otherwise be.\n\nIn the wake of the AHCA\u2019s collapse, he identified a foe against whom he planned to fight: the Democrats. That could work, possibly \u2014 but for the next deal.\n\nDeliver the goods.\n\n@johnboehner @EricCantor \"You can't con people\u2026if you don't deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on.\" \u2013 The Art of the Deal \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 19, 2011\n\nIf you make a deal, you have to uphold your end of the bargain. (Granted, Trump hasn\u2019t always been great at fulfilling this ideal.)\n\nDid Trump do this on health care? If the goods were \u201ca deal,\u201d then: No.\n\nWe will immediately repeal and replace ObamaCare \u2013 and nobody can do that like me. We will save $'s and have much better healthcare! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2016\n\nContain the costs.\n\nTrump advises that you not rely on spending more money to make up for a faltering deal. Spend no more than you have to \u2014 in money, energy or effort.\n\nDid Trump do this on health care? Yes. On Thursday night, Trump cut off negotiations and demanded that the House vote up or down. He decided against expending more energy on a fight that it seemed clear was becoming intractable. Could the House have reached a deal if they\u2019d kept pushing? Perhaps. But it\u2019s also likely that they would have simply wasted more time and political capital.\n\nHave fun.\n\n\"People rarely succeed unless they have fun in what they are doing.\"\u2013 Andrew Carnegie \u2014 Donald J.

Asked if he supported mass deportation of illegal immigrants, he said: \u201cYES.

Republican Candidate for Governor of Virginia and former State Chair for Donald Trump for President,\u201d he began. \u201cThe primary election is June 13th. I am opposing the establishment\u2019s handpicked candidate, former Bush guy, RNC chairman, and cuckservative, Ed Gillespie.\u201d\n\nStewart\u2019s Reddit outing drew a rebuke Friday from the state\u2019s GOP chairman, John Whitbeck, who called some of Stewart\u2019s language \u201cracist.\u201d\n\nIn a written message to The Washington Post, Whitbeck said the term was \u201cnot acceptable in political discourse under any circumstances...No Republican should ever use this type of language in a campaign.\u201d\n\nWhitbeck noted that the term is \u201cused by white nationalists.\u201d\n\nGillespie spokesman Matthew Moran said: \u201dThis is just sad. It\u2019s certainly no way to build a party, no way to win elections, and no way to advance conservative principles.\u201d\n\nStewart said he unaware of any racial overtones to the term \u201ccuck,\u201d but he also questioned Whitbeck\u2019s authority to declare a word unacceptable for political discourse.\n\n\u201cWhat is he, the word pope?\u201d Stewart said. \u201cWho is he to say that? That\u2019s just ridiculous.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Stewart welcomed the attention. Trailing Gillespie in money and endorsements, Stewart has relied on controversy to fuel to his underdog bid in the June 13 primary. He also faces state Sen. Frank Wagner (Virginia Beach). Stewart is chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors and was chairman of Trump\u2019s Virginia campaign until late last year, when he was ousted for participating in an unauthorized protest against the Republican National Committee.\n\nIn another attention-grabbing move this week, Stewart declared at an appearance in Roanoke that \u201cthe most important thing in this campaign\u201d is the preservation of Charlottesville\u2019s Robert E. Lee statue, which the City Council wants removed. He then encouraged a woman in the crowd to unfurl a Confederate battle flag.\n\n\u201cFolks, this is a symbol of heritage,\u201d he said at the Roanoke gathering. \u201cIt is not a symbol of racism. It is not a symbol of slavery. I\u2019m proud to be here with this flag.\u201d\n\nIn an interview Friday, Stewart said, \u201cI don\u2019t fly the Confederate flag on my property, but I\u2019m not going to try to belittle or embarrass anybody who wants to do that. \u2026 I think these cultural issues are very important. I really do. I just think political correctness is a limitation on our First Amendment freedoms.\u201d\n\nStewart\u2019s use of term \u201ccuckservative\u201d were seen by some as another bid for outrage and attention. Stewart said he thought they were just slightly hipper terms for RINO, an insult for establishment Republicans that stands for Republican In Name Only.\n\nStewart has been attacking Gillespie, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee who worked as a counselor to President George W. Bush, as \u201cEstablishment Ed.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019d never heard the words until a few weeks ago, when he started making arrangements to do the Reddit forum.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started talking to Reddit, they dropped the word \u2018cuckservative.\u2019 They were asking me to describe Gillespie. I said, \u2018He\u2019s a RINO,\u2019\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThey said, \u2018Is he a cuck?\u2019 . . . I said, \u2018Hey, what\u2019s that?\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s a fake conservative.\u2019\u201d\n\nStewart said he adopted the term for the forum because \u201cthat\u2019s the lingo of young conservatives who are on Reddit.\u201d\n\nIn Washington Post story on political insults sdescribes \u201ccuck\u201d as \u201can arch-conservative insult that has come to mean, essentially, a girly man.\u201d\n\n[From \u2018nasty woman\u2019 to \u2018failing pile of garbage,\u2019 when an insult becomes a badge of honor]\n\nStewart also stood by his comments about former President Clinton. He said he was referring to a former campaign volunteer\u2019s accusation that Clinton raped her in 1978, when he was Arkansas attorney general running for governor. She later denied the accusation, and then recanted the denial. Clinton has denied the allegation, which surfaced 20 years later.\n\n\u201cYeah, I think he is a rapist, I really do,\u201d he said. \u201c They asked for my opinion.

Schiff (Calif.), did not mince words in signaling that he believes the White House may have been behind this week\u2019s twists and turns, discrediting the House probe in the process.\n\nSchiff told reporters Friday that the events appeared to stem from Comey\u2019s rejection in Monday\u2019s public hearing \u2014 and repeated debunking by lawmakers, including Republicans \u2014 of Trump\u2019s March 4 claims that he was wiretapped at Trump Tower by President Barack Obama during the campaign.\n\nSchiff pointed to what he called a \u201cdead of the night\u201d excursion this week by Nunes in which the chairman claimed to see intelligence that worried him pertaining to Trump and his associates.\n\n\u201cThat effort to defend the indefensible has led us down this terrible rabbit hole and threatens the only investigation that is authorized in the House,\u201d Schiff said, referring to Trump\u2019s original wiretapping claims.\n\nSchiff also \u201cstrongly objected\u201d to the sudden cancellation by Nunes of an open committee hearing early next week. Scheduled to appear were former acting attorney general Sally Yates (who was fired by Trump for refusing to back his first travel ban); former CIA director John Brennan; and former director of national intelligence James R. Clapper Jr.\n\nSchiff argued that this week\u2019s developments suggest the need for an independent commission and that the Intelligence Committee probe may not be credible anymore.\n\nAs for whether he has lost faith in Nunes, Schiff said, \u201cThe [House] speaker needs to decide just as well as our chairman whether there is a credible investigation here.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters Friday, Nunes said he is not expecting to receive the full trove of documents he referred to earlier in the week from intelligence agencies. The documents were expected to show whether individual names were \u201cunmasked\u201d as part of \u201cincidental collection\u201d through other surveillance or through legal surveillance of foreign entities that may pick up communications with American citizens.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect the entirety of everything that we need today, so I would hope that by early next week we would have better accounting of what the National Security Agency is able to provide us,\u201d Nunes said. He noted that the NSA is \u201cfully cooperating\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s possible we will receive documents today.\u201d\n\nUnder questioning from reporters, Nunes would not say \u2014 for the third day straight \u2014 whether the source who provided him with those documents came from or was affiliated with the White House. He denied only that the White House had orchestrated his decision to approach the press before briefing fellow committee members.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/can-trump-keep-his-health-care-promises-and-close-a-deal-with-congress/2017/03/24/9b24f5d6-10b1-11e7-aa57-2ca1b05c41b8_video.html", "text": "- President Trump sold himself as a dealmaker in the 2016 campaign, calling himself an expert negotiator.

Here are the key turning points in their fight to pass the bill. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nOne thing that\u2019s worth keeping in mind about Donald Trump is that his path to the White House was unusually tricky. He was the first winning presidential candidate in the modern era of politics to get less than 50 percent of the total vote in both the primary and the general elections. He won more electoral votes than his opponent, but far fewer actual votes \u2014 a nearly 3-million-vote margin for his opponent, by far the worst popular-vote loss for any winning president.\n\nThe point is that, while Trump has won far more elections than most people, his strength isn\u2019t exactly electoral politics. Over the course of the primaries, it was clear that his campaign\u2019s ability to organize voters was lacking, costing him victory in the Iowa caucuses and, later, delegates in Colorado. He still won, of course, but it\u2019s not clear that he has a strong ability to ensure an electoral victory or loss.\n\nThat\u2019s important Friday morning, the morning of the vote on the wavering Republican health-care bill known as the American Health Care Act, for a perhaps obvious reason. Trump has presumably learned by now that his ability to twist arms or push his will on members of Congress through sheer force of personality is limited. Earlier this week, he offered a more concrete threat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to come after you, but I know I won\u2019t have to, because I know you\u2019ll vote \u2018yes,\u2019 \u201d he said to Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who has led the conservative opposition to the AHCA. In political terms, \u201ccome after you\u201d has a simple translation: I will ensure you\u2019re kicked out of office.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer repeatedly asserted that President Trump has done \"everything\" to try to pass the GOP-proposed American Health Care Act during his briefing on March 24 at the White House. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nIt\u2019s a threat that\u2019s often made against elected officials \u2014 but much more rarely by a president, much less against a member of his own party.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through the calculus that Meadows is likely considering, then: Does Trump actually pose a threat if he weighs in against a House candidate?\n\nThe overarching caveat to all of this is that the November 2018 elections are 19 lifetimes from now, and a lot can change between now and then. So we\u2019re left considering a world in which poll numbers mirror what they are today. And today, it\u2019s hard to see how Trump\u2019s threat carries much weight.\n\nTrump\u2019s greatest strength is his core of fervent support, the cluster of devoted voters who powered him through the early primaries and never wavered in the general. The people who come out to those rallies. But it\u2019s not at all clear whether he can translate that energy toward someone else.\n\nIn 2010, there was some question as to whether the coalition of voters who surged to the polls for Barack Obama in 2008 would, at Obama\u2019s urging, again turn out to vote. They did not, and the Democrats got blown out. This wasn\u2019t Obama targeting a particular person, but it still revealed that his energy didn\u2019t translate two years later. Exit polling tells us that 9 percent of Trump\u2019s voters in 2016 were first-time voters; that\u2019s a lot of people who are probably much less likely to turn out in 2018.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, there are no signs at the moment that Trump will have expanded that base of support much by next fall. His approval ratings have slipped from their already-low starting position. His Gallup approval numbers are substantially lower than most other new presidents \u2014 and are even lower than some presidents saw over the length of their entire terms.\n\nWe're nearing confidence interval separation on Trump's approval rating: https://t.co/t264Sf5dGa pic.twitter.com/NgYD1bRCs2 \u2014 Micah Cohen (@micahcohen) March 24, 2017\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the bill itself is deeply unpopular. A Quinnipiac University poll released on Thursday found that 17 percent of the country approves of the proposal, with 43 percent disapproving. Oh, my apologies: That\u2019s 43 percent strongly disapproving. Overall, 56 percent disapprove of the bill, including a quarter of Republicans and nearly 6 in 10 independents.\n\nThat\u2019s good news for the Mark Meadows of the world. Should an opponent try to frame opposition to the AHCA as being a failure to uphold a pledge to overhaul Obamacare \u2014 the operating premise of the legislation \u2014 Meadows can rely on broad public dissatisfaction with the way in which that overhaul was proposed. There\u2019s enough critique of the legislation to power a rebuttal in any direction: Conservatives can say it didn\u2019t go far enough and moderates that it went too far, with outside analysis to back them up.\n\nIt\u2019s very much worth remembering that part of the 2010 blowout was blowback from the Obamacare vote earlier that year. As debate over that legislation went forward, opinion of it slipped \u2014 but it was still more positively viewed by the time the House voted on it than the AHCA is now.\n\nSo we have:\n\n\u2022 A broadly unpopular president\n\n\u2022 Backing an even-more-unpopular bill\n\n\u2022 Using the threat of electoral loss as a stick, despite having only won the weakest presidential victory in American history.\n\nSure he can hold rallies of thousands of his supporters in contested districts. But House votes are determined by more than a few thousand votes, and many more people might lose or drop coverage under the bill in many districts than will attend a Trump rally. That recent rally in Kentucky doesn\u2019t seem to have done much to change Sen. Rand Paul\u2019s mind, did it?\n\nThis is probably why members of Congress don\u2019t seem to be worried about the threat. Politico\u2019s Playbook reports that members of Meadows\u2019 conservative Freedom Caucus \u201cdon\u2019t care about the president or his threats. Same goes for many of the moderates against the legislation.\u201d\n\nTrump was elected as the guy who could make deals, but that\u2019s a lot harder on Capitol Hill than at the New York City zoning board. So instead, he\u2019s at times resorted to his other favorite tool: threats and attacks. Those don\u2019t seem like they\u2019ll be much more effective."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/blame-game-trump-casts-immigrants-as-dangerous-criminals-the-evidence-shows-otherwise/2017/03/23/f12dffdc-0f4d-11e7-9d5a-a83e627dc120_story.html", "text": "Immigrants collect their belongings before being deported across an international bridge into Mexico on March 14, 2017, from Hidalgo, Tex. (John Moore/Getty Images)\n\nThe Trump administration is launching a series of steps aimed at publicly spotlighting the alleged dangers posed by illegal immigrants, as it seeks to bolster political support for the need for stricter enforcement.\n\nThis week the administration released a list of cities that have not fully cooperated with federal immigration authorities, and soon the Department of Homeland Security will unveil an office staffed by more than two dozen employees tasked with closely assisting families of Americans who were victims of violent crimes by undocumented foreigners.\n\nDHS lawyers also are examining federal privacy laws to determine ways to more freely share potentially incriminating personal information on immigrants among government agencies and release it publicly, including the nationality, immigration status and criminal history of those swept up in enforcement raids.\n\nAnd on Thursday, the Justice Department specifically highlighted immigration offenses and arrests during the release of its annual federal statistics report.\n\n(The Washington Post)\n\nAdministration officials said the strategy is intended to reframe the political debate over immigration reform from what they view as a misplaced emphasis on the well-being of the nation\u2019s estimated 11 million illegal immigrants to the negative impacts their presence can have on local communities.\n\nAt the White House, President Trump has on several occasions used the bully pulpit to highlight some of the most sensational crimes by immigrants, and he met in the Oval Office with family members of their victims.\n\n\u201cWe are providing a voice to those who have been ignored,\u201d Trump said during his prime-time address to Congress last month before highlighting each of the families\u2019 stories.\n\n\u201cThese brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations,\u201d Trump said to two widows of law enforcement officials killed in the line of duty. \u201cShould have never been in our country.\u201d\n\nBut critics, including civil rights advocates and immigration lawyers, said the Trump administration is purposely inflating the dangers and scapegoating a wide swath of immigrants to manipulate public fears and create more political support for its hard-line policies.\n\nAlthough federal data are limited, two reports released this month \u2014 by the Sentencing Project and the libertarian Cato Institute \u2014 confirmed past studies that immigrants, including those here illegally, commit crimes at lower rates than do native-born Americans.\n\n\u201cThe big picture concern is that the administration\u2019s policies seem premised on the idea that immigration status is some kind of indicator for criminality, when in fact that is not at all the case,\u201d said Gregory Chen, advocacy director for the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \u201cWhy is this administration so hyper-focused on making the connection between crime and immigration?\u201d\n\nTrump has been making that connection from his first campaign speech in June 2015, when he referred to Mexican immigrants as rapists, criminals and drug dealers. He appeared at campaign events with \u201cangel moms\u201d whose children had been killed by undocumented immigrants.\n\nBeyond illegal immigration, Trump has characterized legal immigrants as potential terrorist threats in his attempts to enact a ban on refugees and travelers from several majority-Muslim nations. Although his two travel-ban orders have been blocked in federal court, the most recent one included a provision mandating that the government begin publicizing information about acts of \u201cgender-based violence against women,\u201d including \u201chonor killings,\u201d in the United States by foreign nationals.\n\nIn a visit to DHS in January, during which he signed a pair of executive orders to ramp up deportations in the United States, Trump said, \u201cPundits talk about how enforcing immigration laws can separate illegal immigrant families, but the families they don\u2019t talk about are the families of Americans.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s focus on those families, through the new office called Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE), represents a sharp break in rhetoric from his predecessor. President Barack Obama emphasized a balance between upholding the law and showing empathy toward immigrants who had not committed crimes, particularly those known \u201cdreamers\u201d who arrived in the country illegally as children and were often depicted as hard-working strivers.\n\nThis week, White House press secretary Sean Spicer cited a rape case at a high school in Rockville, Md., in which the two alleged teenage perpetrators were in the country illegally as rationale for Trump\u2019s hard-line policies.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason that the president has made illegal immigration and a crackdown such a big deal is because of tragedies like this,\u201d Spicer said, in response to a question about the case. \u201cThis is why he\u2019s passionate about this, because people are victims of these crimes. . . . Immigration pays its toll on our people, if it\u2019s not done legally, and this is another example.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s allies also have featured coverage of sensational crimes by immigrants. Breitbart, the conservative news site previously overseen by senior White House adviser Stephen K. Bannon, regularly devotes a section on its home page to such content.\n\nTrump aims to shine the spotlight on the fact that \u201cbad immigration policy has consequences for American families,\u201d said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration levels. \u201cWhen [the media] do sob stories about families that are separated because a drunk-driving father is deported, okay, but there are plenty of victim stories among Americans, too.\u201d\n\nInside DHS, career officials at Immigration and Customs Enforcement are said to be relieved by the Trump administration\u2019s new guidelines, said one career official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.\n\nThe official said the staff used to joke wryly that Obama\u2019s policies amounted to \u201cprosecutorial discretion by news conference,\u201d meaning deportation proceedings against immigrants would be dropped based on the amount of negative publicity the cases got from advocacy groups.\n\n\u201cThere was a great sense of frustration among agents and officers that even when we were clearly in the right we were not allowed to robustly defend ourselves at times we felt we should,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe number of deportations, which had peaked under Obama at the end of his first term, fell sharply during his second as the administration implemented policies targeting enforcement actions against hardened criminals and those who had recently arrived in the country.\n\nThis week, DHS took the first step toward a more robust public-relations strategy as mandated by Trump\u2019s executive orders, publishing a list of 206 local jurisdictions \u2014 to be updated weekly \u2014 that refused to detain jailed immigrants beyond their release dates so that the federal government could take them into custody and try to deport them.\n\nThe move to name and shame the jurisdictions is aimed at putting public pressure on them to cooperate \u2014 especially sanctuary cities that do not want immigrants to fear the police or be deported for minor traffic offenses. Trump has threatened to withhold some federal funds from such cities.\n\nJohn Sandweg, former acting director of ICE, rejected the notion that the Obama administration was lenient on criminal immigrants. Rather, he said, the number that had committed serious offenses, such as murder, rape, being involved in drug deals or driving while intoxicated, was relatively small.\n\n\u201cWhen we had broader [enforcement] priorities, we were snatching up a lot of nonpublic safety threats but burning a lot of resources,\u201d Sandweg said. Trump is \u201ctrying to mislead the public into thinking that 11 million people are a threat. That\u2019s not true. It\u2019s a very small subset that are a threat. The way to enhance public safety the most is to keep ICE focused on that small percentage.\u201d\n\nInstead, Trump\u2019s executive orders significantly expand the pool of immigrants that are considered priorities for removal, a strategy, critics said, to help the president more easily boost deportations and fulfill his campaign promises.\n\n\u201cWe are going to get the bad ones out \u2014 the criminals and the drug dealers and gangs and gang members and cartel leaders,\u201d Trump said during his visit to DHS. But his critics predicted ICE will begin targeting those with outstanding removal orders based on relatively minor infractions or those checking in with parole officers.\n\n\u201cIf the facts were aligned with what they say about the criminality of immigrants, they wouldn\u2019t have to play up these horrible anecdotes,\u201d said Alex Nowrasteh, a co-author of the Cato immigration crime report. \u201cI see it as a political tactic to support a policy agenda. It\u2019s policymaking by fear, not fact.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/gop-health-care-plan-hangs-in-balance-as-house-leaders-push-for-thursday-floor-vote/2017/03/23/6e8bf05a-0fbd-11e7-9d5a-a83e627dc120_story.html", "text": "President Trump delivered an ultimatum to House Republicans on Thursday night: Vote to approve the measure to overhaul the nation\u2019s health-care system on the House floor Friday, or reject it and the president will move on to his other legislative priorities.\n\nThe president, through his aides in a closed-door meeting, signaled that the time for negotiations was over with rank-and-file Republicans who were meeting late at night on Capitol Hill to try to find common ground on the embattled package crafted by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.).\n\nThe move was a high-risk gamble for the president and the speaker, who have invested significant political capital in passing legislation that would replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act. For Trump, who campaigned as a skilled negotiator capable of forging a good deal on behalf of Americans, it could either vindicate or undercut one of his signature claims. If the measure fails, it would be a defeat for Trump in his first effort to help pass major legislation and it may also jeopardize other items on his wish list, including a tax overhaul and infrastructure spending.\n\nDefeat would also mean that Obamacare \u2014 something that congressional Republicans have railed against for seven years \u2014 would remain in place.\n\n\u201cDisastrous #Obamacare has led to higher costs & fewer options. It will only continue to get worse! We must #RepealANDReplace. #PassTheBill,\u201d Trump tweeted from his official presidential account as the meeting was wrapping up Thursday night.\n\n(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nIt was far from clear, however, that Ryan and Trump have the votes to muscle the package through the House after several members of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus refused to back it following a marathon session of negotiations Thursday with Trump and other top aides.\n\nPost-meeting, a handful of Republicans announced they would back the legislation. But a larger number said they were still opposed or had yet to make up their minds.\n\n\u201cFor seven and a half years we have been promising the American people that we will repeal and replace this broken law, because it\u2019s collapsing and it\u2019s failing families,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cAnd tomorrow we\u2019re proceeding.\u201d\n\nBut the speaker refused to answer shouted questions from reporters after the meeting about whether he had the votes for passage.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to bring it up, pass or fail,\u201d said Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho).\n\nIn the meeting with House Republicans on Thursday night, according to Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney told his former colleagues \u201cthe president needs this, the president has said he wants a vote tomorrow up or down.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf for any reason it\u2019s down, we\u2019re just going to move forward with additional parts of his agenda,\u201d Collins described Mulvaney as saying. \u201cThis is our moment in time.\u201d\n\nView Graphic How health care amendments appease GOP moderates and hard-liners\n\nA key moment inside the session, several lawmakers said, was when Rep. Brian Mast (R-Fla.), a freshman lawmaker who lost both his legs in 2010 while serving as an Army bomb disposal technician in Afghanistan, rose and called on his colleagues to unite behind the bill in the same way he and his comrades fought in battle.\n\nA rowdy group of Republicans burst out of the meeting like explorers on a quest for glory. \u201cBurn the ships,\u201d one Republican shouted to House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (La.), invoking the command that Hernan Cortes, the Spanish conquistador, gave his men upon landing in Mexico in 1519.\n\nThe message was clear, to the GOP leaders now and the Spaniards in 1519, there was no turning back.\n\n\u201cOnly way to do it,\u201d Scalise told a packed elevator of lawmakers.\n\nLeaders continued to plead with individual lawmakers to support the measure well into Thursday night, with the House Rules Committee slated to meet early Friday morning to consider the proposed changes.\n\nRyan got down on a knee to plead with Rep. Don Young, an 83-year-old from Alaska who is the longest-serving Republican in Congress and remains undecided.\n\nWhen the speaker finished with Young, he spent about 10 minutes in an animated discussion with Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), one of the bill\u2019s most outspoken critics. At one point, the speaker took his own arms and held them up, his hands at face level, then slowly lowered them to his waist \u2014 presumably trying to demonstrate his belief that the bill will lower costs.\n\nThe ongoing effort to whip the vote, Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.) said at one point, involved \u201cback-patting and butt-kicking.\u201d\n\n\u201cDemocracy\u2019s messy,\u201d he added.\n\nRyan had intended to bring up his plan for a vote Thursday. But criticism \u2014 mainly from conservatives \u2014 caused that strategy to unravel after Freedom Caucus members rejected Trump\u2019s offer to strip a key set of mandates from the nation\u2019s current health-care law. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Trump chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon trooped up to Ryan\u2019s office to make the case personally, warning recalcitrant conservatives that the only alternative would be to accept the ACA as the law of the land.\n\nBy evening, leaders adopted the proposed change conservatives had rebuffed earlier, eliminating the law\u2019s \u201cessential benefits\u201d that insurers must offer under the ACA in an effort to reduce premium costs. Those benefits include covering mental-health treatment, wellness visits, and maternity and newborn care, and states would have the option of adding them back next year.\n\nThey also added one sweetener for moderates, a six-year delay in repealing a 0.9 percent additional Medicare tax on high-income Americans who earn above $200,000 if filing individually, or $250,000 if married and filing jointly. By keeping the tax in place, GOP leaders could provide an additional $15 billion to the states to help cover treatment for mental health and substance abuse issues, as well as maternity and infant care.\n\nMeanwhile, a new analysis by the Congressional Budget Office released Thursday evening showed that changes House leaders made to the bill Monday do not alter a projection that 24 million more Americans would be uninsured by 2026 under the bill. In addition, the updated bill would cut the deficit by $150 billion over the next decade \u2014 nearly $200 billion less than the earlier version of the legislation.\n\n[Graphic: Health-care bill changes aimed at wooing moderates and the far-right]\n\nThe changes include a couple of conservative overhauls to the Medicaid program and language directing that $85 billion be used to help Americans ages 50 to 64 obtain coverage.\n\nIt was unclear how the new CBO score would affect legislative support for the bill.\n\nBut it was lawmakers on the right eager to dismantle the current health-care law who remained GOP leaders\u2019 biggest problem.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still a \u2018no\u2019 on the bill,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who chairs the Freedom Caucus. \u201cI think it\u2019s the president leading, and I applaud him for leading.\u201d\n\nSome key moderates are also against the bill. Rep. Dan Donovan (R-N.Y.), who has known Trump for decades and whose Staten Island district swung heavily toward the Republican candidate, left the meeting committed to voting no.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to think about the 744,000 people I represent,\u201d he said. Asked about the White House\u2019s message that killing the bill would leave no more chances for repeal, he shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer said during an appearance Thursday night on Fox News that the president remained confident the bill would pass.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, this is the only train leaving the station that\u2019s going to repeal Obamacare,\u201d he said, adding that Trump always knew winning a majority would be tough.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to see the same level of success\u201d as in last year\u2019s campaign, Spicer said. \u201cHe\u2019s left nothing in the field.\u201d\n\nTrump devoted much of his day to personally lobbying members. Speaking to a group of trucking executives and employees at a White House event aimed at showing how the ACA had driven up the industry\u2019s costs, Trump joked that he did not have much time to mingle.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to make it too long, because I have to get votes,\u201d Trump said, sparking laughter. \u201cI don\u2019t want to spend too much time with you. I\u2019m going to lose by one vote, and then I\u2019m going to blame the truckers.\u201d\n\nThis high-wire balancing act, in which Republicans are catering to conservatives in the House with the knowledge that they still must woo moderates to get legislation to Trump\u2019s desk, could not only reshape the nation\u2019s health-care system but could also have uncertain electoral repercussions for the new majority.\n\nGOP leaders can afford only 21 or 22 defections, depending on how many Democrats are present Friday.\n\nBut with failure not a viable option, Ryan and Trump have been working furiously to win over the large voting bloc of conservatives who control the House bill\u2019s fate.\n\n[Conservatives want these essential benefits abolished under a new deal]\n\nPassage of the bill would represent a major political victory for both the White House and House leaders, although the ultimate fate of the legislation hinges on the Senate. There are at least a dozen skeptics of the bill among Senate Republicans, who maintain a slim 52-to-48 advantage, and many of them want to maintain some of the current law\u2019s more generous spending components.\n\nDemocrats relished the GOP\u2019s predicament. Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, who had scheduled a 4 p.m. rally against the bill, turned it into a short-term declaration of victory.\n\n\u201cRemember, they wanted to have their repeal and replace ready when Trump was inaugurated,\u201d said Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.). \u201cNow, here we are \u2014 they don\u2019t have it, again. They\u2019re looking for a sweet spot, and they won\u2019t find one.\u201d\n\n[Americans worry, cheer as Congress moves to upend the Affordable Care Act]\n\nFormer president Barack Obama, for his part, issued a statement noting that more than 20 million Americans have gained coverage since he signed the law in 2010, while the rise in health-care costs has slowed. The statement came on the seventh anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 a day that Republicans had hoped to mark by dismantling it.\n\n\u201cSo the reality is clear: America is stronger because of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Obama said, adding that Republicans are welcome to work with Democrats to improve the law. \u201cBut we should start from the baseline that any changes will make our health-care system better, not worse, for hard-working Americans. That should always be our priority.\u201d\n\n[A question about the impact of the ACA and beyond elicits almost 1,200 answers]\n\nDavid Weigel, Kelsey Snell, John Wagner, Paul Kane, Ed O\u2019Keefe and Karoun Demirjian contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/with-no-carrots-to-dangle-cajoling-recalcitrant-lawmakers-on-a-nail-biter-vote-is-hard/2017/03/23/8d6f87b0-0fd2-11e7-9d5a-a83e627dc120_story.html", "text": "The modern congressional whip operation shifted into high gear this week as House Republican leaders scrambled to find support for their plan to overhaul the health-care system.\n\nBut House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) does not have the tools that previous speakers once used to win over recalcitrants before cliffhanger votes.\n\nFor some of these lawmakers, the health bill would be a lot easier to digest with a side of pork \u2014 some earmarked funding to show they deliver for their district. But earmarks were banished by Ryan\u2019s predecessor, John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), with Ryan\u2019s support, when Republicans took charge in 2011.\n\nAdditionally, the old promise of political support for casting tough votes doesn\u2019t carry the same weight. One key bloc of voters Ryan needs, the moderates, mostly comes from districts where President Trump lost to Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. These Republicans see political separation from Trump as their path to survival in 2018. Offers from the president to appear in their districts or host fundraisers are virtually worthless.\n\nAs a result, Ryan is in the same predicament that Boehner had been in during his five years as speaker: trying to pass the most conservative bill possible without losing too many moderates \u2014 with the far right balking that the measure still wouldn\u2019t go far enough.\n\n(Bastien Inzaurralde,Sarah Parnass,Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nRyan\u2019s only real tools are fiddling with the policy inside the legislation, and as Ryan and Trump learned the hard way Thursday, that\u2019s never an easy task. After a day of shuttle diplomacy, Ryan and Trump still lacked the votes to approve what has previously been an easy rite of baptism in Republican circles: the repeal of Obamacare.\n\nThe day began with Trump hosting members of the conservative Freedom Caucus in the White House to hear their pitch to shift the legislation dramatically to the right, trying to wipe out insurance guarantees for such coverage as maternity care. Before that meeting could even reach its inconclusive finish, moderates had already rebelled.\n\nReps. Charlie Dent (Pa.), Frank A. LoBiondo (N.J.) and Christopher H. Smith (N.J.) joined a growing list of Republicans from the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest who announced their opposition. Unlike some moderates, these three are all safely ensconced in their districts and face no political worry back home.\n\nOne by one, they each subtly made the same proclamation: The current Affordable Care Act might be a mess, but it\u2019s better than Ryan\u2019s proposed mix that would leave 24 million more uninsured by 2026 and those with insurance getting worse coverage.\n\nThe moderate Tuesday Group, which Dent chairs, reiterated this message to Ryan\u2019s leadership team at an early afternoon meeting.\n\nBy 5 p.m., the roles had switched: Conservatives shuttled into Ryan\u2019s office, while moderates headed to the White House.\n\nAnd then the entire House Republican Conference convened around 7 p.m. to try to hash out the family feud between two voting blocs that \u2014 with about several dozen members of the Freedom Caucus and several dozen in the Tuesday Group \u2014 both have the power to blow up the deal.\n\nView Graphic How health care amendments appease GOP moderates and hard-liners\n\nIn the end, it was all to no avail, as the planned vote on the critical legislation was delayed until Friday.\n\n[Trump to GOP critics of health-care bill: \u2018I\u2019m gonna come after you\u2019]\n\nThe recurring message, from the president and the speaker, has been that the GOP team has to stick together. While not perfect, this bill would impale the ACA, setting up momentum for more pieces to replace the health law and on tax cuts.\n\nBut Ryan and his team are dealing with newcomers who are unswayed by calls for loyalty. During a series of unrelated votes Wednesday, as his lieutenants scurried across the chamber in search of support for the health bill, the speaker spent about 10 minutes with a few junior members, including Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), who replaced Boehner after he was run out of Congress in October 2015 by the Freedom Caucus.\n\nWhat was Davidson\u2019s first act after he was sworn in to Boehner\u2019s southwestern Ohio seat? He joined the Freedom Caucus. Now, he is supporting the changes that the group is trying to add to Ryan\u2019s American Health Care Act.\n\nFormally, Ryan\u2019s team had called Thursday \u201cgo time,\u201d vowing to hold the vote whether it was headed for victory or defeat. \u201cI think probably what\u2019s happening is, it\u2019s starting to really sink in to people that we are going to have a vote tomorrow,\u201d Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), a member of the whip team, said Wednesday.\n\nBut the rank-and-file Republicans called Ryan\u2019s bluff, and just as Boehner did many times before him, he pulled the bill from consideration Thursday. He canceled his weekly Thursday conference and made a brief appearance to formally announce that the vote would come Friday.\n\nWith no carrots to offer lawmakers, today\u2019s leaders still have some sticks \u2014 Trump seemed to joke Tuesday in a meeting with House Republicans that he would not support their 2018 reelection bids if they oppose him.\n\nHowever, for those staunch conservatives worried about a Trump-inspired primary challenge, there\u2019s a different force that might neutralize any benefit of keeping the president happy. A pair of conservative groups with ties to the industrialist Koch brothers, who oppose the bill\u2019s current makeup, announced Wednesday night that they will throw significant financial support behind Republicans who defy Ryan and Trump.\n\nThe other form of punishment \u2014 removing rebels from prized committee assignments \u2014 also has its drawbacks. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) led the effort four years ago to boot a handful of antagonists off key panels, only to see those lawmakers become heroes in right-wing media circles.\n\nIn 2015, when McCarthy was the heir to succeed Boehner, those once-punished Republicans led the rebellion to block McCarthy\u2019s promotion.\n\n[Can Paul Ryan pull this off, or is he headed for a brutal defeat?]\n\nAll this has left Ryan and Trump\u2019s advisers trying to tinker with policy provisions, all too aware that each tick to the right or left has a recurring echo that loses votes from the opposite ideological wing of the caucus.\n\nUltimately, the whip team tried to make an existential argument to find the final votes to win Thursday\u2019s expected vote: Republicans have been saying they would repeal the Affordable Care Act for seven years, and if they don\u2019t do that now, it will be a political disaster for the GOP and leave in place a law they despise.\n\n\u201cThe future of our Republican Party in Congress \u2014 and the welfare of generations of Americans and their health care \u2014 is on the line,\u201d Hudson said, adding how the stars aligned, finally, with a Republican Congress and president. \u201cThe American people gave us this opportunity, and shame on us if we squander this opportunity.\u201d\n\nRead more from Paul Kane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/gorsuch-confirmation-hearing-to-focus-today-on-testimony-from-friends-foes/2017/03/23/14d21116-0fc7-11e7-9d5a-a83e627dc120_story.html", "text": "Senate hearings on Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch ended Thursday on a confrontational note, with the body\u2019s top Democrat vowing a filibuster that could complicate Gorsuch\u2019s expected confirmation and ultimately upend the traditional approach to approving justices.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said he will vote no on President Trump\u2019s nominee and asked other Democrats to join him in blocking an up-or-down vote on Gorsuch.\n\nUnder Senate rules, it requires 60 votes to overcome such an obstacle. Republicans eager to confirm Gorsuch before their Easter recess \u2014 and before the court concludes hearing the current term of cases next month \u2014 have only 52 senators.\n\nRepublicans have vowed Gorsuch will be confirmed even if it means overhauling the way justices have long been approved. Traditionally, senators can force the Senate to muster a supermajority just to bring up the nomination of a Supreme Court justice. If that is reached, the confirmation requires a simple majority.\n\nIn a speech on the Senate floor, Schumer said: \u201cIf this nominee cannot earn 60 votes \u2014 a bar met by each of President Obama\u2019s nominees and George Bush\u2019s last two nominees \u2014 the answer isn\u2019t to change the rules. It\u2019s to change the nominee.\u201d\n\n(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 liberal base has been pressuring senators to block Trump\u2019s nominees across the government. But Schumer stopped short of saying that his entire Democratic caucus would join him in opposition to Gorsuch, leaving political space for some Democrats to find ways to work with Republicans.\n\nDemocrats may not have the votes to block Gorsuch, 49, who has been on the Denver-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the last decade and was nominated to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant since Justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly in February 2016.\n\nSeveral Democrats, especially those facing upcoming reelection battles in states that Trump won, are facing opposition from conservative organizations bankrolling a multimillion-dollar ad campaign designed to bolster Gorsuch.\n\nThere are also competing views among Democrats about whether to filibuster Gorsuch\u2019s nomination \u2014 which could provoke the Republican majority to rewrite the rules \u2014 or instead avoid confrontation and preserve the filibuster threat for the future. Retaining the filibuster could force Trump to select a relatively moderate nominee if in the coming years he gets a chance to replace a second Supreme Court justice.\n\nAmong recent Supreme Court nominees, the 60-vote threshold has not caused a problem. President Barack Obama\u2019s choices of Sonia Sotomayor and Elena \u00adKagan each received more than 60 confirmation votes. Samuel A. Alito Jr., chosen by President George W. Bush, was confirmed 58 to 42 in 2006, but 72 senators voted to defeat a possible filibuster and allow his confirmation vote to go forward. Indeed, only Alito \u2014 among the last 16 Supreme Court nominees \u2014 was forced to clear the supermajority hurdle to break a filibuster.\n\nIn announcing his confrontational approach, Schumer said that Gorsuch \u201cwas unable to sufficiently convince me that he\u2019d be an independent check\u201d on Trump. Schumer said later that the judge is \u201cnot a neutral legal mind but someone with a deep-seated conservative ideology,\u201d hand-picked for Trump by conservative legal groups.\n\nThomas C. Goldstein, a Supreme Court practitioner and co-founder of SCOTUSblog, said that Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee did not present a compelling case that Gorsuch was either an illegitimate nominee or that he was outside the conservative mainstream.\n\n(Reuters)\n\n\u201cNone of the Democrats set the table\u201d for a filibuster, Goldstein said. He speculated that one option for some Democrats would be to allow an up-or-down vote, and then to vote against confirmation.\n\nIn addition to Schumer, Sens. Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.), Robert P. Casey Jr. (D-Pa.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) announced Thursday that they would filibuster Gorsuch. Casey is one of 10 Democratic senators running next year in a state that Trump won.\n\nThe Judicial Crisis Network, which is spending at least $10 million on television ads to persuade Democratic senators to support Gorsuch, called Casey and other Democrats opposing Gorsuch \u201ctotally unreasonable\u201d because \u201cthey will obstruct anyone who does not promise to rubber stamp their political agenda from the bench.\u201d\n\nSenior Republicans have vowed that Gorsuch will be confirmed no matter what \u2014 a veiled threat to Democrats that they might use the nuclear option to change the way senators confirm Supreme Court justices.\n\n\u201cIf Judge Gorsuch can\u2019t achieve 60 votes in the Senate, could any judge appointed by a Republican president be approved with 60 or more votes in the Senate?\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said this week.\n\nMuch of the Democratic resistance to Gorsuch centers on the GOP\u2019s decision last year to block consideration of Judge Merrick Garland, Obama\u2019s choice to replace Scalia.\n\nBut moderate Democrats have said they are hoping that the two parties can come to an agreement that leads to Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation and the preservation of current Senate traditions.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), seen as the Democrat most likely to support Gorsuch, said he needed to hear more from the nominee but warned Democrats against risking the deployment of the nuclear option.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t completely made up my mind. I\u2019m going to go talk to him next week; then I\u2019ll make my decision,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cBut I just think the Senate is on a slippery slope.\u201d\n\nAfter two days of answering senators\u2019 questions, Gorsuch was not present on Thursday as civil rights leaders, conservative activists, professors, judges and former clerks debated whether he belonged on the high court.\n\nOn the final day, there were many empty seats in the hearing room, including on the dais as senators dropped in and out to cast votes.\n\nOpponents expressed concern about Gorsuch\u2019s record on civil liberties, election laws and reproductive rights. Gorsuch\u2019s approach \u201creflects a narrow view of civil rights and a deep skepticism of protecting those rights in the courtroom,\u201d said Kristen Clarke, head of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.\n\nGorsuch\u2019s former law clerks and other attorneys countered criticism that as an appellate judge he has favored corporations and employers over individuals. They cited his sympathy and respect for litigants and rulings to protect the rights of religious minorities and prisoners.\n\nSenior U.S. District Judge John L. Kane, also from Colorado, assured the committee that Gorsuch knows that his social, political and religious views have no place on the bench.\n\n\u201cGorsuch is not a monk, but neither is he a missionary or an ideologue,\u201d Kane said.\n\nHuman rights advocates raised concerns about Gorsuch\u2019s tenure at the Justice Department during Bush\u2019s presidency, when he worked on cases related to the detention of terrorism suspects. Gorsuch helped draft language designed to support Bush\u2019s claims of executive authority on matters of torture and the treatment of detainees.\n\nGorsuch told the committee this week that he was merely acting as an attorney for his then-client.\n\nBut Jameel Jaffer, head of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said Gorsuch volunteered for the duty. \u201cIt is not the case . . . that Judge Gorsuch happened to be a government lawyer at a time when the government \u2014 his client \u2014 endorsed torture and a sweeping view of presidential power. The government endorsed those things first, very publicly, and then Judge Gorsuch chose his client.\u201d\n\nThe committee also heard a highly personal account directly from Jeff Perkins, the father of a child with autism whom Gorsuch ruled against in 2008. Perkins called the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit \u201cdevastating,\u201d requiring one parent to move to another school district to get his son, Luke, the education he needed.\n\n[Supreme Court sets higher bar for education of students with disabilities]\n\nGorsuch\u2019s 2008 decision came under scrutiny on Wednesday after the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in another case that the standard Gorsuch applied for assessing the educational benefit for students with disabilities was too low.\n\nScott Clement and David Weigel contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/ryan-on-repealing-obamacare-plan-is-proceeding/2017/03/23/d46b2c56-102b-11e7-aa57-2ca1b05c41b8_video.html", "text": "- House Speaker Paul D.

Seven years after President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, Republicans were poised to take the first concrete step toward repealing and replacing that law. Instead, Thursday produced an embarrassing setback that left the way forward far from certain.\n\nLegislative sausage-making is never pretty, but what has been happening all week with the signature legislative priority of the GOP seems beyond the norms. Faced with possible defeat on the floor, House Republican leaders postponed a scheduled vote until Friday, hoping that another day of negotiations could produce what seven years of talking have failed to produce, which is a consensus bill that all factions of the party can support.\n\nThe difficulties Republicans are confronting are entirely of their own making. For seven years, Republican politicians have made one overriding bargain with their conservative constituency, which was that they would repeal Obamacare as their first order of business if they ever had the power to do so. Now that they have the power, they still haven\u2019t found a way to make good on that promise.\n\n[Graphic: The Republican health-care bill is struggling to find enough votes]\n\n(Reuters)\n\nThe other reality that has become clearer as Republicans have struggled to turn a campaign promise into a satisfactory piece of legislation is that, even if they eventually put a bill on Trump\u2019s desk, they still could be buying themselves political problems in the months and years ahead. That is perhaps a second-order problem right now, given the goal of getting something through the House. But as Obama and the Democrats learned, changing the health-care system is fraught, no matter which direction the changes go.\n\nFailure to live up to the pledge to, at the very least, significantly scale back Obamacare is obviously the worst of all possible outcomes. Such a defeat would put the lie to the claim that the Republicans, now with full control of the executive and legislative branches, were ready to govern as a conservative party. Failure also would undermine the idea of the president as the dealmaker in chief, for he has thrown himself into the battle with notable energy and determination, putting his own prestige on the line.\n\nRepublicans have postponed votes on critical legislation before, bedeviled by opposition from the hardcore conservative faction. They\u2019ve overcome those setbacks and could do so with health care. The president and Republican leaders are far from conceding defeat and will redouble efforts to cobble together the necessary votes in the House.\n\nBut at a minimum, Trump\u2019s reputation as the closer in chief has taken a hit \u2014 and on the first big test of his presidency. The greater damage has been to the reputation of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) as the savvy intellectual godfather of a new conservative agenda around which his party could rally. This legislation, if eventually passed, may come to be known as Trumpcare, but for now it can more fairly be called Ryancare.\n\n[Republicans postpone House vote on health care]\n\nUntil House leaders decided to postpone a vote, Thursday had been yet another frantic day of attempted dealmaking, as first hard-line conservatives and then more moderate conservatives trooped from Capitol Hill to the White House and back. The negotiations came on top of deals cut Tuesday night to woo conservative holdouts, which came after House leaders had made other changes on Monday night, which all came after Ryan had failed to find the legislative sweet spot with his initial plan.\n\nThe effort to strike a delicate balance was designed with a single purpose in mind, which was not necessarily to produce a truly better bill. The real purpose, as everyone knew, was to produce something \u2014 anything \u2014 that would allow passage, even if by the slimmest of margins, of the House bill with the hope that the Senate could then find a way to fix any remaining problems and eventually produce a winning formula.\n\nView Graphic How health care amendments appease GOP moderates and hard-liners\n\nThe rallying cry at this point has been a call to arms to keep a promise. There was no Plan B, White House press secretary Sean Spicer had said when asked what would happen if they didn\u2019t have the numbers in the House ahead of Thursday\u2019s scheduled vote. This was do or die, Trump had told lawmakers. That blew up Thursday afternoon. It still is do or die, however, but with the stakes higher now that Republican leaders have called a timeout.\n\nHardly anyone knows what is in the current bill, or what could be in it after further negotiations. Concessions to conservatives have brought defections among some moderates. Rep. Mark Meadows, (R-N.C.), the leader of the House Freedom Caucus, told reporters Thursday afternoon that there were still 30 to 40 Republicans not committed to supporting the bill. Republicans can afford to lose only 21 or 22 of them, depending on how many Democrats are present to vote.\n\n[More problems ahead if the bill gets to the Senate]\n\nPassage in the House \u2014 hardly a certainty \u2014 would provide the president and congressional Republicans with a partial, if enormously welcome, victory. But that\u2019s merely the first hurdle. The bill already was in trouble in the Senate, and House action could produce fresh substantive and parliamentary challenges for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to overcome. And, of course, the bill now under consideration is only part one of three parts of the overall GOP plan. So Republicans are far from the finish line.\n\nThe haste with which Republicans have been moving has outpaced the ability of the Congressional Budget Office to evaluate the bill. CBO\u2019s first analysis produced mixed headlines for the GOP: tens of millions more without health insurance; higher premiums over the next few years but slightly lower premiums than under current law a decade from now; and a $337 billion reduction in the deficit over the next 10 years.\n\nAn updated analysis released Thursday said deficit reduction would be $150 billion with no significant change in the number who would be without insurance. Those numbers do not reflect where the bill stood as of Thursday and probably will change with additional negotiations in the House and almost-certain amendments in the Senate.\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday showed that the Republican plan starts out in a deep hole. Just 17 percent of Americans say they approve of the GOP bill, compared with 56 percent who say they disapprove. The remaining 26 percent say they are undecided.\n\nThe lowest approval level for the Affordable Care Act in any Washington Post-ABC News poll was 39 percent, with the highest disapproval 57 percent. The worst net negative recorded in those polls was minus-17 points. The Quinnipiac survey puts the net negative for the Republican plan at more than double that number, or minus-39 points.\n\nObama administration officials long claimed that, once their bill was approved and implemented, support would rise significantly. That didn\u2019t happen, and Democrats were battered in the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections. Republicans must be thinking about 2018 as they evaluate current public opinion.\n\n\u201cA promise that looked like a political winner when they started talking about it seven years ago is now beginning to look like a massive political headache,\u201d said William Galston of the Brookings Institution.\n\nHeadache or not, Thursday\u2019s setback or not, Republicans are now left with unpalatable choices. Fail, and suffer the consequences. Succeed, and hope the public eventually buys in. This is hardly the script that Trump and Republicans imagined when they came to power in January."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/an-even-bigger-challenge-if-health-care-reform-emerges-from-house-the-senate/2017/03/23/209f9c88-0f4b-11e7-ab07-07d9f521f6b5_story.html", "text": "Even if the House approves a GOP effort this week to repeal and replace key parts of the Affordable Care Act, the work of persuading the Senate to do the same is likely to be even harder.\n\nWeeks of dealmaking in the House have not satisfied at least a dozen Republican senators who oppose the bill or lean against it. In a chamber where the GOP holds a slim 52-to-48 majority and where Democrats are united against the effort, just three Republican \u201cno\u201d votes would be enough to kill the measure.\n\nIn the House, which has been the epicenter of the health-care debate, GOP leaders postponed a planned Thursday vote on their bill amid struggles to meet the demands of conservative lawmakers. On Thursday night, President Trump delivered an ultimatum to House Republicans: Vote to approve the bill on Friday, or reject it and he would move on to other legislative priorities.\n\n[GOP health-care plan hangs in balance as House leaders push for Thursday floor vote]\n\nSome think the bill would go too far in undoing the ACA\u2019s provisions, and with them the coverage on which many Americans have come to depend. Others say the effort falls short of their demand for a full repeal that would wipe out subsidies of insurance premiums and coverage mandates.\n\n(Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)\n\nIn fact, a stark picture emerges from the statements of two dozen senators and staff members: Without significant changes, the measure stands virtually no chance of passing in the Senate. And such changes, in turn, could torpedo the effort when and if the House and Senate work out their final differences.\n\n\u201cI still have a lot of concerns,\u201d said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska).\n\nFor many, a huge stumbling block is the pace.\n\nAssuming the House approves the bill Friday, Senate leaders, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), have given themselves about a week to iron out disagreements and pass their own version of a bill to replace President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement.\n\n\u201cI am very suspicious of that being enough time, given what\u2019s going on here,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.).\n\nSome lawmakers and staff members say the rush to the finish line could lead to mistakes in the legislation. Staff members on some key committees worry that skipping the usual vetting and debate would trade good policy for speed. Senators have expressed similar concerns.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more important to finally get health-care reform right than to get it fast,\u201d Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said in a statement this week. Cotton has been highly critical of the House measure.\n\nView Graphic How health care amendments appease GOP moderates and hard-liners\n\nThe biggest threat to the bill comes from frustrated Republican senators, particularly those who worry about provisions that, in 2020, would roll back the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to millions of working-class Americans.\n\nSeveral GOP lawmakers from states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA say that would hurt the low-income and disabled people who obtain coverage though the program, particularly those battling drug addiction.\n\n\u201cI still have big, big concerns,\u201d said Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), whose state expanded Medicaid. He said he plans to introduce an amendment to address his concerns if the House doesn\u2019t do so first.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not satisfied,\u201d said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), who has coordinated with Portman to try to tweak the bill. She added, \u201cI\u2019m worried about a lot of folks in West Virginia, of opioid and drug abuse issues, and the expanded Medicaid has helped with that.\u201d\n\nMany Senate Republicans have generally avoided speaking at length this week about the increasingly troubled House legislation, which has been thrust into doubt by opposition from conservative and centrist House Republicans. Senate GOP leaders have mostly avoided outlining an exact plan or strategy for how they plan to act before the House vote because of what one staff member called a fear of trying to commit to a moving target.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re waiting to see what they send over,\u201d said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a junior member of the Senate GOP leadership. \u201cI doubt if there\u2019s a lot of focus on this until . . . the House has actually passed a bill.\u201d\n\nIf the legislation passes the House, it will go directly to the Senate, where McConnell has said he would fast-track it to a floor vote next week. The Senate plans to be consumed the following week with the GOP effort to confirm Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch before leaving for a two-week recess.\n\nAlthough senators would be allowed to offer amendments to the health-care overhaul, McConnell plans to skip the customary process of allowing Senate committees to debate the legislation. Republican leaders say the speedy push is necessary to avoid the threat of a blockade by Senate Democrats.\n\nIn addition to rolling back the Medicaid expansion beginning in 2020, the House bill would replace federal insurance subsidies in the ACA with age- and income-based tax credits. Those tax credits have generated controversy. Senate GOP leaders are expected to try to tweak them.\n\nSenate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune (S.D.) is working on an amendment that would change the structure of the credits to better help older and lower-income Americans buy coverage.\n\n\u201cWe have language on it with all the different thresholds and when it kicks in and how it varies among both age and income,\u201d he said. Trump and his team are watching for Thune\u2019s amendment with interest, said a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe House bill also is under fire from a trio of conservative senators known for bucking party leaders: Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah). They want to shred even more of the ACA than what the House bill targets. Lee and Paul have said they would vote against it in its current form, and Cruz has been very critical.\n\n[What the Freedom Caucus wants in the GOP health-care bill, and why it\u2019s not getting it]\n\nSenate Democrats, meanwhile, stand united against the effort. They have signaled that they will contest whether certain elements of the bill are permitted under Senate rules that would allow the measure to advance on a simple-majority vote only if its scope is limited to budget matters. Otherwise, a 60-vote victory \u2014 almost certainly unattainable in this case \u2014 would be necessary.\n\nThat means Democrats are likely to protest potential last-minute additions to the bill that conservatives want and that House lawmakers have been negotiating: ending the insurance mandates in the ACA that require plans to cover specific medical services such as mental health care, prescription drugs and preventive care.\n\nA small number of conservatives, including Cruz and Lee, have argued that Republicans can go further within those rule constraints to attack the law, while some GOP leaders and Democrats have dismissed that notion. The emerging dispute could erupt next week.\n\nThat fear of commitment has spread to GOP members who represent states that accepted the Medicaid expansion. Normally chatty lawmakers, including Sens. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.), waved off questions while Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) avoided discussing the House legislation entirely. Others simply said they were far from sold on the House GOP plan.\n\n[Thursday\u2019s vote on the GOP Obamacare replacement bill is going to be veeeery close]\n\nMeanwhile, some Republicans expressed impatience about the rest of their agenda, which they can\u2019t address until the health-care legislation is behind them.\n\n\u201cWe are basically running out of time,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), McConnell\u2019s top deputy. \u201cWe can\u2019t get to tax reform or other things until we get this done.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other top Democrats already plan to challenge whether major elements of the health-care bill, such as a ban on funding for Planned Parenthood and work requirements for those who use Medicaid, are legal under the strict budget rules. They hope to force GOP leaders to strike those provisions, which are critical elements of the law for many conservatives.\n\nAll of the forces working against the legislation have lowered the confidence of many Senate Republicans that their chamber can work out all of the kinks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d was all Sen.

Pete Sessions (R-Tex.), left, and Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), the vice chair, listen to arguments from committee chairs as the panel meets to shape the final version of the Republican health-care bill before it goes to the floor for debate. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nAt the moment \u2014 of late, political moments tend to be vanishing so don\u2019t hold it against me if this has changed by the time you read this \u2014 the faction that\u2019s driving the evolution of the Republican bill to replace Obamacare is the House Freedom Caucus, a group of staunchly conservative members who feel as though the \u201crepeal-and-replace\u201d effort has too much replace, not enough repeal. After negotiations with Republican congressional leadership and the White House, it appears that the American Health Care Act, as the bill is known, still doesn\u2019t meet their requirements.\n\nBut while the Freedom Caucus constitutes a large bloc of votes, it is by no means the only group within the Republican caucus that is balking. In fact, opposition to the AHCA is fairly well-distributed across the Republican political spectrum.\n\nUsing the Upshot\u2019s meta-whip-count of opponents to the bill, I pulled data on partisanship of the Republican caucus and those who have expressed opposition. (We only used those identified as opposing the AHCA by two or more media outlets.) This list, too, is evolving quickly, so I\u2019ll timestamp this as of 2 p.m. on Thursday.\n\nI looked at five metrics.\n\nThe first was the Cook Partisan Voting Index, a measure of the partisanship of each congressional district. The red dots are known AHCA opponents; the gray circle is the average of the Republican caucus on the whole.\n\nWhat you want to note is the number of red dots on either side of the gray circle. About half of those who oppose the bill come from less-Republican-than-average districts; about half come from more-Republican-than-average. In one sense, this makes perfect sense: Averages generally land in the middle of populations of people, by definition.\n\nBut in politics, it\u2019s usually the case that opposition arises from one end of the political spectrum or the other. That conservatives are balking at something moderates are comfortable with, or vice versa. Here, the temperature is even throughout.\n\nSame with the margin of the vote in 2016. About half of those who oppose the bill represent districts that were more strongly pro-Donald-Trump than average; about half, less. (This data was compiled by DailyKos.)\n\nConsidering the partisanship of the members of Congress themselves, using DW-NOMINATE data from VoteView \u2014 a bit less even. About twice as many opponents of the bill have a higher score than average \u2014 meaning they are more conservative \u2014 than have a lower-than-average score.\n\nThis is an important factor, of course, and it largely reflects the relative solidity of the Freedom Caucus. Nineteen of the 38 members of the House that we have identified as opponents of the bill are members of the caucus. All 16 who were evaluated by VoteView have partisanship scores higher than the average. Outside of that caucus, three-quarters of those with scores were below average in terms of their partisanship.\n\nWe also considered the likely effects of the passage of the legislation. At least one House Republican, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (Fla.) announced her opposition based on the likelihood that constituents would lose coverage. The Center for American Progress developed estimates for each congressional district of the number of people who might lose coverage overall and, because data weren\u2019t available for all states in that regard, how many were likely to lose individual coverage.\n\nAgain, the results were fairly evenly distributed.\n\n(Ros-Lehtinen\u2019s district is not represented on the first chart above, but is much higher than average in the second.)\n\nThe challenge for House Republican leaders is figuring out how they might find a bill that can appeal to enough people to ensure that the bill passes. Solidifying the Freedom Caucus would help, but that\u2019s only part of the vote that Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and his team need to secure. The problem that follows is that the Freedom Caucus \u2014 on the right side of the spectrum \u2014 will want different and perhaps mutually exclusive things than people who are more moderate than average. Adding something to secure their votes may mean abandoning other votes somewhere else.\n\nThat\u2019s the challenge.

Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), a member of the Intelligence Committee, said on CNN, adding that it was \u201cnot clear\u201d precisely which actions his apology covered.\n\nNunes came under heavy fire from Democrats on Wednesday after going first to the press, then to the White House, and then to the press again before consulting with committee colleagues about what he said was fresh intelligence about the president and his campaign aides.\n\nOn Thursday, Nunes said it was a \u201cjudgment call\u201d to personally brief Trump before speaking with his Intelligence Committee colleagues, who are actively investigating allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections and suspected links between Trump aides and the Kremlin.\n\nWhen he made his apology, Nunes stressed \u201cthat he really wanted us to be bipartisan,\u201d said Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), a member of the Intelligence Committee. \u201cHe was contrite. Internally on the committee, he\u2019s a very reasonable guy.

Nunes said Wednesday that the information he has seen may show that Trump or his aides were picked up in such incidental collection during the transition.\n\nSome Democrats have accused Nunes of speaking publicly in an attempt to deflect attention from Monday\u2019s congressional hearing, at which FBI Director James B. Comey not only confirmed that the FBI is looking into allegations that the Trump team coordinated with Russian officials during the election, but flatly denied Trump\u2019s accusation that the Obama administration had wiretapped him.\n\nSaid one Democratic committee official: \u201cThis looks like the president got in hot water over his wiretapping claim, and the White House had to find a way to give him an off-ramp.\u201d\n\nNunes would not say whether his source was affiliated with the White House or what type of incidental collection had occurred \u2014 whether it was direct conversations between Trump or his team and a foreign agent, or whether two foreign entities were simply picked up discussing the president. He said only that the communications did not involve Russia.\n\nThe intelligence community regularly monitors, under court approval, the communications of foreign individuals acting as agents of a foreign government, as well as some people suspected of terrorism. The communications of Americans who are in touch with foreign agents can thus be \u201cincidentally collected\u201d \u2014 as occurred when former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn was picked up talking to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, who was under surveillance.\n\nThe problem potentially arises when the identities of those Americans are \u201cunmasked\u201d \u2014 that is, revealed to others in the government. There are legal procedures allowing for such unmasking when it is deemed necessary for understanding the context of the intelligence in communications.\n\n(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nNunes said Wednesday he was concerned about the unmasking in the information he viewed. But after speaking with Nunes, Intelligence Committee ranking Democrat Adam B. Schiff (Calif.) said that only one name in the report that Nunes viewed was \u201cunmasked\u201d \u2014 and that name had nothing to do with the Trump team.\n\nNunes told reporters that the identities of the individuals in the report were \u201cvery clear to me,\u201d and that they were members of the Trump team.\n\nThat has sparked charges that if anybody is revealing more than they should, it is Nunes \u2014 for potentially telling the public that hidden names in surveillance reports referred to the president and his advisers, something that is likely classified information.\n\nNunes said the information was classified, but he argued that disclosing the existence of the report and the nature of it did not reveal any classified information.\n\nNunes\u2019s own staff were not aware of the chairman\u2019s decision to go public and brief the president and were dismayed by his actions, said several individuals familiar with the matter.\n\n\u201cHe betrayed the independence that our committee must show to get to the bottom of what happened with Russia\u2019s interference in our elections,\u201d said Rep.

(Mike Blake/Reuters)\n\nWe\u2019ll start with the bad news for House Speaker Paul D. Ryan.\n\nA new Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday shows that the American Health Care Act, the Republican bill championed by Ryan and due for a vote any minute now, is severely unpopular. Stunningly unpopular.\n\nIt is, amazingly enough, less popular than Congress itself.\n\nAccording to Quinnipiac, only 17 percent of Americans approve of the bill \u2014 and only 6 percent of the country supports it strongly. (Congress is approved of by 21 percent of the country.) By contrast, well over half of Americans disapprove of it, 43 percent of them strongly. In other words, more than twice as many people have strongly negative views of the bill than have any positive feelings for it.\n\nBroken down by demographic, the data are grim for Ryan and Republican leaders \u2014 including President Trump, who has embraced the plan.\n\nSome things to note:\n\n\u2022 A lot of people aren\u2019t very familiar with the legislation, as indicated by those gray bars. But those who are familiar with it are heavily stacked against it, by a 3-to-1 margin.\n\n\u2022 Among no demographic group does a majority approve of the bill.\n\n\u2022 Among only three groups \u2014 Republicans, older Americans and whites without college degrees \u2014 does less than half of the population disapprove.\n\n\u2022 Only among Republicans and those 65 and older does more than 10 percent of the population approve of the bill strongly.\n\n\u2022 In every group except Republicans, more than a third of the population views the legislation strongly negatively.\n\nThe three groups that are below 50 percent disapproval are, as you likely noticed, groups that backed Trump strongly in the 2016 election. Across the board, Trump\u2019s approval rating from each demographic group was much higher than the legislation\u2019s approval rating \u2014 generally about twice as high.\n\nThat\u2019s a problem for Trump personally. We noted Wednesday that people are increasingly viewing his handling of health care negatively.\n\nThis suggests that he may pay a personal political price for backing the AHCA. If his core constituencies reject a proposal that he\u2019s made a center of his focus, it\u2019s hard to see how he can maintain strong approval ratings with them. Trump may not be the only one to pay a price: As FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Harry Enten pointed out on Twitter, the bill is much less popular than was Obamacare when it passed \u2014 and Obamacare helped contribute to the Democrats getting blown out in the 2010 House elections.\n\nAmazingly, the poll also found that 70 percent of respondents thought that Obamacare should be repealed in full (20 percent) or in part \u2014 including 46 percent of Democrats. It\u2019s this bill itself \u2014 which may end up being the only chance for any change \u2014 is amazingly unpopular.\n\nNow to the good news for Ryan.\n\nUm.\n\nThe weather is nice?"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/03/23/why-are-republicans-moving-so-fast-on-health-care/", "text": "Two weeks after introducing their bill to overhaul the Affordable Care Act to heated criticism, House Republicans unveiled amendments to the plan. Here's what you need to know about the legislation and its changes. (Bastien Inzaurralde,Sarah Parnass,Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer promised that the Republican effort to replace Obamacare wouldn\u2019t be \u201cjammed down people\u2019s throats\u201d in the way he said the Affordable Care Act was in 2010. Republicans would observe \u201cregular order\u201d in Congress, moving the legislation through committee and ensuring that the public had an opportunity to see what was under consideration.\n\nThat was two weeks ago. Since then, Republican leaders have scrambled to revise their initial proposal, the American Health Care Act, to shore up enough support from their own caucus to ensure that it can pass the House. Late Wednesday night, reports surfaced that substantial components of the bill were being reconsidered to that end. Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus are scheduled to meet with President Trump on Thursday, shortly before the scheduled vote, to hammer out a package that might win majority support on the floor.\n\nIt all raises the question: Why the rush? Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House. They could, theoretically, pass something at any time. Instead, they\u2019re hustling for a vote this week, less than three weeks after they unveiled the original version of the AHCA. So: Why?\n\nTwo big reasons.\n\nThe most important relates to the process Republicans hope to use to pass the replacement. The AHCA is part one of three meant to constitute a new system. While parts two and three are somewhat theoretical at this point, the strategy behind the AHCA is not.\n\n\n\nHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) speaks in support of the Republican health-care bill during a TV interview on Capitol Hill in Washington on March 22. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nPassing the AHCA relies on the congressional reconciliation process, a specific mechanism tied to the overall budget process. It was created in part to provide a system for adjusting mandatory spending figures that can\u2019t be changed through the normal appropriations process. But it also creates a fast-track system for passing very specific types of legislation and \u2014 critically, for the purposes of this discussion \u2014 avoids filibusters in the Senate. If the AHCA can pass the House and if the Senate\u2019s parliamentarian thinks it meets the various requirements necessary to be considered a reconciliation bill, Republicans only need 51 votes in the Senate (perhaps including that of Vice President Pence, in the event of a tie) for the bill to head to Trump\u2019s desk.\n\n(A quick aside: That need to check all the boxes to be considered a reconciliation bill is one of the minefields Republicans face as they scramble to finalize a package that can pass the House. There\u2019s no way they\u2019ll get enough votes in the Senate to avoid a filibuster on non-reconciliation legislation.)\n\nOn Jan. 12, the House and Senate kicked off the reconciliation process (detailed here) using a the fiscal 2017 budget resolution as a vehicle. (One of the rules about reconciliation is that it can only be deployed to adjust spending or revenue once per budget resolution.) After blowing past a Jan. 27 benchmark for reconciliation proposals from committees, Republicans came up with the AHCA.\n\nNow, all of that said, there\u2019s no time limit on the reconciliation process. But Republicans want very much to move on to large-scale budget reform, which means passing a budget for fiscal 2018 and an associated reconciliation bill of its own. That reconciliation could theoretically revamp both health care and tax rules but, as The Post\u2019s Paul Kane points out, that would be an even more complex \u2014 and therefore more politically tricky \u2014 bit of legislation.\n\nWhich brings us to the other reason Republicans are moving quickly: political opposition.\n\nRepublican leaders want to wrap up Obamacare reform and tax reform before August. Why August? Well, for one thing, because August is when Congress goes on recess and representatives generally head back to their districts and host town halls. When Republicans held town halls in January and February, it didn\u2019t always go that well, because a lot of constituents showed up to complain about the attempt to overturn Obamacare.\n\nPolitico\u2019s Tim Alberta reported that Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s allies believe that opposition will continue to firm up as the debate over the AHCA continues. That already seems to be true: Opposition from Republican members of Congress has apparently increased and the bill itself \u2014 while relatively unknown \u2014 is unpopular with the public. It\u2019s less popular than Obamacare was when it passed, even though Obamacare was viewed more negatively than positively. Legislators are already reporting broad, consistent opposition from constituents; it\u2019s not clear why that would change as the fight drags out. Again, Obamacare is instructive: As the vote on it neared, the proposal grew less popular.\n\nBy moving quickly, Republican leaders seem to think that they can get past the hurdle of opposition before it becomes insurmountable. They may have already missed that mark.\n\nThe result? A bill that will not receive unanimous Republican support in the House, which leverages a legislative trick to hopefully gain quick passage in the Senate so the party can move on to tax reform, but which has already garnered significant opposition from party members and the public and which might substantially change at the last minute.\n\nBut if it does pass? One might say it had been jammed down people\u2019s throats."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/perdue-says-research-is-the-basis-of-agricultural-sector-success/2017/03/23/1491c45e-0fe4-11e7-aa57-2ca1b05c41b8_video.html", "text": "- Former governor of Georgia Sonny Perdue, Trump's nominee for Secretary of Agriculture, is asked about the importance of research.

He said he also supports making it easier for dairy farmers to employ immigrant workers.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s budget would cut $4.7 billion from the Agriculture Department\u2019s 2018 budget, reducing its discretionary spending by about 20 percent. However, the budget provided few details about where the savings would come from.\n\nThe bulk of the agency\u2019s budget \u2014 $164 billion in 2016 \u2014 funds mandatory spending programs like the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, also known as \u201cfood stamps.\u201d Discretionary spending goes toward various rural development and agricultural research programs, as well as assistance for women and children (WIC).\n\nDuring Perdue\u2019s hearing, Sen. Debbie Stabenow (Mich.), the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, said that Trump\u2019s first two months in office have made it \u201cclear that rural America has been an afterthought.\u201d\n\n(Senate Agriculture Committee)\n\n\u201cRural America is the economic backbone of our country, and it\u2019s too true that small towns are continuing to struggle to recover from the recession,\u201d she said. \u201cLast week\u2019s budget proposal made it clear that rural America is not a top priority for this administration.\u201d\n\nPerdue said that he had no input into the administration\u2019s budget because he had not yet been confirmed, but expressed \u201csome concern\u201d over the cuts and said he would manage those priorities alongside the cuts, though he didn\u2019t specify how.\n\n\u201cIf confirmed, I will work for agriculture producers and consumers to let this administration . . . know what\u2019s important to America,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are important programs,\u201d Perdue said in another instance. \u201cI understand that, and I will do everything in my power\u201d to advocate for them.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Perdue vowed to make farmers and Americans living in rural America a priority during his tenure. He spoke at length about his rise from his childhood on a dairy farm to his election as the first Republican governor in Georgia since Reconstruction. He stressed that he would pursue a bipartisan approach to agriculture issues.\n\nPerdue is Trump\u2019s final Cabinet-level nominee to receive a hearing. His testimony Thursday before the Senate Agriculture Committee comes nine weeks after he was nominated. It\u2019s unclear why his process took that long.\n\nResponding to questions from Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), Perdue said he would advocate for laws that would allow the dairy industry to use immigrant labor year-round instead of seasonally.\n\nHe also said he would advocate for expanding broadband development in rural areas and committed to maintaining the Rural Utilities Service program, which supports development of water and waste treatment, electric power and other infrastructure in rural areas.\n\nPerdue, in response to a question from Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.), said he also recognized the importance of developing food assistance programs for children that serve them during the summertime, when they are unable to receive free or reduced meals at school because of vacation.\n\nHe agreed with Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) that the USDA has a role to play in helping mitigate the opioid crisis, which has been particularly bad in rural America. Ohio has the largest number of opioid deaths in the country.\n\n\u201cThe sad thing about that, as you well know, is much of this is in rural areas of despair. I will absolutely be an advocate. USDA doesn\u2019t have the basic capacity to supplant health care, but it certainly does have an opportunity to help in that regard,\u201d Perdue said, though he didn\u2019t provide specifics.\n\nPerdue was introduced by former senator Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) and Rep. David Scott (D-Ga.), who called him \u201cmy dear friend, my longtime friend\u201d and spoke about their time together in the state legislature. Scott said he and Perdue were \u201clike brothers.\u201d\n\n\u201cSonny Perdue is indeed the right person at the right time to do the absolute best job,\u201d said Scott. \u201cSonny and I had to meet every single day to work together, to set the agenda. . . . You get to understand a person\u2019s temperament when you\u2019re on the battlefield with them.\u201d\n\n[What Trump cut in his budget]\n\nThe committee did not delve into Perdue\u2019s ethics record during his tenure as governor of Georgia, between 2003 and 2011. During that time, he clashed frequently with the state\u2019s ethics commission and refused to put his businesses in a blind trust. More than a dozen ethics complaints were filed against him, and he was fined twice for campaign finance violations.\n\nIn 2005, a longtime associate serving in the state legislature added to legislation an amendment that allowed Perdue to save $100,000 in taxes.\n\nWatchdogs also worried that Perdue\u2019s significant agriculture business holdings \u2014 including Georgia-based grain merchandiser AGrowStar \u2014 would present a conflict of interest if he were confirmed as agriculture secretary. Ahead of Thursday\u2019s hearing, Perdue reached an agreement with the Office of Government Ethics to turn over those holdings to new trusts that would not benefit him or his wife, according to public documents published by OGE.\n\n[How long Cabinet confirmations take \u2014 and why past nominees failed]\n\nPerdue is widely expected to be confirmed by the Senate. The Agriculture Committee has yet to schedule a committee vote, but if he passes that hurdle, his nomination will advance to a full Senate vote.\n\nPerdue has received support from major food and agriculture interest groups, including the American Farm Bureau and the National Restaurant Association."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/gov-perdue-addresses-trump-immigration-crackdown-affecting-farm-workforce/2017/03/23/8af08a60-0fdd-11e7-aa57-2ca1b05c41b8_video.html", "text": "- Sen.

(The Washington Post)\n\nDeep in the interview President Trump granted to Time magazine, an interview predicated on Trump\u2019s unfaithful relationship with the truth, the president offers a challenge to his interviewer.\n\n\u201cName what\u2019s wrong!\u201d he said, after offering a string of examples where he said he\u2019d been proven correct. \u201cI mean, honestly.\u201d\n\nThere was an enormous \u2014 an almost unbroken \u2014 list of things that were wrong with what Trump had said to that point. Whether he is unaware that he is wrong or simply uninterested is, remarkably, rather beside the point. He was wrong, explicitly and consistently.\n\nLet\u2019s run through his claims, in order.\n\nSweden\n\nSweden. I make the statement, everyone goes crazy. The next day they have a massive riot, and death, and problems. \u2026 I talked about Sweden, and may have been somewhat different, but the following day, two days later, they had a massive riot in Sweden, exactly what I was talking about, I was right about that. \u2026 I\u2019m talking about what Sweden has done to themselves is very sad, that is what I am talking about. That is what I am talking about. You can phrase it any way you want. A day later they had a horrible, horrible riot in Sweden and you saw what happened.\n\nOn Feb. 18, at one of his post-campaign campaign rallies, Trump exhorted the crowd to \u201clook at what\u2019s happening last night in Sweden\u201d as an example of why his ban on immigration was important. Nothing had happened the night before in Sweden; Trump had apparently simply seen Sweden mentioned during a news broadcast on Fox News. Swedes were baffled.\n\nOne of the patterns that emerges in the claims Trump made to Time is that he\u2019ll seize on any isolated incident, however tangential, as proof that his broad claim was correct. He leverages his own unreliability as an excuse to point to something else and say, \u201cthat, that\u2019s what I was talking about.\u201d\n\nSo when a few days later there was a violent confrontation between police and a couple of dozen residents in a largely immigrant community after an arrest, that becomes a \u201chorrible, horrible riot\u201d and proof that Trump was right.\n\nAnthony Weiner\n\nHuma and Anthony, you know, what I tweeted about that whole deal, and then it turned out he had it, all of Hillary\u2019s email on his thing.\n\nTrump at one point tweeted this:\n\nIt came out that Huma Abedin knows all about Hillary\u2019s private illegal emails. Huma\u2019s PR husband, Anthony Weiner, will tell the world. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 3, 2015\n\nWhen Weiner\u2019s laptop was seized as part of an unrelated investigation, the FBI apparently found that his wife, Huma Abedin, had at some point used it to check her email, triggering the resuscitation of the Hillary Clinton email investigation and, Clinton feels, her electoral loss. Weiner\u2019s laptop had some of Abedin\u2019s email and a number of emails between Clinton and Abedin. That is not what Trump tweeted.\n\nNATO\n\nNATO, obsolete, because it doesn\u2019t cover terrorism. They fixed that, and I said that the allies must pay. Nobody knew that they weren\u2019t paying. I did. I figured it.\n\nTwo untrue claims here. The first is that Trump was the motivator for an announced information-sharing plan aimed at addressing terrorism, which experts say was not due to Trump.\n\nThe second is more egregious: His repeated claim that NATO states owe some sort of dues that go unpaid. In reality, NATO states are supposed to commit 2 percent of their GDP to defense, a mark many don\u2019t hit. That they don\u2019t do so has certainly been raised before, including by former defense secretary Bob Gates in 2011.\n\nBrexit\n\nBrexit, I was totally right about that. You were over there I think, when I predicted that, right, the day before. \u2026 Brexit, I predicted Brexit, you remember that, the day before the event. I said, no Brexit is going to happen, and everybody laughed, and Brexit happened. Many many things. They turn out to be right. \u2026 I got attacked on Brexit, when I was saying, I said long before the day before, I said the day before the opening, but I was saying Brexit was going to pass, and everybody was laughing, and I turned out to be right on that. I took a lot of heat when I said Brexit was going to pass.\n\nThe referendum vote on whether or not Britain should leave the European Union \u2014 Brexit \u2014 was held on June 23, 2016.\n\nIn March, he told a British interviewer that he thought it would happen.\n\n\u201cI think that Britain will separate from the EU,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that maybe it\u2019s time, especially in light of what\u2019s happened with the craziness that is going on with immigration, with people pouring in all over the place I think that Britain will end up separating from the EU.\u201d\n\nOn June 22, he did discuss Brexit on Fox Business. But his assertion was hardly the brash prediction he made it out to be after the fact.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody should listen to me because I haven\u2019t really focused on it very much,\u201d he said in that interview. \u201cMy inclination would be to get out, because you know, just go it alone.\u201d\n\nThis is another hallmark of Trump\u2019s convincing himself he\u2019s right \u2014 misrepresenting what he said in the first place.\n\nBrussels\n\nBrussels, I said, Brussels is not Brussels. \u2026 I talked about Brussels. I was on the front page of the New York Times for my quote. I said Brussels is not what it used to be, very sad what has happened to Brussels. I was absolutely lambasted. A short time later they had the major attack in Brussels. One year ago today. Exactly one year ago today. And then people said you know Trump was right.\n\nOn page A10 of the New York Times in January of last year, the paper looked at a comment Trump made about Brussels.\n\n\u201cGo to Brussels. Go to Paris. Go to different places. There is something going on and it\u2019s not good, where they want Shariah law, where they want this, where they want things that \u2014 you know, there has to be some assimilation. There is no assimilation. There is something bad going on,\u201d he had said to Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business. \u201cYou go to Brussels \u2014 I was in Brussels a long time ago, 20 years ago, so beautiful, everything is so beautiful \u2014 it\u2019s like living in a hellhole right now.\u201d Belgians quickly responded with photos and comments depicting life that appeared distinctly unhellholey.\n\nTwo months later, the attack occurred. Some did say that Trump was right: mostly conservative media outlets.\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nI mean many other things, the election\u2019s rigged against Bernie Sanders. \u2026 What I said, look I said, Donna Brazile had information, and she had information on Hillary\u2019s debate questions. I said why didn\u2019t Hillary apologize. Donna Brazile just admitted that that was right. I said the election was rigged against Bernie, a lot of people agree with that one, a lot of people hated the statement when I made it.\n\nEmails stolen from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman that were then released by WikiLeaks created a booming economy in conspiracy theories about the election. The latter set of material did show that Donna Brazile, working as a commentator at CNN, passed questions from a town hall to the Clinton campaign in advance.\n\nBut nothing ever emerged to show that the election was in any way \u201crigged\u201d to favor Clinton over Sanders. Isolated comments were seized upon as evidence that DNC staffers would prefer that Sanders get out of the race, but those were mostly sent well after the contest was clearly already over.\n\nSanders did complain about the rigged nature of the overall political system with regularity, and complained about the \u201cdumb process\u201d used to choose a party nominee.\n\nWiretapping\n\nWhen I said wiretapping, it was in quotes. Because a wiretapping is, you know today it is different from wire tapping. It is just a good description. But wiretapping was in quotes. What I\u2019m talking about is surveillance. And today, Devin Nunes just had a news conference.\n\nWhen Trump accused President Barack Obama of having tapped phone lines in Trump Tower he did use quotation marks \u2014 sometimes. The original tweet was this.\n\nTerrible! Just found out that Obama had my \"wires tapped\" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017\n\nTwo tweets later:\n\nI'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that anyone tapped phones in Trump Tower, much less targeting Trump on behalf of Obama. During a hearing earlier this week, that specific allegation was rebutted by FBI Director James B. Comey.\n\nOn Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes told the media that he\u2019d received new evidence suggesting that some Trump allies may have been surveilled as part of investigations into other people, information that was then shared in the intelligence community. This is not what Trump claimed, quotes or otherwise.\n\nThe Times on wiretapping\n\nLook. I predicted a lot of things that took a little of bit of time. Here, headline, for the front page of the New York Times, \u201cWiretapped data used in inquiry of Trump aides.\u201d That\u2019s a headline. Now they then dropped that headline, I never saw this until this morning. They then dropped that headline, and they used another headline without the word wiretap, but they did mean wiretap. Wiretapped data used in inquiry. Then changed after that, they probably didn\u2019t like it. And they changed the title. They took the wiretap word out.\n\nThe Times did use the word \u201cwiretapped\u201d on its front page on Jan. 20: \u201cWiretapped data used in inquiry of Trump aides.\u201d That story was nebulous in what the surveillance looked like, but it appears to have been in part the sort of surveillance mentioned by Nunes.\n\nThe Times did not change its headline. That idea was propagated by an erroneous report in the National Review, which was later retracted. The shorter word \u201cwiretapped\u201d was used in print; online, the headline was always longer. (\u201cIntercepted Russian Communications Part of Inquiry Into Trump Associates\u201d)\n\nMuslims celebrating on 9/11\n\nWell if you look at the reporter, he wrote the story in the Washington Post.\n\nWhen Trump first claimed in November 2015 that he\u2019d watched thousands of Muslims in New Jersey celebrating on 9/11, the idea was thoroughly examined \u2014 and completely debunked.\n\nTrump and his supporters point to a Post story from 2001 in which a reporter mentions that law enforcement investigated reports of people holding rooftop parties to celebrate. No such celebrations were ever televised \u2014 much less proven to have occurred.\n\nThe reporter who wrote that story, Serge Kovaleski, said that it was \u201cnot the case, as best as I can remember\u201d that hundreds or thousands of people celebrated. That was why Trump then infamously mimicked Kovaleski\u2019s physical disability during a speech.\n\nVoter fraud\n\nWell now if you take a look at the votes, when I say that, I mean mostly they register wrong, in other words, for the votes, they register incorrectly, and/or illegally. And they then vote. You have tremendous numbers of people. In fact I\u2019m forming a committee on it. \u2026 I have people say it was more than that. We will see after we have. But there will be, we are forming a committee. And we are going to do a study on it, a very serious problem.\n\nThere is no evidence that more than a handful of people voted illegally in 2016 (including, allegedly, the former head of the Republican Party in Colorado).\n\nA 2012 report from Pew Trusts outlined problems with voter rolls across the country, including that people who had died were not quickly removed from the lists. Trump has embraced that report, which is accurate, making the totally unfounded extension that \u201cthey then vote.\u201d There\u2019s literally no evidence that\u2019s been shown that any significant number of unauthorized votes are cast using registrations of dead people or by people in multiple states in a single election.\n\nThe election and the polls\n\nThe other one, election, I said we are going to win, we won. \u2026 When everyone said I wasn\u2019t going to win the election, I said well I think I would. You know it is interesting, somebody came up to me and said the other day, gee whiz, the New York Times and other people, you know other groups, had you down at one percent, well, I said no I think I am going to win, and people smiled, George Stephanopoulos laughed, you remember. \u2026 And the New York Times and CNN and all of them, they did these polls, which were extremely bad and they turned out to be totally wrong, and my polls showed I was going to win. We thought we were going to win the night of the election.\n\nNational polling before the election showed Clinton winning more support \u2014 which she did, winning the popular vote by 2.1 percentage points. Trump\u2019s own polls showed him losing as well, according to reports shortly after the election. Trump himself has said that he thought he was going to lose on election night.\n\nIt is true that few expected Trump to win, and that George Stephanopoulos was once amused at the idea.\n\nTed Cruz\u2019s father knowing Lee Harvey Oswald\n\nWell that was in a newspaper. No, no, I like Ted Cruz, he\u2019s a friend of mine. But that was in the newspaper. I wasn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t say that. I was referring to a newspaper. A Ted Cruz article referred to a newspaper story with, had a picture of Ted Cruz, his father, and Lee Harvey Oswald, having breakfast.\n\nIt was the National Enquirer. I mean, honestly."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/gorsuch-mistakenly-says-bigly/2017/03/23/71cb6ed2-0fc0-11e7-aa57-2ca1b05c41b8_video.html", "text": "- Judge Neil Gorsuch mistakenly used President Trump's characteristic adjective, \"bigly\" during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing on March 22, and Sen.

(Arelis Hernandez/TWP)\n\nCritics have sharply questioned why the United States has admitted more than 150,000 unaccompanied minors, mostly from Central America, in the past three years, crowding immigration courts and public schools. This week, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) called it a \u201ckind of amnesty.\u201d\n\nBut the Montgomery County schools superintendent and advocates said that politicians should not judge immigrant children seeking a better life for themselves by one disturbing case.\n\n\u201cThe unaccompanied minors are overwhelmingly young people who are coming here fleeing horrific circumstances of violence in their countries,\u201d said Kim Propeack, political director at Casa, the group formerly known as Casa de Maryland but which now operates in that state, Virginia and Pennsylvania.\n\nA variety of U.S. government agencies have had contact with Montano and Sanchez Milian. Border agents held them first, and then, as the law requires, turned them over to an office at the Department of Health and Human Services, which sheltered them and apparently released them to their guardians in Maryland. The teens enrolled in public schools, which are required by federal law to admit them.\n\nBorder agents had given the teens notices to appear in immigration court. But U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which initiates deportation proceedings in immigration courts, never filed charges against Sanchez Milian. ICE officials said Wednesday that the teen was not a priority for deportation because he had no criminal record and \u201cno known gang affiliations.\u201d\n\nICE officials would not comment on Montano\u2019s deportation case because he is a minor, even though he has been charged as an adult in the rape case.\n\nThe teens have not entered a plea in the case. But Sanchez Milian\u2019s defense attorney, Andrew Jezic, said Wednesday that he was not guilty and called the encounter \u201cconsensual.\u201d Sanchez Milian had fled gang violence in Guatemala and was seeking a better life in the United States, Jezic said.\n\nHenry E. Sanchez Milian, also known as Henry E. Sanchez, age 18, is charged with raping a juvenile female Rockville High School student. (Montgomery County Police)\n\nOn Wednesday, a woman who lives in the house Montano shares with his uncle said she could not imagine the teen she knows by the nickname \u201cChepe\u201d committing such a crime. She said she has rented the room next to Montano\u2019s bedroom for about two months and described him as a \u201cmoto\u201d \u2014 Spanish for orphan, abandoned by his parents in El Salvador. He calls his uncle, \u00adOrlando Montano, \u201cPapa.\u201d\n\nThe elder Montano confirmed Tuesday that he is Jose Montano\u2019s guardian but would not answer other questions.\n\nWednesday afternoon, police arrived to search the small cottage. Officers took photos and left after about 15 minutes, handing Orlando Montano a piece of paper.\n\nJose Montano is being represented by Ron Gottlieb, an experienced lawyer in the public defender\u2019s office in Montgomery. Allen Wolf, the head of that office, declined to comment.\n\nMontano, who is from El Salvador, was apprehended in April 2016, five months after his 16th birthday. Sanchez Milian, from Guatemala, was caught in August of that year, days before he turned 18.\n\nBorder Patrol officials stopped both teens near McAllen, Tex., and detained them for less than the legal limit of 72 hours, then handed them over to HHS\u2019s Office for Refugee Resettlement, according to a federal official with direct knowledge of the case.\n\nUnder federal law, unaccompanied minors from Central America must be turned over to HHS for processing, which is meant to protect them from human trafficking and other dangers. HHS officials did not respond to repeated questions about the teens.\n\nJezic said he was told by Sanchez Milian\u2019s father that the teen was held in Texas for about 18 days. The father said he paid for his son\u2019s flight to Maryland and picked him up at Baltimore-Washington International Marshall Airport, Jezic said.\n\nMontano enrolled at Rockville High in August. Sanchez Milian followed one month later. The public defender who first represented the teens in court said Friday that Montano reads and writes in Spanish and had gone as far as seventh grade in El Salvador.\n\nAt Rockville High, both teens were in a special program for non-English speakers, school officials said this week. They were not in classes with the alleged victim, who prosecutors say was forced into a boys\u2019 bathroom and raped as she cried out in pain and repeatedly told them to stop.\n\nPolice said that until Thursday\u2019s arrests, they had never heard of the suspects.\n\nSanchez Milian and Montano are being held without bond. Each is charged with one count of first-degree rape and two counts of first-degree sex offense.\n\nJezic said that Sanchez Milian was \u201cfleeing from gang threats and gang violence\u201d in his home country and spent about four weeks traveling to the United States. He would like to seek asylum in this country.\n\nMatthew Bourke, a spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the Homeland Security Department, initially said that Sanchez Milian was issued a notice to appear in front of an immigration judge and that it was \u201cwaiting to be scheduled.\u201d\n\nBut Kathryn Mattingly, a spokeswoman for the immigration courts, which report to the Justice Department, said they had no record that ICE had filed a deportation claim.\n\nLater, Bourke acknowledged that the agency had not, noting that there are \u201c500 other cases ICE is responsible for in the Baltimore Area of Responsibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a noncriminal alien who had been released from detention with no known gang affiliations,\u201d Bourke said in a statement. \u201cThe priority to prompt immigration court to review a case has been whether the alien has a criminal conviction or if they\u2019re in detention.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that \u201chad Sanchez Milian appeared in immigration court prior to his criminal arrest, it is significantly unlikely a judge would have made any decision that would have allowed for his immediate removal.\u201d\n\nImmigration officials now are pursuing Sanchez Milian\u2019s deportation and say they have asked local authorities to alert them if he were to make bond.\n\nThey sought to deport Montano before the rape allegations, filing a case in November, Mattingly said. The Baltimore Immigration Court scheduled Montano for an initial hearing on Jan. 24. That day, the court moved his hearing to Dec. 11. Mattingly declined to provide an explanation, saying the courts do not comment on an immigration judge\u2019s decisions.\n\nBourke would not comment on Montano\u2019s case because he is a minor.\n\nJezic said the public should keep in mind that defendants are innocent until proven guilty. \u201cThere has been a rush to judgment,\u201d the lawyer said.\n\nJennifer Jenkins contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/manafort-is-gone-but-his-business-associate-remains-a-key-part-of-trumps-operation/2017/03/22/6ecbaa96-0f0f-11e7-9b0d-d27c98455440_story.html", "text": "The White House on Wednesday sought to again distance itself from President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, who is under increasing scrutiny over his connections to Russian business interests.\n\nBut even as Trump officials downplay Manafort\u2019s role, his \u00addecade-long business associate Rick Gates remains entrenched in the president\u2019s operation. Gates is one of four people leading a Trump-blessed group that defends the president\u2019s agenda. As recently as last week, he was at the White House to meet with officials as part of that work.\n\nThrough Manafort, Gates is tied to many of the same business titans from Ukraine and Russia, including Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch with strong ties to Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin. On Wednesday, the Associated Press reported that Manafort had a multimillion-dollar contract with Deripaska between at least 2005 and 2009 that was aimed at helping the political interests of Putin.\n\nManafort has acknowledged the contract with Deripaska but denied that it, or any other of their dealings, had anything to do with the Russian government. In a brief interview, Gates described his work as being focused on \u201csupporting the private equity fund started by the firm and democracy building and party building in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nGates also acknowledged a role in at least two recent, controversial deals involving separate Putin-connected oligarchs, including one other with Deripaska. Both led to lawsuits in which Gates was listed as a partner to Manafort, though Gates said he holds no equity interest in the firm.\n\n(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nPotential connections between Trump\u2019s associates and the Russian government gained renewed interest this week after FBI Director James B. Comey publicly confirmed Monday that his agency is actively investigating whether there was collusion between the two sides. Manafort and Gates said they had not been contacted by the FBI or any other law enforcement agency.\n\nGates and Manafort are two of many Trump associates with connections to Russia, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn; Carter Page, a former Trump foreign policy adviser; and Roger Stone, a Trump ally who claimed to have communicated indirectly with WikiLeaks before emails hacked by Russian agents were published last summer. All have denied any wrongdoing and said their alleged ties to Russia are being exaggerated to undermine the president.\n\nManafort\u2019s role in potential dealings with Russia gained new attention Wednesday when the AP reported that Manafort proposed in 2005 a plan to influence politics, business dealings and news coverage inside the United States, Europe and the former Soviet republics to benefit the Putin government. Gates did not join the firm until the following year.\n\nManafort said Wednesday that his work for Deripaska was designed to benefit the Russian business executive\u2019s company, Rusal, not the Russian government.\n\n\u201cI have always publicly acknowledged that I worked for Mr. Deripaska and his company,\u201d Manafort said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cI did not work for the Russian government. Once again, smear and innuendo are being used to paint a false picture.\u201d\n\nAsked about the AP report at his daily briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Wednesday, \u201cNothing in this morning\u2019s report references any actions by the president, the White House or any Trump administration official.\u201d\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Manafort and Richard H. Davis, a longtime Republican political consultant, formed Davis Manafort. Gates joined the firm in 2006.\n\nPaul Manafort talks with Trump campaign staff following the results of the Indiana state primary at Trump Tower in Manhattan May 3, 2016. (Lucas Jackson/Reuters)\n\nThat year, the firm wooed Deripaska as a client, telling him that their goal was to set up a $200 million fund to make a series of private equity investments and acquisitions, primarily in Russia and Ukraine, according to documents in the lawsuit. The partnership making the investments was created in the Cayman Islands in 2007.\n\nBy 2014, relations between Manafort and Gates and Derispaska had soured considerably.\n\nThat year, Gates and Manafort were sued by Deripaska, who accused them in a Cayman Islands court of taking nearly $19 million intended for investments, then failing to account for the funds, return them or respond to numerous inquiries about exactly how the money was used.\n\nAt one point, attorneys for Deripaska claimed that they could not locate Manafort or Gates. The Russian tycoon hired a private investigator to track them down, according to a 2014 petition that Deripaska\u2019s attorneys filed in a Cayman Islands court seeking recovery of the money.\n\n\u201cIt appears that Paul Manafort and Rick Gates have simply disappeared,\u201d the petition stated.\n\nA spokeswoman for Deripaska issued a statement Wednesday in Moscow indicating that the suit may still be pending. Vera Kurochkina, the spokeswoman, said that Deripaska did not pay Manafort for Russia-related work but instead paid him for investment consulting that is \u201cthe subject of legal claims.\u201d\n\nManafort\u2019s attorney, Richard Hibey, did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the status of the Cayman Islands dispute.\n\nDeripaska\u2019s ties to Putin are so close that Russia\u2019s foreign minister has asked U.S. secretary of states for more than a decade to help Deripaska secure a visa to enter the United States. According to a 2007 account in the Wall Street Journal, Deripaska had been denied admission by the Justice Department because of alleged ties to organized crime.\n\nAs recently as 2016, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov asked then-Secretary of State John F. Kerry for assistance in getting a visa for the aluminum magnate.\n\nIn 2014, Manafort and Gates were also named in a different lawsuit alleging that they were helping a Ukrainian oligarch named Dmitry Firtash, who has ties to Putin. In attempting to put together an $850 million deal to build luxury housing on the site of the Drake Hotel in New York City, the legal complaint alleged, Manafort and Gates were investing ill-gotten gains Firtash received for an energy deal he had done with a Russian firm. That lawsuit was dismissed.\n\nDuring that same time, Manafort and Gates were active in Washington promoting the policy priorities of the political party of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia after violent street protests against him broke out in Kiev in late 2014. Between 2012 and 2014, Gates arranged introductions for two Washington lobbying firms \u2014 the Podesta Group and Mercury LLC \u2014 to represent the European Center for a Modern Ukraine.\n\nAlice Crites, David Nakamura and Adam Entous contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-intelligence-chair-says-its-possible-trumps-communications-were-intercepted/2017/03/22/f45e18ba-0f2d-11e7-9b0d-d27c98455440_story.html", "text": "The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday accused U.S. spy agencies of abusing their surveillance powers by gathering and sharing information about President Trump and his transition team, an unproven charge that was quickly embraced by the White House but threatened to derail the committee\u2019s investigation of possible Trump campaign ties to Russia.\n\nRep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), one of Trump\u2019s closest allies on Capitol Hill, said he was alarmed after seeing intelligence reports disseminated after the Nov. 8 election that made references to U.S. citizens affiliated with Trump, and possibly the president-elect himself. He appeared to be referring to relatively routine cases of surveillance on foreign individuals in which they communicated with or mentioned Americans.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve read seems to me to be some level of surveillance activity \u2014 perhaps legal, but I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s right,\u201d Nunes said to reporters outside the White House. \u201cI don\u2019t know that the American people would be comfortable with what I\u2019ve read.\u201d\n\nBut Nunes\u2019s refusal to disclose how he had obtained the documents and his unusual handling of the material \u2014 which he withheld from other committee members even while rushing to present it to the White House \u2014 were interpreted by some as a sign that his discovery was engineered to help the White House.\n\nTrump said he regarded Nunes\u2019s disclosures as validation of his widely discredited claim that he was the illegal target of a wiretapping operation last fall ordered by President Barack Obama. Asked whether he felt vindicated, Trump said during a brief public appearance at the White House: \u201cI somewhat do. I must tell you I somewhat do. I very much appreciated the fact that they found what they found.\u201d\n\n(Reuters)\n\nThe timing of Nunes\u2019s disclosures was politically advantageous for Trump, coming just days after FBI Director James B. Comey testified that the president\u2019s wiretapping claims were groundless and falling on a day when Republicans struggled to muster enough votes to pass a health-care overhaul bill.\n\nNunes\u2019s White House visit was denounced by Democrats as a partisan move that severely damaged the prospects of the committee carrying out an impartial probe.\n\nRep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said that Nunes\u2019s action \u201ccasts quite a profound cloud over our ability to do the work,\u201d and he called for the formation of an independent commission. \u201cIf the chairman is going to continue to go to the White House rather than his own committee, there\u2019s no way we can conduct this investigation.\u201d\n\nOther Democrats suggested that Nunes may have crossed a legal line by publicly talking about secret intelligence work.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said the congressman\u2019s statements \u201cappear to reveal classified information, which is a serious concern. With regard to the substance of his claims, I have no idea what he is talking about.\u2019\u2019\n\nNunes, who served as a member of Trump\u2019s transition team, would not say whether his information came from a source affiliated with the White House \u2014 or whether the reports he had seen simply cited cables between foreign entities or direct communications between Trump or his team and a foreign agent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to get into any of this,\u201d he said, stressing only that it was \u201cvery clear to me\u201d who the Trump team officials referenced in the report were.\n\n(The Washington Post)\n\nThe White House has previously enlisted Nunes, as well as a senior U.S. intelligence official, to knock down politically damaging reports about Trump and Russia. White House officials dismissed suggestions that Trump aides had coordinated with Nunes.\n\n\u201cWe watched his press conference on the Hill at the same time everybody else did,\u201d White House deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have any information before that.\u201d\n\nThe developments added to the intrigue and animosity that have so far characterized Trump\u2019s relationship with U.S. intelligence agencies, as well as the administration\u2019s efforts to fend off reports of Russian ties that forced the resignation of Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and a recusal on Russia-related matters by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nNunes\u2019s claims raise the possibility that U.S. spy agencies violated long-standing rules that are designed to protect U.S. citizens from surveillance and require Americans\u2019 names to be stricken from intelligence reports except in rare circumstances. But the lack of detail provided by Nunes, and the ambiguous wording he used in his public appearances to describe the materials, made it hard to determine whether there was any violation.\n\nNunes\u2019s statements appear to center on surveillance approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a secretive panel that authorizes the interception of communications of known or suspected agents of foreign powers \u2014 such as ambassadors \u2014 or terrorism suspects.\n\nThough it is generally not acknowledged, the U.S. government has for years used FISA warrants to eavesdrop on ambassadors, embassies and others believed to be acting in America on behalf of foreign governments.\n\nWhile such surveillance aims to gather intelligence about foreign actors, it can often pick up conversations with their American counterparts \u2014 such as State Department officials, lawmakers or other Americans who speak to foreign officials. Agencies refer to such monitoring as \u201cincidental\u2019\u2019 collection and take steps to minimize the sharing of those people\u2019s names or identifying information within the government, often by masking their names in internal reports about the intercepted communications.\n\nNunes described the surveillance as apparently legal but nevertheless troubling because it involved the activities of Trump and his aides after he was elected but before he became president.\n\n\u201cIt looks to me like it was all legally collected. It was a lot of information on the president-elect and the transition team and what they were doing,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nNunes\u2019s statements were remarkable on numerous levels. He publicly discussed FISA-approved surveillance, something that Comey had refused to do before Nunes\u2019s committee days earlier. Nunes attributed his information to an anonymous source, after he and other members of his party have bemoaned media reports relying on unnamed people.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, Nunes went to the White House to brief the president on the details of material potentially gathered as part of his panel\u2019s investigation into associates of the president and Russia\u2019s interference in the campaign.\n\nNunes said that none of what he reviewed involved Trump team contacts with Russian officials. He initially said the collection included details of Trump\u2019s conversations but then backed away from that claim, saying only that it was \u201cpossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have seen intelligence reports that clearly show that the president-elect and his team were at least monitored and disseminated out in intelligence,\u2019\u2019 he said, adding that he hoped to ascertain who in the government had sought details about the Trump team and had asked for their identities to be revealed, or \u201cunmasked,\u201d in the intelligence reports.\n\nNunes also said that he hoped to have more information by Friday and had asked the FBI, the CIA and the National Security Agency to \u201cprovide a full account of these surveillance activities.\u201d\n\nThe directors of the FBI and NSA spent more than five hours Monday being grilled by lawmakers on Nunes\u2019s committee about the counterintelligence probe looking for any evidence of coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian officials during the election. Comey was also asked about Trump\u2019s claims on Twitter that he had been the victim of an Obama-ordered wiretap. \u201cI have no information that supports those tweets,\u2019\u2019 Comey said.\n\nSchiff said that after speaking with Nunes on Wednesday afternoon, the Republican said that most of the names of American citizens were not \u201cunmasked\u201d in the intelligence reports but that it was still possible to ascertain their identities.\n\n\u201cBecause the committee has still not been provided the intercepts in the possession of the chairman, it is impossible to evaluate the chairman\u2019s claims. It certainly does not suggest \u2014 in any way \u2014 that the president was wiretapped by his predecessor,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nSen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) called Nunes\u2019s actions Wednesday \u201cremarkable\u201d and \u201cbizarre,\u201d and said the partisan jockeying from Nunes and Schiff \u2014 with \u201cno substantiation,\u201d McCain added \u2014 were turning the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation into a political sideshow.\n\nHe called for either a select committee or an independent commission to look into the matter.\n\n\u201cNo longer does the Congress have credibility to handle this alone, and I don\u2019t say that lightly,\u201d McCain said on MSNBC.\n\nHe stressed, however, that he believes the Senate Intelligence Committee is doing \u201ca good job\u201d with its investigation.\n\nJohn Wagner, Adam Entous, Abby Phillip, Julie Tate and Ellen Nakashima contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/neil-gorsuch-confirmation-hearings-supreme-court-nominee-heads-into-day-3/2017/03/21/2c346a8c-0e93-11e7-ab07-07d9f521f6b5_story.html", "text": "Democratic senators more aggressively questioned Judge Neil Gorsuch on Wednesday in hopes of drawing him out on his potential independence from President Trump, while Republicans began congratulating him \u2014 signaling they anticipate his successful confirmation to the Supreme Court.\n\nSenators completed two days of questioning Gorsuch with repeated inquiries about abortion rights, money in politics and a Supreme Court ruling issued on Wednesday that reversed a decision of his appeals court. The hearings will continue Thursday with testimony of those who support and oppose the nomination of the 49-year-old judge on the Denver-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit.\n\n[Supreme Court sets higher bar for education of students with disabilities]\n\nDemocrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee became increasingly frustrated by Gorsuch\u2019s bland answers. \u201cYou have been very much able to avoid any specificity like no one I have ever seen before,\u201d said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nWhen pressed by Sen. Amy Klobacher (D-Minn.) on various noncommittal answers, Gorsuch said it would be wrong for him to be more candid about what he would do on the bench. \u201cIt\u2019s like a campaign promise for office, it seems to me,\u201d Gorsuch said.\n\n(Video: Reuters / Photo: Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nKlobacher responded: \u201cWe have to figure out what your philosophy is.\u201d\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans seemed pretty sure that Gorsuch would be a conservative very much in the mold of the justice he would replace, Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016.\n\nThe politics of the nomination again were at center stage. When Gorsuch said he did not think of judges as Democrats or Republicans, Sen. Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii) responded if that were true, the committee would be considering the man President Barack Obama nominated, Judge Merrick Garland. Senate Republicans denied Garland a hearing and a vote on his nomination.\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), pressing Gorsuch on the issue of campaign finance, said \u201ccommentators\u201d now describe the Supreme Court \u201cas instruments of the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nGorsuch put both hands to his chest and responded he was \u201cdistressed that you think that judges or the Supreme Court is an organ of a party.\u201d\n\nBut partisan rancor over Supreme Court nominations is not new, and Republicans were less interested in questioning Gorsuch than congratulating him.\n\nSen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), who has participated in 14 Supreme Court confirmation hearings, told Gorsuch, \u201cI've seen an awful lot of great people in the law come before this committee. And I haven't seen anybody any better than you.\u201d\n\n(Jenny Starrs/Photo: Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cWhy anybody in this body would vote against you, I'll never understand,\u201d Hatch said later.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) credited Gorsuch for enduring the marathon hearings and said he was passing the test \u201cwith flying colors.\u201d\n\nTrump again was frequently mentioned.\n\nSen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) questioned Gorsuch on the Constitution\u2019s \u201cemoluments clause,\u201d which states the president cannot accept gifts from foreign agents without approval from Congress. Given \u201congoing litigation\u201d involving that clause, Gorsuch said, \u201cI have to be very careful about expressing any views.\u201d\n\nLeahy also noted Gorsuch has strong support from Trump senior counselor Stephen K. Bannon, whom the senator accused of \u201cgiving a platform to extremists and misogynists and racists.\u201d Another senior Trump aide, Reince Priebus, had said Gorsuch could potentially change 40 years of law, Leahy said.\n\n\u201cWhat vision do you share with President Trump?\u201d the senator asked.\n\n\u201cRespectfully, none of you speaks for me,\u201d said Gorsuch. \u201cI am a judge. I am independent. I make up my own mind.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Gorsuch seemed to reject a Feb. 13 comment from senior White House policy adviser Stephen Miller that Trump\u2019s actions on national security \u201cwill not be questioned,\u201d which some interpreted as a signal that Trump could ignore judicial orders.\n\n\u201cYou better believe I expect judicial decrees to be obeyed,\u201d Gorsuch said.\n\n[How Gorsuch\u2019s judicial experience compares with Supreme Court predecessors]\n\nGorsuch also declined to give his view on Scalia\u2019s characterization of the Voting Rights Act as a \u201cperpetuation of racial entitlement.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t speak for Justice Scalia. I speak for myself,\u201d he told the committee.\n\n\u201cYou have been very hesitant to even talk about various Supreme Court precedents,\u201d Leahy told Gorsuch, noting that Justices John G. Roberts Jr. and Samuel Alito took positions on specific cases during their confirmation hearings.\n\nThe latest hearing produced an emotional exchange between Gorsuch and Feinstein on the subject of women\u2019s rights.\n\n\u201cYou are pivotal in this,\u201d she told Gorsuch, saying that the \u201coriginalist\u2019\u2019 interpretation of the Constitution to which he adheres has been used in the past to say that the Constitution does not cover women and gays.\n\n[Gorsuch promises independence from Trump \u2014 and steals Democrats\u2019 line of attack]\n\n\u201cNo one is looking to return us to horse-and-buggy days,\u201d Gorsuch responded. Supreme Court precedent has established that the Constitution\u2019s Equal Protection Clause is wide enough to encompass those who were not recognized when it was written.\n\n\u201cA good judge starts with precedent and doesn\u2019t reinvent the wheel,\u201d Gorsuch said, adding that it \u201cmatters not a whit\u201d that some who wrote the Constitution were racists or sexists, \u201cbecause they were.\u201d What matters, Gorsuch said, were \u201cwhat the words on the page mean.\u201d\n\nThe two also discussed a book that Gorsuch wrote in which he opposed physician-assisted suicide and said any taking of a human life was wrong.\n\nFeinstein mentioned the death of her father and a close friend, which she said were agonizing. She mentioned California\u2019s recent physician-assisted suicide law.\n\n[Opinion: Good-golly Gorsuch may turn out to be a rascal on the bench]\n\n\u201cMy heart goes out to you,\u201d Gorsuch said, and then appeared to choke up when he mentioned the death of his own father. He said his personal views would have no role in his duties as a judge and noted the Supreme Court has ruled that states may allow laws such as California\u2019s.\n\nDemocratic senators also raised questions about a decision that had just been issued across the street from the hearing room at the Supreme Court.\n\nThe eight sitting justices decided unanimously on Wednesday to boost the standards of education that public schools provide to learning-disabled students, rejecting an earlier ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit \u2014 the one that Gorsuch serves on \u2014 saying that it had set the bar too low for students. Gorsuch had ruled similarly in a different case.\n\nAt issue was whether schools must provide disabled children \u201csome\u201d educational benefit \u2014 which several lower courts have interpreted to mean just more than trivial progress \u2014 or whether students legally deserve something more.\n\nIn response to questions from Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), Gorsuch defended his court\u2019s decision, saying that they were applying what the 10th Circuit had decided in a 1996 case, which adopted the standard that the services have to be more than de minimis .\n\n\u201cI was bound by circuit precedent,\u201d Gorsuch said, saying that ruling against an autistic child and his parents was \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d\n\nRepublicans are hoping to refer Gorsuch to the full Senate by April 3 and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said that the judge will be confirmed to the Supreme Court before Easter.\n\n[Senate Democrats want more information about Gorsuch\u2019s role at DOJ]\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said this week that it would be \u201cunseemly\u201d for the Senate to confirm Gorsuch while the FBI is investigating whether Trump\u2019s presidential campaign was swayed by Russian interference.\n\nBut Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W. Va.), a key moderate and a member of Schumer\u2019s leadership team, said on Wednesday that the ongoing FBI investigation \u201cshouldn\u2019t have any bearing\u201d on Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation.\n\n\u201cI want to get a working court, okay? What they did to Merrick Garland was wrong. I don\u2019t want to do the same. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right,\u201d Manchin said at a Washington Post Live event on Trump\u2019s early weeks in office.\n\nManchin later visited the Judiciary Committee room to watch the proceedings for a few minutes \u2014 a notable appearance given that he is one of several moderate Democrats facing reelection next year who are the targets of a multimillion-dollar ad campaign bankrolled by conservative groups in hopes of securing Gorsuch a filibuster-proof vote tally. Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), another potential vote for Gorsuch, made a similar visit on Tuesday.\n\nManchin said at the Post event that he plans to meet again with Gorsuch before deciding how to vote.\n\n\u201cIf Gorsuch is the right person or not, I can\u2019t say that as of yet,\u201d he said. \u201cIs there 60 votes as of yet, I don\u2019t think, I don\u2019t see it.

That was no accident. The CBC, many members of which boycotted Trump\u2019s inauguration, agreed to meet with the president only if the meeting was substantive.\n\n\u201cThe Congressional Black Caucus is not going to be a potted plant or a photo opportunity,\u201d said Rep.

(Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nThe CBC\u2019s leaders arrived at Wednesday\u2019s meeting with a policy memo titled \u201cA Lot to Lose.\u201d Rep. Cedric L. Richmond (D-La.), the CBC\u2019s chairman, was joined by Reps. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), Gwen Moore (D-Wis.), Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.), Andr\u00e9 Carson (D-Ind.) and Anthony G. Brown (D-Md.).\n\n\u201cWe never thought we\u2019d agree on everything in this meeting, but the one thing we did ask is for both sides to be candid,\u201d Richmond said afterward. \u201cHe listened, and we talked, and we proposed a lot of solutions, many of which I think he had not heard before, and we\u2019re going to keep advocating.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s meeting grew out of an awkward incident last month, when during a 77-minute news conference Trump asked April Ryan, a black reporter with the American Urban Radio Networks, if she could set up a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\n\u201cAre they friends of yours?\u201d Trump asked.\n\nRyan noted that she was a journalist, and not part of the CBC. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re watching right now,\u201d she said.\n\nThat gaffe started negotiations about a possible meeting, one that CBC members wanted to avoid turning into presidential PR. Since winning the presidency, Trump has had several awkward moments involving African Americans. At a rally in Pennsylvania, Trump thanked black voters who decided to sit out the election: \u201cThat was big.\u201d\n\nAt an event he held to mark the outset of Black History Month, Trump rambled about his 80-point defeat among black voters, hypothesized about what could get him to a majority of the black vote in 2020, and mentioned the abolitionist Frederick Douglass as \u201can example of somebody who\u2019s done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more.\u201d Douglass died in 1895.\n\n\u201cHe has not surrounded himself with people who can keep him informed,\u201d said Lawrence, whose state broke for Trump in part because of weakened black turnout. \u201cHe painted us as one homogenous group \u2014 broke, being shot at, uneducated. He needs to be given the opportunity to learn.\u201d\n\nThe CBC\u2019s proposals for Trump did sync with what he\u2019d occasionally promised on the trail. During the press scrum, Trump said that \u201cevery American child has a right to grow up in a safe community, to attend great schools, to graduate with access to high-paying jobs,\u201d implying that African Americans had been denied this. But CBC members are waiting for actual policy proposals.\n\n\u201cThere could be something, perhaps, in the area of infrastructure, or in better employment opportunities,\u201d said Rep. William Lacy Clay (D-Mo.). \u201cI can\u2019t point to anything he\u2019s done so far.\u201d\n\nInstead, in the White House\u2019s \u201cskinny budget,\u201d spending for domestic programs was cut to make the math work on increased defense funding. In a Wednesday article for the political journal Democracy, Matthew Colangelo, deputy assistant to the president for economic policy in the Obama administration, listed other Trump decisions that disproportionately hurt black voters, such as an executive order that weakened the Federal Housing Administration and a Justice Department decision to abandon a legal challenge \u2014 which had been winning in court \u2014 against alleged racial gerrymandering in Texas.\n\n\u201cIn just two months, the Trump Administration has already made it harder for African Americans to buy a house, to vote, to enjoy clean air and water, and to retire with dignity,\u201d wrote Colangelo. \u201cThe President\u2019s campaign pledge was correct: The results of his policies for African Americans have in fact been \u2018amazing\u2019 \u2014 it is amazing how much harm can be done so quickly.\u201d\n\nAnd CBC members did not quite dodge the photo op.

It\u2019s unclear why his process took that long.\n\nAs governor between 2003 and 2011, Perdue frequently clashed with the Georgia State Ethics Commission and refused to place his business assets into a blind trust. He faced 13 complaints, according to reporting by the New York Times, and several fines for campaign finance violations. He has also been blasted by critics for giving comfortable government jobs to campaign donors and business partners.\n\nIn 2005, Georgia state Rep. Larry O\u2019Neal \u2014 Perdue\u2019s longtime lawyer \u2014 introduced an amendment that made a new tax cut on land sales retroactive to sales from the previous years. Perdue saved $100,000 on taxes thanks to the measure.\n\nPerdue has significant agriculture business holdings that could pose a conflict of interest if he is confirmed at USDA, includes Georgia-based grain merchandiser called AGrowStar. If confirmed as agriculture secretary, Perdue has vowed to turn over his business holdings to new trusts that will not benefit him or his wife, according to public documents sent to the Office of Government Ethics. He said he will resign his positions on several boards, including the National Grain and Feed Association and the Georgia Agribusiness Council.\n\n(Senate Agriculture Committee)\n\nEthics watchdogs have balked at Perdue\u2019s record as governor and have called Trump\u2019s decision to appoint the former Georgia governor a contradiction of his promise to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington.\n\nJordan Libowitz, a spokesman at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said he hopes those ethics concerns are addressed during the hearing Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe want to remind people about the things that happened in Perdue\u2019s past,\u201d Libowitz said. \u201cWe don\u2019t make judgments about whether nominees are fit to serve or not, but these are really important issues that need to be discussed.\u201d\n\nThe Senate Agriculture Committee also will probably probe Perdue on deep proposed cuts at the department that would reduce its discretionary spending power by $4.7 billion, or about 20 percent. USDA\u2019s annual budget for 2016 was $164 billion, but the bulk of those appropriations go toward mandatory spending programs including the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program \u2014 or SNAP, also known as \u201cfood stamps\u201d \u2014 and crop subsidies. The rest of its budget, known as \u201cdiscretionary spending,\u201d goes toward agricultural research, rural development programs, food safety, and nutritional assistance for women and children (WIC).\n\nThe administration\u2019s proposed budget provided little detail about where the cuts would come from, but among those specified are a savings of $500 million by eliminating a program that provides loans and grants for rural water and waste infrastructure and $95 million in savings by eliminating parts of the Rural Business-Cooperative Service.\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow (Mich.), the ranking Democrat on the Agriculture Committee, strongly opposed the cuts, saying in a statement last week that they would hurt families living in small towns and farmers. \u201cThis proposal undermines job creation by eliminating access to credit for small businesses and completely ends rural water infrastructure programs that could leave small towns without clean drinking water or safe sewer systems,\u201d she said.\n\n[What Trump cut in his budget]\n\nView Graphic Here are the people Trump has chosen for his Cabinet\n\nPerdue, a veterinarian by training, began his political career in local politics, moving from a community council to the state legislature in the early 1990s. After a decade as a state senator, Perdue became governor of Georgia in 2002 and was reelected in 2006.\n\n[How long Cabinet confirmations take \u2014 and why past nominees failed]\n\nPerdue is widely expected to be confirmed by the Senate. He has received support from major food and agriculture interest groups, including the American Farm Bureau, the National Corn Growers Association, National Restaurant Association and the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association.

The high court\u2019s ruling quickly became the focus of questions Wednesday at Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation hearing.\n\nIn its unanimous ruling, the Supreme Court said that a child\u2019s \u201ceducational program must be appropriately ambitious in light of his circumstances\u201d and that \u201cevery child should have the chance to meet challenging objectives\u201d even if the child is not fully integrated into regular classrooms.\n\n[Court to decide: What do schools owe children with disabilities?]\n\nThe court stopped short of setting a bright-line rule, deferring to the expertise and judgment of school officials and acknowledging the unique set of circumstances of each child with a disability.\n\nBut the justices sent a strong, clear message with their unanimous decision that the 10th Circuit standard was too low.\n\nAny standard, the court said, that is not centered on \u201cstudent progress would do little to remedy the pervasive and tragic academic stagnation that prompted Congress to act\u201d when it passed the 1975 law that provides federal funds to help states cover the cost of educating students with disabilities.\n\n\u201cWhen all is said and done, a student offered an educational program providing \u2018merely more than de minimis\u2019 progress from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an education at all,\u201d wrote Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who wrote the 16-page opinion. \u201cFor children with disabilities, receiving instruction that aims so low would be tantamount to \u2018sitting idly . . . awaiting the time when they were old enough to \u201cdrop out.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\n\nLower courts have been split on what level of educational benefit is guaranteed under the federal law known as the Individuals With Disabilities in Education Act, or IDEA. The majority of appeals courts, including the 10th Circuit, say that students are owed \u201csome\u201d benefit, which courts have interpreted to mean just more than trivial. Two appeals courts established a higher bar, calling for a \u201cmeaningful\u201d benefit.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision more clearly defines a uniform nationwide standard for the more than 6 million children with disabilities who qualify for services under IDEA. Advocates said that the ruling would not only affect decisions in the relatively few special-education disputes that go to court but would also more broadly shift the balance of power between families and school officials, pushing schools to set more ambitious goals tailored more carefully to each student\u2019s particular needs.\n\nGary Mayerson, a board member of the advocacy organization Autism Speaks, said that the timing of the decision \u201ccouldn\u2019t be better,\u201d as it comes just before the spring season when many schools draw up individual education plans for students with disabilities.\n\n\u201cSchool districts will have the perfect opportunity to do the right thing and create programs that are consistent with the new clarified standard,\u201d Mayerson said.\n\nThe court did not raise the bar as far as some advocates had hoped, to call for \u201csubstantially equal\u201d opportunities for students with disabilities \u2014 a standard that critics said could have significantly increased costs. Francisco Negron of the National School Boards Association said the decision was \u201cmeasured\u201d and set an expectation that \u201cschool districts will be comfortable with and reflects in many ways how they\u2019re already operating.\u201d\n\nThe justices released their decision Wednesday morning as Gorsuch was testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the third day of his confirmation hearings.\n\nAlmost immediately, he was asked about his application in 2008 of the lower 10th Circuit standard. He said that standard was set in a 1996 decision, which determined that services have to be \u201cmore than de minimis\u201d or, in other words, result in at least minimal progress by the student.\n\n\u201cI was bound by circuit precedent,\u201d Gorsuch told the committee, saying that ruling against a child with autism and his parents was \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d\n\nHe added that his circuit was unanimously taking the same position in all such cases. Now that the Supreme Court has said that is the wrong standard, he said, \u201cFine, I will follow the law.\u201d\n\n[Gorsuch hearings Day 3: Democrats press judge on his independence from Trump]\n\nSen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said Gorsuch had read the law the wrong way and made the precedent worse by adding the word \u201cmerely\u201d to the standard.\n\nIn response to a series of follow-up questions from Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Gorsuch rejected her suggestion that he was \u201canywhere out of the mainstream\u201d in applying the standard rejected by the Supreme Court. He noted that several other appellate courts had relied on the same standard.\n\nScheduled to testify at Gorsuch\u2019s hearing later this week is Jeff Perkins, the father of the child with autism whom Gorsuch ruled against in the 2008 case.\n\nThe case decided Wednesday involves Endrew F., a Colorado boy who was diagnosed with autism at age 2.\n\nHis parents pulled him out of a public schools in Douglas County, south of Denver, after his behavior deteriorated dramatically and he made what they said was almost no academic progress. They placed him in private school, where he made rapid progress, and they sought reimbursement for tuition. They are entitled to that reimbursement if they can prove that the public school failed to provide a \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d under federal law.\n\nThe 10th Circuit ruled in 2015 against Endrew, finding that he had made enough progress under his education plan to satisfy the \u201cmerely more than de minimis\u201d standard. Gorsuch was not part of the panel that decided that case. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision on Wednesday sends the case back to the appeals court to decide in light of its decision.\n\nWilliam Trachman, a lawyer for the Douglas County schools, said the district is confident that its work already meets the Supreme Court\u2019s standard and looks forward to proving it.\n\nColorado lawyer Jack Robinson represented both Endrew and the Perkins family in the 2008 case. Robinson said that until now, too many schools have treated parents dismissively, understanding that \u2014 because of the 10th Circuit\u2019s rulings \u2014 they would not be held accountable for failing to adequately serve a child with a disability.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision changes\u00ad the equation for schools, he said, giving parents a \u201cposture of greater strength\u201d in negotiating for what they believe is best for their children.\n\nRobert Barnes contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/03/22/legislative-rollback-of-obama-era-worker-safety-rules-awaits-trumps-signature/", "text": "\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington on Dec. 12, 2016. (Susan Walsh/AP)\n\nThe Senate passed legislation Wednesday to roll back the second of two Obama-era worker safety regulations that aimed to track and reduce workplace injuries and deaths.\n\nBoth bills, which call for the elimination of two Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules, now await President Trump\u2019s signature. Administration officials said he plans to approve both measures.\n\nThe Senate voted Wednesday along party lines, passing the second measure 50 to 48. The Republican-led effort takes aim at a new rule that gave OSHA authority to issue citations and levy fines against companies with 10 or more employees if they failed to record illnesses, injuries and deaths that dated back as far as five years.\n\nAdopted in January, the rule responded to a 2012 D.C. Court of Appeals decision \u2014 Volks Constructors v. Secretary of Labor \u2014 that limited OSHA\u2019s power to issue citations for record-keeping violations to only those that took place within the last six months.\n\nBefore the lawsuit and court ruling, OSHA had for decades issued citations for violations that went back as much as five years, but Volks Constructors successfully challenged their authority in court.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) led the effort to kill the rule Wednesday, calling it a \u201cheavy-handed regulation\u201d that increased \u201cpaperwork burdens\u201d for businesses while doing little to improve worker safety.\n\nSen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the ranking Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, argued against the measure, saying OSHA needed the rule. Otherwise, businesses would view such record-keeping as optional, she added.\n\n\u201cThis goes against everything President Trump promised workers on the campaign trail,\u201d she said.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce led lobbying efforts to roll back the Volks rule. On Tuesday, the chamber sent a letter to congressional leaders titled \u201cKey Vote Alert!\u201d to let them know their vote on the issue would probably be included in their annual \u201cHow They Voted\u201d scorecard.\n\n\u201cOSHA\u2019s Volks Rule will improperly subject millions of American businesses to citations for paperwork violations, while doing nothing to improve worker health and safety,\u201d the chamber\u2019s letter said. \u201cIt simultaneously represents a usurpation of Congress\u2019 power to write the laws and a direct rejection of the judicial branch\u2019s authority to rein in an agency when it exceeds its authority.\n\nOpponents of the bill also increased their lobbying in the days leading up to the vote. Most notable was a March 19 letter to congressional leaders from the former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioners \u2014 one appointed by President George W. Bush and another by President Barack Obama \u2014 urging a \u201cno\u201d vote on the bill.\n\n\u201cStatistics from this survey play an important role in setting national workplace safety strategies, and are widely used by employers for benchmarking their own injury experience,\u201d wrote commissioners Kathleen Utgoff and Erica Groshen.\n\n\u201cIn many industries, employers must provide data on their injury rates in competing for contracts,\u201d Utgoff and Groshen added. \u201cIf this legislation passes, responsible employers who accurately record workplace injuries will be at a disadvantage competing with employers who do not maintain accurate records.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, the Senate voted to kill the first of the targeted regulations, the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule, which required businesses to disclose and correct serious safety violations when bidding for federal contracts valued at $500,000 or more. As with the Volks rule, the Senate vote divided along party lines, with Republicans successfully passing it 49 to 48.\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s election, the chamber and other business groups created wish lists for regulations they wanted to see eliminated, and these two worker safety rules made it onto many of the lists. Republican lawmakers quickly identified a tool to assist in those efforts \u2014 the rarely used Congressional Review Act (CRA), approved in 1996.\n\nThe CRA allows Congress to roll back recently enacted regulations by a simple majority vote. Once a rule is killed, it is killed forever. No future administration can pass a substantially similar measure unless Congress is persuaded to pass a law instead \u2014 a far more difficult task."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/poll-larry-hogans-deep-popularity-in-maryland-may-not-ensure-re-election/2017/03/21/3ee0fea0-0e4a-11e7-9b0d-d27c98455440_story.html", "text": "\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan enters the House chamber before delivering his third State of the State address in Annapolis on Feb. 1. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post)\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan\u2019s stratospheric approval rating has slipped in a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll for the first time since the Republican took office, while voter skepticism of President Trump and his party threatens to complicate the governor\u2019s bid for reelection next year.\n\nHogan holds a 65 percent job-approval rating, down from a high of 71 percent last September, but still above the highest mark in Post polls for each of the state\u2019s three previous governors.\n\nYet Hogan\u2019s support for reelection lags far behind his approval rating, with 41 percent of registered voters saying they would support him for a second term and 37 percent preferring a Democrat.\n\nThe margin has narrowed since September, when Hogan held a 46 to 30 percent edge over a generic Democrat. No Democratic candidate has entered the 2018 race so far, though several have said they are considering it.\n\n[Read full poll results | How it was conducted]\n\n\n\n\n\n[Md. legislature takes action on immigration, drug bills ahead of key deadline]\n\nThe survey underscores Hogan\u2019s challenge in satisfying a blue state electorate that vaulted him to an upset victory over then-Lt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown (D) in 2014 but that favored Hillary Clinton over Trump by 26 percentage points in November. Hogan\u2019s decision not to endorse Trump earned him widespread support, but he has faced continued pressure this year to buck the 45th president and bend to residents\u2019 liberal leanings on big issues in Washington and Annapolis.\n\n\u201cEven with such high approval ratings, he\u2019s at risk of suffering from . . . what\u2019s going on with the Republican Party,\u201d said Michael Hanmer, an associate professor at the University of Maryland and research director of its Center for American Politics and Citizenship.\n\nHanmer said Hogan\u2019s reelection is \u201cgoing to depend on who the Democrats put forward and how much they can attach [Hogan] to what\u2019s going on in national politics.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul Walczyk, a self-described liberal Democrat who voted for Brown, says Hogan has won him over by breaking with his party to distance himself from Trump and vowing to fight to protect the polluted Chesapeake Bay. But he plans to keep a close eye on how the governor responds to the White House in coming months.\n\n\u201cIf he continues to provide the kind of leadership he has and also comes out strongly against what the administration is doing on health care and immigration and other topics, I would obviously support him,\u201d said Walczyk, a 53-year-old Bel Air resident who works in advertising. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t, it could severely impact my impression of him.\u201d\n\nNearly 6 in 10 Democrats approve of Hogan, but much of that support is soft and can\u2019t guarantee protection from an anti-Republican backlash at the polls in 2018.\n\nRobert L. Ehrlich Jr., the state\u2019s last Republican governor, maintained a 55 percent job-approval rating just weeks before he lost to Democrat Martin O\u2019Malley in 2006, a year that showcased how Marylanders\u2019 frustrations with the national GOP can undermine a popular governor\u2019s standing.\n\nImmigration provides a window into how perceptions of state and national politics can become intertwined.\n\nBy a 65 to 33 percent margin, the poll finds more Marylanders oppose than support Trump\u2019s revised executive order to temporarily block travel from six Muslim-majority countries, exempting U.S. citizens and those who received visas before late January.\n\nHogan has resisted pressure to weigh in against the order, saying his focus is on Maryland issues. Nearly half of Maryland residents both oppose Trump\u2019s executive order and say it is \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d that Hogan speak out against it.\n\nOver 8 in 10 Republicans \u2014 83 percent \u2014 support Trump\u2019s order, although the number falls to 36 percent among independents and 13 percent among Democrats.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe poll finds that Marylanders are cool to local agencies cooperating with federal immigration authorities. A 56 percent majority doubts that increased local involvement in deportations would improve compliance with immigration laws, while three-quarters say it would make undocumented immigrants reluctant to inform police of crime.\n\nBut Hogan has vowed to veto what he called an \u201coutrageously irresponsible\u201d bill passed by the House of Delegates that would limit the ability of state and local officials to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. The bill is awaiting action in the Senate.\n\nBob Bajefsky, a 75-year-old retired attorney from Potomac, is among the Democrats who consider Hogan a reasonable and not overly partisan governor. But he said he has been horrified by Trump\u2019s behavior in office and would like to see Hogan stand up to the president and refuse to assist in rounding up immigrants.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s environment, with where the Republican Party is, I\u2019m probably more strongly inclined toward Democrats than I\u2019ve been in the past,\u201d said Bajefsky, noting that he last voted for a GOP governor in 1966, when Spiro Agnew ran against a segregationist Democrat. \u201cBut it would depend on who is running against him.\u201d\n\nDemocrats who are considering challenging the governor include Prince George\u2019s County Executive Rushern L. Baker III, Baltimore County Executive Kevin Kamenetz, U.S. Rep. John Delaney, former NAACP president Benjamin Jealous, Del. Maggie L. McIntosh (Baltimore) and state Sen. Richard S. Madaleno Jr. (Montgomery).\n\nHogan will probably have a formidable war chest. He had $5 million available for his reelection bid before the legislative session began in mid-January, about 18 months before the June 2018 gubernatorial primaries.\n\n[Maryland Democrats grumble Hogan\u2019s stealing their thunder]\n\nAs governor, Hogan has pursued a moderate agenda focused on growing the economy and reducing regulations and fees, while steering clear of social issues such as abortion and gun rights.\n\nLast week, he backed a ban on fracking, a position overwhelmingly favored by the state\u2019s heavily Democratic electorate.\n\nHe also has proposed his own version of paid-sick-leave legislation, which would require that employers with 50 or more employees provide at least five days off, while offering tax credits to smaller businesses as an incentive for them to provide leave. He has threatened to veto more generous legislation working its way through the General Assembly, including a bill that would require businesses with 15 or more employees to provide five days.\n\nIn the poll, 84 percent of respondents favor requiring paid sick leave for businesses with at least 15 workers. There is also strong support for requiring businesses with 50 or more employees to offer the benefit, and 78 percent of respondents said they would support tax benefits for businesses with fewer than 50 workers that provide paid sick leave.\n\nHogan\u2019s popularity outpaces that of the Maryland legislature and both major parties in the state. Residents give him the highest marks for his handling of the economy, with 6 in 10 approving. His approach to taxes and education had about half of residents in favor and a third disapproving, while approval for his response to the state\u2019s heroin and opioid crisis climbed 12 percentage points in the last year, to 47 percent.\n\nElizabeth Ryan, a conservative Democrat and stay-at-home mom of two school-age daughters, backed Hogan in 2014 because she preferred his stances on education and transportation. His order for Maryland schools to start the year after Labor Day cemented her support ahead of his reelection bid.\n\n\u201cEveryone was always afraid to do it, and I don\u2019t think they wanted to go up against the teachers or local school boards, but he just did it,\u201d said Ryan, 56, who lives in Frederick County.\n\nRyan said she voted for Clinton in the presidential race and is reeling from Trump\u2019s victory. But unlike other Democrats, she isn\u2019t itching for Hogan to denounce the president. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to change anything,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cHe\u2019s his own man, and he\u2019s going to do what\u2019s best for Maryland.\u201d\n\nAnother challenge for Hogan heading into 2018 is solidifying support in suburbs that tilted Democrat in the presidential election, including Anne Arundel, Howard and Baltimore counties.\n\nTogether, voters in those jurisdictions favored Hogan by 22 points in 2014 but supported Clinton by 16 points over Trump last year. And his support among them for a second term is eroding: Voters in Anne Arundel, Howard and Baltimore counties said they would back Hogan over a generic Democrat by a margin of 34 points \u2014 59 to 25 percent \u2014 last fall but by 14 points in the new survey.\n\nMichael Psenicska, a 73-year-old math teacher in Baltimore County, opposed Hogan in 2014 but says he\u2019s open to voting for him, because he doesn\u2019t see any strong Democratic challengers and he appreciated Hogan coming out in favor of the fracking ban.\n\n\u201cI do think he will win reelection, and I won\u2019t be totally upset with it. I don\u2019t agree with everything, but he\u2019s trying \u201d said Psenicska, who was raised in housing projects with government assistance. He said Hogan would more likely get his support if he \u201cshows me that he has a little more compassion for people who don\u2019t have money.\u201d\n\nThe poll, conducted Thursday through Sunday among a random sample of 914 Maryland residents reached on landline and mobile phones, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.\n\nEmily Guskin contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/03/22/only-3-in-10-americans-approve-of-how-trump-is-handling-health-care/", "text": "The pollsters at Quinnipiac University appear to have been scooped by their own social media team.\n\nScott Clement, The Washington Post\u2019s polling manager, noticed this tweet from the school\u2019s polling outfit.\n\nMost of those numbers were included in a national poll released Wednesday \u2014 except the figure on health care.

Two other recent polls, from CNN-ORC and Fox News, have asked the same question about Trump\u2019s work on health care. In the first, conducted at the beginning of the month, views were about split. In the second, conducted two weeks ago, opinions were more negative. In Quinnipiac\u2019s poll, views are more negative still.\n\nMind you, in the first two polls (though not Quinnipiac\u2019s), Trump\u2019s approval ratings were fairly steady. Meaning that while Americans viewed Trump about the same in both CNN\u2019s and Fox\u2019s polls, views of how he was handling health care sank in the latter.\n\nIn each case, though, Americans were more disapproving of Trump\u2019s handling of health care than they were of Trump.\n\nThere\u2019s only one way to read that: Trump\u2019s handling of health care is a negative for the president. While we can\u2019t do an apples-to-apples comparison of three polls from three different pollsters taken at different times, there is a correlation between how long the health-care fight has gone on and how poorly Americans think Trump is handling it.\n\nWe can\u2019t break down the numbers any further just yet, since Quinnipiac hasn\u2019t released cross-tabs (breakdowns by demographic). Like their social media team, we\u2019re a little ahead of things."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-weighs-police-liability-victims-rights-in-officer-involved-shooting-case/2017/03/22/fdf53a7a-0f05-11e7-9d5a-a83e627dc120_story.html", "text": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday debated whether law enforcement officers can be held liable for using excessive force when their actions provoke a violent confrontation.\n\nThe case comes at a time of heightened public concern about police-involved shootings and arose after sheriff\u2019s deputies barged into a shack and shot a homeless man the officers mistakenly thought was pointing a rifle at them.\n\nThere is broad legal agreement that police facing a threat can shoot to save their lives. In this case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit found that the shooting itself was constitutional. But that court held the Los Angeles County deputies liable for provoking the shooting because they did not have a search warrant, and upheld $4 million in damages.\n\nThrough their questions, the justices appeared to be trying to balance the need to compensate injured victims with legal protections for police, who often must make split-second decisions in dangerous situations.\n\n\u201cWhen does the police officer pay the victim who is suffering . . . if the victim had nothing to do with causing the loss?\u201d Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked the deputies\u2019 attorney, E. Joshua Rosenkranz.\n\nThe high court has suggested recently that an officer\u2019s actions before a shooting should not be considered in determining liability, but Leonard J. Feldman, the attorney for the homeless man and his then-girlfriend, urged the court to consider all of the circumstances that gave rise to the encounter.\n\nThe deputies \u2014 Christopher Conley and Jennifer Pederson \u2014 were dispatched to a home in a Los Angeles suburb in 2010 to help track down a fugitive and assigned to search the back yard where officers suspected the missing parolee might be hiding.\n\nWhen Conley pulled back a blue blanket shielding the doorway of a run-down plywood shack, the deputies saw the silhouette of a man who appeared to be pointing a rifle at them. \u201cGun!\u201d Conley shouted before the deputies fired into the windowless shack.\n\nThe man inside was not a fugitive, but Angel Mendez, who was living with his pregnant girlfriend, Jennifer Lynn Garcia. The firearm was a BB gun, and Mendez was not pointing it at the deputies, but shifting his position on the futon.\n\nThe bullets hit Mendez in several spots and required the amputation of a portion of his right leg. Garcia, now married to Mendez, was hit in the shoulder and left hand, but delivered a healthy baby.\n\nThe 9th Circuit ruled that the entry without a warrant violated the couple\u2019s Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches. Even a reasonable use of force by law enforcement becomes unreasonable, the court said, if an officer \u201cintentionally or recklessly provokes a violent confrontation by committing a separate Fourth Amendment violation.\u201d\n\nThe oral argument on Wednesday was dominated for a time by an extended exchange between Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Elena Kagan about whether there would have been a different outcome had the deputies obtained a warrant before entering the shack.\n\nKagan and Sotomayor seemed to agree with the Mendezes\u2019 view that the shooting was foreseeable because the deputies entered the shack without a warrant. Kagan suggested that violence was more likely to ensue when officers do not tell homeowners before entering that they have a warrant.\n\nKagan pressed Rosenkranz: \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it be that a death or injury that results when somebody barges into, goes into somebody\u2019s home without legal authorization, that one of the things that foreseeably can result from that is a shooting?\u201d\n\nRoberts repeatedly rejected the 9th Circuit\u2019s finding that the failure to obtain a warrant created the circumstances that led to the shooting because the deputies were not obligated to announce their entry in advance.\n\n\u201cWhy and in what way did the failure to get a warrant cause everything that followed?\u201d Roberts asked the Mendezes\u2019 attorney several times. \u201cThe failure to get a warrant did not cause the entry.\u201d\n\nFeldman responded: \u201cIf the officers don\u2019t have a warrant and they enter, they are trespassers.\u201d\n\nNicole A. Saharsky, an assistant to the solicitor general, joined the county\u2019s attorney in urging the justices to reject the 9th Circuit\u2019s ruling that she said requires officers to \u201csecond-guess\u201d their actions in the face of a threat.\n\nThe case is County of Los Angeles v.

(Katie Zezima/The Washington Post)\n\nThe eight years during which Barack Obama served as president were a boom time for the gun industry. Obama\u2019s consistent and futile efforts to introduce new regulations restricting gun sales were whipped into rhetoric about imminent crackdowns on gun ownership \u2014 rhetoric that predated Obama\u2019s election, much less his policy efforts.\n\nThere\u2019s been some indication that gun sales have receded in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s election. The go-to metric for gun sales \u2014 a figure that isn\u2019t directly compiled by the government \u2014 is the number of federal background checks completed during a month. The biggest month for such checks tends to be December, as people buy firearms as Christmas gifts. In December 2015, the FBI conducted 3.3 million background checks. In December 2016, after Trump\u2019s win? 2.8 million.\n\nOver the first two months of the year, the number of checks completed totaled 4.3 million. In January and February 2016, the total was 5.2 million. That\u2019s a 2017 decline of 17 percent \u2014 but it was also the third-highest January-February total on record. (The FBI started conducting background checks in 1998.)\n\n(The second-highest January-February period came in 2013, in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre and Obama\u2019s most robust push for new regulations.)\n\nPut another way, the total number of checks in the first two months of this year was larger than the total in 2014 and 2015 \u2014 and at least 50 percent greater than every year before 2012.\n\nBackground checks are an imprecise measure, though, including things such as background checks for those seeking a concealed-carry permit. In Kentucky, for example, those with such permits undergo monthly background checks, driving up the national number.\n\nA more precise estimate comes from excise tax data collected by the government and analyzed by the National Shooting Sports Foundation. Each time a gun or ammunition is sold, the Firearms and Ammunition Excise Tax (FAET) is applied, allowing the NSSF to then estimate sales figures for handguns, long guns and ammunition.\n\nEven before Obama took office, sales figures were increasing, as the background check data make clear. But the increase from 2012 on was sustained. In 2011, Americans spent about $4.3 billion on firearms and ammunition, according to FAET data. In 2012, when gun sales spiked after Sandy Hook, the total topped $6 billion. In 2013, the total was more than $8 billion.\n\nThe end result is that total sales of guns and ammunition during Obama\u2019s eight years in office were over $45.7 billion dollars \u2014 and that\u2019s without data for the fourth quarter of 2016. That\u2019s $29.1 billion on firearms \u2014 $14.7 billion of which was long guns \u2014 and $16.6 billion on ammunition. When fourth-quarter numbers come in, those figures will climb.\n\nConverted into 2016 dollars, it\u2019s clear how much more was spent on firearms and ammunition under Obama than his predecessors.\n\nDuring the administrations of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, Americans spent an estimated $21.1 billion and $22.9 billion in 2016 dollars on guns and ammunition, respectively. Under Obama, Americans spent more than that total combined.\n\nIt\u2019s too early for us to figure out the extent to which having Trump in office will affect that number. (The National Rifle Association\u2019s Wayne LaPierre hasn\u2019t exactly softened his tone, post-inauguration.) Trump would be hard-pressed to be the same boon to the gun industry that Obama was \u2014 no doubt to his chagrin."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/03/22/timeline-paul-manaforts-long-murky-history-of-political-interventions/", "text": "As a lobbyist and political consultant in the 1980s, Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort worked with international clients that included two dictators who were then allied with the United States. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the Associated Press reported that former Donald Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort had drafted a proposal to help advance the business interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2005. In light of that report, we\u2019ve compiled this history of Manafort\u2019s interactions with political campaigns and Russian interests.\n\n1976. Manafort helps guide Republican presidential nominee Gerald R. Ford\u2019s efforts at the Republican National Convention.\n\n1980. After helping shepherd Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidential campaign at the Republican convention, Manafort is a founder of the lobbying and strategy firm Black, Manafort, Stone & Kelly in Washington. The \u201cStone\u201d in that title was for Roger Stone, a longtime Trump confidante.\n\n1984. Manafort helps plan the convention for Reagan\u2019s reelection bid.\n\nNovember 1985. Manafort\u2019s firm is hired to represent Filipino dictator Ferdinand Marcos, apparently after being connected to Marcos via an emissary \u2014 Sen. Paul Laxalt of Nevada \u2014 sent by President Reagan. (This history comes from Ken Vogel\u2019s thorough look at the relationship.) Manafort\u2019s firm is tasked with advising Marcos on public relations and electoral strategy.\n\nFeb. 7, 1986. Marcos wins the country\u2019s presidential election thanks to obvious and rampant voter fraud. Manafort describes his efforts during the election to Time magazine as trying to \u201cmake it more of a Chicago-style election and not Mexico\u2019s.\u201d\n\nFeb. 25, 1986. Marcos flees the country.\n\n1988. Manafort manages the convention for Republican presidential nominee George H.W. Bush.\n\nJanuary 1991. Public relations firm Burson-Marsteller acquires Black, Manafort, Stone & Kelly.\n\n1995. Manafort and partner Rick Davis found a new lobbying firm, Davis Manafort.\n\n1996. Manafort manages Republican Robert J. Dole\u2019s unsuccessful presidential campaign.\n\nLate 2004. Ukraine holds a series of elections in which fraud is rampant. Viktor Yanukovych of the Party of Regions, who came in second in the first round, wins a runoff in November. Outcry at alleged fraud leads the European Union to reject the runoff results; Ukrainians take to the streets in protest in what comes to be known as the Orange Revolution. On a third ballot, Yanukovych again loses.\n\nJune 2005. According to the Associated Press, Manafort develops a strategic plan aimed at promoting the interests of the Russian government and President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cWe are now of the belief that this model can greatly benefit the Putin Government if employed at the correct levels with the appropriate commitment to success,\u201d Manafort wrote in the document.\n\n2006. Manafort signs a $10 million-a-year agreement with the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska apparently based on that plan. The work is not conducted through Davis Manafort but through a separate corporation called LOAV Ltd.\n\nThe relationship with Deripaska also connects Manafort to Yanukovych. At some point before parliamentary elections in March 2006, the Party of Regions officially hires Davis Manafort to help reshape the party\u2019s image. The party gains a number of seats in the election, and Yanukovych becomes prime minister in August after extensive political wrangling.\n\nJanuary 2006. Davis arranges a meeting between Deripaska and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). The two would meet again in August.\n\nJuly 2006. Deripaska\u2019s American visa is revoked.\n\n2007. A secret ledger kept by the Party of Regions indicates that Manafort began receiving under-the-table payments at this point \u2014 nearly two dozen of them totaling nearly $13 million. Manafort denies the allegation.\n\nDecember 2007. Yanukovych is ousted as prime minister after parliamentary elections. Yulia Tymoshenko takes the position, becoming the first woman to do so.\n\n2008. After the presidential election \u2014 Davis served as McCain\u2019s campaign manager, creating some bad press for the candidate because of his business relationships \u2014 Davis Manafort is disbanded.\n\n2009. Manafort\u2019s business relationship with Deripaska continued until at least this point. It\u2019s not clear when it ended again, according to the AP.\n\nFebruary 2010. Yanukovych wins the presidency with Manafort\u2019s help. Beforehand, Manafort warns that he\u2019s concerned about voter fraud working against his client, echoing concerns raised by his next prominent client.\n\n2012. The last secret payment to Manafort is listed in the ledger.\n\nFeb. 21, 2014. After prolonged protests beginning in November the year before, Yanukovych flees to Russia. The next day, he\u2019s officially removed from his post. This triggers Russia\u2019s incursion into Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea.\n\nSeptember 2014. Manafort flies to Ukraine to try to help Yanukovych\u2019s former party once again gain power. The party is rebranded as the Oppo Bloc, at Manafort\u2019s suggestion.\n\nMarch 28, 2016. Manafort is hired by Trump to guide the campaign\u2019s delegate-wrangling effort in the lead-up to the Republican convention. He\u2019s recommended for the position by Roger Stone.\n\nAt some point, intelligence agencies allegedly surveil a call or calls between Manafort and Russian government actors. Manafort later told the New York Times that he had \u201cnever knowingly spoken to Russian intelligence officers.\u201d\n\nSpring 2016. According to the Times, the FBI begins investigating Manafort\u2019s business relationships and ties to foreign powers, including Russia.\n\nIn this time period, the Democratic National Committee\u2019s email system is hacked by people who U.S. authorities believe are linked to the Russian government.\n\nJune 21. After months of tension between himself and campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, Lewandowski is fired. Manafort becomes campaign chairman.\n\nWeek of July 11. At the national security platform meeting establishing the Republican Party positions on the subject, representatives of the Trump campaign intervene to remove a call for arming the Ukrainian military to battle Russian and rebel fighters in the eastern part of the country.\n\nJuly 18. The convention begins. Trump is nominated.\n\nJuly 22. The emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee are released by WikiLeaks.\n\nAug. 14. The secret ledger comes to light.\n\nAug. 17. Reports emerge that Manafort also helped the Party of Regions secretly route $2.2 million in unreported lobbying spending to D.C. in 2012.\n\nAug. 19. Manafort quits the Trump campaign, at the request of the candidate. Among the reasons he was asked to resign were Trump\u2019s dissatisfaction with his tactical advice, and news articles raising questions about his ties to Russia and Ukraine.\n\nNov. 8.

But the CBO\u2019s report was neither the first nor the last analysis to offer more details on the likely effects of the American Health Care Act. Over the past three days, outside groups and the news media have offered up other numbers that seem equally unlikely to bolster the Republicans\u2019 case.\n\nMonday: Most of key tax benefits goes to millionaires\n\nThe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has looked repeatedly at the likely effects of the AHCA\u2019s passage, including an earlier determination that states most likely to have backed President Trump in last year\u2019s election would disproportionately see reduced benefit in the form of tax credits.\n\nOn Monday, the CBPP offered further analysis using data from the Tax Policy Center. As it turns out, repealing two taxes that are part of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) would offer no benefit at all to people making less than $200,000 a year \u2014 and would offer the bulk of its benefits, 79 percent of the total cut, to millionaires.\n\nOverall, millionaires would see tax cuts of $57,000 a year from the passage of the AHCA, $50,000 of which comes from the repeal of the two taxes included in the analysis above.\n\n[CBPP: House GOP Health Plan Eliminates Two Medicare Taxes, Giving Very Large Tax Cuts to the Wealthy]\n\nTuesday: Fewer people would have insurance under the AHCA than if Obamacare were simply repealed\n\nThe New York Times\u2019s Margot Sanger-Katz looked at the CBO\u2019s analysis and realized something surprising: The estimated 24 million fewer people who would have insurance under the AHCA by 2026 is actually one million people higher than if Obamacare were simply repealed.\n\n(New York Times)\n\n\u201cGetting rid of the major coverage provisions and regulations of Obamacare would cost 23 million Americans their health insurance, according to another recent CBO report,\u201d Sanger-Katz writes. \u201cIn other words, one million more Americans would have health insurance with a clean repeal than with the Republican replacement plan, according to CBO estimates.\u201d\n\n[Times: Fewer Americans Would Be Insured With G.O.P.

According to his organization\u2019s calculations, average deductibles from the AHCA would be $1,550 higher than under Obamacare, an increase of more than 60 percent.\n\nWhy? Because people will receive smaller subsidies and therefore increasingly choose lower-cost health-care plans that have higher deductible rates. While much of the debate has been over the extent to which insurance premium costs have increased recently \u2014 which affects 3 percent of the country \u2014 increased deductible costs come out of consumers\u2019 pockets.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly railed against Obamacare\u2019s high deductible costs.\n\n\u201cNobody can afford it, the deductibles are so high it doesn\u2019t work anyway,\u201d Trump said during a speech in Ohio in early September. \u201cYou have to be hit by a truck and die slowly, very, very slowly.

They flew on his jet to join him at his private estate on the Caribbean island of Little Saint James. They even joked about his taste in younger women.\n\nPresident Trump called Epstein a \u201cterrific guy\u201d back in 2002, saying that \u201che\u2019s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\u201d\n\nNow, Trump is on the witness list in a Florida court battle over how federal prosecutors handled allegations that Epstein, 64, sexually abused more than 40 minor girls, most of them between the ages of 13 and 17. The lawsuit questions why Trump\u2019s nominee for labor secretary, former Miami U.S. attorney Alexander Acosta, whose Senate confirmation hearing began Wednesday morning, cut a non-prosecution deal with Epstein a decade ago rather than pursuing a federal indictment that Acosta\u2019s staff had advocated.\n\n[Read the non-prosecution deal Acosta made with Epstein]\n\n(Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post)\n\nAlthough Epstein\u2019s friends and visitors once included past and future presidents, rock stars, and some of the country\u2019s richest men, he is no longer a social magnet. Epstein pleaded guilty to a Florida state charge of felony solicitation of underage girls in 2008 and served a 13-month jail sentence. Politicians who had accepted his donations, including former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson and former New York governor Eliot Spitzer, have scurried to give them back. (Harvard University kept a $6.5 million gift, saying it was \u201cfunding important research\u201d in mathematics.)\n\nBut Epstein\u2019s unusually light punishment \u2014 he was facing up to a life sentence had he been convicted on federal charges \u2014 has raised questions about how Acosta handled the case.\n\nFormer Palm Beach police chief Michael Reiter, whose department conducted the initial investigation into Epstein\u2019s behavior, said in a civil lawsuit deposition that Epstein got off easy.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t an appropriate resolution of this matter,\u201d Reiter said, arguing that the charges leveled against Epstein were \u201cvery minor,\u201d compared with what the facts called for. In a letter to parents of Epstein\u2019s victims, Reiter said justice had not been served.\n\nProsecutors in Acosta\u2019s Miami office who had joined the FBI in the investigation concluded, according to documents produced by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office, that Epstein, working through several female assistants, \u201cwould recruit underage females to travel to his home in Palm Beach to engage in lewd conduct in exchange for money \u2026 Some went there as much as 100 times or more. Some of the women\u2019s conduct was limited to performing a topless or nude massage while Mr. Epstein masturbated himself. For other women, the conduct escalated to full sexual intercourse.\u201d\n\nEpstein has a near-legendary reputation in New York financial circles as a money manager who made many millions for his clients. Although he never graduated from college, he taught advanced math at the Dalton School, one of the city\u2019s top private schools, and went on to be a successful trader at Bear Stearns before starting his own firm, J. Epstein& Co., which managed the finances of clients who had a minimum of $1 billion in assets.\n\nFederal prosecutors detailed their findings in an 82-page prosecution memo and a 53-page indictment, but Epstein was never indicted. In 2007, Acosta signed a non-prosecution deal in which he agreed not to pursue federal charges against Epstein or four women who the government said procured girls for him. In exchange, Epstein agreed to plead guilty to a solicitation charge in state court, accept a 13-month sentence, register as a sex offender and pay restitution to the victims identified in the federal investigation.\n\n\u201cThis agreement will not be made part of any public record,\u201d the deal between Epstein and Acosta says. The document was unsealed by a federal judge in a civil lawsuit in 2015.\n\nReiter said in the 2009 deposition that federal prosecutors in Miami told him \u201cthat typically these kinds of cases with one victim would end up in a ten-year sentence.\u201d Reiter said he was surprised not only by the decision to pull back from prosecuting the case, but also by the light sentence and liberal privileges granted to Epstein during his jail term.\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s confirmation hearing Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) pressed Acosta about the plea agreement reached with Epstein.\n\nAcosta told the committee that the case started at the state level before the Department of Justice decided to get involved. He said the original charge debated would not have led to any jail time and that \u201cbased on the evidence,\u201d prosecutors decided to go with a deal where Epstein would have to register as a sex offender and agree to a two-year prison sentence.\n\nHis testimony Wednesday reflected Acosta\u2019s explanation of his decision in a \u201cTo whom it may concern\u201d letter that he released to news organizations three years after the decision: \u201cThe bottom line is this: Mr. Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire, served time in jail and is now a registered sex offender. He has been required to pay his victims restitution, though restitution clearly cannot compensate for the crime.\u201d Acosta wrote that the case against Epstein grew stronger over the years because more victims spoke out after Epstein was convicted.\n\nAcosta is Trump\u2019s second nominee to be secretary of labor; the first, Andrew Puzder, withdrew last month after Senate Republicans questioned his past employment of an undocumented housekeeper. Support for Acosta seems strong, as some Democrats and union leaders have joined with Senate Republicans in praising the nominee, who has been confirmed for federal positions three times in the past.\n\nIn the 2011 letter explaining his decision in the Epstein case, Acosta said he backed off from pressing charges after \u201ca year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors\u201d by \u201can army of legal superstars\u201d who represented Epstein, including Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz; Kenneth Starr, who as independent counsel led the investigation that brought about President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment; and some of the nation\u2019s most prominent defense attorneys, such as Roy Black, Gerald Lefcourt and Jay Lefkowitz.\n\n\u201cThe defense strategy was not limited to legal issues,\u201d Acosta wrote. \u201cDefense counsel investigated individual prosecutors and their families, looking for personal peccadilloes that may provide a basis for disqualification.\u201d\n\nDershowitz said in an interview that no such effort to rattle the prosecutors ever took place. \u201cThat\u2019s just dead wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cI would never participate in anything of that kind. Of course we investigated the witnesses but not Acosta\u2019s deputies. That\u2019s absurd.\u201d\n\nAcosta\u2019s \u201cintention was to indict, and he fought hard and tried to get the best deal he could,\u201d Dershowitz said. \u201cWe outlawyered him.\u201d Epstein did not return a call seeking comment.\n\nConchita Sarnoff, the author of \u201cTrafficKing,\u201d a book on the Epstein case, said in an interview that Acosta told her a few years after his decision not to prosecute that \u201che felt incapable of going up against those eight powerful attorneys. He felt his career was at stake.\u201d\n\nIn his letter about the decision, Acosta, who has been dean of the law school at Florida International University since 2009, acknowledged that \u201csome prosecutors felt that we should just go to trial, and at times I felt that frustration myself.\u201d He also complained that Epstein \u201creceived highly unusual treatment while in jail,\u201d including being allowed to serve much of his sentence in the county jail rather than a state prison, and being permitted to leave the jail six days a week to work at home before returning to jail to sleep.\n\n\u201cThe treatment that he received while in state custody undermined the purpose of a jail sentence,\u201d Acosta said.\n\nDershowitz said Acosta \u201cwas very anxious to prosecute\u201d Epstein, but \u201cwe persuaded them that they didn\u2019t have enough evidence of interstate transportation\u201d of the underage girls to warrant federal charges.\n\nBut Reiter, the former police chief, said the FBI had evidence \u201cfrom flight logs or something\u201d that an underage victim \u201cwas transported on an aircraft of Mr. Epstein.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome may feel that the prosecution should have been tougher,\u201d Acosta wrote. \u201cEvidence that has come to light since 2007 may encourage that view.\u201d But the prosecutor argued that his office\u2019s investigation allowed state prosecutors to strengthen their charges against Epstein. And Acosta said that those who disagree with his decision \u201care not the ones who at the time reviewed the evidence available for trial and assessed the likelihood of success.\u201d\n\nThe deal Acosta made with Epstein precluded any new federal prosecution based on offenses he may have committed between 2001 and 2007, but in Florida, Trump is on the witness list in a civil case in which two attorneys accuse federal prosecutors of having deceived Epstein\u2019s victims by failing to inform them that they would not charge Epstein.\n\nLawyers for the women argue that they had a right under the federal Crime Victims\u2019 Rights Act to know about Acosta\u2019s deal with Epstein. They say Acosta sought to keep the deal under wraps to avoid \u201cthe intense public criticism that would have resulted from allowing a politically-connected billionaire\u201d to escape from federal prosecution.\n\nAlthough Trump and Bill Clinton flew on Epstein\u2019s plane and visited his homes, neither president has been accused of taking part in the sexual misdeeds. But lawyers for Epstein\u2019s victims say Trump nonetheless may have useful information. Trump banned Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach \u201cbecause Epstein sexually assaulted an underage girl at the club,\u201d Bradley Edwards, an attorney who represents three of the young women, said in court documents.\n\nLawyers involved with the various Epstein cases said there is virtually no chance that the president will be required to testify in a matter in which both sides agree his involvement was tangential.\n\nTrump and Clinton are both among the dozens of names that appeared in a \u201cblack book\u201d of Epstein\u2019s phone contacts that his houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez, obtained. Rodriguez, who died in 2015, was convicted of obstruction of justice in 2010 after he tried to sell the book for $50,000 to lawyers representing Epstein\u2019s victims. In the book, Rodriguez circled the names of contacts he said were involved in sexual misbehavior at Epstein\u2019s properties. There were no circles around the names of Trump, Clinton or other boldfaced names such as former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, former British prime minister Tony Blair, and celebrities Mick Jagger, Michael Jackson, David Frost and Jimmy Buffett.\n\nRodriguez spent 18 months in prison, five months longer than Epstein served in jail.\n\nEpstein has continued to move among his homes in New York City, where he owns one of the largest private residences in Manhattan, Palm Beach and the Caribbean."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/acosta-responds-to-washington-post-report-about-lawsuit-deal/2017/03/22/4279ef82-0f11-11e7-aa57-2ca1b05c41b8_video.html", "text": "- Alexander Acosta, President Trump's nominee for labor secretary, was asked by Sen.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nOf all of the places President Trump might ask his audience if \u201canyone\u201d knows that Abraham Lincoln was a Republican, a fundraising dinner for the National Republican Congressional Committee Dinner is one of the more unexpected. But, on Tuesday night, that was the question he posed.\n\nHere\u2019s that moment\u2014 Trump: \"Most people don\u2019t even know\" Lincoln was a Republican, says PACs should take out an ad to promote that. pic.twitter.com/Hw9LrWqUFB \u2014 Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) March 22, 2017\n\n\u201cGreat president. Most people don\u2019t even know he was a Republican, right? Does anyone know?\u201d he said during his remarks. \u201cLot of people don\u2019t know that. We have to build that up a little more. Let\u2019s take an ad.\u201d\n\n[Trump: Most people don\u2019t know President Lincoln was a Republican]\n\nElected officials from the Republican Party, often referred to as the \u201cParty of Lincoln,\u201d were presumably excused from Trump\u2019s analysis. But let\u2019s answer the president\u2019s question: Do people actually know that Lincoln was a Republican?\n\nMostly, yes.\n\nIn 2012, Pew Research surveyed Americans to gauge their knowledge of our political system and asked that precise question: To what party did Lincoln belong? More than half, 55 percent, said Republican. Only a bit over a quarter said Democratic.\n\nA survey conducted for Newsweek by Princeton Survey Research Associates International in 2007 broke out responses along demographic lines. The question was slightly different, asking people to identify the first Republican president from a list of four: Lincoln, Rutherford B. Hayes, Ulysses Grant or Teddy Roosevelt. Overall, a bit over a third of respondents correctly identified Lincoln \u2014 slightly more didn\u2019t answer or said they didn\u2019t know.\n\nThere was no real difference in response along party lines, suggesting that it isn\u2019t only Lincoln\u2019s party that can identify Lincoln\u2019s party.\n\nBut along other metrics, there was a wider gulf. Older Americans, for example, were much more likely to know that Lincoln was the first Republican president.\n\nAnd, perhaps unsurprisingly, better educated Americans were as well.\n\nMore than half of those with a college or graduate degree identified Lincoln as the first Republican president. Only about 3 in 10 Americans with a high school degree or less could do the same.\n\nIn Pew\u2019s polling, the same splits emerged: Those 65 and over were 21 points more likely to correctly identify Lincoln\u2019s party than those under 30 and people with college degrees were also 21 points more likely to get the question right than those with a high school degree. For both younger and less well-educated respondents to the poll, most, in fact, didn\u2019t know that Lincoln was a Republican.\n\nThese polls were conducted five and 10 years ago, so perhaps America\u2019s familiarity with the political affiliation of Abraham Lincoln has grown or waned to some extent. 2007, for example, was one year into the existence of Twitter, meaning that users of the social network had not yet been barraged by people with egg avatars who used Lincoln\u2019s party affiliation as a trump card in discussions about racial politics.\n\nIf Twitter outrage can move the needle, perhaps these numbers might have shifted. Of course, in that case, America has other problems."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/03/22/whos-going-to-fight-for-trumpcare/", "text": "\n\nPresident Trump speaks at a rally March 15 in Nashville. (Mark Humphrey/AP)\n\nShortly after Donald Trump\u2019s helicopter touched down in a parking lot near the Iowa State Fairgrounds in August 2015, he held a quick news conference. After a brief discussion about how the public doesn\u2019t care as much about detailed policy papers as the press, Trump was asked a question about the process of legislating.\n\n\u201cHow will you get Congress to pass your bills?\u201d he was asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get Congress. I\u2019ve been getting politicians to pass whatever I wanted for my whole life,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s sort of interesting, nobody has more experience dealing with politicians than I do. I\u2019ve been dealing with them all my life. Whether it\u2019s big New York City zoning deals \u2014 which, by the way, are probably tougher than most of the things I\u2019ll be dealing with with foreign countries.\u201d He expounded on some of his properties in the city.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you,\u201d he then continued, \u201cI\u2019ve been dealing with politicians all my life. They\u2019re fine. They\u2019re wonderful. They\u2019re all talk, they\u2019re no action. They\u2019re selling this country down the tubes and they\u2019re easy to deal with. Believe me.\u201d\n\nHis attitude on that may have changed.\n\nFrom the get-go, the American Health Care Act \u2014 the Obamacare replacement legislation that Trump has adopted as his own \u2014 has faced strong opposition on and off of Capitol Hill. Opposition from Democrats has been unyielding. Opposition from Republicans has trickled down through various cracks: the far-right, the moderate middle. The Post\u2019s rough whip count suggests that the bill likely wouldn\u2019t pass if the vote were held today. Republican members of Congress have been pressured by Trump and the party\u2019s leadership, but they\u2019ve been pressured in the other direction by advocacy groups, conservative vote-grading systems and some of the more vocal far-right media outlets. This isn\u2019t Trump trying to finagle some reluctant zoning board officials. It\u2019s 535 people with constituencies that aren\u2019t on board.\n\nTwo weeks after introducing their bill to overhaul the Affordable Care Act to heated criticism, House Republicans unveiled amendments to the plan. Here's what you need to know about the legislation and its changes. (Bastien Inzaurralde,Sarah Parnass,Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nAt FiveThirtyEight, Nate Silver pointed out a reason that Trump\u2019s task in corralling votes is even harder than it might usually be.\n\nConsider the Fox News poll released last week. It asked respondents their views on both of the health-care proposals: Obamacare and Trump\u2019s possible replacement.\n\nOverall, Obamacare is supported by about half the country and opposed by a sizable minority. Unsurprisingly, there\u2019s a partisan split: Republicans \u2014 and, in particular, Trump voters\u2014 are much more likely to oppose it.\n\nThe American Health Care Act gets lower marks. It\u2019s underwater, meaning that more people oppose it than support it.\n\nThis is a disadvantageous position to be in, but, hey, Trump is president thanks to a healthy minority, right? Miracles can happen.\n\nWhat Silver pointed out, though, is that there\u2019s an imbalance in terms of how many people really care about the legislation.\n\nOn Obamacare, about 7-in-10 Republicans strongly dislike the bill. But more than half of Democrats feel strongly the other way. Overall, a quarter of Americans strongly support it.\n\nThat level of fervent support is much lower for the AHCA. It\u2019s still the case that 7-in-10 of the opposition party dislike the bill, but only about 4 in 10 Republicans \u2014and, crucially, 4 in 10 Trump voters \u2014 support it strongly. Overall, only 17 percent of the country strongly supports the AHCA. By contrast, 30 percent of the population views Trump strongly favorably, including three-quarters of his voters.\n\nOne reason the health-care fight has become so complicated is that fear of an Obamacare repeal has activated Americans (mostly Democrats) who rely on the provisions of the legislation. Democratic organizing groups, recognizing that energy, seized on the moment and helped coordinate actions at members of Congress\u2019 town halls.\n\nOn the other side, there\u2019s simply less energy behind the AHCA \u2014 and, what\u2019s more, some conservative organizations that might help whip up positive support actually oppose the bill. The resulting imbalance is obvious to legislators.\n\nPhone calls matter. GOP Rep. Thomas Massie had 275 constituent calls against the health bill. Just 4 calls for it. https://t.co/DHE13qlW6n pic.twitter.com/g7bcduQtoX \u2014 Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) March 22, 2017\n\nRepublican members of Congress may be convinced that this is their only shot to change Obamacare, as Speaker Paul Ryan has argued, but to an outside observer, that\u2019s hard to understand. You control the House, Senate and the White House and you can only pass this one, flawed bill?\n\nSo much for legislators being \u201ceasy to deal with.\u201d To push the bill through Congress, Trump needs to be able to compel legislators to support the measure. But Trump\u2019s arsenal is empty. He threatened balky legislators on Tuesday by saying he\u2019d exact revenge on Rep. Mark Meadows for opposing the bill, but there\u2019s little reason to think that Trump has the capacity to unseat members of Congress from his own party. He can\u2019t even rouse support for the bill! A rally in some other legislator\u2019s district where thousands of people come out to cheer doesn\u2019t mean a whole lot to a popular senator from across the country.\n\nPresident Trump on March 21 said the upcoming vote in the House of Representatives on the Republican health-care bill will be \"crucial.\" (The Washington Post)\n\nEspecially when Trump\u2019s attitude at the rally is that passing the health-care bill is the broccoli the party needs to choke down before they can pig out on dessert (tax cuts). Politico\u2019s Shane Goldmacher noted Trump\u2019s obvious apathy about the bill during the rally he held this week in Kentucky. Which isn\u2019t really a surprise; the bill as formulated is distant from what Trump promised on the campaign trail and is complicated in its attempts to balance competing interests. (\u201cNobody knew health care could be so complicated!\u201d Trump said in February, expressing a sentiment that nobody knew someone could hold.) Trump didn\u2019t write it, and it\u2019s not what he promised, and it seems like he\u2019s tired of the whole thing.\n\nAfter all, at the end of this, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s going to be a big new building in Manhattan with his name on it. If our vote count ends up being accurate, there won\u2019t even be a healthcare bill that bears his name."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/the-donald-vs-the-terminator-a-timeline/2017/03/22/83e8fd24-0ef2-11e7-aa57-2ca1b05c41b8_video.html", "text": "- It's hard to remember that things used to be great between President Trump and former Calif. governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.

But they came from Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), then the leader of a 40-seat Senate Republican minority, attacking the Affordable Care Act on Christmas Eve of 2009.\n\nFour elections and more than seven years later, the GOP\u2019s push to repeal the ACA has repeated many of the sticky process battles that the party campaigned against. Plans to pass the AHCA in the House on March 23, the anniversary of the ACA\u2019s final passage, emphasize that the GOP is trying to undo in a matter of weeks what Democrats did over a grueling and politically damaging year.\n\n\u201cThe ACA took months of deliberations and debate before passage,\u201d said Jim Messina, who was deputy White House chief of staff during the ACA debate. \u201cSo the speed and secrecy around the Republican health-care process is pretty shocking, even by Washington standards.\u201d\n\n(Alice Li,Jayne Orenstein/The Washington Post)\n\n[Trump to GOP critics of health-care bill: \u2018I\u2019m gonna come after you.\u2019]\n\nIt\u2019s an especially sore point for Democrats, who spent years defending the ACA from accusations that it had been rammed through. They aimed, early in 2009, to pass a reform bill with bipartisan support. The process dragged through most of the year as Senate Democrats worked to win over Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), both of whom would vote against final passage.\n\n\u201cWhat we did, in spite of what they said to the contrary, was hold 26 hearings,\u201d said Rep. James E. Clyburn (S.C.), the House Democratic whip during the 2009-2010 process. \u201cWe did that for a year. We accepted over 100 Republican amendments. Now here they are, and they won\u2019t accept a single Democratic amendment.\u201d\n\nFor years, Republicans not only campaigned against the implementation of the ACA, but explained that Democrats weakened themselves politically by pushing it through. In 2010 and every subsequent election, they decried how Democrats reformed health care with no support from the minority, an original sin that voters could understand.\n\n\u201cWe thought \u2014 correctly, I think \u2014 that the only way the American people would know that a great debate was going on was if the measures were not bipartisan,\u201d McConnell told the Atlantic in 2009. \u201cWhen you hang the \u2018bipartisan\u2019 tag on something, the perception is that differences have been worked out, and there\u2019s a broad agreement that that\u2019s the way forward.\u201d\n\n[What\u2019s at stake in the health-care debate? These Americans share their stories.]\n\nBut the push to pass the AHCA in the budget reconciliation process has left Republicans arguing among themselves, explaining why conservatives should back the bill \u2014 not why it would be more broadly popular. Most of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s interviews about the bill have been conducted by conservative media outlets, where he\u2019s emphasized its tax cuts and Medicaid caps.\n\n(Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been dreaming of this since I\u2019ve been around \u2014 since you and I were drinking at a keg,\u201d Ryan told National Review editor in chief Rich Lowry at a forum Friday.\n\nWhen pressed about the speed of the repeal push, Republicans often insist that Democrats cut more corners.\n\n\u201cNone of us are saying what Nancy Pelosi said, her comments about how you had to pass it first,\u201d Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), one of the Senate\u2019s few doctors, said about the Democrat, then the House speaker.\n\n\u201cFolks watching on television now can go online and read what the bill is,\u201d said Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney last week. \u201cThey can watch the committee hearings. Those are things that were dramatically missing in Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve allowed the committees to work their will,\u201d White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday. \u201cThe House has taken up the amendment. It\u2019s been online. I mean, there\u2019s always a balance between jamming it down and getting it done and over it, which is how the Democrats operated at one point when they finally moved on their bill, versus how this is done.\u201d\n\nIn fact, there were more public debates and committee meetings about the ACA than about the AHCA. In 2009, the House Energy and Commerce Committee held three days of hearings; this year, the committee held one marathon \u201cmarkup\u201d that went overnight. The text of the earlier bill\u2019s various versions was online for days before each vote. As the Senate closed in on a vote, then-Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma moved, successfully, for the bill to be read in its entirety on the floor. And Pelosi\u2019s accidentally immortal pledge that voters would \u201cfind out what\u2019s in\u201d the ACA only after it passed was actually made in March 2010, weeks after the final version of the bill was made public.\n\nRepublicans \u201caccuse Dems of ramming through Obamacare,\u201d wrote Philip Klein, a Washington Examiner editor who covered the ACA fight and wrote a book about the law, in a Tuesday tweet. \u201cBut Obamacare was passed at the pace of Zootopia DMV sloths compared to this AHCA attempt.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, some of the ACA features that the party once railed against also survived in the AHCA. While Republicans have proposed eliminating subsidies, they replaced them with tax credits that some hard-line conservatives view as the same sin. They have adopted a proposal by mainstream New York Republicans to change how the state pays out Medicaid, evoking memories of similar carve-outs that won moderate Democratic support for the ACA.\n\nAnd the bill keeps cuts to Medicare spending \u2014 featured in countless campaign ads \u2014 while delaying the \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on some employer plans until 2025, echoing the \u201cgimmicks\u201d that Ryan once railed against.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t that many options,\u201d said Andy Slavitt, acting director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Barack Obama. \u201cA lot of these are in fact cheap imitations of the ACA that don\u2019t do the job as well.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s speed also risks unintended consequences, similar to the ones that spawned lawsuits and legislative fixes after the passage of the ACA. Using the budget reconciliation process for what Republicans call the first of three phases to repeal and replace Obamacare allows them to pass their first bill with just 51 votes, but it leaves it open to challenges that it does not meet the \u201cByrd rule,\u201d which requires such bills to pertain only to budget matters. An amendment, expected to be added on the House floor Thursday to mollify conservatives, changed the language about group plans in a narrow way that might make many veterans ineligible for a tax credit.\n\n\u201cThe risk for Republicans in running a much more fast-paced and secretive process is that Republican members will be held accountable for every provision in this legislation \u2014 including those added at the last minute that will not fare well with sunlight,\u201d said Messina. \u201cFor those voting yes this week, they will face the impossible task of either defending the details that come out or admitting they didn\u2019t take the time to scrutinize such important legislation before it passed. That type of impossible question is one Republican members will face in town halls, editorial boards and interviews for the next 19 months.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, they have gotten stuck in a familiar series of process fights. In January, when Republicans developed the repeal strategy, the message guru Frank Luntz suggested that they frame it as a \u201crescue\u201d mission for a health-care system that was breaking. Democrats used similar messaging to defend the ACA when it was leaking support. Now, said Luntz, Republicans are experiencing their own drift away from a strategy that worked.\n\n\u201cObamacare promised to lower health-care costs. It didn\u2019t,\u201d said Luntz. \u201cIt promised to make health care easier and simpler to access. It didn\u2019t. They promised you could keep your doctor, your hospital, and your health-care plan. It didn\u2019t. This is a simple case to make, yet they aren\u2019t making it. From a communication standpoint, they should be focused on the problem instead of fighting over the solution.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, feeling no pressure to bail out the majority party, argue that the backlash is clarifying what they always wanted voters to see in the ACA.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re finding out what\u2019s in it,\u201d said Clyburn. \u201cThey love it.

Larry Hogan (R), answering questions from a television reporter after touring a police station in Annapolis, made a series of questionable comments about the case, which involved a 14-year-old victim.\n\nAccording to an audiotape provided by the governor\u2019s spokeswoman, Hogan blamed the Obama administration for the presence of the two suspects in the United States.\n\n\u201cIt appears as if this was part of the Obama unaccompanied minor kind of amnesty program where they allowed these kids to come in,\u201d he said. \u201cThey sent them to Montgomery County with no one being provided information.\u201d\n\nMore than 150,000 unaccompanied minors from Mexico and Central America have crossed the border illegally over the past three years. But those who arrived during that period do not qualify for the deferred-deportation relief that President Barack Obama provided to minors who arrived in the country by 2007, or tried unsuccessfully to provide to those who arrived by 2010.\n\nOne of the two rape suspects, Henry Sanchez-Milian, 18, was caught by a Border Patrol agent in Texas seven months ago and was issued a notice to appear before a federal judge. Federal officials have declined to comment on whether they have requested a detainer for the other suspect, Jose O. Montano, saying they could not discuss his case because he is a juvenile, even though he is charged as an adult. According to court records, Montano was born in El Salvador, lived there for 16 years and also arrived in Montgomery County last year.\n\nHogan also lashed out at the school system for educating the two suspects, apparently unaware that federal law requires it.\n\n\u201cWe have questions about what the individuals were doing in the school, what their status was,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to know when the Montgomery County School System knew \u2014 what they knew and when they knew it.\u201d\n\nA landmark 1982 Supreme Court decision, Plyler v. Doe, held that states must offer a free public education to all students regardless of immigration status. \u201cWe serve every student that walks in our door,\u201d Montgomery Schools Superintendent Jack Smith said at a news conference later Tuesday afternoon.\n\nPolice noted that neither suspect had any criminal charges or contact with law enforcement in the county prior to the rape.\n\nHogan also asked: \u201cWe want to know exactly how this was allowed to happen. Why is an 18-year-old man in a ninth grade class with 13- and 14-year-old girls?\u201d\n\nAs Smith told reporters at the news conference, 18-year-olds, 14-year-olds and 13-year-olds are quite often under the same roof in high schools that go from ninth through 12th grade. Smith said both suspects had been in a special program for non-English speakers at the high school and had not been in classes with the victim."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/2017/03/21/018ef7a6-0e49-11e7-9b0d-d27c98455440_story.html", "text": "White House press secretary Sean Spicer landed Maryland in the middle of the nation\u2019s emotionally charged debate over immigration policy Tuesday, decrying the rape of a Rockville High School student, allegedly by two undocumented immigrants, and urging state and local officials to reexamine laws and procedures to reduce the likelihood of such an incident happening again.\n\n\u201cThe president recognizes that education is a state-run and a \u00adlocal-run issue, but I think it is cause for concern what happened there,\u201d Spicer said in response to a reporter\u2019s question about the case. \u201cAnd I think the city should look at its policies, and I think that this is something authorities are going to have to look at.\u201d\n\nSpicer called the rape of the 14-year-old girl in a boys bathroom on Thursday \u201cshocking, disturbing, horrific and whatever other words that someone can think of.\u201d He also characterized the victim as an immigrant who had come to this country legally. But Montgomery County officials said she had no immigrant status of any kind.\n\nThe two suspects, Henry Sanchez-Milian, 18, and Jose O. Montano, 17, who was charged as an adult, are being held without bail. Montgomery Schools Superintendent Jack Smith told reporters that both suspects had been in a special program for non-English speakers at the high school and not in classes with the victim.\n\nSmith pushed back hard against questions about whether the rape case should affect local efforts to comply with federal law, which guarantees a free public education to any child living in the United States, regardless of citizenship status.\n\nHenry Sanchez-Milian, 18, is charged with the rape of a 14-year-old Rockville High School student. (Montgomery County Police)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally inappropriate to suggest that we\u2019re going to deny a 14-year-old, a 16-year-old, an \u00ad18-year-old an education because of a horrible thing that happened in our schools last Thursday,\u201d Smith said. \u201cSome have tried to make this into a question and issue of immigration . . . but we serve every student who walks through our doors.\u201d\n\nThe incident is also affecting the political debate in Annapolis, where Gov. Larry Hogan (R) has vowed to veto legislation that would limit the ability of state and local officials to cooperate with federal immigration agents in enforcing the nation\u2019s immigration laws. The Trust Act passed the House on Monday and is awaiting action in the Senate.\n\nIn a Facebook post Tuesday, \u00adHogan called on Montgomery to \u201cfully cooperate with all federal authorities during the investigation of this heinous crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe public has a right to know how something this tragic and unacceptable was allowed to transpire in a public school,\u201d Hogan wrote.\n\nThe comments incensed Montgomery officials, who said they already have a policy of cooperating with federal authorities in any serious criminal case. They accused Hogan of stoking public fears of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants.\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s feeding into is this Trump energy against immigrants in a manner that I think is totally irresponsible,\u201d said Montgomery County Council President Roger Berliner (D-Potomac-Bethesda). \u201cIt has inflamed what was already a tinderbox.\u201d\n\nThe suspects were unknown to county law enforcement before the rape and have no known gang connections, officials said, adding that the assault occurred in a remote area of the school.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing that could have come to the attention of our local authorities where they could have acted,\u201d said County Executive Isiah Leggett (D).\n\nMontgomery police are barred from asking about national origin during traffic stops or other activity. Immigration status comes into play only if a person enters the county correctional system. All prisoners\u2019 fingerprints are placed in a database that federal authorities can use. If they identify someone who is in the country illegally, they can issue a detainer \u2014 a request that the county hold the prisoner until he or she can be placed in federal custody.\n\nSince 2014, Montgomery has honored detainers when they involve those who have committed serious crimes or if they come with a federal court order or a warrant containing probable cause. The Trust Act bill being debated in Annapolis would codify those procedures into state law.\n\nState Sen. Victor R. Ramirez (D-Prince George\u2019s), the lead Senate sponsor, said the legislation is intended to protect the vast majority of undocumented immigrants, who are law-abiding after arriving in this country, not those who commit heinous crimes. \u201cWe all should take in consideration the hard-working Maryland residents who . . . have children, have ties to the community and don\u2019t have a criminal record,\u201d he said.\n\nThe bill passed the House 83 to 55, two votes short of the minimum needed to override a gubernatorial veto. The Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee is expected to vote on both the House and Senate versions this week.\n\nSenate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. (D-Calvert) said the bill is \u201creasonable,\u201d and he accused Hogan of misinterpreting what the statute would do.\n\n\u201cThe state of Maryland is not going to become a sanctuary state,\u201d Miller said. \u201cBut what it does say is that if you are on your way to church, on your way to court, if you are walking down the street, people shouldn\u2019t come up to you randomly and ask you what your name is or where you live solely for the purposes of seeking to deport you.\u201d\n\nParents in Montgomery have reacted to the rape with alarm. Many came to Rockville High on Tuesday night for a meeting with local officials. The session was closed to reporters. Patricia \u00adSpigner, who lives in Gaithersburg and has three grown children, came to the school to protest what had happened.She held a poster that said \u201cSafety not sanctuary!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just gotten to the point where illegals are more protected than our own children,\u201d she said.\n\nAt the news conference earlier in the day, Smith noted that there are nearly 160,000 students in the school system and said that \u201cthis horrible incident shouldn\u2019t change anyone\u2019s mind that schools are safe for our students.\u201d He said the district was reviewing \u201cevery single aspect\u201d of its safety plans and will make sure any gaps are closed.\n\nJosh Hicks contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/donald-trump-addresses-nrcc-fundraiser/2017/03/21/03faf2ae-0e9b-11e7-aa57-2ca1b05c41b8_video.html", "text": "- In a speech to the National Republican Congressional Committee\u2019s March fundraiser, March 21, President Trump pledged to cut taxes once the House GOP\u2019s health-care bill is adopted.

Manafort, who joined the Trump campaign in March, served as campaign chairman from May until his resignation in August. (Matt Rourke/AP)\n\nNew corruption allegations lodged in Ukraine against President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, have thrust Manafort back into the forefront of ongoing scrutiny over whether the Trump team coordinated with the Russian government to influence the U.S. election.\n\nThe allegations were disclosed Tuesday at a news conference by a Ukrainian lawmaker who said he had obtained documents showing that Manafort had attempted to hide payments he had received from the party of Ukraine\u2019s former president, who is living in Russia and wanted on corruption charges\u00ad in his home country.\n\nA spokesman for Manafort called the claims \u201cbaseless\u201d and said some of the documents released Tuesday appeared to be fabricated because the letterhead and signatures did not match those belonging to Manafort.\n\nThe spectacle in Kiev came just hours after FBI Director James B. Comey confirmed the existence of a federal probe into possible connections between Trump\u2019s campaign and the Kremlin.\n\nIt also followed an apparent effort by the White House to distance Trump from the man who helped lead his campaign during five critical months into last summer, with White House press secretary Sean Spicer declaring Monday that Manafort had played a \u201climited role for a very limited amount of time\u201d in the campaign.\n\n(Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\nManafort, 67, a longtime lobbyist and Republican strategist, was hired by the Trump campaign in March 2016, a time when Trump was winning primaries but feared he could still lose the nomination if his team failed to properly master arcane convention rules and wrangle votes from Republican delegates. In May, he was named the campaign\u2019s chairman.\n\nFrom the start, there was focus on Manafort\u2019s ties to pro-Russian figures, given Trump\u2019s repeated calls to forge closer relations to Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin and Russia\u2019s emerging role over the summer in seeking to meddle in the U.S. election.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials have said that the Kremlin orchestrated the politically damaging hacks of emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta.\n\nManafort had done business with Putin-aligned business titans and worked in Ukraine for former president Viktor Yanukovych\u2019s political party starting in 2004. Yanukovych fled the country in 2014 amid violent street protests.\n\nThe issue of Ukraine\u2019s relationship with Russia was a point of contention during the campaign, with Trump expressing openness to consider easing U.S. sanctions on Moscow that had been imposed after Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.\n\nManafort resigned as Trump\u2019s campaign chairman in August, after the New York Times reported that his name appeared in a \u201cblack ledger\u201d that showed he was paid $12.7 million in secret cash payments from Yanukovych\u2019s party. Manafort has denied receiving the payments and said he is the victim of political infighting in Ukraine.\n\nNow, Manafort has come under scrutiny in an FBI investigation into possible foreign corruption involving Ukrainian politics, according to people familiar with the matter. The Ukraine corruption investigation is related to the broader counter\u00adintelligence investigation into alleged contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russian officials, these people said.\n\nBut Manafort vehemently denies any involvement in the Russian efforts and has told people close to him that he is eager to testify before congressional committees investigating Moscow\u2019s intervention in the election.\n\nIn a statement, Manafort said he was the victim of a \u201cblatant attempt to discredit me and the legitimacy of the election of President Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had no role or involvement in the cyber\u00adattack on the DNC or the subsequent release of information gained from the attack, and I have never spoken with any Russian Government officials or anyone who claimed to have been involved in the attack,\u201d he said. \u201cThe suggestion that I ever worked in concert with anyone to release hacked emails or sought to undermine the interests of the United States is false. Despite the constant scrutiny and innuendo, there are no facts or evidence supporting these allegations, nor will there be.\u201d\n\n[Inside Trump adviser Manafort\u2019s world of politics and global financial dealmaking]\n\nThe new allegations against Manafort were leveled by Serhiy Leshchenko, a lawmaker and journalist, who on Tuesday released a copy of what he said was an invoice on letterhead from Manafort\u2019s consulting company, based in Alexandria, Va., dated Oct. 14, 2009, to a Belize-based company for $750,000 for the sale of 501 computers.\n\nOn the same day, Manafort\u2019s name is listed next to a $750,000 entry in the \u201cblack ledger\u201d released by anti-corruption investigators in August. The list was found at the party headquarters in the turmoil after Ukraine\u2019s 2014 revolution.\n\nLeshchenko alleged that Manafort falsified an invoice to the Belize company to legitimize the $750,000 payment to himself.\n\nNazar Kholodnytskyi, a deputy prosecutor general of Ukraine whose department specializes in corruption cases, said in an interview Tuesday that the documents hadn\u2019t been confirmed by law enforcement or, to his knowledge, submitted for examination. There is an ongoing investigation into the black ledgers, he said, but Manafort was not a target of that investigation.\n\nManafort\u2019s spokesman, Jason Maloni, said the new documents released Tuesday appear to be fabricated. \u201cWe have seen some of the new documents and they are not Paul\u2019s letterhead or Paul\u2019s signature,\u201d he said.\n\nMaloni added that Leshchenko\u2019s claims should be \u201csummarily dismissed.\u201d\n\nLeshchenko\u2019s name has emerged separately in a cache of more than 285,000 personal messages apparently stolen from the iPhone of Manafort\u2019s daughter, Andrea Manafort, 31, and dumped in February on a website used by cyberhackers.\n\nMaloni said Manafort has confirmed that his daughter\u2019s phone was hacked and that some of the texts are authentic, but he has declined to authenticate the entire cache. Maloni said Andrea Manafort declined to comment.\n\nThe posted texts show Manafort had received a blackmail email purportedly from Leshchenko in August, threatening to release information about Manafort\u2019s work in Ukraine. Leshchenko has said he did not send the email. Maloni said Manafort did not know who was behind the threat but had turned the matter over to his lawyer.\n\nIn her texts, Andrea Manafort dismissed the idea that her father would have taken cash as described in the Ukrainian ledger. \u201cIt\u2019s just a bunch of hogwash,\u201d she wrote a few days after he resigned. \u201cMy dad is a lot of things but he isn\u2019t stupid.\u201d\n\nBut she also apparently expressed deep reservations about his work overseas.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t fool yourself,\u201d she wrote to her sister in 2015, according to the posted texts. \u201cThe money we have is blood money.\u201d\n\nAndrea Manafort also portrayed her father as being at the center of Trump\u2019s campaign, texting a friend in April that he was Trump\u2019s \u201cright hand man,\u201d one posted message said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s super tight w the trumps.
