[{"text": "The House and Senate intelligence committees are expanding their investigation into the so-called \u201cunmasking\u201d controversy, Fox News has learned, to examine whether other candidates or lawmakers beyond President Trump\u2019s associates were affected.\n\nUntil now, the investigation focused on how the identities and communications of Trump transition members were collected by U.S. intelligence agencies and then revealed to, and disseminated among, high-ranking members of the Obama administration.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., now plans to audit files from the National Security Agency and White House to determine whether identities and conversations of presidential candidates -- or members of Congress -- also were swept up during NSA surveillance of foreign leaders. He also plans to review whether Obama\u2019s National Security Council and White House counsel collected and distributed the intelligence for reasons unrelated to foreign intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe will be performing an accounting of all unmasking for political purposes focused on the previous White House administration,\u201d a member of the committee told Fox News. \u201cThis is now a full-blown investigation.\u201d\n\nStaffers on the Senate committee told Fox News they also have expanded their investigation into whether presidential candidates were unmasked and information was misused -- and what role former National Security Adviser Susan Rice, among others, played following reports that she requested Trump-affiliated names be unmasked.\n\nFor a private U.S. citizen to be \u201cunmasked,\u201d or named, in an intelligence report is extremely rare and typically only done if it has some foreign intelligence value. Typically, the American is a suspect in a crime, is in danger or has to be named to explain the context of the report.\n\nThe intelligence reports that Rice and others in the administration reportedly assembled are similar to what a private investigator might piece together, congressional and U.S. intelligence sources said. In some cases, rather than documenting foreign intelligence, the files included salacious personal information that, if released, could be embarrassing or harmful to the person\u2019s reputation, U.S. intelligence and House Intelligence Committee sources said.\n\nThese reports were then disseminated to about 20 to 30 people who had classified clearance in the Obama administration hierarchy, these sources said.\n\nTrump, members of his family, and members of his campaign and transition teams, were likely subjects of \u201cincidental electronic surveillance\u201d by U.S. intelligence agencies, Fox News reported.\n\nSources told Fox News that names were then sent to all those at the National Security Council, some at the Defense Department, then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and then-CIA Director John Brennan -- as well as Rice and her former deputy Ben Rhodes, even though the names were supposed to be reported only to the initial requester.\n\nIf the names were unmasked in intelligence reports and then leaked to the media for political reasons, it could constitute criminal behavior.\n\nRetired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s initial national security adviser, is one known example of a Trump campaign official whose name was unmasked from an intelligence report and leaked to the press. While Rice hasn\u2019t said whether she unmasked Flynn, the leak of his conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak where he discussed U.S. sanctions led Flynn to resign three weeks into his term.\n\nNunes first announced on March 22 that he\u2019d viewed intelligence reports that contained incidental surveillance on members of the Trump team.\n\nOn Tuesday, The Washington Post reported former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page also was monitored by the FBI after the agency obtained a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant as part of an ongoing investigation into possible links between Russian officials and members of the Trump campaign.\n\nIn a statement to Fox News, Page said he has done nothing wrong and was a political target.\n\nMalia Zimmerman is an award-winning investigative reporter focusing on crime, homeland security, illegal immigration crime, terrorism and political corruption.

Chris Christie unloaded on United Airlines Wednesday in the wake of the forced removal of a passenger from a Chicago flight earlier this week, slamming the airline\u2019s attitude as \u201cawful\u201d and calling on the Trump administration to act.\n\nUnited Airlines has apologized after David Dao was dragged off the flight by airport security Sunday when he refused to leave after being asked to make way for United employees on the full flight. Video of the incident sparked outrage, and forced United CEO Oscar Munoz to apologize and conduct a review.\n\nBut Christie told \"Fox & Friends\" the incident is representative of a broader culture at the airline.\n\n\u201cEverybody who flies commercial knows United is awful,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know it\u2019s awful.\u201d\n\nUNITED CEO: 'I DEEPLY APOLOGIZE' TO CUSTOMER DRAGGED OFF FLIGHT\n\nChristie said it is a particular problem in his state, where 70 percent of flights at Newark International Airport are by United Airlines.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ve ever really recovered from the merger between United and Continental, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve integrated employees. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve set a culture there, and you\u2019ve got a CEO who takes off after the guy was dragged down the aisle,\u201d he said.\n\nChristie sent a letter Tuesday to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, saying that his state is looking into action to prevent what he called the \u201cabusive practice\u201d of overbooking, and requested that the administration suspend airlines' ability to overbook.\n\n\u201cWe would ask, in the context of the president\u2019s efforts at regulatory reform to improve the lives of our citizens, that you consider the immediate suspension of this overbooking authority until a thorough review can be done by your department,\u201d Christie wrote.\n\nChristie told \"Fox & Friends\" that until that happens, United Airlines can capitalize on the fact that people often have no choice but to fly United in places like Newark.\n\n\u201cThey kicked those people off \u2026 to make money and they\u2019re doing it with the permission of the federal government,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what I\u2019m saying to the administration is, stop them from doing it.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Transportation and others are looking into the incident, but the White House has not signaled any regulatory changes.\n\n\"Let\u2019s not get ahead of where that review goes,\" Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday. \"It was an unfortunate incident, clearly, when you watch the video. It is troubling to see how that was handled. ... Law enforcement is reviewing it. And I think for us to start to get in front of what should be a local matter, not necessarily needing a federal response.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Munoz issued an apology after initially defending the company in a memo.\n\n\"I deeply apologize to the customer forcibly removed and to all the customers aboard,\" he said in the statement. \"No one should ever be mistreated this way.\"", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/12/christie-tees-off-on-awful-united-airlines-in-wake-uproar.html"}, {"text": "**Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day? Sign up here.**\n\n\n\nOn the roster: \u2018I like Steve, but\u2026\u2019 - A win but a warning for GOP in Kansas House race - Tense talks as Putin agrees to meet Tillerson - Chinese pitch in to corral Norks - Woof\u2026\n\n\n\n\u2018I LIKE STEVE, BUT\u2026\u2019\n\nIt would appear that senior White House advisor Steve Bannon is just the latest in a long line of those who tried and failed to put Donald Trump in a corner.\n\nThe president, in an interview with NYP\u2019s Michael Goodwin, threw more shade than a sequoia on the man who conventional wisdom has long held is not only the architect of Trumpism, but the Iago darkly manipulating the new president.\n\nThe conventional wisdom, it would seem, is all wet when it comes to Bannon.\n\nThere\u2019s a fairly straightforward explanation for Trump not only diminishing Bannon\u2019s perceived role but also issuing a public ultimatum to his onetime top advisor vis-\u00e0-vis continued White House infighting \u201cto straighten it out or I will.\u201d\n\nBannon tried to muscle Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner and found himself crossways with the boss\u2019s daughter, never a good place to be in any organization.\n\nBut there is something else at work here, too: the remaking of Trump\u2019s political brand.\n\nIf someone would have told you six months ago that Trump would be riding strong public approval for intervening in the Syrian civil war, putting U.S.-Russia relations in a deep freeze, celebrating cooperation with China, pummeling the most conservative members of the House and turning increasingly toward the guidance of establishment political and policy figures you might have, at the very least, been surprised.\n\nYou could say that Trump is moving left with his embracive interventionism and bipartisanship, but you could also say that Trump is turning his back on the neo-Jacksonian Revolution that Bannon & Co. once ordained.\n\nIt would seem the moment of truth for Bannon came when Trump took his most explicit step toward the more traditional understanding of the modern presidency with the Syria strikes.\n\nIf you were applying the usual rules of politics, Trump simply couldn\u2019t bomb Syria.\n\nIt would throw over the bid to rebalance global power around a new U.S.-Russia alliance aimed at containing China. It would reestablish America\u2019s role as the superpower policeman of the world. It would expend substantial sums and place American credibility on the line in a conflict with no immediate threat to the country Trump is governing.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound much like the \u201cAmerica first\u201d policy that Bannon sketched out in Trump\u2019s inaugural address.\n\nBut if anyone should have known by now that rhetorical or ideological consistency is not a North Star for Trump, it should be Bannon.\n\nHe watched and no doubt cheered as Trump reversed himself on issues far and wide during the campaign. Once a defender of partial-birth abortion, Trump declared himself pro-life. Once a friend and donor to Hillary Clinton, Trump said she should be in jail. Once a proponent on enormous tax increases, Trump came to love Laffer curve. Once a critic of Mitt Romney\u2019s harsh rhetoric about illegal immigrants, Trump, well\u2026 you know.\n\nThe misconception among Bannon and some other Trump supporters seems to have been that he would have to abide by the views under which he was elected \u2013 that somehow this would place a seal of permanency on his previously always fungible views.\n\nThat\u2019s not how this is going to be.\n\nConservatives lament the increasing sway of Democrats within the administration, including Kushner and former Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn. Many on the right take seriously Trump\u2019s threat to work with Democrats on his proposal for massive stimulus spending, health insurance and other initiatives.\n\nSimilarly, those opposed to American interventions overseas in both parties are now in something of a panic as their guy increasingly surrounds himself with a foreign policy team that George W. Bush would have been very happy to call his own.\n\nThe whispered accusation here is that Trump swindled supporters by taking positions during the campaign that he did not truly hold. But that misses the mark and misunderstands what Trumpism really is.\n\nTrump was not a closet Democrat masquerading as a quasi-isolationist. He was a guy trying to win an election. What he was saying was working, mostly, so he went with it. And in that way Trump understands populism better than the self-described populists.\n\nAs the president tries to find sure footing for his administration, he is looking to give the people what they want.\n\nThose who style themselves as populists are really, as Andrew Jackson was, anti-establishmentarians. Destroying the administrative state and bringing the federal government to a crashing halt or allowing ObamaCare to crash and burn as a political payback may be assaults on the establishments of both parties, but would probably be about as popular as allowing dictators to get away with gassing children.\n\nTrump is finding a new way \u2013 call it \u201cpopularism\u201d if you like \u2013 and the folks who thought they could constrain him by his prior promises and positions are in for some rough sledding. It will be approval ratings, not doctrines, that carry the day.\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: POWER IN NUMBERS\n\n\u201cThe natural strength of the people in a large community, in proportion to the artificial strength of the government, is greater than in a small [community], and of course more competent to a struggle with the attempts of the government to establish a tyranny.\u201d \u2013Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 28\n\n\n\nTIME OUT: LONG IN THE TOOTH\n\nNat Geo: \u201cRabbits are the third most popular pet in America, after cats and dogs, according to the Humane Society of the United States\u2014and the third most abandoned. Most Americans have a sense of how long cats and dogs live, the kind of care they need, their behaviors. But rabbits? \u2026 In fact, with proper care, rabbits live 10 to 12 years. People\u2019s understanding of them seems to be out of step with their ubiquity. This disconnect appears to drive impulse pet rabbit purchases, says Anne Martin, executive director of the House Rabbit Society, the largest rabbit rescue organization in the U.S. Because many people think they\u2019re short-lived, low maintenance, cage-bound animals, rabbits are seen as \u2018starter pets,\u2019 akin to hamsters or goldfish, perfect for kids. This misconception may help drive a glut of baby bunny sales ahead of Easter\u2014and a subsequent rise in rabbit abandonments.\u201d\n\n\n\nFlag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.\n\nA WIN BUT A WARNING FOR GOP IN KANSAS HOUSE RACE\n\nThere\u2019s good news and bad news for Republicans in the special election to replace now-CIA Director Mike Pompeo in his former Kansas House seat.\n\nThe good news is that soon-to-be Rep. Mike Estes, R, Kan. made it and will stand a good chance for re-election next year. The bad news is that for the second special election in a row a democratic nominee outperformed their previous cycle\u2019s presidential candidate by about 20 points.\n\nAs you read and hear analysis of this race, bear in mind that something\u2019s are easily over-interpreted. Scott Brown\u2019s 2010 Massachusetts Senate win was indeed a harbinger but Republican successes in 2011\u2019s special elections meant no great shakes for 2012.\n\nThat having been said, Republicans are right to be worried about the trend this year, especially with a high-stakes contest next week in suburban Atlanta for now-Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price\u2019s former seat.\n\nPolitical nerds care about these things because we are keenly interested in things like voter turnout, intensity and demographic patterns. For partisans, though, the consideration is about more than trend lines. It\u2019s about recruitment and the current Congress\u2019 agenda.\n\nThe tighter-than-it-should-have-been race in Kansas if paired with a GOP loss in Georgia would cause Republican members of Congress to recoil from ambitious plans laid before them and make it doubly hard for the party to recruit for next year.\n\nTENSE TALKS AS PUTIN AGREES TO MEET TILLERSON\n\nNYT: \u201cAfter Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson waited for much of the day, wondering whether he would get to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin, the two men sat down at the Kremlin late Wednesday afternoon in the first face-to-face meeting between the Russian leader and a top official in the Trump administration. Relations between the United States and Russia have grown so tense that it was unclear whether Mr. Putin would agree to see Mr. Tillerson... In the 24 hours before Mr. Tillerson landed, the White House accused Mr. Putin\u2019s government of covering up evidence that the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad was responsible for sarin gas attacks on its own people, launched from a base where Russian troops are operating. Mr. Putin shot back that the charge was fabricated... \u2018This reminds me very much of the events of 2003, when U.S. representatives in the Security Council showed alleged chemical weapons discovered in Iraq,\u2019 Mr. Putin said\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nNew evidence shows payments to Manafort from pro-Putin source \u00ad- AP: \u201cLast August, a handwritten ledger surfaced in Ukraine with dollar amounts and dates next to the name of Paul Manafort, who was then Donald Trump's campaign chairman. Ukrainian investigators called it evidence of off-the-books payments from a pro-Russian political party - and part of a larger pattern of corruption under the country's former president. \u2026 Now, financial records newly obtained by The Associated Press confirm that at least $1.2 million in payments listed in the ledger next to Manafort's name were actually received by his consulting firm in the United States.\u201d\n\nFBI got surveillance warrant on former Trump adviser with Kremlin ties - AP: \u201cA newspaper report says the FBI obtained a secret court order last summer to monitor the communications of Carter Page, an adviser to then-candidate Donald Trump, because the government had reason to believe Page was acting as a Russian agent. The Washington Post, citing unnamed law enforcement and other U.S. officials, says the government surveillance application laid out the basis for believing that Page had knowingly engaged in intelligence activities on Russia's behalf. The newspaper said the application includes contacts Page had with a Russian intelligence operative in 2013.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump stands by Comey - The Hill: \u201cPresident Trump says he will not request FBI Director James Comey\u2019s resignation, even though the FBI is investigating Trump's potential ties to Russia. \u2018No, it\u2019s not too late,\u2019 Trump said Wednesday on Fox Business when asked about seeking Comey\u2019s resignation. \u2018I want to give everybody a good, fair chance. We\u2019ll see what happens. It\u2019s going to be interesting.\u2019 The FBI director revealed last month that his agency is probing Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, including possible collusion between Moscow and Trump\u2019s campaign.\u201d\n\nCHINESE PITCH IN TO CORRAL NORKS\n\nReuters: \u201cChinese President Xi Jinping called for a peaceful resolution of rising tension on the Korean peninsula in a telephone conversation with U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday, as a U.S. aircraft carrier strike group steamed towards the region. Trump's call with Xi, just days after they met in the United States, came as an influential state-run Chinese newspaper warned that the Korean peninsula was the closest it has been to a \u2018military clash\u2019 since North Korea's first nuclear test in 2006. The communication between the leaders underscores the increasing sense of urgency as tension escalates amid concern that reclusive North Korea could soon conduct a sixth nuclear test, or more missile launches, and Trump's threat of unilateral action to solve the problem.\u201d\n\nSPICER, AGONISTES\n\nFox News: \u201cWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer apologized late Tuesday after stating in his daily briefing that Adolf Hitler \u2018didn't even sink to using chemical weapons.\u2019 \u2018Today I was trying to describe the attack that [Syrian President Bashar] Assad made on his own people using chemical weapons,\u2019 Spicer told Fox News. \u2018Frankly, I mistakenly used an inappropriate and insensitive reference to the Holocaust, to which there is frankly no comparison. Obviously, that is not what I was intending to do. And I \u2014 especially during this week [Passover] \u2014 regret using that term and apologize and hope that we can focus on the president's decisive action that he took to make sure that we deal with the situation in Syria.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\n\nTrump reverses order instituting federal hiring freeze \u00ad- The Hill\n\nPiece of cake: Trump raves to Maria Bartiromo about the dessert Chinese president was eating at the time of Syria strike news - People\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump to be paid damages from libel case - Bloomberg\n\n\n\nKatie Pavlich breaks down the new rules on illegal immigrants at the Justice Dept. - Townhall\n\nProtestors at S.C. town hall turn Rep.

Wholesalers would have records of which pharmacy they send drugs into. If a prescription is paid in cash, manufacturers have no idea where the wholesalers delivered the drugs. If it\u2019s electronically adjudicated via insurance, a manufacturer would know what zip code it went to, and which doctor wrote the Rx. Something tells me this was a cash only business.\u201d \u2013Norm Smith, Newtown, Pa.\n\n[Ed. note: Thank you for pointing out that distinction, Mr. Smith. I don\u2019t pretend to know enough about the way drug wholesaling and retailing works to claim to understand. For readers who missed Tuesday\u2019s audible about the Pulitzer Prize won by the Charleston [W. Va.] Gazette Mail\u2019s Eric Eyre, the placement of blame in how hundreds of millions of these powerful, and powerfully addicting, drugs ended up in a state where the population is about the size of metropolitan Nashville is a huge issue.

That is unacceptable to Washington\u2019s foreign policy establishment, which dismissed Trump\u2019s approach as impossibly na\u00efve.\n\nWhen combined with Russian hackers trying to hurt Hillary Clinton by illegally obtaining emails from her campaign and the DNC, some Trump skeptics assumed either collusion between the Republican candidate and the Kremlin or speculated that Putin\u2019s gang had damaging information on Trump.\n\nBut now that the new president is confronting the harsh truth of geopolitics, his stance looks very different. As Eric Trump put it: \u201cIf there was anything that Syria did, it was to validate the fact that there is no Russia tie.\u201d\n\nIn the briefing room yesterday, Sean Spicer said \u201cthere\u2019s no question Russia is isolated,\u201d pointing to its alliance with North Korea and Iran as well as Syria. Nikki Haley told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that nothing \u201cis off the table\u201d when it comes to imposing tougher sanctions on Russia as well as Iran.\n\nAnd unnamed national security officials told White House reporters that \u201cit is clear the Russians are trying to cover up what happened\u201d through a \u201cdisinformation campaign.\u201d\n\nThe president himself told Fox Business anchor Maria Bartiromo that Putin is aligning himself with someone who is \"evil\" and that \"I don't think it's good for Russia.\"\n\nTillerson, for his part, pressed Moscow by saying that Assad is an \u201cunreliable partner.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that a long-term alliance that serves Russia's interests?\u201d the secretary of State told reporters. \u201cOr would Russia prefer to realign with the United States, with other Western countries and Middle East countries that are seeking to resolve the Syrian crisis?\u201d\n\nTrump may not always listen to the low-profile Tillerson, but he\u2019s surely not out there freelancing.\n\nPutin, meanwhile, likened the missile attack to the Bush administration\u2019s invasion of Iraq, while his government said another U.S. strike would be \u201cunacceptable\u201d and that U.S.-Russian relations are in the \u201cmost difficult period since the Cold War.\u201d\n\nI happen to think the president missed an opportunity by not addressing the country after the missile strike to lay out his vision of America\u2019s role in intervening after foreign atrocities. That prompted stories like this one in the New York Times, which said \u201chis administration has spoken with multiple voices as it seeks to explain its evolving policy. But one voice has not been heard from: that of Mr. Trump himself.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s clear that relations are already rocky between Trump and Russia. And you don\u2019t have to be a member of his family to grasp that his optimistic campaign talk is being overtaken by reality.\n\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

But Mulvaney has made clear that agencies targeted for significant budget cuts in Trump's first budget proposal, such as the Environmental Protection Agency, will likely be expected to make significant cuts to their workforces.\n\nAnd agencies that Trump wants to spend more on, like the Department of Veterans Affairs, would be expected to see their payrolls rise.\n\nTrump's budget blueprint calls for a 6 percent increase in VA funding, mostly to pay for rising health costs to treat veterans. The VA is one of three agencies slated for more money amid major cuts to other domestic programs.\n\nMulvaney declined Tuesday, when first announcing the plan, to say how many jobs, overall, the administration intends to eliminate.\n\nOne possibility is moving the National Nuclear Security Administration from the Department of Energy to the Department of Defense.\n\nHowever, Mulvaney acknowledged that many such changes would require congressional sign-off. Democrats have so far opposed nearly every Trump proposal.\n\nDespite the earlier order, the federal government added 2,000 workers in February and 4,000 in January, according to Labor Department figures. Several departments, including the State Department, were granted exemptions from the hiring freeze after voicing concerns.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/12/trump-replaces-federal-hiring-freeze-with-agency-cuts-to-end-billions-wasted.html"}, {"text": "Mr. President,\n\nYou were elected as an outsider who would do what is right for the American people against a system that is rigged to do what is wrong.\n\nIf you follow Congress\u2019 lead on tax cuts, your economic agenda is on the road to destruction. The base, which is already treated like a perpetual headache by GOP leadership, will not tolerate this Congress blowing it again on a major election promise.\n\nPresident Trump, your domestic agenda now stands at a crossroads. Which direction you take will be of significant consequence for the Republican Party, the country and the future of your administration.\n\nBut it will be up to you to take the lead. Strong and effective leadership is precisely what is called for right now.\n\nIn your Contract with the American Voter, you promised \u2018massive tax reduction and simplification\u2019 which would grow the economy 4 percent per year and create at least 25 million new jobs.\n\nKeeping this pledge of tax cuts to the American people is critical. Individuals and families need the relief and the economy needs the boost. But the GOP leadership\u2019s disastrous handling of the health care bill should lower all expectations that this Congress is capable of carry tax cuts across the finish line.\n\nGOP leaders aren\u2019t repealing and replacing ObamaCare, the right way, as they promised the American people over countless election cycles; they are going to keep Chuck Schumer happy and leave out your border wall in their upcoming spending bill; and now they are dilly-dallying on a \u2018once in a generation\u2019 tax reform package.\n\nThe embarrassing Republican plan kept the worst parts of ObamaCare and did little to address those who are currently being hurt by astronomical premiums due to the Democrats radical restructuring of American healthcare.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this movie countless times, having locked horns with Congressional leadership while you were running your business and Vice President Pence was running Indiana.\n\nBelieve us when we tell you: it was like pulling teeth getting this Congress to do anything the grassroots elected them to do, even when leadership made sure that no matter what they did, it wouldn\u2019t matter.\n\nRemember, most members of Congress avoided you like the plague, convinced you were going to lose the election. Their stunning lack of political acumen ensured they weren\u2019t ready for your aggressive approach, and gives them no currency in the debates ahead.\n\nSpeaker Ryan and his colleagues are now kicking the tax reform can down the road to God only knows when and with who knows what type of bill.\n\nIf a governing Republican Party cannot give much needed tax cuts for the American people, then this Congress is as useless as a three-dollar bill.\n\nRight now Congress is embarking on recess having accomplished practically nothing for your agenda. It is now up to you President Trump to steer the ship.\n\nIf you want to follow through on your promise to make \u2018massive\u2019 tax cuts, go it alone. Take the lead on authoring the plan and sell it directly to the American people.\n\nTogether, you and the American people put pressure on Congress to get your agenda back on track.\n\nDon\u2019t outsource tax cuts to a liberal Congress. Make Congress follow the White House\u2019s lead on delivering tax cuts to the American people.\n\nMr. President: You didn\u2019t just inherit a mess. You inherited a useless Congress.

It would reestablish America\u2019s role as the superpower policeman of the world. It would expend substantial sums and place American credibility on the line in a conflict with no immediate threat to the country Trump is governing.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound much like the \u201cAmerica first\u201d policy that Bannon sketched out in Trump\u2019s inaugural address.\n\nBut if anyone should have known by now that rhetorical or ideological consistency is not a North Star for Trump, it should be Bannon.\n\nHe watched and no doubt cheered as Trump reversed himself on issues far and wide during the campaign. Once a defender of partial-birth abortion, Trump declared himself pro-life. Once a friend and donor to Hillary Clinton, Trump said she should be in jail. Once a proponent on enormous tax increases, Trump came to love Laffer curve. Once a critic of Mitt Romney\u2019s harsh rhetoric about illegal immigrants, Trump, well\u2026 you know.\n\nThe misconception among Bannon and some other Trump supporters seems to have been that he would have to abide by the views under which he was elected \u2013 that somehow this would place a seal of permanency on his previously always fungible views.\n\nThat\u2019s not how this is going to be.\n\nConservatives lament the increasing sway of Democrats within the administration, including Kushner and former Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn. Many on the right take seriously Trump\u2019s threat to work with Democrats on his proposal for massive stimulus spending, health insurance and other initiatives.\n\nSimilarly, those opposed to American interventions overseas in both parties are now in something of a panic as their guy increasingly surrounds himself with a foreign policy team that George W. Bush would have been very happy to call his own.\n\nThe whispered accusation here is that Trump swindled supporters by taking positions during the campaign that he did not truly hold. But that misses the mark and misunderstands what Trumpism really is.\n\nTrump was not a closet Democrat masquerading as a quasi-isolationist. He was a guy trying to win an election. What he was saying was working, mostly, so he went with it. And in that way Trump understands populism better than the self-described populists.\n\nAs the president tries to find sure footing for his administration, he is looking to give the people what they want.\n\nThose who style themselves as populists are really, as Andrew Jackson was, anti-establishmentarians. Destroying the administrative state and bringing the federal government to a crashing halt or allowing ObamaCare to crash and burn as a political payback may be assaults on the establishments of both parties, but would probably be about as popular as allowing dictators to get away with gassing children.\n\nTrump is finding a new way \u2013 call it \u201cpopularism\u201d if you like \u2013 and the folks who thought they could constrain him by his prior promises and positions are in for some rough sledding. It will be approval ratings, not doctrines, that carry the day.\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: POWER IN NUMBERS\n\n\u201cThe natural strength of the people in a large community, in proportion to the artificial strength of the government, is greater than in a small [community], and of course more competent to a struggle with the attempts of the government to establish a tyranny.\u201d \u2013Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 28\n\n\n\nTIME OUT: LONG IN THE TOOTH\n\nNat Geo: \u201cRabbits are the third most popular pet in America, after cats and dogs, according to the Humane Society of the United States\u2014and the third most abandoned. Most Americans have a sense of how long cats and dogs live, the kind of care they need, their behaviors. But rabbits? \u2026 In fact, with proper care, rabbits live 10 to 12 years. People\u2019s understanding of them seems to be out of step with their ubiquity. This disconnect appears to drive impulse pet rabbit purchases, says Anne Martin, executive director of the House Rabbit Society, the largest rabbit rescue organization in the U.S. Because many people think they\u2019re short-lived, low maintenance, cage-bound animals, rabbits are seen as \u2018starter pets,\u2019 akin to hamsters or goldfish, perfect for kids. This misconception may help drive a glut of baby bunny sales ahead of Easter\u2014and a subsequent rise in rabbit abandonments.\u201d\n\n\n\nFlag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.\n\nA WIN BUT A WARNING FOR GOP IN KANSAS HOUSE RACE\n\nThere\u2019s good news and bad news for Republicans in the special election to replace now-CIA Director Mike Pompeo in his former Kansas House seat.\n\nThe good news is that soon-to-be Rep. Mike Estes, R, Kan. made it and will stand a good chance for re-election next year. The bad news is that for the second special election in a row a democratic nominee outperformed their previous cycle\u2019s presidential candidate by about 20 points.\n\nAs you read and hear analysis of this race, bear in mind that something\u2019s are easily over-interpreted. Scott Brown\u2019s 2010 Massachusetts Senate win was indeed a harbinger but Republican successes in 2011\u2019s special elections meant no great shakes for 2012.\n\nThat having been said, Republicans are right to be worried about the trend this year, especially with a high-stakes contest next week in suburban Atlanta for now-Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price\u2019s former seat.\n\nPolitical nerds care about these things because we are keenly interested in things like voter turnout, intensity and demographic patterns. For partisans, though, the consideration is about more than trend lines. It\u2019s about recruitment and the current Congress\u2019 agenda.\n\nThe tighter-than-it-should-have-been race in Kansas if paired with a GOP loss in Georgia would cause Republican members of Congress to recoil from ambitious plans laid before them and make it doubly hard for the party to recruit for next year.\n\nTENSE TALKS AS PUTIN AGREES TO MEET TILLERSON\n\nNYT: \u201cAfter Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson waited for much of the day, wondering whether he would get to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin, the two men sat down at the Kremlin late Wednesday afternoon in the first face-to-face meeting between the Russian leader and a top official in the Trump administration. Relations between the United States and Russia have grown so tense that it was unclear whether Mr. Putin would agree to see Mr. Tillerson... In the 24 hours before Mr. Tillerson landed, the White House accused Mr. Putin\u2019s government of covering up evidence that the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad was responsible for sarin gas attacks on its own people, launched from a base where Russian troops are operating. Mr. Putin shot back that the charge was fabricated... \u2018This reminds me very much of the events of 2003, when U.S. representatives in the Security Council showed alleged chemical weapons discovered in Iraq,\u2019 Mr. Putin said\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nNew evidence shows payments to Manafort from pro-Putin source \u00ad- AP: \u201cLast August, a handwritten ledger surfaced in Ukraine with dollar amounts and dates next to the name of Paul Manafort, who was then Donald Trump's campaign chairman. Ukrainian investigators called it evidence of off-the-books payments from a pro-Russian political party - and part of a larger pattern of corruption under the country's former president. \u2026 Now, financial records newly obtained by The Associated Press confirm that at least $1.2 million in payments listed in the ledger next to Manafort's name were actually received by his consulting firm in the United States.\u201d\n\nFBI got surveillance warrant on former Trump adviser with Kremlin ties - AP: \u201cA newspaper report says the FBI obtained a secret court order last summer to monitor the communications of Carter Page, an adviser to then-candidate Donald Trump, because the government had reason to believe Page was acting as a Russian agent. The Washington Post, citing unnamed law enforcement and other U.S. officials, says the government surveillance application laid out the basis for believing that Page had knowingly engaged in intelligence activities on Russia's behalf. The newspaper said the application includes contacts Page had with a Russian intelligence operative in 2013.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump stands by Comey - The Hill: \u201cPresident Trump says he will not request FBI Director James Comey\u2019s resignation, even though the FBI is investigating Trump's potential ties to Russia. \u2018No, it\u2019s not too late,\u2019 Trump said Wednesday on Fox Business when asked about seeking Comey\u2019s resignation. \u2018I want to give everybody a good, fair chance. We\u2019ll see what happens. It\u2019s going to be interesting.\u2019 The FBI director revealed last month that his agency is probing Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, including possible collusion between Moscow and Trump\u2019s campaign.\u201d\n\nCHINESE PITCH IN TO CORRAL NORKS\n\nReuters: \u201cChinese President Xi Jinping called for a peaceful resolution of rising tension on the Korean peninsula in a telephone conversation with U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday, as a U.S. aircraft carrier strike group steamed towards the region. Trump's call with Xi, just days after they met in the United States, came as an influential state-run Chinese newspaper warned that the Korean peninsula was the closest it has been to a \u2018military clash\u2019 since North Korea's first nuclear test in 2006. The communication between the leaders underscores the increasing sense of urgency as tension escalates amid concern that reclusive North Korea could soon conduct a sixth nuclear test, or more missile launches, and Trump's threat of unilateral action to solve the problem.\u201d\n\nSPICER, AGONISTES\n\nFox News: \u201cWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer apologized late Tuesday after stating in his daily briefing that Adolf Hitler \u2018didn't even sink to using chemical weapons.\u2019 \u2018Today I was trying to describe the attack that [Syrian President Bashar] Assad made on his own people using chemical weapons,\u2019 Spicer told Fox News. \u2018Frankly, I mistakenly used an inappropriate and insensitive reference to the Holocaust, to which there is frankly no comparison. Obviously, that is not what I was intending to do. And I \u2014 especially during this week [Passover] \u2014 regret using that term and apologize and hope that we can focus on the president's decisive action that he took to make sure that we deal with the situation in Syria.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\n\nTrump reverses order instituting federal hiring freeze \u00ad- The Hill\n\nPiece of cake: Trump raves to Maria Bartiromo about the dessert Chinese president was eating at the time of Syria strike news - People\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump to be paid damages from libel case - Bloomberg\n\n\n\nKatie Pavlich breaks down the new rules on illegal immigrants at the Justice Dept. - Townhall\n\nProtestors at S.C. town hall turn Rep.

Wholesalers would have records of which pharmacy they send drugs into. If a prescription is paid in cash, manufacturers have no idea where the wholesalers delivered the drugs. If it\u2019s electronically adjudicated via insurance, a manufacturer would know what zip code it went to, and which doctor wrote the Rx. Something tells me this was a cash only business.\u201d \u2013Norm Smith, Newtown, Pa.\n\n[Ed. note: Thank you for pointing out that distinction, Mr. Smith. I don\u2019t pretend to know enough about the way drug wholesaling and retailing works to claim to understand. For readers who missed Tuesday\u2019s audible about the Pulitzer Prize won by the Charleston [W. Va.] Gazette Mail\u2019s Eric Eyre, the placement of blame in how hundreds of millions of these powerful, and powerfully addicting, drugs ended up in a state where the population is about the size of metropolitan Nashville is a huge issue. An issue that I suspect will be working through the criminal and civil courts for years to come.

And a picture in the media is worth a million words...and billions of dollars!\n\nThe media decides what makes the headlines. The media just turned the United Airlines scandal into the biggest news story of the year. One customer being beaten and dragged off a plane went viral and destroyed a billion dollar brand.\n\nIn this case the mainstream media was right. The minute I saw what United Airlines did to one of their own customers, I warned in media interviews this would destroy United Airlines' brand, cost them billions in lost business, and drive their stock dramatically down. This is a business school case study in how to destroy a billion dollar brand overnight.\n\nThis scandal was so powerful because it could have been anyone of us. What if that poor beaten and bleeding man being dragged from the plane was you? Your husband? Your son? Your dad?\n\nThat incident wins the award for the worst treatment of a customer by a private sector company ever. Disgraceful. Everyone involved should be fired.\n\nBut I have a much worse story than this. A similar story, except far more widespread. The difference is the media never made it a headline. They barely covered it at all.\n\nIt\u2019s also a story of a CEO and terrible abuse of his own customers. The CEO is former President Barack Obama. The customers in this case were conservative taxpayers. The company that committed the terrible crimes against thousands of our fellow citizens was the IRS.\n\nAnd it was Obama's IRS.\n\nThat's why the media never cared. That's why the media never covered it. Obama was (and still is) their hero. And the liberal mainstream media hates \"evil\" private sector corporations like United Airlines. But they love government agencies like the IRS.\n\nThey don't want the wrongdoing, abuse and corruption of government to make headlines all over the world.\n\nThe media covers up scandals involving Democrats and government. The either kill the story...or put it on the bottom of page 98.\n\nThe United Airlines scandal is the story of the year. Deservedly so. But the IRS scandal ignored by the media is the story of the century.\n\nNow President Donald Trump has the opportunity to expose the most widespread criminal conspiracy in U.S. political history.\n\nThis scandal would make the Gambino Crime Family blush. I have stumbled upon this \"political scandal of a lifetime\" because I\u2019m a witness. I was one of the victims. Now I\u2019m asking President Trump to get involved in seeing that justice is served.\n\nBack in 2010, I became one of the most high-profile critics of President Obama. My opinions were featured in the national media, day and night. In particular, here on Fox News.\n\nSuddenly I became the victim of the most vicious, over-the-top, IRS attack any tax expert had ever seen. I was targeted for destruction. It was a witch hunt, persecution and intimidation all in one. It was meant to punish me, distract me and bankrupt me.\n\nI beat the IRS. A judge in tax court threw the case out. But only six days after winning in court, I was under a new IRS assault. Tax experts reported this had never happened before in tax history. They told me, \u201cYou are on the President\u2019s Enemies List.\u201d\n\nThankfully, I won again. I didn\u2019t owe one cent. But I lost three years of my life and tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees. I didn't sleep for three years. I told my story multiple times here at FoxNews.com.\n\nGovernment watchdog Judicial Watch got involved. They fought a 14-month battle to force the IRS to hand over my tax files. Once we prevailed, guess what we found? Hard evidence this was a political witch hunt, persecution, and intimidation based on my conservative political beliefs. We have the proof in writing. A government agency- in America- tried to destroy a citizen based on his political beliefs.\n\nBut this scandal isn't like the United Airlines scandal. The media destroyed a billion dollar brand based on one poor man's treatment at the hands of a cold, ruthless bureaucracy. This is so much worse. So much bigger.\n\nThe IRS scandal is not about one man being abused by a cold, ruthless bureaucracy. And he will make millions in a lawsuit against United. Millions for one hour of abuse.\n\nThe victims of IRS abuse suffered for years. And there are no lawsuits possible -- because government employees are protected by law from lawsuits.\n\nBut here's the big story. I\u2019m only the tip of the iceberg. There were thousands of victims just like me attacked by Obama\u2019s IRS.\n\nHow do I know? Well, first, did you see the headlines from Judicial Watch this week? Of course not. No one did.\n\nThe media never covered the new developments in the IRS scandal involving thousands of abused customers. They were too busy covering the one customer abused by United.\n\nHere is what you missed. The IRS has finally handed over thousands of pages of supposedly \u201clost documents.\u201d They claimed they were lost forever. It turns out they weren't lost, just hidden from investigators. These documents confirm the IRS illegally targeted conservatives.\n\nBut the scandal runs much deeper than the abuse of faceless conservative groups. I\u2019ve personally heard from over a hundred individual GOP donors who were mysteriously attacked out of the blue by the IRS- in each case, only weeks after writing a donation check to either the GOP, a GOP candidate, or a conservative group.\n\nI've heard from board members of Tea Party groups who were attacked by the IRS for the first time in their lives, only weeks after joining the board.\n\nI heard from a hedge fund CEO who attended the first meeting of hedge fund executives for Mitt Romney back in 2011. Everyone of the millionaire hedge fund CEOs in the room that day wrote a big check to Mitt Romney. He reports every one of them wound up under either IRS or SEC attack. 20 for 20. Could that be a coincidence?\n\nThere are clearly thousands of cases out there -- just like this.\n\nIf the IRS targeted thousands of Obama critics and individual conservative donors, this was the biggest criminal conspiracy in US history. And it's easy to prove.\n\nHere\u2019s my recommendation for President Trump:\n\nStart a DOJ investigation immediately. This case is so easy to prove. Simply compare Federal Election Commission lists of GOP donors for the eight years of Obama versus a list of IRS audit victims. I'm betting you'll find IRS audit percentage rates through the roof. I'm betting you'll find well over 50% of large GOP donors were audited by the IRS during Obama's eight years in office.\n\nNow compare a FEC list of Democrat donors during Obama\u2019s reign. I'm betting you'll find normal random audit rates of 1%.\n\n1 percent versus over 50 percent. That's statistically impossible.\n\nI'm betting what DOJ investigators will also find is that Obama's IRS targeted and audited the highest percentage of GOP donors of any president in history.

This was a massive criminal conspiracy to persecute, punish, intimidate and bankrupt GOP donors, activists and critics of Obama. It was meant to weaken and starve Obama\u2019s political opposition. It was meant to scare anyone away from writing a check to conservative candidates or causes. And it worked.\n\nLower-level IRS employees didn\u2019t do this by themselves. They were just following orders. Orders given by the Obama White House to destroy conservatives.\n\nPresident Trump must send a loud message.

They claimed it showed improper secret payments to Manafort from Ukrainian political and business interests including the Russia-leaning Party of Regions political group, which Manafort\u2019s firm advised from 2004 to 2010.\n\nU.S. investigators have struggled to find direct evidence of wrongdoing from the financial ledger, partly because much of it is hand-written in cyrillic and Ukrainian investigators haven\u2019t been able to cross-reference the entries with bank records.\n\nBut the AP report says that newly obtained financial records confirm that at least $1.2 million in payments between 2007 and 2009 listed in the ledger next to Manafort\u2019s name were actually received by his consulting firm in the United States.\n\nLater in the day the AP reported Manafort was registering as a foreign agent.\n\n\"Since before the 2016 election, Mr. Manafort has been in discussions with federal authorities about the advisability of registering under FARA for some of his past political work,\" Manafort's Spokesman Jason Maloni said in a statement. \"Mr. Manafort received formal guidance recently from the authorities and he is taking appropriate steps in response to the guidance. The work in question was widely known, concluded before Mr. Manafort began working with the Trump Campaign and was not conducted on behalf of the Russian government.\"\n\nThe report goes on to detail how the transactions were made via connections in Belize and Cyprus, which the AP points out is an \u201cisland nation once known as a favored locale for money laundering.\u201d\n\nBut Manafort\u2019s spokesman told Fox News that \u201cthe real facts are completely contrary\u201d to the implications of the AP report. \u201cThe real facts,\u201d said Maloni, \u201care that Mr. Manafort did very visible consulting work for the Party of Regions and was paid by wire transfer into his accounts.\n\n\"Mr. Manafort has always denied that he ever received cash payments for his work and has consistently maintained that he received all of his payments for services rendered through wire transfers through the international banking system. There is absolutely nothing improper with this method of payment.\u201d\n\nAs for the use of the Bank of Cyprus, in a statement provided to Fox News, Manafort said, \u201cMy company was paid\u2026 using clients\u2019 preferred financial institutions and instructions. I performed my work, billed for my services, and received payment through my firm\u2019s U.S. bank account.\u201d\n\nMuch of the smoke involving Manafort\u2019s activities in Ukraine with the Party of Regions has been driven by a member of the Ukrainian Parliament named Serhei Leshchenko. Whatever - if anything - Manafort was up to in Ukraine, even Leschenko admits he knows nothing about any collusion with the Russians.\n\nReached by Fox News at his home in Ukraine last month, Leshchenko told Fox News that he\u2019s focused on allegations of Ukrainian corruption, and he\u2019s trying to recover money he believes was unlawfully received from a party he opposed at the time.\n\nBut he admits that he has \u201cno information on Manafort and Russia. I am just focused on the Ukraine issue.\u201d Manafort, Leschenko said, \u201ckept his eyes blind to all the corruption\u201d by the Ukrainian politicians he was advising years ago.\n\nAnd the AP makes clear that the payments in its report are unrelated to the 2016 presidential campaign and came years before Manafort worked as President Trump\u2019s unpaid campaign chairman.\n\nIn conversations with Fox News, the Manafort team was highly critical of the Ukrainian lawmaker. \u201cMr. Leschenko has always claimed that Mr. Manafort received illegal cash payments for his work in Ukraine and that the alleged \u2018black ledger\u2019 of the Party of Regions proves it,\u201d said Maloni, \u201cNow, he is changing his story to say that he has proof that Mr. Manafort received wire transfers to his business account in the U.S. and this somehow proves illegal behavior.\n\n\"Beyond the fact that he is completely changing his story, Mr Leshchenko\u2019s allegations are absurd. Allegations of corruption have been lobbed indiscriminately without a shred of evidence. What is Paul guilty of since it was publicly known he was working for the Party of Regions? Is someone alleging he did not provide consulting services?\u201d\n\nIn his statement, Manafort said, \u201cIndividuals with political motivations are taking disparate pieces of information and distorting their significance through a campaign of smear and innuendo.\u201d\n\nReached at his home in Ukraine on Wednesday, Leshchenko answered the Manafort team\u2019s accusation that he changed his story, \u201cLast summer we did not have the evidence we have now. Now we have a contract of payment. What kind of service did he provide for that money? What was the legal ground for the payment? I cannot say the payment was public because we cannot have access to wire transfer information.\u201d\n\nManafort has volunteered to testify before the House Intelligence Committee, but no date has been set, at least publicly.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/12/paul-manafort-new-report-on-ukraine-ties-totally-misleading-and-incorrect.html"}, {"text": "The House and Senate intelligence committees are expanding their investigation into the so-called \u201cunmasking\u201d controversy, Fox News has learned, to examine whether other candidates or lawmakers beyond President Trump\u2019s associates were affected.\n\nUntil now, the investigation focused on how the identities and communications of Trump transition members were collected by U.S. intelligence agencies and then revealed to, and disseminated among, high-ranking members of the Obama administration.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., now plans to audit files from the National Security Agency and White House to determine whether identities and conversations of presidential candidates -- or members of Congress -- also were swept up during NSA surveillance of foreign leaders. He also plans to review whether Obama\u2019s National Security Council and White House counsel collected and distributed the intelligence for reasons unrelated to foreign intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe will be performing an accounting of all unmasking for political purposes focused on the previous White House administration,\u201d a member of the committee told Fox News. \u201cThis is now a full-blown investigation.\u201d\n\nStaffers on the Senate committee told Fox News they also have expanded their investigation into whether presidential candidates were unmasked and information was misused -- and what role former National Security Adviser Susan Rice, among others, played following reports that she requested Trump-affiliated names be unmasked.\n\nFor a private U.S. citizen to be \u201cunmasked,\u201d or named, in an intelligence report is extremely rare and typically only done if it has some foreign intelligence value. Typically, the American is a suspect in a crime, is in danger or has to be named to explain the context of the report.\n\nThe intelligence reports that Rice and others in the administration reportedly assembled are similar to what a private investigator might piece together, congressional and U.S. intelligence sources said. In some cases, rather than documenting foreign intelligence, the files included salacious personal information that, if released, could be embarrassing or harmful to the person\u2019s reputation, U.S. intelligence and House Intelligence Committee sources said.\n\nThese reports were then disseminated to about 20 to 30 people who had classified clearance in the Obama administration hierarchy, these sources said.\n\nTrump, members of his family, and members of his campaign and transition teams, were likely subjects of \u201cincidental electronic surveillance\u201d by U.S. intelligence agencies, Fox News reported.\n\nSources told Fox News that names were then sent to all those at the National Security Council, some at the Defense Department, then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and then-CIA Director John Brennan -- as well as Rice and her former deputy Ben Rhodes, even though the names were supposed to be reported only to the initial requester.\n\nIf the names were unmasked in intelligence reports and then leaked to the media for political reasons, it could constitute criminal behavior.\n\nRetired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s initial national security adviser, is one known example of a Trump campaign official whose name was unmasked from an intelligence report and leaked to the press. While Rice hasn\u2019t said whether she unmasked Flynn, the leak of his conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak where he discussed U.S. sanctions led Flynn to resign three weeks into his term.\n\nNunes first announced on March 22 that he\u2019d viewed intelligence reports that contained incidental surveillance on members of the Trump team.\n\nOn Tuesday, The Washington Post reported former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page also was monitored by the FBI after the agency obtained a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant as part of an ongoing investigation into possible links between Russian officials and members of the Trump campaign.\n\nIn a statement to Fox News, Page said he has done nothing wrong and was a political target.\n\nMalia Zimmerman is an award-winning investigative reporter focusing on crime, homeland security, illegal immigration crime, terrorism and political corruption.

But Mulvaney has made clear that agencies targeted for significant budget cuts in Trump's first budget proposal, such as the Environmental Protection Agency, will likely be expected to make significant cuts to their workforces.\n\nAnd agencies that Trump wants to spend more on, like the Department of Veterans Affairs, would be expected to see their payrolls rise.\n\nTrump's budget blueprint calls for a 6 percent increase in VA funding, mostly to pay for rising health costs to treat veterans.

Manafort, who worked for the party as an international political consultant, has publicly questioned the ledger's authenticity.\n\nNow, financial records newly obtained by The Associated Press confirm that at least $1.2 million in payments listed in the ledger next to Manafort's name were actually received by his consulting firm in the United States. They include payments in 2007 and 2009, providing the first evidence that Manafort's firm received at least some money listed in the so-called Black Ledger.\n\nThe two payments came years before Manafort became involved in Trump's campaign, but for the first time bolster the credibility of the ledger. They also put the ledger in a new light, as federal prosecutors in the U.S. have been investigating Manafort's work in Eastern Europe as part of a larger anti-corruption probe.\n\nSeparately, Manafort is also under scrutiny as part of congressional and FBI investigations into possible contacts between Trump associates and Russia's government under President Vladimir Putin during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The payments detailed in the ledger and confirmed by the documents obtained by the AP are unrelated to the 2016 presidential campaign and came years before Manafort worked as Trump's unpaid campaign chairman.\n\nIn a statement to the AP, Manafort did not deny that his firm received the money but said \"any wire transactions received by my company are legitimate payments for political consulting work that was provided. I invoiced my clients and they paid via wire transfer, which I received through a U.S. bank.\"\n\nManafort noted that he agreed to be paid according to his \"clients' preferred financial institutions and instructions.\"\n\nPreviously, Manafort and his spokesman, Jason Maloni, have maintained the ledger was fabricated and said no public evidence existed that Manafort or others received payments recorded in it.\n\nThe AP, however, identified in the records two payments received by Manafort that aligned with the ledger: one for $750,000 that a Ukrainian lawmaker said last month was part of a money-laundering effort that should be investigated by U.S. authorities. The other was $455,249 and also matched a ledger entry.\n\nThe newly obtained records also expand the global scope of Manafort's financial activities related to his Ukrainian political consulting, because both payments came from companies once registered in the Central American country of Belize. Last month, the AP reported that the U.S. government has examined Manafort's financial transactions in the Mediterranean country of Cyprus as part of its probe.\n\nFederal prosecutors have been looking into Manafort's work for years as part of an effort to recover Ukrainian assets stolen after the 2014 ouster of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia. No charges have been filed as part of the investigation.\n\nManafort, a longtime Republican political operative, led the presidential campaign from March until August last year when Trump asked him to resign. The resignation came after a tumultuous week in which The New York Times revealed that Manafort's name appeared in the Ukraine ledger \u2014 although the newspaper said at the time that officials were unsure whether Manafort actually received the money \u2014 and after the AP separately reported that he had orchestrated a covert Washington lobbying operation until 2014 on behalf of Ukraine's pro-Russian Party of Regions.\n\nOfficials with the Ukrainian National Anti-Corruption Bureau, which is investigating corruption under Yanukovych, have said they believe the ledger is genuine. But they have previously noted that they have no way of knowing whether Manafort received the money listed next to his name. The bureau said it is not investigating Manafort because he is not a Ukrainian citizen.\n\nStill, Manafort's work continues to draw attention in Ukrainian politics.\n\nLast month, Ukrainian lawmaker Serhiy Leshchenko revealed an invoice bearing the letterhead of Manafort's namesake company, Davis Manafort, that Leshchenko said was crafted to conceal a payment to Manafort as a purchase of 501 computers.\n\nThe AP provided to Manafort the amounts of the payments, dates and number of the bank account where they were received. Manafort told the AP that he was unable to review his own banking records showing receipt of the payments because his bank destroyed the records after a standard 7-year retention period. He said Tuesday the \"computer sales contract is a fraud.\"\n\n\"The signature is not mine, and I didn't sell computers,\" he said in a statement. \"What is clear, however, is individuals with political motivations are taking disparate pieces of information and distorting their significance through a campaign of smear and innuendo.\"\n\nLeshchenko said last month the 2009 invoice was one of about 50 pages of documents, including private paperwork and copies of employee-issued debit cards, that were found in Manafort's former Kiev office by a new tenant.\n\nThe amount of the invoice \u2014 $750,000\u2014 and the payment date of Oct. 14, 2009, matches one entry on the ledger indicating payments to Manafort from the Party of Regions. The invoice was addressed to Neocom Systems Ltd., a company formerly registered in Belize, and included the account and routing numbers and postal address for Manafort's account at a branch of Wachovia National Bank in Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nThe AP had previously been unable to independently verify the $750,000 payment went to a Manafort company, but the newly obtained financial records reflect Manafort's receipt of that payment. The records show that Davis Manafort received the amount from Neocom Systems the day after the date of the invoice.\n\nLeshchenko contended to AP that Yanukovych, as Ukraine's leader, paid Manafort money that came from his government's budget and was \"stolen from Ukrainian citizens.\" He said: \"Money received by Manafort has to be returned to the Ukrainian people.\"\n\nLeshchenko said U.S. authorities should investigate what he described as corrupt deals between Manafort and Yanukovych. \"It's about a U.S. citizen and money was transferred to a U.S. bank account,\" he said.\n\nA $455,249 payment in November 2007 also matches the amount in the ledger. It came from Graten Alliance Ltd., a company that had also been registered in Belize. It is now inactive.\n\nThe AP reported last month that federal prosecutors are looking into Manafort's financial transactions in Cyprus, an island nation once known as a favored locale for money laundering.\n\nAmong those transactions was a $1 million payment in October 2009 routed through the Bank of Cyprus. The money was deposited into an account controlled by a Manafort-linked company, then left the account on the same day, broken into two disbursements of $500,000, according to documents obtained by the AP.\n\nThe records of Manafort's Cypriot transactions were requested by the U.S. Treasury Department Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which works internationally with agencies to track money laundering and the movement of illicit funds around the globe.\n\nDozens of Ukrainian political figures mentioned in the Black Ledger are under investigation in Ukraine.

That is unacceptable to Washington\u2019s foreign policy establishment, which dismissed Trump\u2019s approach as impossibly na\u00efve.\n\nWhen combined with Russian hackers trying to hurt Hillary Clinton by illegally obtaining emails from her campaign and the DNC, some Trump skeptics assumed either collusion between the Republican candidate and the Kremlin or speculated that Putin\u2019s gang had damaging information on Trump.\n\nBut now that the new president is confronting the harsh truth of geopolitics, his stance looks very different. As Eric Trump put it: \u201cIf there was anything that Syria did, it was to validate the fact that there is no Russia tie.\u201d\n\nIn the briefing room yesterday, Sean Spicer said \u201cthere\u2019s no question Russia is isolated,\u201d pointing to its alliance with North Korea and Iran as well as Syria. Nikki Haley told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that nothing \u201cis off the table\u201d when it comes to imposing tougher sanctions on Russia as well as Iran.\n\nAnd unnamed national security officials told White House reporters that \u201cit is clear the Russians are trying to cover up what happened\u201d through a \u201cdisinformation campaign.\u201d\n\nThe president himself told Fox Business anchor Maria Bartiromo that Putin is aligning himself with someone who is \"evil\" and that \"I don't think it's good for Russia.\"\n\nTillerson, for his part, pressed Moscow by saying that Assad is an \u201cunreliable partner.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that a long-term alliance that serves Russia's interests?\u201d the secretary of State told reporters. \u201cOr would Russia prefer to realign with the United States, with other Western countries and Middle East countries that are seeking to resolve the Syrian crisis?\u201d\n\nTrump may not always listen to the low-profile Tillerson, but he\u2019s surely not out there freelancing.\n\nPutin, meanwhile, likened the missile attack to the Bush administration\u2019s invasion of Iraq, while his government said another U.S. strike would be \u201cunacceptable\u201d and that U.S.-Russian relations are in the \u201cmost difficult period since the Cold War.\u201d\n\nI happen to think the president missed an opportunity by not addressing the country after the missile strike to lay out his vision of America\u2019s role in intervening after foreign atrocities. That prompted stories like this one in the New York Times, which said \u201chis administration has spoken with multiple voices as it seeks to explain its evolving policy. But one voice has not been heard from: that of Mr. Trump himself.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s clear that relations are already rocky between Trump and Russia.

In France, the candidate closest to Trump in ideology is undergoing a withering assault just two weeks before French voters go to the polls. And, like Trump, she may actually benefit from the ordeal.\n\nMarine Le Pen, the presidential candidate of the National Front, touched an old but still open wound among Frenchmen this week, when she said her countrymen should stop feeling guilty about rounding up French Jews who were sent to their deaths during World War II, when France was under Nazi occupation.\n\nThe National Front\u2019s founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen \u2013 Marine\u2019s father \u2013 was an anti-Semite and a Holocaust denier. But since Marine took over leadership of the party, she has successfully softened its image, while still calling for stronger borders, fewer immigrants and a hard look at France\u2019s participation in the European Union.\n\nThose kind of anti-establishment positions have put her in the cross-hairs of her rivals, as well as most of the French mainstream media. France has a two-round system for choosing its president, and Le Pen has consistently been among the top two in national polls. The first round of voting takes place April 23.\n\nHer top rival, Emmanuel Macron of the moderate En Marche Party, quickly used Le Pen\u2019s heritage to attack her, saying, \u201cYou repeat the lies that you heard from your father\u2019s mouth.\u201d\n\nLe Pen\u2019s reference to the Holocaust, which appears to have been off-hand and not pre-planned, may have been inopportune two weeks before a crucial election where polls have her doing well. She may well lose whatever support from French Jews that she ever had. And the newspapers who delight in pillorying her will have a week or so of easy target practice.\n\nBut what they, and the French political establishment are forgetting, is this: not many Frenchmen living right now were born during World War II. And the youngest French voters \u2013 in their late teens and 20s \u2013 have no connection to the Holocaust except what they have read or been told. Certainly they do not feel personal responsibility for a round-up of French Jews that took place 75 years ago.\n\nIt is those young voters who will be most affected by the direction France takes in these elections. The youth unemployment rate in France is 23 percent, more than double the national average. While that is not directly attributable to immigrants taking away jobs from Frenchmen, Le Pen\u2019s call to Put France First (sound like she\u2019s Trumpeting someone?) appeals to youths who are don\u2019t believe in the tired, corrupt French political establishment.\n\nLe Pen\u2019s inelegant remarks about French participation in the Holocaust stirred up the usual outrage among her foes. But in seeking to put history in the past \u2013 which is, after all, definition of history \u2013 Le Pen may be trying to send a message to younger voters who were not alive for those tragic events, and feel no inherited sense of guilt.\n\nJohn Moody is Executive Vice President, Executive Editor for Fox News.

It comes as President Donald Trump seeks to expand detention capacity in a drive to deport more people.\n\nThe numbers obtained by the group don't provide details on individual cases or a full accounting of how the complaints were addressed, but they suggest complaints are common.\n\nHomeland Security inspector general's office disclosed that it received 1,016 complaints from detainees reporting sexual abuse or assault from May 2014 to July 2016. More than 90 percent involved Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an agency within Homeland Security that has more than 30,000 beds at detention facilities nationwide.\n\nThe inspector general received more than 33,000 allegations of a broader range of abuses from January 2010 to July 2016, including 702 for coerced sexual contact, 714 for physical or sexual abuse and 589 for sexual harassment, according to the group. The group's analysis showed the inspector general investigated 247, or less than 1 percent. But it was unclear how many others were taken up by agencies in the department, such as Immigration and Customs and Enforcement or Customs and Border Protection.\n\nThe group cited the numbers in a complaint to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly that urges changes in how allegations are handled. Gillian Christensen, a Homeland Security spokeswoman, said the department would review the complaint \"to determine if further action or recommendations are warranted.\"\n\nChristensen noted the allegations represent a small number of the more than 2 million admissions to Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities in the six-year period covered in the report. She said the agency has a \"zero tolerance policy\" and listed steps it has taken to address sexual abuse of detainees, including a directive to employees on prevention and intervention.\n\n\"While ICE's goal is to prevent all sexual abuse among its custody population, given the volume of individuals who annually pass through its detention system, the agency believes the overall incidence of such activity is very low,\" she said.\n\nThe inspector general's office generally focuses on allegations of employee misconduct and often refers complaints of detainee abuse to Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Office of Professional Responsibility to follow up, Christensen said.\n\nCommunity Initiatives for Visiting Immigrants in Confinement said it independently documented 27 alleged instances of sexual abuse. Most haven't filed grievances because they fear retaliation.\n\nDouglas Menjivar was allegedly raped by another detainee in the presence of four witnesses at the Joe Corley Detention Center in Conroe, Texas, in September 2013. The group says an official told him that he was stupid to let it happen and that the facility didn't document Menjivar's claim or provide medical or psychological care. Menjivar reported the incident to a doctor in November 2014, and after being interviewed twice, authorities told him that his allegations were unsubstantiated.\n\nThe group also published figures, obtained from a records request by Human Rights Watch, that show private companies contracted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement had the most hotline complaints of sexual and physical assault from Oct. 1, 2012 to March 14, 2016, as opposed to centers managed by the agency.

Cohn, a life-long Democrat and latecomer to the Trump train, is White House Economic Council Director. The former president of Goldman Sachs is reportedly ascendant, while Steve Bannon, Peter Navarro and Stephen Miller see their stars fading. This is not good news for Trump supporters, or for the GOP.\n\nDonald Trump was elected by angry Americans: people furious at Obama\u2019s progressive agenda, incensed that China was stealing our jobs and disgusted by milquetoast Republicans who had not delivered on campaign promises to ditch Obamacare, curb illegal immigration and spur faster economic growth. Trump voters were fed up with Obama\u2019s global ambitions and celebrated his America First message.\n\nHis backers didn\u2019t care that Trump knew little about policy or Washington; he was in a sense an empty vessel when it came to translating common sense ideas into legislation and regulations. Now, though, they see that vessel being filled in part by individuals who do not share their views. One of those is Gary Cohn, who has emerged as a powerful but discordant voice.\n\nDemocrats and the mainstream media have rejoiced as they have watched Cohn, along with Jared Kuschner, his wife Ivanka Trump and former Goldman Sachs partner Dina Powell, soften White House policy on issues such as cutting regulations, immigration enforcement and Obamacare repeal.\n\nWhen Gary Cohn recently lofted the possibility of bringing back Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era law that allowed big banks to engage in investment banking, Senator Elizabeth Warren was reportedly giddy with joy. The law, which was repealed by Bill Clinton in 1999, is viewed by progressives as having helped cause the financial crisis. Leaving a meeting in which Cohn mused about reinstating the bill, Warren reportedly said to an aide, \u201cHas the whole world gone mad? Am I on the same page as a former Goldman executive? My entire worldview has been shattered.\u201d\n\nHer confusion is understandable. Not that long ago, Cohn joined Trump in ardently pressing to dismantle the cumbersome bank regulations contained in Dodd-Frank. So upset was Warren over Cohn\u2019s determination to knock down those rules, which are loathed by Wall Street, that she and fellow senator Tammy Baldwin wrote a letter to Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein demanding proof that he and his former colleague were not in cahoots.\n\nIt is worth noting that while reinstituting Glass-Steagall would be problematic for all the leading financial institutions, it would hurt Goldman much less that the big banks who are its major competitors.\n\nCohn\u2019s former political affiliation and past support of President Obama is not important. What is important is how his liberal views could distort President Trump\u2019s agenda. For example, Cohn has taken a major role in crafting the White House\u2019s stance on tax reform. Recently, in searching for a revenue source needed to balance proposed cuts in tax rates, it was reported that Cohn suggested a carbon tax. (He has since denied advocating that approach.) The idea was quickly shot down, but its very consideration was alarming. Trump campaigned on dismantling Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan, has proposed sharp cuts in the budget of the EPA and wants to resuscitate our coal industry. How does a carbon tax fit into that program?\n\nCohn is also reportedly a free-trade advocate, and has appointed Andrew Quinn to the Economic Council as Special Assistant to the President for International Trade. Quinn was one of the lead negotiators of the multi-national TPP trade pact that Trump savaged on the campaign trail and has since junked. How will Quinn work to revise our trade commitments and revise NAFTA?\n\nFor the most part, Cohn\u2019s hires for the National Economic Council have been right-leaning and likely to support President Trump\u2019s campaign pledges. Kenneth Juster, for instance, tapped to be head of international affairs, served under both G.W. Bush and his father, and is a strong advocate for boosting exports.\n\nIt is also true that there are other sound voices on economic policy within the administration. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is nobody\u2019s fool, and will support an aggressive U.S. trade posture. Though conservatives have reservations about Steve Mnuchin, they applaud some of his picks, like economist David Malpass for international affairs and Drew Maloney for legislative. Mnuchin\u2019s choice of major Hillary fundraiser Craig Phillips to oversee financial regulation, is less popular.\n\nStill, access to the president, enjoyed by Cohn and others on the White House staff, is critical. Cohn is known as a big, forceful straight talker. He is also successful \u2013 the kind of individual that Trump instinctively trusts. One of his former Goldman colleagues describes him as a \u201ctough operator,\u201d who would be comfortable and probably victorious engaging in the kinds of turf battles rumored to be underway in the White House.\n\nIt is early days, but ongoing power struggles could well determine the success of the Trump presidency. He needs to remember who put him in office, and who he will rely on to keep him there. It wasn\u2019t Manhattan elites or Democrats, it was people who are counting on him to cut taxes, bring back jobs, dismantle our stifling red tape, and rein in illegal immigration. A recent Quinnipiac poll showed Trump losing ground with exactly the people who elected him \u2013 Republicans, white voters and men. And guess what, he isn\u2019t making up for those losses with newly affectionate Democrats.\n\nLiz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

Yes, part of the story in the race between Republican state Treasurer Ron Estes and previously little-known Democrat James Thompson has to do with what Kansas political insiders say is an enthusiasm gap favoring Democrats.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, and Republicans are feeling logy after a few months with their party in control in Washington, Democrats, now suffering political plagues that would make even pharaoh wince, could find hope for an exodus from minority status.\n\nIf a seat that went Republican by 31 points last year is even remotely competitive, prudence demands taking a closer look.\n\nAs is often the case, though, the political press is probably over-interpreting. Estes is part of a Republican administration in Topeka that ranks in popularity in the Jayhawker State somewhere between wheat fungus and Mizzou athletics.\n\nKansas Republicans have been in a funk for most of Gov. Sam Brownback\u2019s tenure, including when his unpopularity seemed for a time to threaten the 2014 re-election of Sen. Pat Roberts.\n\nBrownback, who has seen approval ratings in the teens and low 20s, was reportedly in the running for a Trump appointment to a U.N. post in Rome. Kansas Republicans probably only wondered why it couldn\u2019t have been somewhere farther away.\n\nIf Estes, who Trump called \u201ca wonderful guy\u201d on Twitter today, loses, or wins in a nail-biter, it will be more about Brownback and less about Trump.\n\nBut just because reporters are over-interpreting today\u2019s vote doesn\u2019t mean that Republicans should ignore what\u2019s happening in Wichita.

It\u2019s easy to see why. Trump won in the district by less than 2 points and underperformed 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney by almost 13 points.\n\nThat election, which will likely set up a runoff vote between the top Republican and Democrat on June 20, is exactly the kind of test the Republicans fear could break their current coalition.\n\nNeedless to say, southern Kansas and suburban Atlanta don\u2019t share much in common politically or demographically. Having a party that can accommodate both kinds of voters is crucial to the GOP maintaining its new post-Trump fusion of conservatism and populism.\n\nFor Democrats, if they cannot make inroads in the leafy lanes of suburbia, their claim to threaten the Republican House majority in 2018 will look a little silly.\n\nHouse races are notoriously hard to poll so we are all groping in the dark a bit here, but in all of these special elections, leaders of both parties seem convinced that the ground may be shifting.\n\nRemember always that in politics, you are only as good as the other guys think you are.\n\nIf Trump can take his first wholly successful week in office and turn it into something good, Republicans will benefit.

The statement sends a small but potentially significant signal to insurers, encouraging them to stay in the market. The future of the payments has been in doubt because of a lawsuit filed in 2014 by House Republicans, who said the Obama administration was paying the subsidies illegally. Without the subsidies, insurance markets could quickly unravel. Even more insurers could withdraw from the public marketplaces where more than 10 million Americans obtained coverage last year. The Affordable Care Act requires insurers to reduce deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for certain low-income consumers.

This was after he sent a memo last week announcing the creation of task force groups to focus on violent crimes, sentencing policies, illegal immigration, human trafficking and more.\n\nNot on the list: white-collar crimes.\n\nWhite-collar prosecutions in the U.S. fall under a pretty big umbrella. Typically, they involve non-violent, financially motivated offenses that cover everything from insider trading to embezzlement to Ponzi schemes to identity theft.\n\nThe push to prosecute these crimes exploded during the Bush and Obama years. Public rage grew as millions of Americans were forced to foreclose on their homes while big banks and Wall Street fat-cats profited.\n\nSome white-collar defense experts predict prosecutions of securities law and other financial violations will now take a backseat as the DOJ refocuses its mission.\n\nAlan Dershowitz, a prominent defense attorney and Harvard Law School professor, predicts a \u201cmore conservative approach\u201d netting fewer prosecutions.\n\nBill Black, an associate professor of economics and law at the University of Missouri, predicted in a TV interview that white-collar crime would have a \"field day.\"\n\nWhile it's too early to track a pattern in prosecution stats, there are some signs the Trump administration is shifting its resources.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s fiscal 2018 budget proposal calls for cutting 4 percent of the Justice Department's budget. While it\u2019s not known exactly where that money would come from, Sessions\u2019 office reiterated to Fox News that \u201ccombatting violent crime and restoring public safety are top priorities.\u201d\n\n\"To help achieve those goals, the Department, with the help of our critical federal, state, and local law enforcement partners, will be focusing much of its efforts on thwarting violent crime, drug trafficking, gun crime and gang violence, and criminal immigration enforcement,\u201d the DOJ said in a written statement.\n\nWhen asked if white-collar crime prosecutions would be a lower priority, the DOJ said in a separate, subsequent statement that Sessions\u2019 focus on violent crime should not detract from that effort.\n\n\"The Attorney General has emphasized his commitment to prosecuting fraud and corruption, and that commitment will not be diminished by an enhanced focus on targeting violent criminals,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAs attorney general, Sessions has a great deal of discretion as to what cases are brought and where the department will focus its enforcement attention.\n\nAnother indication of the DOJ\u2019s shifting priorities was the very public firing of Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney who had made a name for himself as the \u201cSheriff of Wall Street.\u201d Bharara\u2019s team had aggressively gone after insider trading rings and market manipulators and had brought down Wall Street masterminds like Bernie Madoff and Raj Rajaratnam, former hedge fund manager and billionaire founder of the Galleon Group who received 11 years in prison -- the longest-ever sentence handed down for violating insider trading laws.\n\nDuring his tenure, Bharara obtained $14 billion on behalf of victims.\n\nIn the final few weeks of the Obama administration, more than $20 billion in corporate fines and penalties were doled out against big names like Deutsche Bank and Rolls-Royce.\n\nIt\u2019s up to the discretion of new presidents to replace U.S. attorneys, and Bharara was asked to submit his resignation along with almost every other U.S. attorney. Still, his situation drew added attention since Trump previously was thought to be keeping him on board, and Bharara refused to resign.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason I said I was not going to resign and be fired was because I want the record to reflect for all time that there was a deliberate decision, not just a bureaucratic sweeping away of what had been there in the past, but a specific decision to change one\u2019s mind and deliberately fire me, particularly given what my office\u2019s jurisdiction is and where my office is situated,\u201d Bharara said at The Cooper Union in New York City last week, alluding to the fact that both Wall Street and Trump Tower fell within his jurisdiction.\n\nOn the campaign trail last year, Trump vilified Wall Street and repeatedly linked Democratic rival Hillary Clinton to the multimillionaires at Goldman Sachs. But like many presidents before him, his Cabinet and inner circle advisers now count several Goldman alumni, including National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and chief strategist Steve Bannon.\n\nBut not everyone thinks Sessions will ease the pressure on white-collar criminals.\n\n\u201cCompanies and corporate executives should not expect any lessening of the enforcement attention\u201d under Sessions, said Scott Fredericksen, a former federal prosecutor and white-collar criminal defense partner at Foley & Lardner LLP.\n\nFredericksen believes the DOJ under Sessions has \u201can appreciation for the deterrent value of prosecuting white collar crime and a willingness to use prosecutions to send a message of compliance.\u201d\n\nSessions, who served as a Republican senator before being confirmed to his current post, has 16 years of experience as a prosecutor in Alabama at both the federal and state level under his belt.\n\nDuring a 2002 Judiciary Committee hearing, then- Sen. Sessions described himself as a tough prosecutor who prompted \u201ca lot better behavior in banking today.\u201d", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/11/sessions-seen-shifting-doj-focus-from-white-collar-to-violent-crimes.html"}, {"text": "Lost in the alt-left's extreme and ruthless opposition to President Trump is the fact that he's been very busy keeping his promises and checking off items on his agenda, one by one.\n\nPutting Judge Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court is just the latest fulfillment of a campaign promise. Here's what President Trump said during the ceremony in the Rose Garden.\n\n\u201cOver the past two months, the American people have gotten to know, respect and truly admire our newest member of the United States Supreme Court,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Justice Gorsuch, they see a man of great and unquestioned integrity. They see a man of unmatched qualifications. And most of all, and most importantly, they see a man who is deeply faithful to the Constitution of the United States.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump kept his word and put an originalist on the U.S. Supreme Court to replace Justice Antonin Scalia. What the mainstream media will not tell you and what Trump's enemies will never admit is that this is just one of the president\u2019s many accomplishments.\n\nPresident Trump is busy bringing back jobs, making phone calls to the CEOs of companies day and night. He's gutting Obama-era regulations, and the president has said he could eliminate up to 75 percent of government rules and regulations. The war on coal is over and the red tape from the Obama administration is gone.\n\nIllegal immigration has plummeted since Trump took the oath of office. The White House is fighting back against sanctuary cities by taking a tough stance against places that shield illegal immigrants.\n\nPresident Trump has drafted a plan to defeat ISIS. His administration has sanctioned Iran over its missile program and put the rogue regime on notice. Our commander-in-chief responded to Syria's use of chemical weapons by approving a Tomahawk missile strike.\n\nDomestically, President Trump created a task force to reduce crimes. He signed executive orders to protect police officers and to target drug cartels that poison our cities, suburbs and rural areas.\n\nWhile the president is enacting his agenda every day, there's still plenty of work do. Failing to repeal and replace ObamaCare was a big misstep. Republicans need to learn from that mistake and build consensus before introducing such an important bill. And while the health care bill is not dead, Republicans are moving ahead on a massive tax reform plan.\n\nThe Republican leadership needs to come together to pass the president's budget so we can reduce spending, shrink government, rebuild the military, and get all of these things done so Americans get back to work.\n\nWhile President Trump works to advance his agenda, the alt-left, propaganda, destroy-Trump media, breathlessly reports on infighting in the White House. Who knows whether or not the press has blown this out of proportion, like everything they cover. But the reality is that it's irrelevant. Whomever President Trump wants around him is his business. If you work for the president, your job is to put his agenda in place, serve him and serve the country.\n\nThere are many people and factions that want to see this president fail. Yet, he's right on the right track, and all he has to do to succeed to be popular and to win over votes in the coming elections is to keep his promises to the American people.\n\nAdapted from Sean Hannity\u2019s monologue on \u201cHannity,\u201d April 10, 2017\n\nSean Hannity currently serves as host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) Hannity (weekdays 10-11PM/ET).

People who never raised an eyebrow or their voice about Ebola or Isis or MS-13 are now concerned about this guy.\n\nLogic tells you this reaction can only be wrong. In the realm of emotional debate, nothing is ever as evil, or as great, as you want it to be. The truth is almost always situated in some realistic middle that\u2019s upsetting to a few and boring to many.\n\nThe idea that a businessman, an eager reality show host moving into his eighth decade, might actually be a madman ... Maybe that\u2019s plausible to a liberal, but only if you ignore some obvious facts.\n\nThis is a man who was born and bred in New York City, where even the conservatives are liberal.\n\nHis kids, despite the frenzied fishbowl they\u2019ve lived in, appear to be normal.\n\nThe assumption that he\u2019s anti-gay or hates minorities or women requires a logical disconnect \u2014 to make not just one leap of faith, but four or five concurrent leaps while juggling six balls of unequal weight.\n\nSo feel free to hate the guy. That\u2019s OK. The right did that with President Obama. It\u2019s a team sport thing. But it might be as false now as it was then.\n\nFor President Trump to fulfill your nightmares, you have to ignore an entire fabric of politically benign living.\n\nThe right didn\u2019t trust Obama because he lived a unexamined life of romanced, unchallenged progressivism. He was a card-carrying Leftist.\n\nTrump lived a public life of transparent opinion while navigating the most liberal, cosmopolitan city on earth \u2014 ever.\n\nThink about that when you\u2019re losing your crap. Trump was out in the open, for all to see. Unlike most.\n\nSo here I offer some soothing reasons why you don\u2019t have to worry \u2026 much. Fact is, libs, Trump is more like you than he is like me, or Mike Pence or Mike Huckabee or anyone who turns your ideological stomach. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. The Syrian strike reveals that Trump\u2019s response, even to ghastly attacks, is a firm \u201cjust enough.\u201d I compare it to smacking a dog\u2019s nose with a newspaper, or spanking an unruly child in aisle 3 of Walmart. It\u2019s not an act of war. It\u2019s an act of \u201cYo, we\u2019re back.\u201d It\u2019s a message that our diplomacy has more muscle than simply shrugging disapprovingly while checking Tinder. Hillary would do, and wanted to do, the same thing. You can damn Trump for changing his mind, but you would have damned him for doing the opposite.\n\nThere are two ways to explain the Syria strike. You can explain what happened: \u201cMissiles hit a facility.\u201d Or you can explain what it means: \u201cThis strike is exactly the perfunctory minimum we will perform to maintain a persona of resolute toughness without igniting an actual conflict with people we\u2019re perhaps on the same side with when fighting ISIS.\u201d That\u2019s all it is \u2014 the comfortable middle ground between the impotence of doing nothing and the hysteria of escalation. Yes, America, you elected a centrist.\n\n2. Pragmatism prevails, as was predicted by many who refuse to give in to apocalyptic notions about Trump. Even an oddball like me knew this: The guy is a non-ideological technocrat who is willing to shift gears to clobber the conspiratorial, transient opinions of his sweatiest ideological henchmen when hard facts enter the room. There are consequences: Principles of yore are obliterated by the bait-and-switch pragmatism that pulls leaders toward the center. But it happens in both parties, in every cycle.\n\nSide note to righties: if you find yourself deceived by Trump and stuck idling in a conservative cul de sac \u2014 that\u2019s your fault. New Yorkers always talk tough, then become \u201cflexible.\u201d But your naivet\u00e9 is sweet. It beats looking phony after deriding \u201csquishies\u201d and \u201ccucks\u201d or whatever self-appointed bouncers of the Right tweet between laundry runs \u2014 only to defend Trump\u2019s centrism later.\n\n3. Economic nationalism will also show itself out, as global deals and coalitions call for cooperation. The world\u2019s top dog, like it or not, should say \u201cme first.\u201d But \u201cme\u201d means the whole thirsty world gets a drink, because sooner or later, all bad things make their way to us, as all our good things make their way to them. You can\u2019t isolate yourself in a phone booth. Just make your home safer, and then invite friends in.\n\n4. Even perceptions of force are enough. Illegal crossings into our country have dropped dramatically, to a nearly two-decade low. Why is that? Perception. Trump is a metaphorical wall. My analogy: When the local bar fires the guy who used to give you free drinks and replaces him with a co-owner who has skin in the game, the freeloader finds a cheaper venue. People go elsewhere, without trying to get a freebie. Trump\u2019s the new bartender.\n\n5. Trump\u2019s white nationalist fanboys are deeply wounded. Yes, it\u2019s finally dawning on these geeks that daddy used them the way the Dems often used their radical minions. The freaks are merely tolerated until the real business gets done. White nationalists are essentially the Republican versions of Reverend Wright and Bill Ayers \u2014 kicked to the curb, where they belong. And their whining is proof that the guy they once liked has no use for them.\n\n6. Trump made it safer for honest people. This point is for liberal entertainers, who happen to be the whiniest, most panicky of the bunch. Trump, to his credit, redefined the literality of language and the context of public conversation. This is both off-putting and freeing. To make an omelet (killing PC culture), Trump broke a few eggs (jokes about Senator McCain, and so on). It wasn\u2019t pretty, but it was effective. And comedians should admit this to themselves, or they\u2019re false: Trump helps you.\n\nFor years, the left (the comedian\u2019s default political stance) inevitably devoured their own when it came to violations of sensitive speech. If you crossed the ever-changing line \u2014 as defined by humorless scolds running campus groups \u2014 you were damaged goods. Comedians admitted they avoid college campuses for this reason.\n\nBy turning the debates into a comedy roast, Trump\u2019s ripe ripostes, which would sink most politicians, elevated him.\n\nSarah Silverman can hate Trump all she wants, but he made her anxiety-ridden life easier. And not just by creating an endless fuzzy-navel fountain of material.\n\nHe allows everyone in a public square to be a little more dangerous, a little more free and, yes, more ugly.\n\nHe revived the First Amendment. You could hate the stuff he said, but he reminded you that saying it and hating it are compatible.\n\nComics should be genuflecting before him, rather than condemning him on Twitter, using the same callow tools that will likely be used on them in the future.\n\nIn American life, and in this ridiculously enduring republic, no one is as great or as bad as you wish them to be. And demonizing them only clouds your ability to reason.\n\nUltimately, you fail to engage in an argument when it matters. Yes, it happened with Obama \u2014 but now, my liberal friends, you\u2019re doing the same with Trump.\n\nLighten up. Give it time. He\u2019s more you than me.\n\nGreg Gutfeld currently serves as host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The Greg Gutfeld Show (Saturdays 10-11PM/ET) and co-host of The Five (weekdays 5-6PM/ET).

The tone of his comments at times echoed the explicit rhetoric President Trump himself used when discussing illegal immigration and cartels during the campaign.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about MS-13 and the cartels, what do we mean? We mean international criminal organizations that turn cities and suburbs into warzones, that rape and kill innocent civilians, and who profit by smuggling poison and other human beings across our borders,\u201d Sessions said.\n\n\u201c\u2026 It is here on this very sliver of land\u2014on this border\u2014that we take our stand. It is a direct threat to our legal system, peace and prosperity,\u201d he said.\n\nTimed with his visit, Sessions issued a memo to all U.S. attorneys asking federal prosecutors to renew focus on immigration enforcement. He asked them to focus on particular offenses that can help prevent and deter illegal immigration \u2013 and to each, designate a border security coordinator to oversee such efforts.\n\nSessions\u2019 visit comes amid new questions over the future of Trump\u2019s promised border wall. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has suggested the wall is not a \u201cleading priority,\u201d and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly told lawmakers last week that the administration would not build a wall from \u201csea to shining sea.\u201d\n\nBut Sessions stressed enforcement as he met border agents and toured the area known as the Tuscon Sector.\n\nThe Tuscon Sector, which covers most of Arizona, once was considered one of the most congested areas in illegal border crossings and drug smuggling. But in recent years, that reputation has shifted to the Rio Grande Valley in Texas.\n\nLast year, the Arizona area saw about 65,000 arrests\u2014that\u2019s roughly half the number of arrests agents made in 2012, according to Border Patrol data. Marijuana arrests also have dropped in the area by about 28 percent, from 1 million pounds in 2012 to 728,000 last year.\n\n\u201cWe hear you, and we have your back,\u201d Sessions said Tuesday. \u201cWe will secure this border and bring the full weight of both the immigration courts and federal criminal enforcement to combat this attack on our national security and sovereignty.\u201d\n\nSessions cited an \u201cunprecedented\u201d 40 percent drop in illegal crossings in January and February of this year \u2013 adding that March had the lowest monthly figure for \u201cat least 17 years.\u201d\n\nIn his memo, Sessions added that U.S. attorneys should make the prosecution of assault on a federal law enforcement officer a \u201ctop priority.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf someone dares to assault one of our folks in the line of duty, they will do federal time for it,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nSessions also announced that the department would add 50 immigration judges to the bench this year, and an additional 75 judges in 2018.\n\n\"The catch and release policies of the past are over,\" he said.\n\nFox News' Matthew Dean contributed to this report.\n\nBrooke Singman is a Reporter for Fox News.

Trump is tweeting again.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea is looking for trouble,\u201d he warned Tuesday morning. He also devoted some of his 140 characters to tell China that the USA would take care of business, with or without them.\n\nDoes this tweet mean the president is planning to start World War III? Not likely. When it comes to dealing with the North Korean threat, President Trump is far more likely to pick up where President Obama left off.\n\nTrump has reportedly asked for\u2014and received\u2014a review of the full range of options for dealing with the growing nuclear threat from Pyongyang and the increasingly bellicose Kim Jong Un. That\u2019s the right approach, and there\u2019s nothing novel about it.\n\nU.S. policy has long been \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d\u2014the only practical policy when dealing with a regime that threatens to burn your cities to the ground. Circumstances may change, moving matters from the \u201cbe prepared for anything\u201d stage to \u201cdrastic, decisive action is called for now? But that day is not today.\n\nWhen the president reviews all the options, the first to drop-off the list is an escalatory military conflict. Most of Seoul, a city of 10 million, is within range of North Korea\u2019s \u201ccone of fire.\u201d An artillery and missile barrage from the North could be devastating. No president would choose, as Option One, a strike that would invite a response that could inflict mass civilian casualties among an ally.\n\nLikewise, the \u201clet\u2019s negotiate\u201d option was probably quickly dropped. Giving into North Korea\u2019s wild threats is exactly what Kim wants. Rushing to talk now would only encourage more provocative actions.\n\nThat leaves the suitable and feasible options somewhere in the middle. This includes deterring North Korea with a protect-and-defend strategy. That involves showing our willingness to protect South Korea with missile defenses like THADD and U.S. ground troops, while demonstrating the capacity to reach out and touch the North Korean regime. The latter element is why we now have U.S. strategic bombers circling overhead and U.S. combat ships steaming to the peninsula.\n\nThe other part of pressing Kim to back down is to squeeze the regime where it hurts\u2014in the bank account. North Korea Despite what you may have heard, North Korea is not the most heavily sanctioned country on earth.\n\nYes, a lot of sanctions have been imposed on the regime, as far as paperwork is concerned. But as Heritage Foundation analyst and regional expert Bruce Klingner has frequently noted, those sanctions are not fully and forcefully enforced. China, for example, routinely signs on to new sanctions, then just as routinely stops observing them within a few months.\n\nBut cracking down on North Korea is a strategy that has given Dear Leaders pause in the past. Exasperated after trying everything else, even the Obama administration concluded in the end that\u2019s increasingly tighter sanctions are part of the best strategy for now.\n\nSo, going back to the tweet, when Trump says we are going to deal with Kim with or without China, likely what he means is that Beijing can voluntarily agree to participate in the sanctioning regime or we\u2019ll do it with a heavy hand\u2014one that will include Chinese firms and individuals doing business with North Korea.\n\nThat would make the Chinese very uncomfortable, but Trump seems to be saying, it\u2019ll happen unless they start working harder to get Kim to tone down his act\u2014and his actions. In other words, the free lunch for China is over.\n\nThere are no easy answers for dealing with North Korean. There is a sensible package of isolation and defensive measures that can make U.S. policy make sense.\n\nWhat Trump ought to do\u2014and is most likely to do\u2014is follow this tough-minded but responsible middle course.\n\nJames Jay Carafano is vice president of foreign and defense policy studies The Heritage Foundation.

The official, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly on intelligence matters and demanded anonymity, didn't offer concrete proof and others in the Trump administration cautioned that no final determination of Russia's foreknowledge had been made.\n\n\"We cannot let this happen again,\" Tillerson said of the chemical attack.\n\n\"We want to relieve the suffering of the Syrian people. Russia can be a part of that future and play an important role,\" Tillerson added in remarks to reporters. \"Or Russia can maintain its alliance\" with Syria and Iran.\n\nRussia's foreign ministry said in a statement that it hoped for \"productive talks.\" It said the outcome of the discussions is important not only for the U.S.-Russian relationship, but \"for the overall atmosphere on the world stage.\"\n\nSYRIA CRISIS: BARREL BOMBS DROPPED BY GOVERNMENT, ACTIVISTS SAY\n\nThe United States has sought to minimize expectations for the trip or the likelihood that the U.S. will leave with any Russian concessions on Syria.

Regardless of how President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions feel about the topic\u2014 and both have been skeptical of reforming this system -- the new report should inform the attorney general\u2019s newly announced Task Force on Crime Reduction and Public Safety and prompt congressional leaders to take a closer look.\n\nAccording to the OIG report, the Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigations, and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms grab the assets of thousands of people annually, and there is big money involved.\n\nThe DEA alone has made more than 80,000 cash seizures resulting in forfeitures that totaled more than $4 billion over the last decade. The overall total for the Justice Department seizure program has grown over the same period to more than $28 billion.\n\nFair enough, perhaps. But we can\u2019t tell. Of the agency-seized cash, 77 percent was forfeited administratively as opposed to civilly or criminally. This means no review by any independent court: the government agencies are policing themselves.\n\nIndeed, this is the normal practice for the Justice Department. Its policy manual on the topic specifies that administrative proceedings must be used except when the government is taking a home or other building or more than $500,000 in assets.\n\nIndividuals whose property is seized can still challenge the administrative forfeiture in court. But obviously, it can be difficult for an individual to hire lawyers to pursue a case when the government has his money.\n\nMoreover, in civil court the government doesn\u2019t need to prove that a crime was committed under the \u201creasonable doubt\u201d standard of a criminal case. Instead, the government merely must show a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d -- just a little bit more likely than the odds that a coin flip comes up heads.\n\nAt least as striking is what the OIG report doesn\u2019t find. The federal government, it seems, has essentially no mechanisms to evaluate the effectiveness of its asset forfeiture efforts.\n\nIt does not, for example, actively evaluate instances of successful legal challenges to seizure operations, which would give overall sense of how often seizures are found to be unjustified.\n\nThe OIG report also found that agencies do not collect data to measure \u201chow often seizures and forfeitures advance or relate to criminal investigations.\u201d\n\nTo fill that vacuum, the OIG sampled 100 allegedly drug-related interdiction cases in which the DEA had seized assets without a warrant and without seizing any illicit narcotics.\n\nThe investigation found that in most of the cases law-enforcement officers relied on their \u201cimmediate, on-the-spot judgment,\u201d without any \u201cpredicating information regarding involvement in drug trafficking activities.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the DEA could verify only 44 of the 100 seizures as having \u201cadvanced or having been related to criminal investigations.\u201d\n\nFinally, the investigation found that \u201cdifferent task force officers made different decisions in similar situations when deciding whether to seize all of the cash discovered.\u201d\n\nEven if we assume that law enforcement officers have been acting in good faith, the varying standards applied when government agencies seize people\u2019s money -- and the fact that most seizures did not appear to advance any criminal case -- has to erode the public\u2019s trust in law enforcement as an institution, which can compromise legitimate efforts to prevent and prosecute crime.\n\nThe lack of supervision also provides a perverse incentive for such seizures to increase.\n\nThe current practice may even be unconstitutional. In a March 6 written opinion commenting on a Supreme Court decision not to consider a challenge to a civil asset forfeiture, Justice Clarence Thomas argued that the Court should reassess \u201cwhether modern civil-forfeiture statutes can be squared with the Due Process Clause and our Nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nJustice Thomas\u2019s argument included evidence of \u201cegregious and well-chronicled abuses\u201d and noted, pointedly, that these \u201cforfeiture operations frequently target the poor and other groups least able to defend their interests in forfeiture proceedings.\u201d\n\nOf course, these groups are more likely to vote for Democrats, but the Republican Party\u2019s 2016 platform stated aggressively that civil asset forfeiture had become \u201ca tool for unscrupulous law enforcement officials, acting without due process, to profit by destroying the livelihood of innocent individuals, many of whom never recover the lawful assets taken from them.\u201d\n\nThe platform urged Congress \u201cto enact reforms to protect law-abiding citizens against abusive asset forfeiture tactics.\u201d\n\nThe question is whether President Trump and Attorney General Sessions agree.\n\nIn a January meeting with local law enforcement officials, the president suggested loosening Obama-era constraints on forfeiture, which a Kentucky sheriff argued were constraining local budgets that \u201cshare\u201d in seizures taken by the feds.\n\nTrump\u2019s view echoes that previously espoused by Attorney General Sessions, who in the Senate defended modern civil-asset forfeiture practice, saying that 95% of the individuals affected \u201chave done nothing in their lives but sell dope.\u201d\n\nSuch sentiments are understandable because law-and-order Republicans tend to like the police departments that profit from the assets seized. But there\u2019s nothing Republican about allowing the government to take individuals\u2019 property without due process of law.\n\nAnd the same principles underlying drug-enforcement seizures also apply to other areas of the government--including the IRS.\n\nIn fact, the IRS Office of the Inspector General released its own report on April 4 that examined the tax agency\u2019s practice of civil asset seizure in \u201cstructuring\u201d cases\u2014those involving repeated large cash withdrawals, which are commonplace for many small businesses and farms. The report found that 91% of such seizures were taken from businesses and individuals that had obtained the money legally.\n\nIn an April 5 memorandum, the attorney general asked his Public Safety Task Force to \u201cexplore\u201d the government\u2019s \u201cuse of asset forfeiture.\u201d Let\u2019s hope the task force does that with a critical eye\u2014and that, regardless, Republicans in Congress take this cause to heart and work across the aisle with their Democratic colleagues for long overdue reforms in this area.\n\nThis should be a truly bipartisan issue.\n\nJames R.

In 2013, Putin personally awarded Tillerson the Order of Friendship- which is a top state award in the country, Reuters reported.\n\nA Russian spokesman did not indicate why the two will not meet.\n\nTillerson is emerging from the shadows with a leading public role in shaping and explaining the Trump administration\u2019s missile strikes in Syria. And, he\u2019s set for an even higher-profile mission, heading to Moscow under the twin clouds of Russia\u2019s U.S. election meddling and its possible support for a Syrian chemical weapons attack.\n\nSUSAN RICE'S CLAIM ON SYRIA GETS FOUR PINOCCHIOS\n\nTillerson was visible during last week\u2019s announcement of the response to the gruesome chemical attack, fielding questions from reporters on and off camera, and then captured in an official White House photo seated next to President Trump as they heard the result of the 59 cruise missiles that struck a Syrian military base.\n\nTillerson was a prominent fixture during the most important foreign policy period in Trump\u2019s young presidency: a two-day summit with Chinese President Xi that coincided with the strikes against Syria. He was by Trump\u2019s side during his meetings with Xi and spoke publicly multiple times to address both issues.\n\nIt was Tillerson who delivered the Trump administration\u2019s first blistering condemnation of Russia in the hours after the strikes. Standing in a cramped conference room alongside national security adviser H.R. McMaster, Tillerson said Moscow had \u201cfailed\u201d to live up to its obligations under a 2013 agreement to strip Syria of its chemical weapons stockpiles. \u201cEither Russia has been complicit or Russia has simply been incompetent in its ability to deliver on its end of that agreement,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Sunday, he made his first network television interview appearances. In one interview, Tillerson said he sees no reason for retaliation from Russia for the U.S. missile strikes. Russia maintains a close political and military alliance with President Bashar Assad\u2019s government and has been accused of supporting its attacks against Syrians opposed to Assad\u2019s rule \u2014 something Moscow adamantly denies.\n\nTillerson said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that Russians were not targeted by the strikes. He also said the top U.S. priority in the region hadn\u2019t changed and remained the defeat of Islamic State militants.\n\nThen he headed to Europe to gather with the foreign ministers of the other major industrialized nations before venturing on eastward to become the first Trump Cabinet member to visit Moscow \u2014 and possibly meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe criticism from the foreign policy establishment\u2019s left and right that has dogged Tillerson\u2019s tenure is dying down.\n\nTillerson had faced questions about whether he understood that his new position meant he was now the face of the United States to the world, that he had to answer no longer to a small group of top shareholders but to more than 320 million Americans.\n\nThe secretary of state must be \u201cthe spokesman for American foreign policy,\u201d said Eliot Cohen, a senior State Department official during George W. Bush\u2019s presidency. \u201cThis is the administration\u2019s first crisis but it won\u2019t be their last by a long shot, so he\u2019s going to have to get used to this.\u201d\n\nJoining Trump at the president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, Tillerson was supposed to focus on the informal summit with Xi. Instead, he was thrust to the forefront after photos of the bodies piled in heaps in Idlib, Syria, dramatically altered the agenda.\n\nOnly a week earlier, Tillerson had alarmed U.S. allies by indicating the U.S. was no longer interested in pushing for Assad\u2019s removal from power.\n\nIn the hours leading up to Trump\u2019s decision to order the strikes, Tillerson was among the most forward-leaning of Trump\u2019s top aides in suggesting the U.S. would deliver an \u201cappropriate response.\u201d He challenged Russia publicly in a way Trump appeared scrupulously to avoid and said of Assad early Thursday: \u201cIt would seem that there would be no role for him to govern the Syrian people.\u201d\n\nAfter the cruise missiles crashed down in Syria, Tillerson was calm and commanding in a question-and-answer session with journalists.\n\nCohen, a conservative critic of Trump\u2019s foreign policy who has chided Tillerson for his reticence, said he saw Tillerson growing into the job. \u201cI suspect you\u2019ll see more of him as he grows more comfortable in dealing with the press and in his relationship with the president and the administration\u2019s national security team,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nBeyond Syria are disputes over Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region and support for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nAt the same time, Tillerson carries to Moscow the weight of FBI and congressional investigations into Russia\u2019s interference in last year\u2019s presidential election. The Trump campaign\u2019s possible ties to the presumed Russian meddlers are also under scrutiny.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be Tillerson\u2019s biggest test to date,\u201d said Julianne Smith, a National Security Council and Defense Department official under President Obama.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/11/tillerson-faces-biggest-challenge-yet-in-upcoming-meeting-with-russian-counterpart.html"}, {"text": "Gov.

Sheriff Ric Bradshaw says the county was expected to spend $250,000 during Trump's recent meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, the president's sixth trip to his Winter White House in the 12 weeks since his inauguration.\n\nCounty Commissioner Dave Kerner has suggested turning Mar-a-Lago into a special taxing district and imposing a levy on the resort to pay the president's security costs. Because Mar-a-Lago is incorporated as a club, it pays lower property taxes than hotels. It also gets a tax break because Trump surrendered development rights after he purchased the property from the estate of cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post for $10 million in 1985.\n\nThe 500 members pay $14,000 annually in dues. The initiation fee was recently doubled to $200,000.

No solution has been found for the 28 business owners at Lantana Airport, a small field for propeller planes about 6 miles (10 kilometers) from Mar-a-Lago. The Secret Service shutters it every time Trump visits Mar-a-Lago because agents believe the 350 flights it handles daily pose a security risk.\n\nMarian Smith, who owns a flight school, says she has lost almost $100,000 because of the closures. A banner-towing company that operates from the airport says it has lost over $40,000 in contracts.\n\nJonathan Miller, the contractor who operates the county-owned airport, said this week that he believes a compromise will be worked out with the Secret Service, the Federal Aviation Administration and other agencies that would allow the airport to operate with restrictions during presidential visits.\n\n\"The FAA has a strong incentive to work with us and help get some funding that will put a system in place that will appease the Secret Service,\" Miller said.\n\nThe cost of Trump's visits divides local residents, with the schism often falling along political lines.

In both cases the military was left underfunded, under strength and undercapitalized so the incoming president had to advocate for a substantial military build-up.\n\nIn President Reagan's case the Libyan dictator, Qaddafi, had declared the Gulf of Sidra Libyan territory and had termed the line of entrance into the gulf as \"the line of death.\"\n\nLibyan fighters had fired on an American reconnaissance plane in1980 but President Carter had not responded to the challenge.\n\nPresident Reagan wanted a low-cost way of showing that America was a tougher, more aggressive country. He asked the Navy what would happen if we deliberately crossed the \"line of death\" and the Libyans challenged us. The Navy assured him that they could handle the obsolete Libyan equipment with minimal risk. As a result, President Reagan authorized a large battle group including two nuclear powered carriers.\n\nOn August 19, 1981 two United States Navy F-14s shot down two Libyan aircraft for no losses.\n\nAs a sign of the new calm, steady American approach President Reagan told the press,\n\n\u201cIf our planes were shot down, yes, they'd wake me up right away. If the other fellows were shot down, why wake me up?\u201d\n\nIn one decisive understated fight President Reagan sent the Kremlin a signal that a new, tougher, and more risk taking American government was now prepared to challenge their efforts to control the world.\n\nIn commemoration of this decisive turning point there is an F-14 on display at the Reagan Presidential Library.\n\nAs an initial military action, there is a real similarity between the Reagan approach and what President Trump ordered on Thursday.\n\nThe Syrian dictatorship had clearly broken every agreement about chemical warfare and was using a vicious chemical weapon against civilians \u2013 including women and children.\n\nIn using these chemical weapons the Syrian military was violating a United Nations resolution and making a mockery of Russian assurances that the dictator Assad would refrain from using his chemical stockpiles.\n\nPresident Trump had criticized his predecessor, President Obama, for setting red lines in Syria and then doing nothing. He had also criticized plans to put military forces on the ground to occupy the country.\n\nThe president had three choices. He could say a few noble words but do nothing in the Carter-Obama tradition. He could launch a major American ground campaign to replace Assad even if it meant confronting the Russians and the Iranians. Or he could use American technological strengths to launch a limited but very violent attack against a specific target, in this case the airfield from which the chemical weapons had come.\n\nMuch like President Reagan, President Trump chose a high-result, low-risk strategy. The United States hit the airfield with enough missiles that a powerful message was sent to Syria and the world. The United States is back in the business of leading from the front.\n\nThe way the Trump Administration dealt with the Russians was a good example of this new leadership. Putin was not consulted. The Russian military were warned through military channels of what we were doing and in effect were told to stay out of the way.\n\nThe fact is the United States is so much stronger than Russia that we can project power in a way they can't stop. President Trump's superb national security team knows how to apply military power and they showed it. This action took less than 48 hours to plan and it was powerful.\n\nThree other points about President Trump's response.\n\nFirst, he had just met this week with President al-Sisi of Egypt and King Abdullah of Jordan. He clearly had their advice on how to deal with Assad.\n\nSecond, he was in the middle of dinner with the Chinese Premier and stepped out to speak to the country about the missile attack in Syria. If the Chinese wanted a vivid demonstration of the change in American toughness they could hardly have had a more timely visit.\n\nThird, the President's talk with the American people (and in fact with the world) was very emotional and very revealing. It is worth reading in its entirety.\n\nI want to emphasize two parts of the talk.\n\nFirst, President Trump grew very emotional when he reported \"Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad launched a horrible chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians. Using a deadly nerve agent, Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women, and children. It was a slow and brutal death for so many. Even beautiful babies were cruelly murdered in this very barbaric attack. No child of God should ever suffer such horror.\u201d\n\nThe emotion as he talked about \"beautiful babies\" is a real reminder of how much the President loves children and especially babies. You can see it in how he treats his own children, but it really came through in his remarks.\n\nFinally, for the first time I can remember an American President said \"God bless America and the entire world.\"\n\nThe president so many had feared was an isolationist has proven he will represent America first \u2013 but will also care for those in harm\u2019s way around the world.

But the decisions are significant because it raises the possibility of Texas being stripped of the right to unilaterally change its election laws without federal approval. Forcing Texas to once again seek federal permission -- known as \"preclearance\" -- has been a goal of Democrats and minority rights groups since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the requirement in 2013.\n\n\n\nThe latest voter ID ruling by U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos of Corpus Christi comes more than two years after she likened the ballot-box rules in Texas, known as SB 14, to a \"poll tax\" meant to suppress minority voters. On Monday, she reaffirmed that conclusion after an appeals court asked her to go back and re-examine her findings.\n\n\n\nThe Texas law requires voters to show one of seven forms of identification at the ballot box. That list includes concealed handgun licenses -- but not college student IDs -- and Texas was forced under court order last year to weaken the law for the November elections.\n\n\n\n\"Proponents touted SB 14 as a remedy for voter fraud, consistent with efforts of other states.

Greg Abbott could sign later this year.\n\nTexas election officials, however, have acknowledged that hundreds of people were allowed to bypass the state's toughest-in-the-nation voter ID law and improperly cast ballots in the November presidential election by signing a sworn statement instead of showing a photo ID.

But he\u2019s a quick learner and one of the most brilliant businessmen in world history. At one point a quarter of a century ago, Trump was billions of dollars in debt to the biggest banks in the world. For all intents and purposes Trump was bankrupt and finished.\n\nThe arrogant bankers thought they had him right where they wanted him. But Trump defeated the banks -- and pulled a rabbit out of a hat. He came back from death\u2019s door. Today he is worth an estimated $4 billion plus -- with almost no debt. Houdini couldn\u2019t have pulled off a better trick.\n\n\u201cThe Celebrity Apprentice\u201d knows how to win a tough reality competition. The D.C. liberal politicians are making the same mistake -- writing Trump off prematurely. The difference this time is\u2026\n\nBankers are a thousand times smarter than career Washington politicians.\n\nThe politicians in Washington are \u201cthe Biggest Losers.\u201d They have no idea what they\u2019re up against. They are so hysterical over President Trump that they\u2019ve convinced themselves that they\u2019re winning. Only days ago a leading Democrat said Trump is already a \u201clame duck president.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll bet the bankers thought that, too.\n\nMeanwhile Trump is quietly going about destroying liberals and liberal policies. It\u2019s happening every single day and the liberal politicians and biased-liberal mainstream media are too blind, deaf, and mostly dumb to notice.\n\nIn only the last week, while liberals sat around gloating over the \u201cfailure\u201d of the ObamaCare repeal\u2026Trump changed the direction of America. Trump is busy erasing Obama like he never existed.\n\nAnd wait, ObamaCare\u2019s repeal is coming too. What happened to TrumpCare was a short-term blip. Trump is relentless. I should know. I wrote the national bestseller \u201cThe Power of RELENTLESS.\u201d Trump is the poster boy for relentless. More on that in a minute.\n\nFirst let\u2019s review what Trump has accomplished in only a week.\n\n-- Trump approved the Keystone Pipeline that Obama fought against for eight long years, then killed outright. Like Freddie Krueger in \u201cNightmare on Elm Street\u201d Keystone is back from the dead.\n\n-- Trump rolled back Obama\u2019s entire climate change agenda and killed the war on coal. Coal was dead, and now it\u2019s not.\n\nLike I said, Trump is erasing Obama like he was never there.\n\n- Trump and AG Jeff Sessions announced the defunding of Sanctuary Cities. Finally, we have a president who believes in the rule of law. Finally, we have a president who believes in the U.S. Constitution. Finally, we have a president who takes action. Finally, we have a president who follows through on his campaign promises. Trump really will cut off funding to cities that protect illegal aliens and refuse to obey the laws of the land.\n\nIt\u2019s a new country, folks. Call it \u201cTrumpland.\u201d\n\n- Trump forced an Israel-hater at the United Nations who authored a report calling Israel an \u201capartheid state\u201d to resign. Obama would have given her an award. Trump said \"YOU'RE FIRED.\"\n\n- Trump signed legislation killing BLM (Bureau of Land Management -- where all the liberal big government control freaks live) rules for federal government control of over 40 million acres of federal lands. Trump has the back of ranchers, farmers, property owners. The power is back in the hands of the states, not Gestapo-like agents of the federal government.\n\n- Trump put his son-in-law Jared Kushner in charge of a SWAT team of business executives with the job of streamlining government, overhauling the federal bureaucracy and killing regulations that hinder business.\n\n- Trump signed two new Executive Orders on trade policy leveling the playing field for American workers. Trump just did something no other politician has ever done -- he did exactly what he promised on the campaign trail.\n\n- Don\u2019t look now, but Trump is taking bids on the building of \u201cTHE WALL.\u201d Liberals believed Trump's wall was just a slick campaign slogan. It\u2019s really happening. Over 500 companies have signed up to make bids to build the infamous wall -- and over a dozen are Hispanic-owned.\n\n- And then Trump shocked the world by directing a missile attack on Syria's air bases after Syria used chemical weapons on their own people. Trump drew the line in the sand that Obama never did in eight years. Trump punished the bad guys and sent a powerful message to China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. \"There is a new sheriff in town. Don't mess with America!\"\n\n- Finally, my educated guess is Trump is also creating Executive Orders right now, behind the scenes, that slowly starve and strangle ObamaCare without any Congressional vote. Wanna bet?\n\nBut in the end, it won't matter. Because I\u2019m betting President Trump will convince Congress to pass the ObamaCare repeal\u2026soon. Trump didn\u2019t lose that battle. Liberals celebrated way too soon.\n\nBusinessmen like Trump never fail. They just learn from an initial failure, pick themselves back up and figure out how to win the battle.\n\nSmart businessmen are relentless. They run circles around politicians.\n\nTrump\u2019s political opposition in Congress is made up of a bunch of clueless career politicians. They have no balls. They've never risked a dime of their own money. They play only with OPM (other people's money). They have no idea how to play a game of \"chicken\" against Trump, a man who has risked billions of his own money. Trump will eat them for breakfast.\n\nObamaCare is as good as dead. Liberals just don\u2019t know it yet.\n\nAnd Trump will be one step closer to erasing Obama's legacy like he never existed.\n\nWith President Trump in charge, politics is like the greatest show on earth.

The arrangement will call for Nigeria to purchase up to 12 Embraer A-29 Super Tucano aircraft with sophisticated targeting gear for nearly $600 million, one of the officials said.\n\nThe officials were not authorized to discuss the terms of the sale publicly and requested anonymity to speak about internal diplomatic conversations.\n\nThough President Donald Trump has made clear his intention to approve the sale of the aircraft, the National Security Council is still working on the issue. Military sales to several other countries are also expected to be approved but are caught up in an ongoing White House review. Nigeria has been trying to buy the aircraft since 2015.\n\nThe Nigerian air force has been accused of bombing civilian targets at least three times in recent years. In the worst incident, a fighter jet on Jan. 17 repeatedly bombed a camp at Rann, near the border with Cameroon, where civilians had fled from Boko Haram. Between 100 and 236 civilians and aid workers were killed, according to official and community leaders' counts.\n\nThat bombing occurred on the same day the Obama administration intended to officially notify Congress the sale would go forward. Instead, it was abruptly put on hold, according to an individual who worked on the issue during Obama's presidency. Days later, Trump was inaugurated.\n\nSen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said this past week that he supported the A-29 deal to Nigeria as well as the sale of U.S.-made fighter jets to Bahrain that had been stripped of human rights caveats imposed by the Obama administration.\n\nUnder Obama, the U.S. said Bahrain failed to make promised political and human rights reforms after its Sunni-ruled government crushed Arab Spring protests five years ago.\n\n\"We need to deal with human rights issues, but not on weapons sales,\" Corker said.\n\nThe State Department said in a 2016 report that the Nigerian government has taken \"few steps to investigate or prosecute officials who committed violations, whether in the security forces or elsewhere in the government, and impunity remained widespread at all levels of government.\"\n\nAmnesty International has accused Nigeria's military of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the extrajudicial killings of an estimated 8,000 Boko Haram suspects. President Muhammadu Buhari promised to investigate the alleged abuses after he won office in March 2015, but no soldier has been prosecuted and thousands of people remain in illegal military detention. Nigeria's military has denied the allegations.\n\nThe A-29 sale would improve the U.S. relationship with Nigeria, Africa's largest consumer market of 170 million people, the continent's biggest economy and its second-largest oil producer. Nigeria also is strategically located on the edge of the Sahel, the largely lawless semi-desert region bridging north and sub-Saharan Africa where experts warn Islamic extremists like the Nigeria-based Boko Haram may expand their reach.\n\nThe aircraft deal also would satisfy Trump's priorities to support nations fighting Islamic uprisings, boost U.S. manufacturing and create high-wage jobs at home. The A-29 aircraft, which allow pilots to pinpoint targets at night, are assembled in Jacksonville, Florida.\n\n\"It's hard to argue that any country in Africa is more important than Nigeria for the geopolitical and other strategic interests of the U.S.,\" said J. Peter Pham, vice president of the Atlantic Council in Washington and head of its Africa Center.\n\nOnce Congress is officially notified of the sale, lawmakers who want to derail it have 30 days to pass veto-proof legislation. That's a high hurdle given Corker's support. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Armed Services Committee, also said he backs the sale.\n\n\"We've really got to try to do what we can to contain them,\" McCain said of Boko Haram.\n\nIn Trump's first phone call with Buhari in February, he \"assured the Nigerian president of U.S. readiness to cut a new deal in helping Nigeria in terms of military weapons to combat terrorism,\" according to Buhari's office.\n\nA Feb. 15 White House statement that provided a summary of the call said \"President Trump expressed support for the sale of aircraft from the United States to support Nigeria's fight against Boko Haram.\"\n\nSen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said in mid-February he was \"leery\" of the sale because of the Nigerian military's impunity. Cardin said this week he's not trying to block the deal.\n\n\"Ultimately we hope that the sale goes forward,\" he said. \"But there is progress that needs to be made in protecting the civilian population.\"", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/10/trump-to-sell-attack-planes-to-nigeria-for-boko-haram-fight.html"}, {"text": "**Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day?

The administration's first attempt to write legislation is in its early stages and the White House has kept much of it under wraps. But it has already sprouted the consideration of a series of unorthodox proposals including a drastic cut to the payroll tax, aimed at appealing to Democrats. Some view the search for new options as a result of Trump's refusal to set clear parameters for his plan and his exceedingly challenging endgame: reducing tax rates enough to spur faster growth without blowing up the budget deficit.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut so far no nibble from Dems - WSJ: \u201cGOP attempts to reach across the aisle are complicated by lack of agreements on priorities. Democrats are starting to settle on a price for participating in a tax-code overhaul, and many Republicans won\u2019t want to pay it.

What\u2019s amazing is that it has taken years for the major media to admit it, despite epic evidence. Even journalists have a breaking point -- in this case, false statements about deadly chemical weapons.\n\nRice\u2019s lies have angered conservatives for years. Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer nicknamed the former national security adviser the \u201cliar in chief,\u201d according to The Blaze.\n\nRice\u2019s willingness to misrepresent what happened during the Benghazi attack was so amazing, that she repeated it on five separate Sunday morning news talk shows. It was a lie that might make Pinocchio proud. But it took her lies about Syria to do just that.\n\nThe Washington Post gave Rice four Pinocchios (out of four) in the paper\u2019s liars scoreboard for bogus claims about removing Syria\u2019s chemical weapons. The Post criticized her for comments she made during a Jan. 16, NPR interview. It looks bad for Rice that a paper so blatantly anti-Trump as the Post would criticize her for such willful deceit.\n\nThe paper\u2019s Fact Checker called Rice\u2019s statement \u201cproblematic\u201d before spending 1,400 words proving she lied. \u201cShe did not explain that Syria\u2019s declaration was believed to be incomplete and thus was not fully verified \u2014 and that the Syrian government still attacked citizens with chemical weapons not covered by the 2013 agreement. That tipped her wordsmithing toward a Four,\u201d wrote Glenn Kessler.\n\nThe article cited several examples where Syria had continued to use chemical weapons. \u201cKerry\u2019s \u201cexit memo\u201d to Obama, released 11 days before Rice\u2019s remarks on NPR, acknowledged that Syria continued to use \u2018undeclared\u2019 chemical weapons,\u201d emphasized Kessler.\n\nThe New York Times mentioned the same NPR quote in a April 9 story about Obama\u2019s failure to remove WMD from Syria. Here is Rice\u2019s now famously false comment:\n\n\u201cWe were able to find a solution that didn\u2019t necessitate the use of force that actually removed the chemical weapons that were known from Syria, in a way that the use of force would never have accomplished. \u2026 We were able to get the Syrian government to voluntarily and verifiably give up its chemical weapons stockpile.\u201d\n\nThe Times\u2019 Peter Baker showed how nuanced Rice was trying to be to make that explanation. \u201cPublicly, Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers sometimes referred to \u2018known\u2019 or \u2018declared\u2019 stockpiles to qualify their claims, and sometimes did not. But from the start of the deal, there were discrepancies in Mr. Assad\u2019s weapons declarations.\u201d That\u2019s terrifying, given Rice\u2019s involvement in the Iran nuclear deal which relies on similar reporting by a terror state.\n\nBaker then detailed the times that Syria had used chemical weapons against its own citizens -- after the Obama administration said they were 100 percent gone.\n\nRice\u2019s involvement in lies is nothing new. She\u2019s been caught up in the Benghazi scandal from the beginning. She went on \"Face the Nation,\" falsely claiming, \u201cWe do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned.\u201d\n\nRice also drew fire for defending an Obama administration effort to spin the Iran deal. A Times profile of Ben Rhodes, whose brother David is CBS News president, detailed plans to deceive the public. Remember, this isn\u2019t a conservative outlet. It\u2019s The. New. York. Times.\n\nHere\u2019s the Times\u2019 quote:\n\n\u201cThe way in which most Americans have heard the story of the Iran deal presented \u2014 that the Obama administration began seriously engaging with Iranian officials in 2013 in order to take advantage of a new political reality in Iran, which came about because of elections that brought moderates to power in that country \u2014 was largely manufactured for the purpose for selling the deal. Even where the particulars of that story are true, the implications that readers and viewers are encouraged to take away from those particulars are often misleading or false.\u201d\n\nHer response was classic Rice -- more denials. \u201cThere was nothing hidden. There was no effort to or reality of misleading,\u201d said Rice, according to the Daily Caller. \u201cThere is nothing that Ben or the president or I or anybody who was involved in explaining the Iran deal to the American public said that wasn\u2019t factually correct.

This includes \u201ceducation, financial transactions, medical history, criminal or employment history, and information that can be used to distinguish or trace the individual\u2019s identity.\u201d\n\n'VETS CONTINUE TO DIE'\n\nRodriguez acknowledged his email named an assistant as someone who had criticized him in front of veterans and others -- but said he didn't disclose any personal information.\n\n\u201cJust reporting someone's name shouldn't be secret -- we are government employees,\u201d Rodriguez told Fox News. \u201cThey are trying to twist anything they can to punish me.\u201d\n\nThe Phoenix VA hospital was the epicenter of allegations ranging from lax care to misconduct in 2014 when a scheduling clerk became the first whistle-blower to disclose that a secret appointment wait list existed and dozens of would-be patients had died.\n\nIn a report released in October 2016, the VA Inspector General's Office (OIG) found that 215 deceased patients had open appointments at the Phoenix facility on the day they died.\n\nRodriguez complained to the VA inspector general last November that 90 veterans still were waiting more than 400 days for care and five had died without seeing a doctor. In February, he filed another complaint alleging more than 4,000 veterans had their appointments inexplicably canceled by the Phoenix VA after they already had waited more than 180 days, documents show.\n\nWhistle-blowers across the nation started reporting their own VA horrors, including Brandon Coleman, a Phoenix counselor who told the inspector general that many suicidal veterans were not getting timely care.\n\nBeing a whistle-blower comes with a price: many say they have endured a hostile work environment while waiting for their complaints to be remedied. Coleman and Rodriguez are two who went public with allegations and later claimed they received continued harassment at work.\n\nRodriguez detailed his alleged mistreatment in lengthy memos to the Office of Special Counsel, a department that reports directly to the president and is charged with protecting whistle-blowers. He said incidents included his desk being moved into a closet with no air conditioning; his promotion being halted; being told he was better suited for a rural outpost because \u201cyou have native blood\u201d; and facing an increased workload.\n\nThe VA stood by the warning sent to Rodriguez.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Veterans Affairs is obligated to ensure the confidentiality of its beneficiaries\u2019 and employees\u2019 personal identifying information,\u201d the VA said in a statement regarding Rodriguez's pending discipline. \u201cEmployees are expected to act in a manner that is consistent with VA\u2019s core values of Integrity, Commitment, Advocacy, Respect and Excellence. Leadership should take action to ensure the safety of our patients and staff and preserve the integrity of our mission within applicable laws and regulations.\u201d\n\nThe agency has given Rodriguez until April 13 to respond to its claims, and then an assistant chief said he would impose discipline ranging from \u201creprimand to removal.\u201d\n\nRep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, has taken a dim view of the VA's actions.\n\n\u201cIt is unacceptable that any law-abiding whistle-blower would be punished for bringing the issues within VA to light,\u201d Roe said in a statement, adding he has introduced legislation to enhance whistle-blower protections and allow for easier suspension, demotion or firing of bad employees.\n\nThat bill, the VA Accountability First Act of 2017, recently passed the House and forbids the VA from suspending or firing any employee without permission from the Special Counsel. It also shortens the amount of time the VA takes to investigate alleged misconduct, such as in Rodriguez's case.\n\nThe First Amendment Coalition, a free speech advocacy group that aids the public in battles against government secrecy, also said the VA's use of a privacy statute is overly broad if it claims names of employees should not be divulged.\n\n\u201cTo threaten discipline up to and included firing seems at the very least heavy-handed; it's not like the Social Security or bank account numbers were released,\u201d said David Snyder, the coalition's executive director.\n\nSnyder said there could be instances where Rodriguez's reprimand may be technically correct, such as if he knowingly violated an agency guideline. But where the general public is concerned, most federal employee names do not fall under a category of \u201csecret.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs the mere existence of an employee's name secret or to be withheld from the public? Certainly not,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cThe mere existence of a name isn't something they are entitled to redact\u201d in document requests.\n\nThe media often uses the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to obtain documents, which often include emails naming the sender and recipient.\n\n\u201cWhat is redactable is medical, personnel or similar files,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cAs a general matter, that is understood to mean sensitive private information. Just a name by itself does not fall into that category.\u201d\n\nTori Richards is a freelance writer based in Los Angeles.\n\nLike us on Facebook\n\nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/10/veterans-affairs-whistle-blower-faces-punishment-for-revealing-alleged-harasser-email-shows.html"}, {"text": "Here are five news stories and events to start your week:\n\nThe Carl Vinson carrier strike group has been ordered to cancel planned port visits in Australia and sail to the Western Pacific days after North Korea test-fired a ballistic missile from its eastern coast. U.S. Third Fleet announced Saturday night that the San Diego-based strike group, which just completed a four-day port visit in Singapore, will now sail north and \"report on station\" in the Western Pacific. Multiple outlets reported that the ships would be positioned off the Korean peninsula. Cmdr. David Benham, a spokesman for Pacific Command, called the North's missile tests and pursuit of nuclear weapons \"reckless, irresponsible, and destabilizing.\"\n\nA U.S. soldier was killed Saturday during combat operations in Afghanistan, according to the U.S. military. The unidentified U.S. Special Forces team member died of injuries sustained while serving with Afghan forces during an operation against militants affiliated with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, and a branch called Khorasan that operates in Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to a release from U.S. Forces-Afghanistan. \"I offer our deepest condolences to the family and friends of our fallen comrade,\" Gen. John W. Nicholson said. \"We will always remember our fallen comrades and commit ourselves to deliver on their sacrifice.\"\n\nThe Navy has extended the operational pause implemented for its fleet of T-45C Goshawk trainer aircraft without a stated end date to allow leadership to develop a plan to address hypoxia-like episodes in the cockpit. Naval Air Forces officials first announced a three-day operational pause for the aircraft Wednesday, less than a day after Fox News reported that some 100 instructor pilots had refused to fly March 31, citing safety concerns. Officials confirmed that about 40 percent of flights in T-45C training commands in Kingsville, Texas; Pensacola, Florida; and Meridian, Mississippi, were canceled that day because of operational risk issues raised by the pilots.\n\nThe Marine Corps has taken punitive action against a pair of Marines whose online activity was investigated as part of a effort to crack down on misogynistic internet postings and \"revenge porn\" sharing within the service. Two enlisted Marines -- a noncommissioned officer and a junior enlisted service member -- both attached to 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines, out of Camp Pendleton, California, were demoted in paygrade and punished with 45 days of military restriction and 45 days of additional punitive duties. The Marines were sent to NJP because of derogatory comments made about one of their more senior enlisted leaders.\n\nDr. Mark E. Green, a medical doctor, Tennessee state senator and decorated West Point graduate, has been nominated to serve as the 23rd secretary of the Army, the White House announced Friday. His nomination comes more than a month after billionaire Vincent Viola, President Donald Trump's previous pick for the position, removed himself from consideration due to business interests. Green served in the Army as an infantry officer from 1986 to 2006, deploying twice to Iraq and once to Afghanistan while on active duty. He earned the prestigious Army Ranger Tab early, and later served as a captain with the 82nd Airborne Division.\n\n-- Hope Hodge Seck contributed to this report.\n\n-- Brendan McGarry can be reached at brendan.mcgarry@military.com.

Gorsuch is qualified for the position and deserved confirmation. In fact, I believe Judge Gorsuch should have been confirmed without the Republicans having to take the \u201cnuclear option.\u201d\n\n2. We are in a highly polarized political environment. Many Democrats faulting Majority Leader Mitch McConnell seem to forget that just four years ago, Harry Reid eliminated the filibuster on lower judicial nominations as well. Yet, in the case of Gorsuch\u2019s nomination, our political polarization extended beyond Congress and into the Supreme Court, with its decision-making power hanging in the balance. I regret that the filibuster was abandoned, but securing the Court\u2019s functional integrity was most critical.\n\n3. Democrats have put themselves in this position. Seemingly since Election Day, the fundamental Democratic Party strategy has been to resist Trump at every step. Regardless of whether or not Gorsuch truly is a philosophical or moral threat to traditional party values, the Democratic strategy dictated that they must resist his nomination in every possible way. Strategic objectives, not traditional values, created this outcome and now threaten to more rapidly polarize our political environment.\n\n4. If the Democrats could not compromise with Republicans on a judge who was previously confirmed by unanimous vote in 2006 to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, then opportunities for future bipartisanship will be limited, decreasing the likelihood of any and all legislative reforms on the horizon.\n\n5. Furthermore, if partisanship continues to toxify the Senate, it may only a matter of time before a majority party moves to eliminate the filibuster on legislative matters as well. Such a move would destroy one of the few remaining vestiges of rigorous debate in American politics.\n\nYet, like the threat posed to the Supreme Court if a critical seat remained unfilled, politicians\u2019 inability to deliver much-needed social and economic reforms to the American people may make removing the filibuster a political necessity for a majority party in the near future.\n\nDouglas E.

He as a proven record defending religious liberty.\n\nThe First Amendment to the U. S. Constitution declares, \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d This amendment is deeply significant because it declares that every citizen is free to hold his or her own convictions about ultimate reality, align his or her life with those convictions, and do so openly and without fear.\n\nJustice Gorsuch has a proven track record defending religious liberty, stronger in fact than Scalia\u2019s, as Nathan Diament noted recently. Two of the weightiest examples are Hobby Lobby (2013) and Little Sisters of the Poor (2015), cases heard by Judge Gorsuch and the 10th Circuit of Appeals. In both cases the defendants successfully invoked the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (1993) as reason to overturn the Obamacare contraceptive mandate, arguing that the mandate would force them to be complicit in actions that their faith prohibits.\n\n2. He will interpret the law rather than arbitrate morality.\n\nIn a 2009 speech entitled, \u201cMullahs of the West: Judges as Moral Arbiters,\u201d the late Justice Scalia lamented that many Americans have placed their faith in Supreme Court justices to give our nation moral guidance. Yet, the Constitution of the United States specifically guards against giving the justices such mullah-like power; it gives the \u201cWe the People\u201d the right to decide questions of moral profundity.\n\nSadly, certain federal judges have taken this right away from us by embracing a \u201cliving document\u201d view of the Constitution. This progressive view contends that judges have the right to reinterpret the Constitution in light of \u201cthe times.\u201d It\u2019s overall effect is that a SCOTUS majority can remove things from the Constitution that they do not like and insert things they do. The \u201cliving document\u201d view enabled the Roe v. Wade (1973) and Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) decisions.\n\nWe are not saying that the Constitution might never need to be revised or updated again in light of \u201cthe times.\u201d Instead, we are saying that our Founding Fathers made clear amendment to the Constitution must reflect the will of the people; an amendment requires an overwhelming Congressional majority and ratification by three-fourths of the state legislatures.\n\nJustice Gorsuch\u2014like Justice Scalia before him\u2014rejects the \u201cliving document\u201d view. He would refrain from the type of judicial activism that bypasses the will of the people.\n\n3. He may be willing to reject unconstitutional precedents.\n\nThe most contentious debate, however, concerns the legal principle of stare decisis. A Latin phrase, stare decisis means that judges should respect legal precedents by letting them stand instead of overturning them. It is important to note, however, that stare decisis is not found in the Constitution or the Bill or Rights; it is not the law of the land, but a \u201crule of thumb.\u201d\n\nAs Constitutional lawyer Robert McFarland points out , a number of Democratic congressmen have taken a sudden interest in this legal principle. But for what reason? There is no evidence that these Congressmen have an affection for the legal principle, in and of itself.\n\nThey wouldn\u2019t want to let Plessy v. Ferguson (which established segregation) stand, would they? Of course not. Were they concerned about it during Obergefell v. Hodges? No, not a peep. Yet, suddenly they are interested because a strict adherence to stare decisis might safeguard certain of the left\u2019s favorite decisions, even if those decisions were unconstitutional or poorly reasoned.\n\nJustice Gorsuch likely would not adhere strictly to stare decisis; there is reason to believe he would reject the precedent of previous SCOTUS decisions if and when he thinks the courts have gotten it wrong.\n\n4. No Need for Mullahs on the Supreme Court\n\nAmericans\u2014especially Evangelicals\u2014stand to benefit from Judge Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation. He will defend religious liberty. He will confine himself to interpreting the law rather than setting himself up as a moral arbiter. And he may be willing to overturn bad legal precedents in which former jurists set themselves up as moral arbiters.\n\nIn so doing, he will send a message to the political community that we have no need for mullahs at 1 First Street in Washington.\n\nBruce Ashford is the Provost and Dean of Faculty at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, where he also serves as Professor of Theology and Culture.

In January, she told NPR that the Obama administration was able to \u201cfind a solution\u201d on Syria that didn\u2019t require the use of force \u2013 and still dealt with the chemical weapons threat, using diplomacy.\n\n\u201cWe were able to get the Syrian government to voluntarily and verifiably give up its chemical weapons stockpile,\u201d she claimed.\n\nThen came last week\u2019s attack that killed dozens and that the U.S. suspects involved sarin nerve gas. The strike prompted President Trump to launch missiles late last week against the base suspected of being used to carry out the attack.\n\nRice\u2019s comments about the 2013 agreement to purge the Assad regime\u2019s chemical weapons quickly were called into question, along with the claims of other Obama officials.\n\nThe Washington Post noted, \u201cthe Obama administration had a tendency to oversell what was accomplished, perhaps because Obama received so much criticism for not following through on an attack if Syria crossed what Obama had called \u2018a red line.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reality is that there were continued chemical-weapons attacks by Syria \u2014 and that U.S. and international officials had good evidence that Syria had not been completely forthcoming in its declaration and possibly retained sarin and VX nerve agent,\u201d the Post wrote.\n\nCiting Rice\u2019s exact words, the fact-check column ruled: \u201cShe did not explain that Syria\u2019s declaration was believed to be incomplete and thus was not fully verified \u2014 and that the Syrian government still attacked citizens with chemical weapons not covered by the 2013 agreement.

Justice Anthony Kennedy \u2013 Gorsuch\u2019s former boss \u2013 administered the Judicial Oath, the second of two Gorsuch took.\n\n\"To the American people, I am humbled by the trust placed in me today,\" Gorsuch said after taking the oath. \"I will never forget to whom much is given to much will be expected, and I promise you that I will do all my powers permit to be a faithful servant of the Constitution and laws of this great nation.\"\n\nAt the ceremony, President Trump called Gorsuch a man of \"unmatched qualification\" and \"deeply devoted\" to the Constitution.\n\n\"I have no doubt you will rise to the occasion, and the decisions you make will protect our Constitution today and for many generations of Americans to come,\" he said.\n\nEarlier, Gorsuch took the Constitutional Oath in a private ceremony, administered by Chief Justice John Roberts in the Supreme Court\u2019s Justice\u2019s Conference Room. He was accompanied by his wife Louise, who held the Bible, and his two daughters.\n\nGorsuch, 49, takes the seat of the late Justice Scalia, who died in February last year, and whom Gorsuch has been compared favorably to by conservatives hopeful for another originalist on the court.\n\nExpand / Contract April 10, 2017: Neil Gorsuch takes the first of two oaths for the Supreme Court. (Franz Jantzen, Collection of the Supreme Court of the United States)\n\nHe underwent a rocky confirmation hearing as he faced stiff opposition from Democrats unhappy with how Republicans had blocked President Barack Obama's nominee -- Judge Merrick Garland -- after Scalia's death.\n\nGorsuch is likely to cast a deciding vote in a number of high-profile cases, which also explains the tough confirmation process. The high stakes led Republicans to trigger the \u201cnuclear option\u201d last week to kill the 60-vote filibuster threshold for Supreme Court nominees.\n\nHere\u2019s a preview of what Justice Gorsuch will be looking at:\n\nTrinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Pauley\n\nSeen as the hot-button case of the Court\u2019s sitting, this case involves a Lutheran preschool in Missouri that was denied state funds to improve a playground due to a law banning prohibiting government aid to schools with religious affiliations. Trinity Lutheran and supporters are hoping that, given Gorsuch\u2019s rulings on past church-state issues, he will back them in this one.\n\nWeaver v. Massachusetts and Davila v. Davis\n\nThe first case surrounds a 16-year-old who murdered a 15-year-old in 2003, and his lawyers claim his Sixth Amendment rights were violated and he was given inadequate representation after a court kept his family locked out while a jury was selected and his lawyers did not object.\n\nThe Davila case involves a Texas gang member convicted of killing a 5-year-old and her grandmother in a shooting. But lawyers claim he was given ineffective counsel, and specifically they question the legal remedies given to capital defendants.\n\nMaslenjak v. U.S.\n\nJustices will hear the case of an ethnic Serb from Bosnia, who was stripped of U.S. citizenship for lying about how she came to the country. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit ruled that a naturalized citizen can be stripped of citizenship in a criminal proceeding based on immaterial false statements. Gorsuch\u2019s record is unclear on immigration issues, and he only ruled on a few in his time on the 10th Circuit.\n\nCalifornia Public Employees' Retirement System v. ANZ Securities, Inc.\n\nThis case involves the question of whether certain class-action securities lawsuits can be barred because they were filed too late.\n\nThe retirement fund in California has sued various financial institutions over their alleged role in the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers.\n\nHow the justices rule in this case is expected to have serious consequences for institutional investors and also will determine whether putative class members must file individual complaints before the three-year period imposed by Section 13 of the Securities Act has run out.\n\nFox News\u2019 Bill Mears and Andrew O\u2019Reilly and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/10/gorsuch-sworn-in-as-supreme-court-justice-ahead-key-cases.html"}, {"text": "Relentless, harsh and wholly unmerited\u2014such were the attacks against Judge Neil Gorsuch. Yet Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) held firm to his promise to hold a full-Senate vote on the judge\u2019s nomination and today we have, once again, a full complement of justices on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nHopefully, Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation means that the court once again has the crucial fifth vote needed to sustain the Constitution as written and to protect fundamental rights like religious freedom, free speech, and the right to bear arms.\n\nOnce he is sworn in, Justice Gorsuch will arrive at the Court just in time to hear the April 19 oral arguments in Trinity Lutheran Church v. Pauley. It is a case of stark, blatant religious discrimination by the government.\n\nThe state of Missouri provides grants to help nonprofit organizations resurface their playgrounds with rubber from recycled tires. The goal is to provide safer play areas for kids. But Missouri denied a grant to the licensed preschool and daycare center at Trinity Lutheran solely because it is a church. Missouri said the grant would violate separation of church and state. In reality, it violated prior Supreme Court precedent.\n\nGiven the hostility to religious freedom expressed in prior decisions like Burwell v. Hobby Lobby (2014) (the contraceptive mandate case) and Town of Greece v. Galloway (2014) (the town council opening prayer case) by the four liberal justices on the Court, Gorsuch is needed in the Trinity Lutheran case to prevent an injustice from occurring. Excluding churches from an otherwise neutral and secular government aid program clearly violates the First Amendment.\n\nGorsuch may also make a difference in the Court\u2019s decisions about which of the pending petitions it will accept for appeal. Each term, the Court accepts only a little over 70 of the roughly 7,000 petitions it receives. It will be helpful, therefore, to have another justice who understands the importance of constitutional issues and will vote to accept the most important cases for review.\n\nAmong the petitions currently pending is Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, an important case about an individual\u2019s right to not be forced by the government to act in violation of his or her religious beliefs.\n\nAnother petition is Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute. In this case, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an erroneous decision, misinterpreting federal law to prevent the state of Ohio from cleaning up its voter registration list. This is an especially important case for improving election integrity\u2014and one which Justice Gorsuch may be inclined to take up.\n\nAnother petition that could help assure election integrity is North Carolina v. North Carolina NAACP. Here, a three-judge panel of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals erroneously threw out North Carolina\u2019s voter ID law as well as numerous other election reforms.\n\nJustice Gorsuch may also make a difference on petitions to come\u2014such as the emergency appeals of the numerous injunctions issued against President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order temporarily suspending travel from terrorist safe-havens.\n\nAs five dissenting judges from the Ninth Circuit pointed out, those decisions confound Supreme Court precedent and the constitutional and federal statutory provisions that authorize the president\u2019s actions.\n\nNeil Gorsuch should be the fifth vote needed to quash this judicial activism that interferes with the president\u2019s authority as commander-in-chief to protect the nation.\n\nIn recent years, Justice Antonin Scalia provided the crucial fifth vote in numerous critical decisions. We\u2019re talking about decisions that uphold the Second Amendment [e.g., McDonald v. Chicago (2010) and District of Columbia v. Heller (2008)] and First Amendment rights of political speech, [e.g., Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010) and McCutcheon v. FEC (2014)].

Last week, he wrote a column called \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s Climate Fantasies\u201d in which he told readers to pity the president.\n\n\u201cIn less than 100 days, we have learned that Trump is a man living in a fantasy world. He issues decrees, barks orders, sends out midnight Tweets, but to no avail. The facts \u2013 real ones, not his 'alternative' variety \u2013 keep intervening,\u201d Sachs wrote.\n\nAlso in March, he wrote a column for The Boston Globe accusing Trump of \u201cmining that deep vein of fear and hate\u201d with his travel ban affecting certain Muslim-majority countries. He also has called Trump the \u201cquintessential short-run populist\u201d and a \u201cnon-stop font of lies.\u201d Sachs did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News.\n\nSachs' reappointment is not the only possible anti-Trump move in recent days. According to a letter obtained by Fox News, U.N. General Assembly President Peter Thomson told the Mexican ambassador he has appointed him as a co-facilitator of upcoming intergovernmental negotiations of a \u201cglobal compact\u201d for safe, orderly and regular migration.\n\nTrump\u2019s relations with the Mexican government have been tense ever since he made his demand that Mexico pay for a wall on the southern border.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration has continued to criticize what it sees as a bloated and biased body. Haley has been particularly sharp in her criticism of the body\u2019s perceived anti-Israel tilt, working to secure the withdrawal of a report last month that called Israel an \u201capartheid state,\u201d while Trump\u2019s budget blueprint has hinted at deep cuts to U.N. spending.\n\n\"We've carried the burden for a really long time,\u201d Haley said recently. \u201cAnd it doesn't mean we're not going to continue to pay our due. But at some point, other countries have to step in and start funding these missions, too.\u201d\n\nAmid the cost-cutting push, Foreign Policy reported that Haley urged the U.N. to trim the peacekeeping mission to Congo. Haley wanted a cut of 1,500 troops, though only came away with a 370-troop cut. The push, however, signaled the Trump administration sees tightening costs as a real issue \u2013 an effort likely to face strong resistance from U.N. officials.\n\nGuterres himself has been taking swipes at Trump on his trips abroad. At an address to the League of Arab States in Jordan last month, Guterres slammed \u201cpopulist political leaders \u2013 [who] for short-sighted and cynical reasons -- distort Islam to spread anti-Muslim hatred, playing into the hands of terrorist and extremist groups.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt breaks my heart to see developed countries closing their borders to refugees fleeing this region, and worse, sometimes invoking religion as a reason to keep them out,\u201d he said.\n\nIn February, the U.N.\u2019s High Commissioner for Human Rights Prince Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein took an apparent shot at the Trump administration\u2019s threat to leave the Human Rights Council, and criticized \u201cpolitical leaders who today wage campaigns against universal human rights, or threaten withdrawal from international or regional treaties and the institutions which uphold them.\u201d\n\nAfter praising the anti-Trump marches that took place the day after Trump\u2019s inauguration, and adding he was \u201cproud members of my staff took part,\u201d the career Jordanian diplomat warned about political actors who would withdraw from parts of the \u201cmulitilateral system.\u201d\n\n\u201c[O]ur rights, the rights of others, the very future of our planet cannot, must not be thrown aside by these reckless political profiteers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe warning apparently did not work, as the U.S. boycotted the first session of the council amid concerns about anti-Israel resolutions.\n\nAdam Shaw is a Politics Reporter and occasional Opinion writer for FoxNews.com.

One moment, the media were depicting Trump as a bumbling leader who couldn\u2019t even pass a health bill. In the next, he was a bold and decisive commander-in-chief responding to Bashir al-Assad\u2019s horrifying chemical attack against his own people.\n\nBut there are some dissenting voices, which I\u2019ll get to in a moment.\n\nEven some former Barack Obama aides, in backing Trump\u2019s decision, are now admitting that the former president should not have declared a red line against Syria and failed to enforce it in 2013, settling instead for a deal on chemical weapons that obviously didn\u2019t remove all of them from the country.\n\nI\u2019ve been wondering why Trump wasn\u2019t hit harder on the charge of flip-flopping.\n\nTo be sure, many news outlets have noted that Trump has changed his position against intervening in the Middle East, a staple of his campaign rhetoric. As recently as October, he said Clinton might start World War III in Syria. And Trump tweeted at Obama four years ago. \u201cTO OUR VERY FOOLISH LEADER, DO NOT ATTACK SYRIA - IF YOU DO MANY VERY BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN & FROM THAT FIGHT THE U.S. GETS NOTHING!\u201d Trump tweeted then.\n\nMy conclusion: Journalists care far less about flip-flopping if you flip in their direction. And foreign policy commentators tend to reflect a Beltway bias toward U.S. military intervention.\n\nFor the moment, Trump is letting the results speak for themselves, even as Syria has used the damaged air strip to resume bombing the town where the chemical attack took place. Kellyanne Conway told me yesterday on \u201cMedia Buzz\u201d that there are no immediate plans for a televised speech on the issue, but that Trump went out of his way to take a nonpartisan approach.\n\nSo what happens next?\n\nFrom the right, National Review says: \u201cIf it is a one-off, this strike is the very definition of a symbolic pinprick\u2026\n\n\u201cWe are skeptical of the wisdom of this approach. It may be that the strike is enough to deter Assad from future chemical attacks, but it also could have unwelcome unintended consequences. If Assad decides to defy us, we will be forced into further action against his regime without any idea of what would replace it.\u201d\n\nThe Weekly Standard questions the legality: \u201cLost in the praise for the strike is the lingering constitutional question: On what grounds did the White House rest its decision to attack a nation with which we are not formally at war and which has not attacked us? Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's statement that \u2018if there are weapons of this nature available in Syria, the ability to secure those weapons and not have them fall into the hands of those who would bring those weapons to our shores to harm American citizens\u2019 is lame if it's meant to satisfy the conditions for defensive preemption. Hitting the air base was no more likely to secure those weapons than taking out cell towers so Assad can't call his bankers in London and Geneva.\u201d\n\nLaura Ingraham, the radio talk show host who spoke at Trump\u2019s convention, does not sound pleased, tweeting: \u201cMissiles flying. Rubio's happy. McCain ecstatic. Hillary's on board. A complete policy change in 48 hrs.\u201d\n\nFrom the left, Slate objects to the praise on the grounds that, well, Trump is a dangerous guy:\n\n\u201cIf you are looking for extra reasons why these commentators may be looking to extend a warm hand to Trump, here's another one: There is something comforting about Trump acting in a manner that much elite opinion has been in favor of for years. Barack Obama was criticized for not launching an attack on Assad after the latter crossed Obama's \u2018red line, and many people have made cases\u2014ranging from completely legitimate and thoughtful to entirely bonkers\u2014that America should be more involved in the anti-Assad side of the Syrian conflict\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cBut Trump is not\u2014and will never be\u2014a normal president. He is an uninformed and dangerously unstable one. If he wants to conduct military action without congressional approval, he should be challenged, not lauded.\"\n\n\n\nOf course the media need to keep pressing these questions: What is Trump\u2019s larger strategy? What is he willing to commit in terms of military resources? What risks is he prepared to take? What if Americans are captured in this effort? What about the fallout with Russia? Can the United States really affect the Syrian civil war without boots on the ground?\n\nAs retired generals flood the airwaves to praise the airstrikes, the media must avoid getting swept away as they were in 2003, when most news organizations covered the runup to the Iraq war with minimal skepticism.\n\nAt the moment, Trump is basking in some rare praise.

The National Taxpayers Union supported the House Republican bill and FreedomWorks opposed it.\n\nBoth of our organizations \u2013 longtime, steadfast proponents of reducing the size and scope of government \u2013 remain committed to repealing ObamaCare as the debate over health care legislation continues. However, as many policymakers on Capitol Hill shift focus from health care to tax reform, it\u2019s absolutely essential for free market advocates to set aside any ObamaCare-related differences and stand united.\n\nWe simply cannot afford to squander this once-in-a-generation opportunity to pass fundamental tax reform.\n\nTo be sure, the need for reform has never been greater. The past eight years taught Americans that higher taxes and more regulation slow economic growth, depriving many Americans of opportunity and prosperity. Indeed, the fact that the United States hasn\u2019t seen economic growth of 3 percent or higher since 2005 is an indictment of the policies of the past decade. Americans deserve better, and Congress has a responsibility to deliver.\n\nOur tax code is an absolute mess. Americans spend nearly 7 billion hours annually on tax compliance. This wasted time, when combined with out-of-pocket costs, amounts to an economic loss of $261.2 billion each year.\n\nOur tax code is an absolute mess. Americans spend nearly 7 billion hours annually on tax compliance. This wasted time, when combined with out-of-pocket costs, amounts to an economic loss of $261.2 billion each year. But it\u2019s not just complexity that\u2019s problematic. Our current tax structure imposes excessively high rates on individuals and small businesses. This takes far too big a bite out of family budgets and limits the economic potential of entrepreneurs.\n\nOn the corporate side, we\u2019ve saddled American businesses with the highest tax rate in the industrialized world. This has damaged the ability of our companies to compete globally and, combined with a hostile regulatory environment, led to far too many businesses moving their operations overseas. Any credible tax reform plan must significantly cut the corporate rate. Reform should also include full expensing to encourage capital investment and a shift to territoriality to reduce complexity and bring our code more in line with the rest of the world.\n\nWhile the path forward on reform remains unclear, it\u2019s extremely helpful to have a workable blueprint in place: the Better Way plan authored by Speaker Paul Ryan and House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady. The blueprint is not perfect, but it does a great job of setting the table for reform. On the individual side, it broadens the tax base by eliminating many \u201cloopholes,\u201d lowers and consolidates tax rates, and expands the standard deduction.\n\nUnder this plan, most individuals could fill out their tax forms on a single sheet of paper and the average family would see an increase in take home pay of more than $4,600, according to the Tax Foundation. Further, it would get rid of the onerous \u201cdeath tax,\u201d scrap the alternative minimum tax, and restructure the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nThese proposed changes to the tax code, most of which conservatives and libertarians have long desired, promote economic growth and opportunity for all Americans. The American worker hasn\u2019t seen a pay raise in 15 years. We\u2019re confident that this overhaul and simplification of the tax code would put more money in the pockets of Americans.\n\nFor the business community, the Better Way plan would drop the corporate rate down to 20 percent, which would be below the average rate for industrialized countries. It would allow for full expensing and move us to a territorial system, which would mean American businesses would no longer be taxed on worldwide earnings. These changes would spur economic growth, encourage entrepreneurialism and attract new investment.\n\nAs the process moves forward, the House plan will hopefully be refined and improved through public input and the legislative process, but there\u2019s no doubt it represents a dramatic improvement over the status quo. It\u2019s a great starting point and FreedomWorks and National Taxpayers Union are excited about working cooperatively to advance the discussion.\n\nWe hope that all members of Congress \u2013 regardless of their views on repealing ObamaCare \u2013 can work together on the monumentally important task of reforming our tax code.\n\nOur nation\u2019s prosperity is at stake and we cannot afford to allow past differences and disagreements stand in the way.\n\nBrandon Arnold is the executive vice president of the National Taxpayers Union.

However, a detailed tax plan is still weeks away.\n\nA complete tax overhaul will likely miss the August deadline set by Treasury Secretary Mnuchin. The White House is trying to learn from the failure of enacting a new health care law to replace ObamaCare and take a more active role in getting legislation passed.\n\nWhite House aides told The Associated Press Monday that the goal is to cut tax rates sharply enough to improve the economic picture in rural and industrial areas of the U.S. However, the administration so far has swatted down alternative ways for raising revenues, such as a carbon tax, to offset lower rates.\n\nTrump has not said which trade-offs he might accept and had remained noncommittal on the leading blueprint for reform from Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.\n\nBrady has proposed a border adjustment system, which would eliminate corporate deductions on imports, to raise $1 trillion over 10 years that could fund lower corporate tax rates.\n\nBut that possibility has rankled retailers who say it would lead to higher prices and threaten millions of jobs, while some lawmakers have worried that the system would violate World Trade Organization rules.\n\nBrady has said he intends to amend the blueprint but has not spelled out how he would do so.\n\nAnother option being floated around on Capitol Hill would change the House GOP plan to eliminate much of the payroll tax and cut corporate tax rates and possibly requiring a new dedicated funding source for Social Security.\n\nThe change, proposed by a GOP lobbyist with close ties to the Trump administration, would transform Brady's plan on imports into something closer to a value-added tax by also eliminating the deduction of labor expenses. This would bring it in line with WTO rules and generate an additional $12 trillion over 10 years, according to budget estimates. Those additional revenues could then enable the end of the 12.4 percent payroll tax, split evenly between employers and employees, that funds Social Security, while keeping the health insurance payroll tax in place.\n\nThis approach would give a worker earning $60,000 a year an additional $3,720 in take-home pay, a possible win that lawmakers could highlight back in their districts even though it would involve changing the funding mechanism for Social Security, according to the lobbyist.\n\nSen.

Gray's death touched off the worst rioting in Baltimore in decades.\n\nIn a memo made public earlier this week, the Trump Justice Department signaled that it may retreat from the consent decrees that have been put in place in recent years in such cities as Cleveland; Ferguson, Missouri; Miami; and Newark, New Jersey.\n\nThe Justice Department can appeal the judge's decision, but it would have to show the judge made an error or abused his discretion.\n\nThat would be difficult to prove, said Jonathan Smith, a civil rights attorney in the Obama Justice Department who oversaw negotiations with troubled police departments.\n\nJustice Department lawyers also could try to modify the consent decree, but the burden is high, requiring them to show there has been a substantial change in the facts or the law, Smith said.\n\nCity officials, including Police Commissioner Kevin Davis, have voiced their support for the agreement.\n\nMayor Catherine Pugh disputed the notion the decree will hurt the fight against crime.\n\n\"I believe that it makes Baltimore safer,\" she said. \"I think by building and training our police officers in ways to de-escalate violence, to work with our communities, to have cultural diversity training and have the right kind of tools they need to know what they can do in certain areas of our community ... I think it's improved policing.\"\n\nThe homicide rate in Baltimore immediately spiked after the riots over Gray's death, leading some residents to accuse officers of taking a hands-off approach for fear of increased scrutiny.\n\nThe soaring crime rate has not relented. In the first three months of 2017, the city recorded 79 homicides, compared with 56 for the same period the year before.\n\nBaltimore's agreement calls for additional training for officers and discourages them from arresting people for minor offenses such as traffic infractions or loitering. It also says officers can no longer detain someone simply for being in a high-crime area.\n\nFollowing Gray's death, the department began undertaking some reforms, including outfitting officers with body cameras and updating the use-of-force policy.\n\nGene Ryan, president of the Baltimore police union, has complained that the agreement was rushed and that the union wasn't involved enough in the negotiations.\n\nThe national Fraternal Order of Police said it was disappointed by the judge's decision to move forward.\n\n\"But Baltimore officers will endeavor to give the citizens of Baltimore the best public safety service possible given the constraints imposed upon the department by the decree,\" said Jim Pasco, the senior adviser to the group's president.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/08/sessions-warns-that-overhaul-baltimore-police-may-result-in-less-safe-city.html"}, {"text": "A fatal airstrike occurred Saturday in the same northern Syrian town hit earlier this week by a deadly chemical weapon attack, according to several international monitoring groups.\n\nThe airstrike on the town of Khan Sheikhoun killed a woman, following the chemical attack Tuesday that killed 87 people, including children.\n\nThe chemical attack purportedly was authorized by Syrian President Bashar Assad and targeted the town because it is a stronghold for rebel forces trying to topple his regime in the country\u2019s 6-year-long civil war.\n\nThe Local Coordination Committees, another monitoring group, said the airstrike Saturday was carried out by warplanes from Russia, which has backed Assad.\n\nPresident Trump authorized a missile attack overnight Thursday that struck an air base in central Syria from which the chemical attack was launched, killing nine people.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to our great military men and women for representing the United States, and the world, so well in the Syria attack,\u201d Trump tweeted Saturday.\n\nSyria's government has denied responsibility for any chemical attack on Khan Sheikhoun.\n\nAnd Russia's Defense Ministry, which has condemned the U.S. response, said the toxic chemical were released when a Syrian airstrike hit a rebel chemical weapons arsenal and munitions factory on the town's eastern outskirts.\n\nTurkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Ankara sees the U.S. intervention in Syria as appropriate but not enough.\n\n\"If this intervention is limited only to an air base, if it does not continue and if we don't remove the regime from heading Syria, then this would remain a cosmetic intervention,\" said Cavusoglu in the southern city of Antalya.\n\nCavusoglu, whose country is a strong backer of the Syrian opposition, said the most ideal process will be a political solution that leads to a transitional government accepted by all Syrians as soon as possible.

Trump announced that he launched an airstrike into Syria moments after dinning with his Chinese counterpart.\n\nXi requested time with Alaska\u2019s Gov. Bill Walker as the Chinese delegation's plane made a refueling stop in Anchorage. His wife and the Chinese delegation stepped off the Boeing 747 and were greeted by Walker, his wife and several dignitaries. The Anchorage Daily News reported that the Alaska visit was kept under wraps until earlier this week.\n\nThe visitors and their hosts drove off in a line of SUVs, limos and other vehicles in 40-degree weather under blue skies. The sightseeing tour will include a stop at Beluga Point, a pullout on the scenic Seward Highway about 15 miles south of Anchorage.\n\nThe pullout offers a stunning view of the snow-capped Chugach Mountains and Turnagain Arm in Alaska's Cook Inlet. The waters are home to the endangered Beluga whale.\n\nWalker said he was eager to tell Xi about the abundance of Alaska's resource development opportunities.\n\n\"We have tremendous potential in our oil and gas, tourism, fish, air cargo and mineral resource industries,\" Walker said in a statement issued before the meeting.\n\nFor Walker, even just a few hours of time with the president of the world's largest country can pay dividends.\n\nExpand / Contract (Chugach Mountains bordering the north shores of Turnagain Arm)\n\nChina is the state's top export market, buying nearly $1.2 billion worth of goods in 2016, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The next top international market was Japan, at nearly $820 million, followed by South Korea, at $730 million.\n\nChris Hladick, the commissioner of the state's Commerce department, called the visit by the Chinese delegation a \"once-in-a lifetime opportunity.\"\n\n\"We're not even shown on the map for the United States,\" he said, a nod to Alaska and Hawaii often being left off of maps of the U.S. \"I think this is an extremely valuable opportunity to meet with our largest trade partner face to face.\"\n\nThe state's top export product to China? Fish, accounting for 58 percent. Frozen cod and flat fish, such as halibut, topped a lengthy list of fisheries products, which also included frozen salmon and pollock.\n\nA distant second on the export list are minerals and ores, accounting for 27 percent. Included in that last year was about $130 million of precious metals, which Hladick said was likely gold from the Fairbanks area.\n\nLower-tier exports included oil, wood, scrap metal and airplane parts.\n\nHladick sees China as a potential market for Alaska coal and hoped to raise the issue with Chinese officials during their visit. \"It's meetings like this that spark interest and then you follow up,\" Hladick said.\n\nHaving your largest trade partner drop in for a meeting is fortuitous when the state is in tough financial straits because of a prolonged period of low oil prices. Hladick said he'd be happy to get a 45-minute meeting with the Chinese trade minister.\n\nWalker has been courting Asian markets -- particularly Japan and South Korea -- in trying to drum up interest in a liquefied natural gas project the state is pursuing. State officials wouldn't say if Walker would bring up the natural gas pipeline, which is in its early stages, during his visit with Xi, but it seemed unlikely that he wouldn't take time to tout the multi-billion dollar project that would take natural gas from Alaska's North Slope to a plant on the state's coast, where it would be liquefied and shipped.\n\nXi is the second major world leader to spend time in Alaska's largest city in the last few years. U.S. President Barack Obama used a three-day trip to Anchorage in 2015 to showcase the impact of climate change. King Harald V of Norway also made an official visit to Anchorage a few months before Obama.\n\nAlaska's location provides a natural stopping point for world leaders to make refueling stops, and Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage has hosted many presidents over the years for these short stints.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II met in 1984 during refueling stops at the airport in Fairbanks.

Conservative Antonin Scalia had died. Hours after his death, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced that his chamber would not consider an Obama nominee and would instead wait until the new president was elected. There were 11 months left in Obama\u2019s term at the time.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s gambit worked. Obama's nomination, Judge Merrick Garland never saw the light of day, and Trump defeated Clinton.\n\nTrump nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch who\u2014thanks to the Republican-controlled Senate\u2019s decision to go nuclear\u2014is set to be sworn in on Monday. The tilt of the court has regained its conservative tilt.\n\nAs soon as April 13, Gorsuch could take part in his first private conference, where justices decide whether to hear cases \u2014 and some of them could involve gun rights, voting rights and a Colorado baker's refusal to design a cake for a same-sex couple's wedding, The Associated Press reported.\n\nBut just as Gorsuch begins to get comfortable in his new chambers, Supreme Court observers are considering the real posibility that Trump could name additional justices. The court is collectively older than any other on record. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Anthony Kennedy and Stephen Breyer are 84, 80 and 78, respectively.\n\nGorsuch's confirmation process was fought bitterly on both sides. Democrats assailed McConnell for choosing to go nuclear. Sen. Chuck Schumer said afterwards that there's no incentive for nominees to even speak to the minority anymore.\n\nUniversity of California at Irvine Professor Rick Hasen warned Democrats at the height of the Gorsuch fight that they had little to gain in filibustering the nomination.\n\n\"Imagine if in a year or so Justices Breyer, Ginsburg, or Kennedy leave the Court,\u201d he wrote on Election Law Blog. \u201cThen things get MUCH worse from the point of view of progressives.

Trump needn\u2019t have solved everything to have done something beneficial Thursday.\n\nStill, they will need \u2014 and soon \u2014 to explain how Thursday\u2019s attack squares with what appeared to be a policy of focusing on the defeat of ISIS and leaving Bashir al Assad in power.\n\nMike O\u2019Hanlon has suggested several smart adjustments to policy that have the potential for real progress in bringing the Syrian war to an end: more assistance to Kurdish and Sunni groups fighting ISIS and Al Qaeda (with post-war assistance conditioned on weapons returns to mollify Turkey), with temporarily protected autonomous governance zones for Kurds and Sunni in a federated Syria.\n\nThese and others should be considered if a shift in policy is genuinely underway to involve the U.S. more directly in the Syrian war.\n\nA one-off attack to punish chemical weapons use is also a defensible policy. It establishes boundaries within which states are constrained even in fighting protracted civil wars, puts other potential WMD users on notice that the U.S. will enforce the norms that preclude them.\n\nIt reassures allies reliant on American security guarantees that we are willing to run risks for our interests and the broader good.\n\nIt shows the Russians, Iranians, and other potential adversaries that we are not hesitant to use force even in complicated circumstances where we risk confrontation with them. Moreover, the president approved the attacks while also meeting with the Chinese President, demonstrating the U.S. can manage many problems simultaneously.\n\nPresident Trump has claimed keeping strategy secret as a virtue. As with so many things the president says, there is some truth to it: free societies fight at a disadvantage when they telegraph all their actions. But public debate and legislative oversight are essential for building a stable basis of support for the president\u2019s policies.

The president\u2019s top spokesman described the course of events as a \u201c72-hour evolution\u201d that involved \u201cupdates and options and refinements\u201d before a final decision.\n\nOBAMA OFFICIALS UNDER FIRE FOR CHEMICAL WEAPONS CLAIMS\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to telegraph his next move,\u201d Spicer cautioned, but described Thursday\u2019s actions as carefully planned, decisive and \u201cjustified.\u201d\n\nAccording to Spicer and other officials, the timeline played out as follows:\n\nTuesday at 10:30 a.m. ET: Trump was informed during his daily briefing about the suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria. Trump asked his team for more information. The team developed \u201cinitial\u201d options.\n\nTuesday at 8 p.m.: Preliminary options were \u201cpresented and refined.\u201d\n\nWednesday morning: Another \u201crestricted principals meeting\u201d was held where options were further reviewed and refined.\n\nWednesday at 3 p.m.: Trump was briefed on updated options at a national security meeting. He reviewed them, asked questions, and requested more information \u2013 including options for strikes on Syria.\n\nThursday at 1:30 p.m.: En route to Florida, Trump convened his national security team aboard Air Force One.\n\nThursday at 4 p.m.: Trump, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and others met in a secure room in Palm Beach. The president \u201cgave the okay\u201d to move ahead. This decision was made at about 4:30 p.m.\n\nThursday at 7:40 p.m.: Navy destroyers in the Mediterranean launched Tomahawk missiles into Syria.\n\nThursday at 8:30 p.m.: Foreign leaders and congressional leaders started to be notified. Around that time, the first missiles were hitting. Trump informed President Xi as their dinner was ending. According to Spicer, all 59 missiles \u201chit their target.\u201d After dinner, Trump held a secure call with the Joint Chiefs.\n\n\u201cHe asked about reaction from the world community as well as congressional leaders and was informed that there was fairly unanimous praise for the decision and the actions the president took,\u201d Spicer said.\n\nTrump mostly has won bipartisan praise on Capitol Hill for the response, though some have warned that he must seek congressional authorization going forward. The strikes also fueled a fiery U.N. Security Council session on Friday, where Syria\u2019s allies condemned the action.\n\nThe strikes took some by surprise, considering Trump\u2019s past criticism of intervention in Syria. Spicer, and the president himself, say he was moved by the horrific images of victims of this week\u2019s chemical attack.\n\n\u201cIt was very disturbing and tragic and moving to him,\u201d Spicer said.\n\nFox News\u2019 Judson Berger, Lucas Tomlinson and Lesa Jansen contributed to this report.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/07/syria-strikes-story-behind-trumps-72-hour-evolution.html"}, {"text": "The American media resembled Los Alamos this week -- making more references to \u201cgoing nuclear\u201d than a guy in a lab coat with a German accent.\n\nCNN chose \u201cSenate GOP triggers nuclear option\u201d while The Washington Post picked, \u201cSenate Republicans go \u2018nuclear.\u2019\u201d The Drudge Report used a huge, color photo of a nuclear blast and the headline: \u201cREPUBLICANS PUSH BUTTON.\u201d\n\nFor such an explosive choice, the major media reaction was mellow -- distracted by Trump\u2019s actions in Syria and yet another terror attack in Europe. Most outlets went with a version of the what ABC News deployed -- the generic headline, even if it was in red. \u201cNEIL GORSUCH CONFIRMED TO THE SUPREME COURT. CBS News initially led its website with a millennial-esque meh headline: \u201cNeil Gorsuch receives enough votes to be confirmed by Senate.\u201d Not Trump wins.\n\nNotice the spin? All six top traditional news sites excluded Trump from their Gorsuch headlines. ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Washington Post and New York Times censored any headline mention of Trump\u2019s biggest victory since taking office as a non-event. Politico did the same, but it\u2019s a liberal political site. It took the Jerusalem Post to make the journalistic point honestly. \u201cIn big win for Trump, Senate approves conservative court pick Neil Gorsuch.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post was rare among news sites to make the event obviously partisan. The paper\u2019s website, now enshrined under the anti-Trump motto, \u201cDemocracy Dies in Darkness,\u201d politicized the new justice. \u201cGorsuch is confirmed, restoring conservative tilt to high court.\u201d That was in keeping with an earlier headline that was worse: \u201cNeil Gorsuch\u2019s Supreme Court nomination is on track to change the Senate \u2014 and further divide the country.\u201d Hardly surprising for a news outlet that inserts attacks on Trump in news, fashion, sports and business.\n\nFor context, the Post\u2019s headline almost precisely mirrors the one used by far-left Democracy Now! \u201cGOP Senators Trigger Nuclear Option to Confirm Far-Right Judge Neil Gorsuch.\u201d Alt-lefty Alternet combined both the Post themes into one: \u201cRepublicans Have Just Handed America an Extreme Right-Wing Supreme Court That Will Divide the Country More Than Ever.\u201d\n\nLiberals based that idea on the claim that the GOP was trying to steal the seat. Even before the final vote, that was the argument CNN commentator Sally Kohn was making. \u201cGo, Democrats, go!!!! Republicans stole this #SCOTUS seat from President Obama AND #Gorsuch is even more extreme right than Scalia!\u201d\n\nFormer journalist Luke Russert bashed the #GOP in identical fashion. \u201cUNPRECEDENTED-How the #GOP used the filibuster to stop Obama & steal a Supreme Court pick,\u201d he tweeted. Russert appears to have left both his MSNBC gig and the news business. At least we can hope.\n\nThe hardcore voices on the left vowed revenge and even claimed victory. Abortion extremist and NARAL president Ilyse Hogue seemed to be tweeting for conservatives unintentionally. \u201cGorsuch ascends to #SCOTUS by 54-45 vote. There's victory in fighting for what's right, and the people have been victorious in this fight.\u201d\n\nYes, the right people won. She promised senators, \u201cWe have long memories and #WeObject.\u201d Earlier she had claimed, \u201cThis is the vote where the GOP inalterably changes the course of our democracy.\u201d\n\nConservatives relished in the victory. On a day where even some liberals were singing Trump\u2019s praises over his action in Syria, it made for a win-win.\n\nRadio host Eric Metaxas\u200f presented the conservative case on Gorsuch with a bit of snark. \u201cJudge Gorsuch confirmed! Gorsuch a time as this. I wonder if Hillary would have nominated an originalist, he said very very sarcastically\u2026.\u201d\n\nThat was echoed by the Heritage Foundation which had been instrumental in Trump\u2019s judicial choices. \u201cThe Senate just confirmed Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court. This is an enormous win for all Americans.\u201d\n\nDaily Wire writer John Nolte, known for his biting Twitter wit, credited former Democrat Sen. Harry Reid for the victory. \u201cEveryone thank @SenatorReid\u2026 Thanks, Harry!\u201d\n\nThe media also had a role in the loss. It was a fight Democrats never were likely to win, a reality journalists did little to share with liberal supporters.\n\nNews outlets hyped the fillibuster fight like it would actually stop Trump from naming the justice he wanted. Anti-conservative, sometime comedian Stephen Colbert used \"The Late Show\" to make that point, but apparently not enough liberals were watching. \"Sure, it's a fight they're going to lose,\" Colbert said of the left. \"But those are the kinds of fights Democrats love.\"\n\nEven when the filibuster was deployed, lefty websites were describing it as a victory. Bustle ran the deceptive headline: \u201cDemocrats block Trump\u2019s SCOTUS Nominee Neal [Sic] Gorsuch.\u201d Except they didn\u2019t. What they did was help Trump nominate a future justice without any Democrat involvement. Bustle just got $12 million to do political reporting. One hopes they haven\u2019t spent it yet.\n\nThe Atlantic\u2019s Matt Ford reprised that utterly fruitless argument. \u201cThat's 41 votes for the Democrats.

He generally supported a hands-off policy, noting, in the second Republican debate, \u201cLet them fight each other and pick up the remnants.\u201d\n\nAnd as he later told Fox News\u2019 own Chris Wallace in the third Presidential debate, \u201cwe don\u2019t know who the rebels are [...] but if they ever did overthrow Assad [...] you may very well end up with worse than Assad.\u201d\n\nSources telling me U.S. attack in Syria planned for tonight, we must stop! #NoMoreWar https://t.co/lgonnxRF4x \u2014 Mike Cernovich \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@Cernovich) April 6, 2017\n\nIt\u2019s statements like this that have erstwhile allies asking what happened.\n\nFor instance, pro-Trump blogger Mike Cernovich tweeted And widely noted conservative commentator Ann Coulter wrote \u201cTrump campaigned on not getting involved in Mideast. Said it always helps our enemies & creates more refugees. Then he saw a picture on TV.\u201d\n\nBut maybe it was more than just seeing a picture on TV. As Trump noted, in explaining his attack \u201cYears of previous attempts at changing Assad\u2019s behavior have all failed and failed very dramatically. As a result, the refugee crisis continues to deepen, and the region continues to destabilize, threatening the United States and its allies.\u201d\n\nAnd, in fact, it\u2019s not as if he campaigned on no attacks ever. Indeed, he made clear his eyes were open. Whenever the subject of Syria came up, he didn\u2019t hedge on his feelings about Assad. From the fourth Republican debate: \u201cAssad is a bad guy. [...] I don\u2019t like Assad. Who\u2019s going to like Assad?\u201d\n\nAnd he was no patsy for Putin, either. As he stated in the third President debate, \u201cI never met Putin. This is not my best friend.\u201d\n\nHis larger point was America, under President Obama, had been outplayed, partly due to its indecision. Obama had told Syria to back down and didn\u2019t follow through\u2014as Trump put it in the second Presidential debate: \u201cObama draws the line in the sand. It was laughed at all over the world what happened.\u201d\n\nHis point, then, was that while he\u2019d rather get along with others, he\u2019d stand up to aggression if necessary.\n\nAnd, strategically, the strike was perfectly consistent with the way candidate Trump promised to fight\u2014when he did act, it would come as a surprise to the enemy. As he said in an interview last September \u201cI\u2019m tired of watching these people get up, these politicians, and tell the enemy exactly what we\u2019re going to do, when we\u2019re going to be there, when we\u2019re going to leave.\u201d\n\nIn other words, if he ever became Commander-in-chief, don\u2019t be surprised if he did something surprising.\n\nTime will tell if Trump\u2019s attack on Syria was a smart move, or a huge mistake.

But a singular strike against a limited asset hardly constitutes war. It is a military action intended to confront hostilities which does not rise to the level of a declared war as the Founders envisioned.\n\nIt is clear that the Framers recognized there would be times when the President needs to use immediate military force unilaterally and without the extensive time it might take for Congress to consider the matter, then debate it and approve it. They chose to withhold from him only the power to declare war, not make war which was regarded as a vital emergency power allowed the president to counter or thwart foreign threats.\n\nHence it is perfectly consistent with the Constitution for President Trump to have taken action against the brutality of Bashar Al-Assad to prevent the spread and repeated use of chemical weapons. It is not only Syrian civilians the Commander-In-Chief is endeavoring to protect, but U.S. troops in the region and other American assets, all of whom stand in jeopardy.\n\nCongressional Acts\n\nIn 1973, Congress passed The War Powers Act in reaction to the Vietnam War, which was never a declared war even though roughly 60,000 American soldiers were killed.\n\nIn relevant part, the law permits the president to launch a military strike on his own, as long as he notifies or consults with Congress within 48 hours. This President Trump did.\n\nAn argument can also be made that the president has latitude to take action against Syria under a 2001 law passed by Congress following the 9/11 attacks. Called The Authorization for Use of Military Force, it gives him permission to direct military force to prevent future terror attacks against the U.S.\n\nPresidents Bush, Obama and Trump have used an expansive view of this authority to fight both Al Qaeda and ISIS in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere.\n\nThe law is not limited to terror groups. It encompasses any nation which engages directly or indirectly in terrorist acts or harbors terrorists.\n\nThe Syrian chemical attack against innocent people can surely be described as an act of terrorism. And again, the U.S. has vulnerable troops in the region helping in the fight against ISIS. They might be the next target of an Assad chemical attack should he not be deterred by the use of American force.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s Actions\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s immediate predecessor, as most presidents before him, used military force in a foreign venue without congressional authorization. The same basic reasons and justifications were cited.\n\nHe launched attacks against Libya even though Congress refused to grant permission, arguing he had the constitutional and statutory power to do it anyway.\n\nTwo years later, when Assad launched a deadly chemical attack on his own people, President Obama once again asserted he had clear authority to act unilaterally. But he didn\u2019t.\n\nHe subsequently backed down electing to abdicate his responsibility to Congress which he knew would decline to act. It is hard to reconcile the reasoning behind his decisions.\n\nMore Precedence\n\nAcross the history of this nation, presidents have used military force without express congressional approval on more than 125 occasions. None of these actions were held to be unconstitutional. Hence, there is ample precedence for President Trump\u2019s decision to strike a military base in Syria.\n\nSome of these presidential actions proved unwise, like President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s military invasion of Veracruz, Mexico, a bloody conflict which lasted for months and, arguably, achieved little except embarrassment.\n\nBut presidents are allowed to make mistakes of judgment, as long as they abide by the constitutional framework set forth by the Founders and the statutory requirements imposed by Congress.\n\nPresident Trump has done so.\n\nGregg Jarrett is a Fox News Anchor and former defense attorney.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/04/07/gregg-jarrett-president-trumps-military-strike-against-syria-is-perfectly-legal.html"}, {"text": "Drone flights over 133 military facilities will be restricted for security reasons, marking the first time such flight restrictions have been applied only to drones rather than aircraft in general, the U.S. aviation safety authority said Friday.\n\nThe restrictions are in response to requests from the Defense Department and other security and intelligence agencies, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement. No specific threat was cited.\n\nWhile drones can't fly over the facilities, the FAA's agreement with the Defense Department permits drone flights below 400 feet (120 meters) high within the side boundaries of the facilities, the statement said. Small drones in general are limited by the FAA to flights no higher than 400 feet anywhere without special permission.\n\nAn attorney for a coalition of companies that want to make or use drones said the language of the restriction is broadly written and may be used to apply to other types of facilities besides military installations.\n\nThe FAA announcement came as a surprise to the drone industry, said Michael Drobac of the Small UAV Coalition. Companies in general weren't asked for their views ahead of the decision despite efforts to work closely with the agency through numerous committees and working groups, he said. The \"imprecise\" language in the new restrictions leaves drone operators uncertain exactly what will and what won't be allowed, he said.\n\n\"We lack the kind of clarity and specificity that industry depends upon from government,\" Drobac said.\n\nAn aviation law passed by Congress last year requires the FAA to come up with rules to determine what types of facilities, in addition to military facilities, are safety or security critical and may be designated as no-drone zones. The agency was supposed to propose a plan to do that in January, but missed the deadline, Drobrac said.\n\nFAA officials also promised to propose by the end of 2016 long-sought rules under which operators can fly drones over densely populated areas and crowds, which isn't permitted now except by special waiver. The rules are a necessary step to clear the way for package deliveries by drones. But that proposal was derailed at the last minute when military and law enforcement officials expressed concern that they don't have a way yet in which to identify whether drones operating present a threat or not.\n\nFAA officials have now set aside their work on rules for flights over populated areas in order to first address the security concerns.\n\nThe new flight restrictions are effective beginning April 14.

He withstood fire from Democrats over his perceived conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry and the FDA\u2019s failure to address the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic, which he vowed will be his \u201chighest and most immediate priority\u201d if approved.\n\nRegarding his ties to drug companies, Gottlieb has filed an ethics agreement stating he will recuse himself for one year from agency decisions that involve more than 20 health companies he has been connected to.\n\nGottlieb has been endorsed by the National Consumers League, the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship (he is a survivor of Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma), the Global Healthy Living Foundation, the Alliance for Aging Research and by former FDA Commissioners Margaret Hamburg, Robert Califf and Mark McClellan.\n\nBased on his experience as deputy FDA commissioner during the George W. Bush administration and as an entrepreneur who founded a successful cancer biotech company, Gottlieb understands the importance of the FDA in establishing and policing successful treatments. He has written extensively about the importance of timely vaccines for dangerous diseases, including influenza.\n\nA few weeks ago, I had breakfast with Gottlieb at a trendy spot in New York. I forgot to make reservations, so we had to grab a table by the bar \u2014 good food, but hardly exclusive. Scott has always struck me as easygoing and accommodating, and our breakfast did nothing to change that impression. We slid in beside others just as easily as we might have taken a window table in the more exclusive dining room. He instantly passed my George W. Bush test \u2014 he was just as comfortable with waitresses as with millionaires. He came across as very straightforward, and he processed information more quickly in person than in front of a TV camera.\n\nWe discussed pharmaceuticals, and it was clear that his associations informed his vast knowledge base without biasing him. He does not appear to be the kind of person or physician who would ever let anyone ply him for favors. He also displayed confidence and certainty, which will keep those who report to him from grabbing authority for themselves.\n\nScott Gottlieb will never be asleep at the switch. He has a history of mixing personalized, creative solutions with comprehensive data analysis. Perhaps most importantly, for a practicing physician like me, he is known to believe in sharing information about off-label uses of drugs.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2026 FDA labeling is crucial. But most of us develop our greatest treatments from years of experience with off-label uses in the medical trenches. The FDA does not regulate my practice of medicine, but I would love for it to be more directly on the receiving end of what I discover from using the various treatments and medical devices they\u2019ve approved.\n\nAs FDA commissioner, Gottlieb can also play an important role in integrating discoveries in the university setting with discoveries in the drug labs. Better communication can lead to faster approvals when appropriate, especially in keeping with the new 2016 law for that purpose.\n\nGottlieb said he believes in speedier review and approval of generic drugs, which could help bring down prices, but he also said most FDA regulations are \u201cthere for a reason.\u201d In other words, speed often must be sacrificed to ensure safety. He is familiar with the issues that surround drug pricing and the role the \u201cmiddleman\u201d pharmacies play in negotiating. He has written extensively about the need for FDA transparency, including explaining why it rejects a drug.\n\nIn this day of genetically modulated immunotherapy and a future that may well hold a different health pill for each of us, it is hard to think of a candidate better suited to head the FDA than patient-and-doctor-centric Dr. Scott Gottlieb. His experiences as a cancer patient and his work as a practicing hospitalist also count. And if he acquired some of the essential tools he needs at the very source of drug creation, all the better.\n\nOh, by the way \u2014 we split the check.\n\nMarc Siegel, M.D. is a professor of medicine and medical director of Doctor Radio at NYU Langone Medical Center.

Sign up here.**\n\nOn the roster: Donald Trump, exceptionalist - Russian outrage over Syria strikes - It\u2019s official: Gorsuch confirmed as Justice - \u2018Power Play\u2019 plays on - Orgies are a young snake\u2019s game\n\n\n\nDONALD TRUMP, EXCEPTIONALIST\n\nIf you wondered what American exceptionalism looks like, the 59,000 pounds of U.S. warheads raining down on Syria\u2019s air force is a pretty good snapshot.\n\n\n\nAmerica, the apex power of the world, does not tolerate the use of chemical weapons. We forbid it. Another country used chemical weapons \u2013 repeatedly \u2013 in its civil war, so the United States punished that nation by depleting its military.\n\n\n\nThere are other countries in the world with the capability to deliver that kind of firepower and spend something approaching $100 million to send a message about the rules of war. But only the United States has the wherewithal to do so without even breaking a sweat.\n\n\n\nAnd, we dare say, that no other country in the world combines such capabilities with our moral authority. As much maligned, sometimes rightly, as America\u2019s overseas interventions have been, no great power in history can match our track record of the use of force without conquest.\n\n\n\nMembers of Congress, Democratic and Republican, want President Trump to get congressional authorization if he intends to keep up the strikes or undertake, ahem, a forward strategy of freedom to remove Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad from power and install a Western-style liberal democracy in his place.\n\n\n\nBut as for the legality of this attack, there\u2019s not much to debate. As when the British Empire unilaterally decided in 1807 to use its navy to stop the slave trade, powerful nations have special privileges when confronting moral odium. Right and might together are hard to beat.\n\n\n\nAnd that is what the traditional understanding of American Exceptionalism has been, not the more recent vintage that held that it was a little different from patriotism. Exceptionalism does not here refer to the qualities of the nation, but rather that there are exceptions to the rules for this nation because of its qualities.\n\n\n\nAmerica can have nuclear weapons but says that others can\u2019t. America can sail its navy when and where it pleases, but forbid others so to do. And so on\u2026\n\nIt is not fair, but for more than a century, and in some ways since our founding, it is a right which America has claimed and defended as a privilege merited by our virtue.\n\n\n\nNow, you may or may not like that role for our country. You may, as Trump held during his campaign, believe that America is a sap and a sucker that spends money and sheds blood overseas without anything in return, allowing other countries to take advantage of us.\n\n\n\nOr you may believe, as Trump did when his predecessor, Barack Obama, contemplated a similar action punishing for atrocities committed four years ago, that such interventions threaten U.S. national security and divert needed resources from rebuilding the United States.\n\n\n\nAnd given the ways in which America has failed in the exercise of its power over the decades, these are far from unsupported arguments. In fact, what is happening in Syria today can properly be said to substantially descend from a confused and confusing application of American power.\n\n\n\nAnd here we get to the questions with which human beings always struggle the most.\n\n\n\nWe arrange our thinking and pursuits very much around questions relating to the word \u201ccan.\u201d Those are simpler since they relate more to the other understanding of being exceptional -- can we do it? The hard ones are about \u201cshould.\u201d The application of American power, exceptional or not, should always be governed more by the latter than the former.\n\n\n\nBut as for the question of what America\u2019s rightful role in the world is, Trump, after many years arguing the opposite, has placed himself firmly on the side of the exceptionalists.\n\n\n\nRUSSIAN OUTRAGE OVER SYRIA STRIKES\n\nAP: \u201cWorld leaders rallied around the United States after it launched a missile strike early Friday on a Syrian air base in response to this week's chemical attack, while Russia condemned the move as \u2018aggression\u2019 and suspended crucial coordination with Washington in Syria's congested skies. The overnight missile attack, which marked the first time the U.S. has directly targeted Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces, was condemned by his allies in Russia and Iran but welcomed by the Syrian opposition and its supporters, who expressed hope it signaled a turning point in the devastating six-year-old civil war. The bombing represents Trump's most dramatic military order since taking office and thrusts the U.S. administration deeper into the complex Syrian conflict. The Obama administration threatened to attack Assad's forces after previous chemical attacks, but never followed through.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut claim they wouldn\u2019t have been harmed - Miami Herald: \u201cThe Russian military says its facilities in Syria are reliably protected by cutting edge air defense weapons \u2026 Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Friday that the S-400 and Pantsyr air defense systems offer a \u2018guaranteed protection\u2019 to Russian warplanes stationed at Hemeimeem air base in Syria's province of Latakia. He added that a Russian navy outpost in Syria's Mediterranean port of Tartus is protected by S-300 air defense systems. Konashenkov has previously said that the Russian military would help the Syrian military beef up its air defenses following the U.S. strike.\n\n\n\nAnd Iran isn\u2019t happy either - LA Times: \u201cIran on Friday condemned the Trump administration\u2019s missile strikes against Syria, saying the unilateral U.S. action would strengthen terrorists and \u2018further complicate the situation\u2019 in the Middle East. The Islamic republic, a strong ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad, said that while it condemned the use of chemical weapons, the U.S. response was \u2018dangerous, destructive and a violation of international law.\u2019 Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghassemi rejected the conclusion that Assad\u2019s forces had carried out the poison attack on Tuesday that killed more than 70 people in the town of Khan Sheikhoun, in rebel-held Idlib province.\u201d\n\n\n\nSOME MEMBERS OF GOP ARE NOT ON BOARD\n\nThe Hill: \u201cSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said Thursday night that President Trump needs congressional authorization for military action in Syria after Trump ordered an airstrike in retaliation for a deadly chemical attack earlier this week. \u2018While we all condemn the atrocities in Syria, the United States was not attacked,\u2019 Paul said in a statement shortly after reports that the U.S. had launched more than 50 Tomahawk cruise missiles against an airfield in Syria. \u2018The President needs congressional authorization for military action as required by the Constitution, and I call on him to come to Congress for a proper debate,\u2019 Paul said.\n\n\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: ONE COURT TO RULE THEM ALL\n\n\u201cTo avoid the confusion which would unavoidably result from the contradictory decisions of a number of independent judicatories, all nations have found it necessary to establish one court paramount to the rest, possessing a general superintendence, and authorized to settle and declare in the last resort a uniform rule of civil justice.\u201d \u2013 Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 22\n\nTIME OUT: HAIL, LEXINGTON!\n\nHistory: \u201cOn this day in 1776, Navy Captain John Barry, commander of the American warship Lexington, makes the first American naval capture of a British vessel when he takes command of the British warship HMS Edward off the coast of Virginia. The capture of the Edward and its cargo turned Captain Barry into a national hero and boosted the morale of the Continental forces. Barry was born in the seaboard county of Wexford, Ireland, in 1745 and offered his services to the Continental Congress upon the outbreak of the American Revolution. Congress purchased Barry\u2019s ship, Black Prince, which it renamed Alfred and placed under the command of Commodore Esek Hopkins. It was the first ship to fly the American flag, raised by John Paul Jones.\u201d\n\nFlag on the play? - Email us at\n\nHALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.\n\nIT\u2019S OFFICIAL: GORSUCH CONFIRMED AS JUSTICE\n\nAP: \u201cThe Senate confirmed Neil Gorsuch to become the newest associate justice on the Supreme Court Friday, elevating Donald Trump's nominee following a corrosive partisan confrontation that could have lasting impacts for the Senate and the court. Vice President Mike Pence was presiding as the Senate voted 54-45 in favor of Gorsuch, a 49-year-old veteran of the 10th U.S. Circuit of Appeals in Denver whose rulings make him an intellectual heir to the late Justice Antonin Scalia, whose seat he will fill. Gorsuch won support from 51 of the chambers' Republicans as well as three moderate Democrats up for re-election in states Trump won last fall: Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkampof North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana. GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia did not vote.\u201d\n\nTRUMP SON-IN-LAW DIDN\u2019T DISCLOSE RUSSIA MEETINGS\n\nNYT: \u201cWhen Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, sought the top-secret security clearance that would give him access to some of the nation\u2019s most closely guarded secrets, he was required to disclose all encounters with foreign government officials over the last seven years. But Mr. Kushner did not mention dozens of contacts with foreign leaders or officials in recent months. They include a December meeting with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, and one with the head of a Russian state-owned bank, Vnesheconombank, arranged at Mr. Kislyak\u2019s behest. The omissions, which Mr. Kushner\u2019s lawyer called an error, are particularly sensitive given the congressional and F.B.I. investigations into contacts between Russian officials and Trump associates.\u201d\n\n\n\nTell us how you really feel, Steve Bannon - The Daily Beast: Donald Trump\u2019s chief strategist Stephen Bannon has called the president\u2019s senior advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner a \u2018cuck\u2019 and a \u2018globalist\u2019 during a time of high tension between the two top aides, several Trump administration officials told The Daily Beast. The fighting between Kushner and Bannon has been \u2018nonstop\u2019 in recent weeks, according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. It\u2019s been an \u2018open secret\u2019 that Bannon and Kushner often clash \u2018face-to-face,\u2019 according to senior officials.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2018POWER PLAY\u2019 PLAYS ON\n\nAnother week, another round of \u201cPower Play with Chris Stirewalt.\u201d We liked our addition of the weekly news quiz so much we did it again.

Rod Blum shares a lighter moment with Linda McMahon head of the Small Business Administration and the former World Wrestling Entertainment CEO.\n\n\n\nFROM THE BLEACHERS\n\n\u201cI enjoy reading your Halftime Report and here's an Alexander Hamilton thought that's quite timely: \u201cIf a pertinacious minority can control the opinion of a majority...[the government's] situation must always savor of weakness, sometimes border upon anarchy.\u201d I found that in an Atlantic article about Cato turning the Roman senate into a morass. The authors posited that the Founding Fathers were familiar with what Cato's actions led to (the First Triumvirate) and the Feds had no desire for the minority to lead the majority around by the nose. Bipartisan actions are preferable to one-party rule and I hold out hope that senators will seek to serve country rather than party, but what's America without hope? France? The filibuster is not in the U.S. Constitution and deserves the boot. And the absence of the filibuster gives the New York Times one less opportunity to be hypocritical -- sweet!\u201d \u2013 Michael Friend, Atlanta, Ga.\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: You are quite right, Mr. Friend. There is nothing magical about vote thresholds in the U.S. Senate. But I would argue that the increased thresholds have been a good check on the factionalism intensified by direct election over the past century. I do believe the Senate will endure, and may even thrive in this new era. But I still cannot help thinking that the loss of comity, though perhaps unavoidable, will come at some greater cost, especially for the court. A bad idea is not made good by virtue of bipartisan support. It is possible for both parties to be wrong at the same time. What pains me to see, however, is that with the rise of mobocracy, there is so little room for leadership.]\n\n\n\n\u201cAny chance you could describe the difference between partisan and \u2018rank partisan\u2019? Possibly you might look to see if there is a correlation between the rise of the demos replacing the republic and the loss of the \u2018most free\u2019 nation on earth to out of the top 10.\u201d \u2013 George Chapogas, Rivas, Nicaragua\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: I think you\u2019re on to something, Mr. Chapogas! At the risk of sounding sanctimonious, I will say that the difference between a partisan and a rank partisan is ordinal in nature. Partisanship is fine if it still leaves room for putting your country first.]\n\n\n\n\u201cI think you are trying to prove we live in a multiverse. My version of the universe has the last three Democrat Supreme Court nominees getting approved, mostly along philosophical lines, without a talk-a-thon or filibuster. In your version of the universe it\u2019s OK for the Democrats to act like 2 year old, crying because they didn't get their way, because their nominee for the Supreme Court wasn't considered? The lack of getting their nominee considered was exactly because they laid out a set of rules about 40 years ago and then amplified by their ex VP, that said that no Supreme Court nominee from the opposing party would be consider in the last year of their President's term..... Is there a remote possibility that we could bring these two universes back to one, where we can all conduct our conversation based on one set of data, not multiple sets?\u201d \u2013 Paul Hill, New Bern, N.C.\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: There\u2019s no debate that Democrats had it coming on the nuclear option. But whatever universe you live in, it sometimes proves helpful to consider things from a view outside of tu quoque arguments. I don\u2019t blame Republicans for taking the step that they did, but I still lament the deterioration of republican ideals.]\n\n\n\nShare your color commentary: Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM and please make sure to include your name and hometown.\n\n\n\nORGIES ARE A YOUNG SNAKE\u2019S GAME\n\nNat Geo: \u201cRight now in Manitoba, Canada, tens of thousands of red-sided garter snakes are emerging from their winter dens to mate in massive, roiling throngs. While this bizarre reproductive strategy seems like it might be dangerous for the females, who may have upwards of one hundred males trying to mate with each of them at once, a new study published this week in the Royal Society journal Proceedings B finds that it\u2019s the males who suffer most in the long-term. \u2018Our results suggest that the male snakes may face a cost of such intense reproductive investment in the form of shortened telomeres, which cap the ends of chromosomes,\u2019 says Emily Uhrig, a behavioral ecologist who coauthored the study while completing a PhD at Oregon State University.\u201d\n\n\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201cI'm just saying that when a superpower changes its policy radically because a president is moved by pictures, you've got to wonder about the stability of the foreign policy.\u201d \u2013Charles Krauthammer on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier.\u201d\n\nChris Stirewalt is the politics editor for Fox News.

Service members are automatically enrolled for $400,000 in coverage, with a premium of $29 per month, or 7 cents per $1,000 of coverage. SGLI includes separate coverage, known as TSGLI, that provides a payout after a traumatic injury. The premium for that, $1 a month, is automatically added to the cost of SGLI. Service members can decline or decrease the coverage by filling out a form.\n\nTroops can choose who will receive the payout if they are killed. If a married service member elects someone who is not their spouse or if they deny coverage altogether, the government is supposed to send a notification of the change to the spouse.\n\nIn the past, SGLI was updated only via a paper-based system or electronic records through troops' unit personnel offices. A hard copy form could be filled out and turned in, or the form could be electronically signed at the personnel office.\n\nThe new Navy system, launched April 5, allows sailors to update SGLI on their own through a new Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance Online Enrollment System (SOEC) using their DS login or a Common Access Card. The SGLI program is managed by the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nOfficials plan to open the online system to soldiers and airmen this summer and Marines in the fall.

The hospital was bombed shortly afterward, officials said, possibly in an effort to cover up evidence of chemical weapons usage.\n\nThe U.S. says a sarin-like nerve agent was used. Syria denies the claim. And the Kremlin says Syria's government wasn't responsible.\n\nThe U.S. officials also said they're aware of Russians with chemical weapons expertise who've been in Syria.\n\nThe United States and Russia, meanwhile, will maintain a hotline aimed at preventing midair collisions of their warplanes in Syria, senior U.S. military officials said Friday, contradicting Moscow's claims that it has suspended the \"de-confliction\" talks in protest of America's cruise missile strikes on a Syrian air base.\n\nOfficials blamed Russia for failing to control the Syrian government's use of chemical weapons or to account for chemical agents that were supposed to have been eliminated under a 2013 agreement, and questioned whether Russia may have been complicit in Tuesday's horrifying strike that involved the use of a sarin-like nerve gas.\n\nIn Moscow, the Russian government on Friday initially announced it would cut the hotline that was established after Russia joined Syria's civil war in 2015 to help Syrian President Bashar Assad's government against opposition groups.\n\nThe hotline's primary intent is to ensure Russian planes conducting combat missions in Syria's skies don't stumble into an accident or confrontation with aircraft flown by the U.S.-led coalition fighting an Islamic State insurgency in the north of the country.\n\nForeign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova reportedly said later Friday that Moscow would consider reactivating the memorandum with the United States on preventing air incidents in Syria.\n\n\"Today, everyone heard the statement of the Defense Ministry, which gave a clear assessment of this step and what motivated it,\" she was quoted as saying on Russian television station NTV. \"We will proceed from the real situation.\"\n\nBut the senior U.S. military officials, who weren't authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity, said U.S.-Russian discussions have continued since Thursday night's attack on the Syrian military base. They said American officials asked to make sure the military talks would continue, and the Russians said they would.\n\nPressed on whether the Russians were actively participating in the safety calls, one official said conversations were ongoing.\n\nNeither side had previously expressed an interest in severing the line of communication.

While the news media will focus on U.S. \u2013 China issues such as North Korea and the South China Sea, most Americans have a singular concern\u2014China\u2019s unfair trade practices and how China\u2019s cheating threats their job security. When President Trump sits down with the Chinese President, one would hope that he keeps the plight of the American worker close at mind.\n\nThe U.S. aluminum industry, one of America\u2019s most iconic industries, has been decimated by China\u2019s cheating.\n\nOver the last 18 months, more than 3,500 American aluminum workers have lost their jobs due to China\u2019s illegal aluminum subsidies.\n\nIn January 2017, the outgoing Administration finally challenged China\u2019s illegal aluminum subsides at the World Trade Organization (WTO). This is a historic case that for the first time goes right at the heart of how China uses government directed capital to unfairly capture market share at the expense of U.S. workers and their families.\n\nAccording to the consultation request, for years the Chinese government has provided below market loans to aluminum producers, forgiven producers\u2019 debt, and provided highly subsidized energy and other inputs to these companies.\n\nThese subsidies allowed the Chinese aluminum industry to grow much larger than it otherwise would have if it had to compete fairly and causing a massive excess capacity crisis that is weighing on global aluminum prices.\n\nAmerican producers and workers can compete with anyone, but not when foreign governments cheat and rig the system.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to look far for examples of China\u2019s illegal subsidization of its aluminum industry and other key sectors of its economy.\n\nChalco, a Chinese state-owned entity and one of the country\u2019s largest aluminum producers, has over $20 billion in debt and its debt-to-equity ratio is well beyond acceptable industry standards. Like other aluminum producers in China, Chalco used government directed low-interest debt to fuel its massive capacity expansion. From 2008 to 2014, Chalco\u2019s total debt increased by over 131 percent and its total assets increased by nearly 50 percent, yet over this same period Chalco recorded massive losses.\n\nIn 2014, Chalco recorded the largest loss of any Chinese state owned entity. This defies basic logic and economics. In a free market, companies like Chalco would not continue to receive funding at below market rates. However, Chinese state owned banks are recklessly propping up domestic China\u2019s aluminum producers like Chalco.\n\nOther Chinese aluminum producers like China Hongqiao, the world\u2019s largest aluminum producer, use government directed input subsidies to mask the fact that without these subsidies it would not be able to meet its cost of capital.\n\nCurrently, China Hongqiao is under investigation for irregular audit findings and its shares have halted trading on the Hong Kong stock exchange. On Feb. 28, Emerson Analytics released a report saying that Hongqiao has hidden 21.6 billion yuan ($3.14 billion) in costs through underreporting and subsidization, thereby distorting its true profitability. \"Our investigations and analysis have shown that, mainly through underreported costs and subsidies provided by connected parties disguised as independent third parties, China Hongqiao has fabricated the profitability that vastly exceeds those of its peers,\" it said.\n\nThe case of Chalco and China\u2019s Hongqiao are emblematic of the Chinese economic model that is built upon massive amounts of highly subsidized directed credit to build and expand what would otherwise be uneconomic production and capacity at the expense of U.S. producers and thousands of ordinary hard working Americans. American workers are paying the price for China\u2019s industrial debt problem.\n\nIronically, in the early 2000s when China joined the WTO, aluminum experts expected China to be a net importer. But, China has abused the rules. Fast forward to 2016, China produced more than half of the world\u2019s aluminum without any natural comparative advantage other than unprecedented government support, causing a massive amount of excess production capacity to overhang the aluminum market. This has depressed prices by more than 45 percent, making it incredibly challenging for competitors to keep up.\n\nThe consequences in the U.S. are far and wide. A recent Economic Policy Institute report notes that the United States bears a uniquely large burden, suffering more than other countries from subsidized and dumped imports in these industries.\n\nIn 2001, when China joined the WTO, there were 18 aluminum smelters in the United States. Today, there are only five. The loss extends beyond the smelters to American workers, their families, and their communities.\n\nPresident Xi\u2019s visit is a chance for President Trump to call out China\u2019s cheating, put American workers first and demonstrate his commitment to hold China accountable to the obligations it agreed to abide by when it joined the WTO and continue the WTO case against China\u2019s illegal aluminum subsidies. American producers and their workers need real concrete action.\n\nAs part of his bold vision to Make America Great Again, President Trump needs to make it clear to China that its illegal trade practices will no longer be tolerated and keep the plight of Americans close at mind when he sits down with the Chinese leader.\n\nRepublican Judd Gregg is a former governor and three-term senator from New Hampshire.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/04/07/what-trump-needs-to-tell-xi-chinas-illegal-trade-practices-will-no-longer-be-tolerated.html"}, {"text": "More than 30 lawmakers sent a letter to President Trump on Thursday in a renewed call for IRS Commissioner John Koskinen to step down from his post before the end of his term.\n\nHouse Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and 37 House members sent the letter, which accused Koskinen\u2019s of providing false testimony to Congress and obstructing the congressional investigation into the IRS targeting of conservative political groups.\n\n\u201cSo long as the IRS commissioner is a man who has misled the people, destroyed evidence, and failed his legal duties to the people\u2019s representatives on Congress, the IRS is not \u2018controlled by the people\u2019,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cFor that reason, we request you immediately remove Koskinen.\u201d\n\nThe White House had no comment.\n\nCommissioner Koskinen testified before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday, where he reaffirmed his commitment to staying on until the end of his five-year term, which is set to end on November 13 unless President Trump removes him.

Col. Warren Cook, commander of 2/4, said in a statement.\n\nThe Marines ultimately were sent to NJP because of derogatory comments made about one of their more senior enlisted leaders, officials said, but the comments were discovered through investigation into inappropriate comments about women. The prosecutions were first reported by The Washington Post.\n\n\"The issue began very similar to others we've discussed, akin to making comments online about [a] woman or women,\" the assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Glenn Walters, told reporters at the Pentagon on Friday. \"In the comments that transpired underneath it, they made comments about a variety of subjects, which opened them up to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\"\n\nThe command was alerted to derogatory comments posted on the social media page \"United States Grunt Corps\" on April 5, according to Cook's statement.

As one element of that, he said, potential recruits will now be counseled on appropriate online conduct before they reach boot camp.\n\n\"The good news here was that we published this guidance, we got the commanders trained, and this happened without us knowing,\" Walters said of the punishment handed out to the two enlisted Marines. \"This is a good news story because we've got commanders taking action to police up their people for their online behavior.\"\n\n-- Hope Hodge Seck can be reached at hope.seck@military.com.

In February 1982, he ordered a nearly month-long military besiegement of Hama to crack down on the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s anti-government uprising. The attack left about 30,000 civilians dead, according to the Syrian Human Rights Committee.\n\nWhen Hafez al-Assad died in 2000, his son and current president, Bashar al-Assad, took control of the country. In 2011, inspired by Arab Spring protests against then-Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Syrians took to the streets in anti-government protests.\n\nThe turning point came in March 2011, when security forces arrested and tortured a group of boys for painting anti-government graffiti on their school, according to Al Jazeera. The response from the Syrian government in follow-up protests were violent, including security forces firing upon demonstrators in Darra later that month and raiding a sit-in in Homs in April 2011. Protesters began to arm themselves as a result.\n\nPower struggle\n\nAs the anti-Assad rebellion grew, local militias and Syrian Armed Forces defectors formed the Free Syrian Army \u2013 an armed group aimed at toppling the Assad regime.\n\nMCCAIN CALLS FOR RENEWED SUPPORT FOR FREE SYRIAN ARMY, ESTABLISHMENT OF NO-FLY ZONES\n\nBeyond policy, anti-government sentiment began taking sectarian tones as the majority of opposition fighters were Sunni Muslims, according to the BBC. Sunni Islam is the most popular religious domination, but Assad is part of the Shia Alawite sect.\n\nInstability in the area with gunfights and indiscriminate attacks spreading across the country also were compounded with the growing Islamic State movement. Attacks conducted by the Islamic State gained global attention, leading to the U.S. conducting airstrikes against the jihadist group in September 2014.\n\nDanger and violence from these factions have forced at least 5 million Syrians to flee their homeland since the conflict began, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, sparking an ongoing global humanitarian crisis as refugees seek safety in other countries.\n\nChemical weapon attacks\n\nSuspected state use of chemical weapons is a recurring issue. In March 2013, a sarin nerve gas attack killed 26, including government soldiers in Khan al-Assal, Syria. Then, in August 2013, hundreds were killed after ground-to-ground missiles filled with sarin nerve gas struck the rebel-held civilian suburbs of Damascus.\n\nThen-U.S. President Barack Obama said in 2012 that the use of chemical weapons would change his stance on intervening in Syria\u2019s civil war.\n\nREVEALED: FIRST PHOTOS OF ASSAD AIDE HEADING SYRIA'S CHEMICAL WEAPONS UNIT\n\nFacing possible intervention and pressure from the U.N. Security Council, in October 2013, Bashar al-Assad agreed to add Syria to the Chemical Weapons Convention. The agreement \u201caims to eliminate an entire category of weapons of mass destruction by prohibiting the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, transfer, or use of chemical weapons\u201d by member states. In turn, member states are expected to enforce the chemical weapons prohibition within their jurisdiction.\n\nThe Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the implementing body of the Chemical Weapons Convention, reported in June 2014 that all of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons were removed. But Syrian opposition officials contested the finding, stating that not all the weapons were accounted for.\n\nIn August 2015, at the behest of the United Nations, the OPCW was deployed to investigate reports of state chlorine gas attacks against civilians in rebel-held areas. The panel eventually found that the Syrian government used helicopters to launch chlorine gas in civilian areas of the northern Idlib province.\n\nForeign players\n\nRussia has backed Assad by offering arms and political support. To complicate matters, it is suspected that Russia\u2019s involvement in anti-Islamic State airstrikes actually have targeted opposition-held areas, including hospitals and schools.\n\nAmnesty International reported evidence of \"at least six deliberate attacks on hospitals, medical centres, and clinics in the northern part of the Aleppo Countryside governorate in the past 12 weeks.\"\n\nRUSSIAN WARSHIP STEAMS TOWARD US DESTROYERS THAT LAUNCHED SYRIA STRIKES\n\n\n\nSyria also finds support in neighboring Iran.\n\nOther countries in the region, including Saudi Arabia and Turkey, have backed Syrian rebels. The U.S. also helped to arm rebels to dually fight the Assad regime and Islamic State militants.\n\nU.S. airstrike on Syrian airbase\n\nThe order of missile strikes on an airbase near Homs was in response to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s suspected chemical weapons attack on civilians Tuesday that \u201cchoked out the lives of helpless men, women, and children,\u201d Trump said in a televised address.

Despite that report, members of the Obama administration continued to claim they had been successful in disarming Assad\u2019s chemical weapons arsenal.\n\nThey routinely touted the diplomatic nature of the joint U.S.-and-Russia brokered deal.\n\nObama issued his infamous \u201cred line\u201d warning to Syria\u2019s leader in 2012 not to use chemical weapons. In 2013, when reports surfaced that Assad used sarin gas to kill his people, the deal to remove chemical weapons was intended to avert military action.\n\nThe president himself on Aug. 18. 2014 said that \u201cthe most lethal declared chemical weapons possessed by the Syrian regime were destroyed by dedicated U.S. civilian and military professionals\u201d and that it had been done \u201cseveral weeks ahead of schedule.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2015, then-White House Press Secretary John Earnest praised Russia for its role in destroying the chemical weapons stockpile of the Assad regime.\n\n\u201cThat was an important step, because it reduced, or essentially eliminated, the proliferation risk from that declared chemical weapons stockpile, that we could essentially destroy those chemical weapons and ensure that terrorists would not be able to get their hands on them and use them in other places.\u201d\n\nFive months later on June 17, 2015, Earnest said that the \u201cdeclared chemical weapons stockpile that Assad previously denied existed has now been acknowledged, rounded up, removed from the country and destroyed precisely because of the work of this administration and our successful efforts to work with the Russians to accomplish that goal.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday night, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson slammed Russia for failing to do its part in preventing the Syrian government from using chemical weapons, despite the 2013 agreement to remove weapons from the country.\n\n\u201cEither Russia has been complicit or Russia has been simply incompetent,\u201d Tillerson said.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/07/susan-rice-obama-colleagues-take-heat-for-past-claims-on-syria-chemical-weapons-purge.html"}, {"text": "The Senate confirmed Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court on Friday, filling the critical ninth seat that has been vacant for over a year and capping a tumultuous debate that saw Republicans overhaul the way the chamber operates in order to overcome what they described as an unprecedented Democratic filibuster.\n\nThe 54-45 vote, in which three Democrats crossed party lines to support the appeals court justice, is expected to restore a 5-4 conservative tilt on the bench.

This is a dangerous and morally wrong policy.\n\nBut no matter your view of the merits of engaging in Syria, every member of Congress should stand up today and reclaim our Constitutional authority over war.\n\nThe Constitution clearly states that it is Congress that has the power to declare war, not the president. Even the War Powers Resolution, shoved forward by hawks as justification, clearly states criteria under which the president may act \u2013 a declaration of war, a specific statutory authorization, or a national emergency created by an attack on the United States.\n\nThat\u2019s it. Absent those criteria, the president has no authority to act without congressional authorization. Congress must stand up and assert its authority here and now.\n\nNo president is above the law or the Constitution. I said so when it was Barack Obama, and I will say so when it is Donald Trump.\n\nOur Founding Fathers had this right, and we should heed their wisdom about allowing the president to have war powers. They were concerned the president could rule like a king.\n\nMadison wrote that the Constitution supposes what history demonstrates \u2013 that the executive is the branch most interested in war and most prone to it. The Constitution, therefore, with studied care, vested that power in the legislature.\n\nBefore any act of war, we should have a serious and thoughtful debate over the ramifications.\n\nIn Syria \u2013 what is our goal?

But more importantly, it epitomizes the bond shared by all those wearing the uniform, past and present. The bond of service.\n\nOn Sept. 27, 1942, Munro volunteered to lead the evacuation and rescue of a battalion of Marines trapped by enemy forces. Munro maneuvered his boat to provide cover for the Marines and was fatally wounded.\n\nMunro sacrificed his own life to save those Marines -- men who went on to change the world.

By his side in combat were Samuel Roberts and Raymond Evans.\n\nNavy Coxswain Samuel Roberts volunteered to join Munro and go back to rescue the battalion.

Pauley\n\nDubbed by many observers as the hot-button issue case of this Supreme Court\u2019s sitting and arguably the biggest church-state case in recent memory, the justices will be asked to address the question, \u201cWhether the exclusion of churches from an otherwise neutral and secular aid program violates the Free Exercise and Equal Protection Clauses when the state has no valid Establishment Clause concern.\u201d\n\nIn layman\u2019s terms, the preschool at Trinity Lutheran Church in Missouri filed suit after being denied state funds to improve a playground\u2019s surface used by its preschool by replacing gravel with softer recycled rubber.\n\nThe state funds are from a program that gives grants to nonprofits seeking a safer recreational environment for children. Missouri's law -- similar to those in 37 other states -- prohibits direct government aid to educational institutions that have a religious affiliation.\n\nTrinity Lutheran and its supporters are hoping that given his past rulings on religious liberty cases, Gorsuch will tip the scales in favor of the parochial schools. While Gorsuch has not publicly weighed in on this case, many observers say his ruling on the Hobby Lobby Stores v. Sebelius case indicates where he stands.\n\nIn that case \u2013 where Hobby Lobby sued to challenge the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that employer\u2019s insurance must cover all forms of birth control \u2013 Gorsuch wrote in his opinion that courts can\u2019t \u201cdecide whether a religious teaching about complicity imposes \u2018too much\u2019 moral disapproval on those only \u2018indirectly\u2019 assisting wrongful conduct.\u201d\n\nGorsuch\u2019s 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that federal law prohibited the ACA requirement from applying to closely held corporations and the ruling was later upheld in the Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision.\n\n\u201cGorsuch seems to be on the side believing that government programs should treat religious freedoms fairly and should recognize the rights of religious organizations to participate in public welfare-type programs,\u201d Stephen Wermiel, a professor at American University\u2019s Washington School of Law told Fox News.\n\nWeaver v. Massachusetts and Davila v. Davis\n\nBoth of these cases deal with the Sixth Amendment, the right to a speedy and public trial, and both center around a defendant\u2019s rights and counsel being misused.\n\nIn the case of Kentel Weaver, who as a 16-year-old in 2003 murdered a 15-year-old boy, his legal team argues that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated and he had inadequate representation. A court officer kept the public, including his family, locked out for two days while a jury was selected and Weaver\u2019s trial lawyers did not object to the move.\n\nLawyers for Erick Davila \u2013 a Texas gang member convicted of killing a five-year-old girl and her grandmother in a drive-by shooting \u2013 question both whether he was provided with ineffective counsel and what legal remedies are afforded to capital defendants.\n\nThe Stanford Law Review called Gorsuch\u2019s rulings on Sixth Amendment cases both \u201crestrained\u201d and \u201cinterpretive,\u201d noting that his opinions have stated a well-developed position on at least one aspect: \u201cineffective assistance of counsel claims.\u201d\n\nGorsuch\u2019s idea of judicial restraint and pragmatism differentiates him from Scalia, whose time on the bench saw him frequently rule in favor of the defendant.\n\nThe Supreme Court has long held that a defendant who pleads guilty based on bad advice can show prejudice by demonstrating \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he \u2026 would have insisted on going to trial,\u201d the Stanford Law Review noted. \u201cWhile he admitted that counsel can be ineffective at the plea bargaining phase, Gorsuch would only find a Sixth Amendment infringement where that ineffectiveness denied the defendant \u2018his constitutional entitlement to a trial.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe review added: \u201c[A] criminal defendant with Sixth Amendment claims can fairly expect an uphill battle to win his vote.\u201d\n\nMaslenjak v. U.S.\n\nIn the last scheduled argument of the term, the justices will hear the case of Divna Maslenjak of Ohio -- an ethnic Serb from Bosnia \u2013 who was stripped of her U.S. citizenship for lying about the circumstances that brought her to this country.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit ruled -- in direct conflict with the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the 1st, 4th, 7th and 9th Circuits -- that a naturalized American citizen can be stripped of her citizenship in a criminal proceeding based on immaterial false statements.\n\nGorsuch\u2019s record on immigration cases shows that he is neither a staunch defender nor a critic of immigrant rights. During his time on the bench in the 10th Circuit, Gorsuch handled only a few prominent immigration-related cases and ruled in favor of the immigrant slightly less than half the time.\n\nWhen hearing Alejandre-Gallegos v. Holder last year, Gorsuch initiated disciplinary proceedings against an attorney who he stated had repeatedly done a poor job representing immigrants.\n\nGorsuch, however, in the case Porro v. Barnes overturned a ruling in a lower court favoring an immigrant who had been shot with a Taser by jailers. While Gorsuch said that the jail did ignore federal policy that prohibits the uses of Tasers on immigration detainees, he ruled that this action did not violate the person\u2019s constitutional rights.\n\nCalifornia Public Employees' Retirement System v. ANZ Securities, Inc.\n\nAnother case Gorsuch will hear centers on whether certain class-action securities lawsuits can be barred because they were filed too late.\n\nThe retirement fund in California has sued various financial institutions over their alleged role in the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers.\n\nHow the justices rule in this case is expected to have serious consequences for institutional investors and also will determine whether putative class members must file individual complaints before the three-year period imposed by Section 13 of the Securities Act has run out.\n\nFox News\u2019 Bill Mears contributed reporting to this piece.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/04/supreme-court-5-cases-gorsuch-will-hear-in-his-first-month-on-bench.html"}, {"text": "The office of Syria\u2019s President Bashar al-Assad on Friday denounced the U.S. missile strike against one of its air bases as \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cirresponsible.\u201d\n\nThe statement claimed the strikes were \u201cshortsighted\u201d and reflected a continuation of policy based on targeting and \u201csubjugating people,\u201d regardless of which administration is in charge.\n\nU.S. LAUNCHES MISSILES INTO SYRIA IN RESPONSE TO CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK\n\nThe U.S. military blasted the Shayrat air base near Homs with a barrage of cruise missiles in fiery retaliation for this week\u2019s gruesome chemical weapons attack against civilians.

Job gains in January and February had averaged a robust 218,000, fueled partly by strong hiring in construction, which occurred because of unseasonably warm winter weather.\n\nAs a result, economists had expected a falloff in hiring in March. Still, the drop last month was worse than expected.\n\nIt its jobs report Friday, the government also revised down the job growth for January and February by a combined 38,000. And it reported that average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent in March from February and have risen 2.7 percent over the past 12 months.\n\nThe unemployment rate fell because nearly a half-million more Americans reported finding jobs, the Labor Department said.\n\nLast month, construction companies added just 6,000 jobs, the fewest in seven months. Retailers, suffering from the shift to online shopping, slashed 30,000 jobs. Education and health care services added the fewest jobs for that category in 15 months.\n\nIn the past three months, employers have added an average of 178,000 jobs, roughly the same as last year's solid pace.\n\n\"Job growth this year is running close to last year's pace and is running well ahead of what is needed to keep up with labor force growth,\" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services.\n\nThe report showed that large numbers of teenagers, women and Latinos found jobs last month. The unemployment rate for teens dropped to 13.7 percent from 15 percent.\n\nThe number of part-time workers who would prefer full-time jobs declined. As a result, an alternative gauge of unemployment, which includes those part-timers as well as people who have given up their job hunts, dropped to 8.9 percent. That is the lowest such rate in over nine years.\n\nThe economy appears to have slowed in the first three months of the year, though most economists expect a rebound in the current April-June quarter.\n\nConsumer and business sentiment has soared since the November presidential election, but the increased optimism hasn't yet accelerated growth. Consumers actually slowed their spending in January and February, when adjusted for inflation. Any such pullback tends to exert a drag because consumers account for about 70 percent of the economy.\n\nBusinesses have been ordering more high-cost manufactured good since fall, a reflection of stepped-up investment. But those orders slipped in February and remain below levels of a year ago.\n\nStill, some areas of the economy are humming: Developers are building more homes, with construction starts up 7.5 percent in January and February compared with a year earlier. And home sales reached their highest level in a decade in January before slipping a bit in February.\n\nWhat's more, for the first time in years, overseas growth stands to boost the U.S. economy. Germany's factories enjoyed a surge in orders in February. The rest of Europe, as well as Japan, is reporting faster growth, and China is stabilizing after fears about its outsize debts roiled markets last year.\n\nMany economists expect hiring to fall back eventually to last year's pace or even lower as the unemployment rate declines and companies struggle to fill jobs. Yet hiring could remain strong if more Americans come off the sidelines and start looking for work again. The proportion of Americans who are either working or looking for work remains far below pre-recession levels.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/07/us-adds-just-98k-jobs-unemployment-falls-to-low-4-5-percent.html"}, {"text": "President Trump\u2019s decision to strike an Assad airfield drew bipartisan praise from some of his biggest critics \u2013 while also renewing the dormant debate over Congress\u2019 role in approving military actions.\n\nSens.

Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who has been critical of Trump\u2019s past statements defending Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, had nothing but positive words for the U.S. president on Friday morning. As the Trump administration now takes a firmer stance against Russia\u2019s support for Assad, Rubio told \u201cFox & Friends\u201d the missile attacks on the airfield thought to be the staging point for this week\u2019s deadly chemical weapons strike was \u201cthe right choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt had to be done,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nRubio also defended Trump\u2019s authority to launch the strikes.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have 535 commanders-in-chief, we have one,\u201d he said, stressing that the cruise missile strikes do not constitute a declaration of war.\n\nSome lawmakers, though, contend that Congress has a role here \u2013 an argument that last played out when Syria action was considered under the Obama administration.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, both called on Trump to come to Congress.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution gives the power to authorize the use of military force to the legislative branch. Expanded military intervention in Syria requires action by Congress,\u201d Warren said in a statement. \u201cIf President Trump expects such an authorization, he owes the American people an explanation of his strategy to bring an end to the violence in Syria. We should not escalate this conflict without clear goals and a plan to achieve them.\u201d\n\nThe War Powers Resolution, enacted in 1973 required the president to consult with Congress before sending U.S. armed forces into combat unless there already had been a declaration of war. The troops could not stay more than 90 days unless lawmakers backed the decision. The law also sought to give the president \"leeway to respond to attacks or other emergencies,\" according to the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nPresidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and now Trump have used that leeway to their advantage. Following the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001, Congress gave Bush authority to attack any countries or groups involved in the attacks, which was generally accepted to mean Al Qaeda. Obama used that same authority to fight the Islamic State militant group, which emerged in 2014 as an outgrowth of Al Qaeda. Trump has used that same authority to continue military action in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria.\n\nIn February 2015, Obama asked Congress to formally authorize war against the Islamic State. His resolution would have limited authorization to three years, with no geographic restrictions for U.S. forces. Congress held a few hearings, but never acted on the proposal.\n\nSeveral Democrats praised Trump\u2019s missile strikes Thursday night, following bipartisan outrage over what officials assert was a sarin gas attack by the Assad regime that killed civilians earlier this week.\n\n\u201cMaking sure Assad knows that when he commits such despicable atrocities he will pay a price is the right thing to do,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement. \u201cIt is incumbent on the Trump administration to come up with a strategy and consult with Congress before implementing it.

Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., also said the strike \u201cappears to be a proportional response to \u2026 the regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons.\u201d\n\nHowever, she noted that if Trump plans to escalate U.S. military involvement in Syria, \u201che must to come to Congress for an Authorization for Use of Military Force which is tailored to meet the threat and prevent another open-ended war in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nShe followed that up with a letter Friday to House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., calling for the House to be summoned back into session to debate a formal authorization.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/07/trumps-syria-strike-draws-praise-from-critics-but-renews-debate-over-congress-role.html"}, {"text": "The U.S. missile strike targeting a major Syrian air base near Homs early Friday destroyed about 20 Syrian jets, two senior defense officials with knowledge of the strike told Fox News.\n\nWH photo (ed for security): @potus receives briefing on #syria military strike fr Nat Security team, inc @vp , SECDEF, CJCS via secure VTC pic.twitter.com/aaCnR7xomR \u2014 Sean Spicer (@PressSec) April 7, 2017\n\nNone of the jets managed to take off and escape before U.S. missiles hit the target, the officials said, adding that all of the destroyed aircraft were jets -- not helicopters.

Rice has strenuously denied any involvement in the leaking.\n\nLawmakers with the House and Senate intelligence committees are currently complaining that the FBI, CIA and National Security Agency are not cooperating with their requests for information that bears on the leaks, an accusation that all three agencies deny.\n\nRice has defended her requests to \u201cunmask\u201d such identities in a number of surveillance transcripts as routine and said that the names were needed to provide context \u201cin order to understand the importance of the report and understand the significance.\u201d\n\nOfficials from previous Administrations who had made similar unmasking requests in the past have noted that they are rare and anything but routine, given the paperwork involved.\n\nJohn Bolton, a former Assistant Secretary of State and U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., told Fox News that during four years in government he made ten such requests in all, while examining \u201cthousands\u201d of intelligence reports where such identities were restricted. (Bolton is a Fox News contributor.)\n\nHe added that at least in the past the unmasking did not extend to everyone who subsequently read the surveillance documents, but only to the person who requested the specific identity. \u201cIt is not revealed in any other intercept,\u201d he said.\n\nMoreover, he noted, any intended use of the unmasked material beyond what was covered in the written requests for it would amount to \u201cfalse statements\u201d to a federal agency, itself a crime.\n\nAs it happens, Rice\u2019s public explanation that the identities were needed for context tracks closely with one of that rationales mentioned on page 12 of the procedures document for releasing what is called \u201cU.S. person information,\u201d or USPI: \u201cto understand the foreign intelligence or counterintelligence information or assess its importance.\u201d\n\nA \u201cnonexclusive\u201d list of examples that follows that heading largely points to cases where the \u201cU.S. person\u201d might be engaged in spying or unauthorized disclosure of classified information, narcotics trafficking, or be the target of \u201chostile intelligence activities of a foreign power.\u201d\n\nIn cases involving \u201ca senior official of the Executive Branch of the U.S. Government,\u201d the document advises, \u201cnormally only the official\u2019s title will be disseminated.\u201d\n\nThe document adds that \u201ca high-level official of the recipient [requesting agency] will ensure that domestic political or personal information that is not necessary to understand foreign intelligence r counterintelligence or assess its importance is not retained or disseminated.\u201d\n\nThe procedures document also strictly ordains that \u201ca [requesting agency] receiving raw SIGINT [unredacted surveillance information] under these Procedures may not further disseminate the raw SIGINT it obtains\u201d without authorization from the Director of National Intelligence\u2014a decision that involves further consulting with NSA\u2019s General Counsel about whether that is possible.\n\nIn other unspecified cases, even more sign-offs, from the National Security Division of the Department of Justice and the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, may be required.\n\nThe same thicket of oversight is also supposed to be applied to the sensitive raw information once it has been handed over to whoever asked for it, through the requestor\u2019s \u201coversight and compliance program\u201d --which must be reviewed and approved by the Director of National Intelligence\u2019s Civil Liberties Protection Officer.\n\nAmong other things, this compliance program is supposed to \u201censure that the [requesting agency] does not improperly retain and/or disseminate USPI\u201d it had received.\n\nGeorge Russell is Editor-at-Large of Fox News.

The proposed agreement to remedy the abuses was negotiated during the final days of President Barack Obama's administration.\n\nBaltimore Solicitor David Ralph said Thursday that the plan was designed to help police fight crime while also protecting residents' rights and repairing trust between the community and the department.\n\nThe plan discourages officers from writing up minor offenses such as loitering and bars them from arresting people simply because they are in high-crime areas. It also calls for more training for officers on handling mentally ill people, and the continuation of a program that is issuing body cameras to all officers.\n\nThe agreement is subject to approval by U.S. District Judge James Bredar. It would then be up to him to make sure the parties abide by it.\n\nThe Justice Department initially wanted the judge to postpone the hearing. He refused, and now the department wants him to delay signing the agreement for at least 30 days. Bredar did not indicate when he would decide on the plan.\n\nThe Obama Justice Department opened roughly two dozen investigations of police departments, and 14 of them ended in consent decrees, in such cities as Ferguson, Missouri; Miami; Cleveland; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and Newark, New Jersey.\n\nIn a memo made public this week, however, Sessions ordered a review of all such consent decrees, saying the federal government should not be managing local law enforcement agencies. He also said heavy scrutiny of the police is making them less aggressive and leading to a rise in crime in some cities.\n\nNearly all residents who testified Thursday voiced strong support for the consent decree and urged the judge to sign it swiftly.\n\n\"Non-white residents feel distrustful, attacked, bullied, defensive, scared, scarred and singled out,\" said Shantay Guy, a community mediator. \"Officers generally feel misunderstood, ill-equipped, labeled, targeted, mischaracterized, stereotyped, demoralized, criticized and limited.\"\n\nShe added: \"Both groups indicate that change is important to them \u2014 change in their interactions with each other that give them the safety and respect they're looking for.\"\n\nThe judge also heard from mothers whose sons were killed by police.\n\n\"I don't know if the officer was anxious, but he shouldn't have been the judge, jury and executioner,\" said Darlene Cain, who said she lost her 29-year-old son.\n\n\"It's very important for all of our children to realize their lives matter.

Let's keep it going, & help all Arizona kids succeed!\"\n\nThe program will give Arizona one of broadest voucher programs in the nation.\n\nThe law comes at a time with considerable national momentum behind school choice, punctuated by the confirmation of Betsy DeVos as President Donald Trump's Education Secretary. The billionaire is a vocal supporter of school choice and voucher programs, putting the nation's top education official firmly behind the Arizona proposal.\n\nDeVos tweeted Thursday night lauding the decision, calling it a \"big win for students and parents in Arizona.\"\n\nTechnically called Empowerment Scholarship Accounts, the Arizona program allows parents to take between 90 percent and 100 percent of the state money a local public school would receive to pay for private or religious education. The average student who isn't disabled will get about $4,400 a year, but some get much more.\n\nNevada has a similar plan applying to all students, but its funding mechanism was recently struck down by the state Supreme Court.\n\nThe original Arizona plan was estimated to cost the state general fund at least $24 million, but the revised plan adds up to a savings of $3.4 million by 2022.\n\nDemocrats questioned findings by the Legislature's budget analysts, noting that the analysis also said children of wealthy parents who already planned to send their children to private schools would now get state money to help pay for that tuition.\n\nThe measure had been stalled for nearly two months as opposition from a handful of GOP lawmakers and all Democrats left the measure short of votes.\n\nMinority Democrats said the expansion will swamp the state's general fund and siphon cash from public schools, which already rank near the bottom in terms of state funding nationally. They predicted the enrollment cap will be gone.\n\n\"The cap will come off,\" House minority leader Rebecca Rios said. \"Make no mistake.\"\n\nSince the initial program was adopted in 2011, it has expanded to cover about a third of all students, including children attending failing schools, those living on Indian reservations, foster children and children of military members.\n\nDespite those increases, the program has remained relatively small, but expanding it to all students would allow parents who now send their children to private schools to use the program.\n\nDucey said at a January school choice event that he'll continue to be an advocate for using state tax money for charter and private schools and home-schooling. That's despite low funding for public schools in the state.\n\nDucey proposed a 2 percent raise for teachers over five years in his budget, a figure that has been widely panned by education advocates.\n\n\"I was really surprised to hear that the governor was making this a priority,\" said Joe Thomas, president of the Arizona Education Association, which represents public school teachers. \"I don't remember this as part of state of the state address.

He called those charges \u201centirely false and politically motivated,\u201d essentially saying he was stepping down from his committee\u2019s probe to avoid becoming a distraction.\n\nBut even some Republicans and conservatives had urged Nunes to take precisely that step.\n\nThe problem was that the California congressman acted more like a Trump ally than the chairman of a bipartisan investigation.

Nevertheless, Russia's Deputy U.N. ambassador Vladimir Safronkov warned that any negative consequences from the strikes would be on the \"shoulders of those who initiated such a doubtful and tragic enterprise.\"\n\nDavis, the Pentagon spokesman, confirmed that \"there are Russians at the base,\" but said they had been warned \"multiple times\" to leave. He did not know whether Russian aircraft were at the base when the missiles hit.\n\nThe U.S. also notified its partner countries in the region prior to launching the strikes.\n\nU.S. defense officials tell Fox News that two warships based in the eastern Mediterranean, the USS Porter and the USS Ross, have been training for the past two days to execute this mission.\n\n\u201cOur forward deployed ships give us the capability to quickly respond to threats,\" said a Navy official. \"These strikes in Syria are a perfect example - this is why we're there.\"\n\nThe original plans called for two targets, the airbase and a chemical weapons storage facility. However, Pentagon planners decided late Thursday to target just the airbase.\n\nAs a candidate, Trump warned against against the U.S. getting pulled into the Syrian civil war. But the president earlier in the week appeared moved by the photos of children killed in the chemical attack.\n\n\"I think what happened in Syria is one of the truly egregious crimes and shouldn't have happened and it shouldn't be allowed to happen,\" Trump told reporters traveling on Air Force One to Florida earlier , where he was holding a two-day summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nLate Thursday, a U.S. government official told Fox News that the intelligence community has high confidence that the attack was carried out by Syrian government aircraft. The official said the analysis was consistent with eyewitness reports that fixed-wing aircraft launched the strike.\n\nThe official described the use of sarin gas in the attack as a watershed. The Assad government had agreed to disband its chemical weapons capability by 2014 under an agreement coordinated with the Obama administration and Russia. Tuesday's attack was considered a breach of that agreement.\n\nThe Turkish ministry of health says the preliminary results show the use of sarin gas. Sarin is a colorless, odorless liquid and is highly volatile while moving from its liquid state to a gas. Unlike chlorine, which the Assad government has used on a regular basis, sarin does not dissipate quickly. The victims in Tuesday\u2019s attack showed all the hallmarks of a sarin attack \u2013 including twitching, jerking and foaming at the mouth.\n\nTrump's decision to attack Syria came three-and-a-half years after President Barack Obama threatened Assad with military action after an earlier chemical weapons attack killed hundreds outside of Damascus. Obama had declared the use of such weapons a \"red line.\" At the time, several American ships in the Mediterranean were poised to launch missiles, only for Obama to abruptly pull back after key U.S. ally Britain and the U.S. Congress balked at his plan.\n\nHe opted instead for the Russian-backed plan that was supposed to remove and eliminate Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles.\n\nThe world learned of the chemical attack earlier in the week in footage that showed people dying in the streets and bodies of children stacked in piles.\n\nThe U.S. show of force in Syria raises legal questions. It's unclear what authority Trump is relying on to attack another government. When Obama intervened in Libya in 2011, he used a U.N. Security Council mandate and NATO's overall leadership of the mission to argue that he had legal authority \u2014 arguments that many Republicans opposed. Trump can't rely on either justification here.\n\nUnclear also is whether Trump is adopting any broader effort to combat Assad. Under Obama, the United States largely pulled back from its support for so-called \"moderate\" rebels when Russia's military intervention in September 2015 led them to suffer a series of battlefield defeats. Instead, Obama sought to work with Russia on a negotiated transition.\n\nTrump and his top aides had acknowledged in recent days the \"reality\" of Assad being in power, saying his ouster was no longer a priority. But the chemical weapons attack seemed to spur a rethink. In Florida on Thursday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said of Assad: \"There's no role for him to govern the Syrian people.\"\n\nFox News' Catherine Herridge and the Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nJennifer Griffin currently serves as a national security correspondent for FOX News Channel .

Another statement, also attributed to an unnamed official, referred to \"losses.\" The officials did not elaborate.\n\nTalal Barazi, the governor of Homs province, where the targeted air base is located, told The Associated Press by phone that most of the strikes appeared to target the province in central Syria.

This is totally wrong.\"\n\nRussia has provided military support for the Syrian government since September 2015, turning the balance of power in Assad's favor. Moscow has used its veto power at the Security Council on several occasions since the civil war began six years ago to prevent sanctions against Damascus.\n\nSyria maintains it didn't use chemical weapons, blaming opposition fighters for stockpiling the chemicals. Russia's Defense Ministry said the toxic agents were released when a Syrian airstrike hit a rebel chemical weapons arsenal and munitions factory on the eastern outskirts of Khan Sheikhoun.\n\n\"I stress, once again, that the Syrian Arab Army did not and will not use such weapons even against the terrorists who are targeting our people,\" Syria's Foreign Minister Walid Moallem told reporters in Damascus.\n\nTrump had said the attack crossed \"many, many lines,\" and put the blame squarely on Assad's forces. Speaking Thursday on Air Force One, Trump said the attack \"shouldn't have happened, and it shouldn't be allowed to happen.\"\n\nEarlier, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had said he hopes Trump will take military action, Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency quoted him as saying.\n\nErdogan said Turkey would be prepared to do \"whatever falls on us\" to support possible military action, the news agency reported.\n\nU.S. officials had said they hoped for a vote late Thursday night on a U.N. Security Council resolution that would condemn the chemical attack, but with council members still negotiating the text into the evening, the British Mission's political coordinator Stephen Hickey tweeted the vote wouldn't take place until later.\n\nAt the U.N., the United States, which currently holds the presidency of the Security Council, it drafted a resolution along with Britain and France that condemns the use of chemical weapons, particularly in the attack on Khan Sheikhoun, \"in the strongest terms.\"\n\nRussia, which has warned against fixing blame for the attack until an investigation is completed, objected to key provisions in the resolution and negotiations have been underway to try to bridge the differences.\n\nBritain's deputy ambassador Peter Wilson said \"what we want is a unanimous resolution ... and we want to see this done soon.\"\n\nFrance's U.N. Ambassador Francois Delattre indicated difficulty in reaching agreement on a resolution.\n\nAfter the attack, hospitals around Khan Sheikhoun were overwhelmed, and paramedics sent victims to medical facilities across rebel-held areas in northern Syria, as well as to Turkey. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group put the death toll at 86.\n\nThe attack happened in Syria's Idlib province about 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the Turkish border, and the Turkish government \u2014 a close ally of Syria's rebels \u2014 set up a decontamination center at a border crossing in Hatay province, where the victims were treated initially.\n\nTurkish officials said nearly 60 victims of the attack were brought to Turkey for treatment and three of them died.\n\nVictims showed signs of nerve gas exposure, including suffocation, foaming at the mouth, convulsions, constricted pupils and involuntary defecation, the World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders said. Paramedics used fire hoses to wash the chemicals from the bodies of victims.\n\nVisuals from the scene were reminiscent of a 2013 nerve gas attack on the suburbs of Damascus that left hundreds dead.\n\nIn Turkey, Anadolu and the private DHA news agencies on Thursday quoted Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag as saying \"it was determined after the autopsy that a chemical weapon was used.\"\n\nThe Turkish Health Ministry said later that \"according to the results of the first analysis, there were findings suggesting that the patients were exposed to chemical substance (sarin).\"\n\nWHO experts took part in the autopsies in the Turkish city of Adana late Wednesday, Turkish media reported.\n\nThe Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said it has \"initiated contact\" with Syrian authorities and its Technical Secretariat has been collecting and analyzing information about the allegations. \"This is an ongoing investigation,\" it said.\n\nThe area of Khan Sheikhoun is difficult to access, and as more time passes since the attack, it will be increasingly difficult to determine exactly what happened.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/04/06/syria-decries-aggression-as-us-launches-cruise-missiles.html"}, {"text": "The Trump administration\u2019s strike on an Assad airbase reflected a significant course change for the president\u2019s attitude toward the Syrian civil war.\n\nDuring the \u201cred line\u201d debate in 2013, he advocated against involvement in the war and attacking Assad \u2013 but this week\u2019s deadly chemical weapons attack changed his view.\n\nHere is a sampling of how Trump\u2019s statements, and views, on Syria have evolved.\n\nTrump, on Twitter, June 15, 2013:\n\n\u201cWe should stay the hell out of Syria, the \u2018rebels\u2019 are just as bad as the current regime.

Raytheon\u2019s website says, \u201claunching the weapon from such a long distance helps to keep sailors out of harm's way.\u201d\n\nFormer commanding officer of the U.S.S. Cole, Kirk Lippold told Fox and Friends on Friday that the U.S. forces aboard the destroyers were well prepared. \u201cBefore they even deployed, they spent months getting trained and certified in being able to fire these weapons,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are very familiar with the procedures, for any incidence that may occur, misfires, rapid changes in targeting.\u201d\n\nSYRIA AIRSTRIKES: TRUMP SAYS MILITARY ACTION IN 'VITAL NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST'\n\nWhile the cruise missiles that hit Syria were launched from two US Navy surface ships, one of the most intriguing platforms than can fire the Tomahawk is the submarine. Specifically, converted ballistic missile submarines. Four Ohio-class guided-missile submarines, originally designed to launch nuclear missiles, were converted between 2003 and 2007.\n\nThe USS Florida (SSGN 728) was converted in August 2003, the USS Michigan (SSGN 727) in October 2004, the USS Ohio (SSGN 726) in December 2005, and the USS Georgia (SSGN 729) in December 2007. According to the U.S. Navy, \u201ccombined, the four SSGNs represent more than half of the Submarine Force's vertical launch payload capacity with each SSGN capable of carrying up to 154 Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles\u201d. Additionally, the converted submarines can carry and deploy as many as 66 special operations personnel.\n\nIn contrast the USS Porter and Ross, combined, can carry up to 90 Tomahawks each. The four converted submarines can carry up to 616 tomahawk missiles, or over ten times the number launched on Syria. Adding up to as 265 special operators, like Navy SEALs, and these sea going vessels are, according to the Navy, \u201cland attack and SOF [Special Operation Forces] platforms.\u201d\n\nLippold explained that the Tomahawk is so precise, that with the help of G.P.S. technology, it could target and strike the 10th floor of a building. \u201cIt is a very accurate weapon and the reason we want to use that, obviously, is to nail the target and not have the civilian casualties\u201d that come with setting off large bombs.\n\nThe missiles were last used in October, when the military launched strikes in Yemen against three coastal radar sites in Yemen after Houthi rebels there fired missiles at several U.S. ships over several days.\n\nFox News' Lucas Tomlinson and Jennifer Griffin contributed to this report.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/04/06/syria-airstrikes-what-are-tomahawk-cruise-missiles.html"}, {"text": "President Trump\u2019s decision to strike an Assad airfield drew swift praise Thursday night from Republican senators who had urged him to take action in response to the chemical weapons attack in Syria.

It was the first direct strike on the Assad government since the start of the country\u2019s civil war. The base targeted is believed to be the point from where Tuesday\u2019s chemical attack was staged.\n\nUS LAUNCHES MISSILES INTO SYRIA IN RESPONSE TO CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK\n\n\u201cWe salute the skill and professionalism of the U.S. Armed Forces who carried out tonight\u2019s strikes in Syria.

President Trump condemned the sarin attack, indicating it changed his view of Assad \u2013 then took decisive action Thursday evening, launching an estimated 60 cruise missiles at the Al-Sharyat airbase in the Homs area, with early reports of Syrian aircraft damaged.\n\nThis swift kinetic response was important on many levels. It tells Assad the game is up on sarin. It tells North Korea to stand by, as they may be next. It tells Russia, China and American detractors that Obama is really gone, the days of non-engagement by America over, and days of proportionate kinetic response are back. America will not sit silent.\n\nAs a former Assistant Secretary of State and Naval Intelligence Officer, the difficulty balancing kinetic response and forward-leaning diplomacy is hard, situationally dependent and fraught with potential error. President Trump struck the perfect balance. He made clear his revulsion at Syrian use of sarin, set global expectations for a diplomatic shift and kinetic response, delivered the promised retaliation, and remains fully engaged.\n\nThis is not an incidental win, this is critical. Credible deterrence of sarin worldwide depended on a swift, meaningful American response, particularly in view of past disappointments. Use of sarin by Assad, the lethal nerve agent invented by Nazi Germany in 1939, represented a diplomatic game-changer.\n\nTrump saw this immediately. Nerve agents were banned after World War I, based on their horrific effects. Pictures displayed at the United Nations this week, including children dying of sarin, confirmed the horror.\n\nPresident Trump did not hesitate, which by itself sends a startling message to the world. Don\u2019t call his bluff \u2013 it is not a bluff. Here was a new \u201cshot heard round the world\u201d -- or rather 60 of them. A United Nations condemnation is due, with a unified call on Russia to renounce continued support for Assad.\n\nThat said, American strikes on the offending Syrian airbase were obviously well-planned and proportionate. They show how easily the US can, if it wants, evade Russian and Syrian air defenses, penetrating Syrian airspace at will, no handwringing. Russia will also not forget that.\n\nAll this has the flavor of Reagan\u2019s strike on Libya in 1986, and Israel\u2019s on the Iraqi nuclear plant in 1981. Reagan\u2019s 1986 Libya strike, Operation El Dorado Canyon, was in direct retaliation for Libya\u2019s 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing. He wasted no time, set Muammar Qaddafi back. Not surprisingly Qaddafi began immediate internal reforms, his \u201crevolution within the revolution.\u201d Reagan changed that game. Similarly, the 1981 strike on Iraq, Operation Opera, was intended to have material effect \u2013 and did.\n\nSo, what next? Continued and constructive engagement. The first priority is to end any future use of sarin. While this strike may do it, it may not. Prepare for another. If another is needed, it should hit Syria\u2019s command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I).\n\nAlternatively, the next kinetic strike could hit the Syrian Air Force Intelligence Directorate or National Security Bureau, both formerly involved in chemical attacks. Former Syrian General Adnan Sillou has been quoted saying that \u201cjust two people have the power to order a chemical weapons attack aside from Assad \u2026,\u201d heads of these two bureaus. Another option is to hit one or both with a robust, retaliatory cyber-attack. This is the stuff of credible deterrence.\n\nDiplomatically, the kinetic response, new American resolve, and universal international condemnation of Assad should be leveraged to dissuade Russia from continued support for the Syrian leader. This should be top priority for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson when he visits Moscow next month. Now, he has capital to work with.\n\nPresident Trump appears to be reasserting American moral leadership, as President Reagan once did. This event boldly called him out, and we should all be glad it did. He apparently heard the call, did not hesitate, did not over or under calibrate, and did not tweet.\n\nWhat he did is what Reagan would have done. He called it straight, relied on his top diplomat and top military leader to help him set global expectations, and delivered a heart punch. Message sent. Let us hope the message was heard at the other end of the line. We will soon see in Moscow.\n\nHats off to U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, Secretary Rex Tillerson, and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis too \u2013 for being prepared. As diplomacy takes over, America should give Russia every reason to join a broad international coalition accelerating Assad\u2019s departure. Sarin is impermissible, full stop. That makes Assad impermissible.\n\nThe only thing left is a strong, Reagan-like \u2013 or perhaps Jacksonian \u2013 speech from the Oval Office explaining that the civilized world will not tolerate sarin, and \u2013 on this 100th anniversary of America\u2019s entry into World War I \u2013 we will never again allow that kind of horror.\n\nAmerica is once again a moral leader, and we should invite the world once again to join us. For most, that should not be a hard call.\n\n\n\nRobert Charles is a former assistant secretary of state for President George W. Bush, former naval intelligence officer and litigator.

The body then swiftly took another, 55-45 vote to end debate and tee up a final confirmation vote expected at 11:30 a.m. ET Friday.\n\nThis was after Democrats initially blocked Gorsuch in a filibuster earlier in the day. Four Democrats broke ranks -- Sens. Michael Bennet, D-Colo.; Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D.; Joe Donnelly, D-Ind.; and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. \u2013 but Republicans still fell short of the 60 votes needed to proceed, prompting McConnell to overhaul the way the Senate works.\n\nHe said he did so \u201cfor the sake of our country.\u201d\n\nBennet later opposed Gorsuch on the do-over vote.\n\nWhile congressional Republicans and President Trump are now virtually guaranteed to get Gorsuch on the high court, the impact of the events that played out Thursday could be felt for years, if not decades, to come. Each party blamed the other for the escalation and the breakdown in the Senate\u2019s parliamentary decorum.\n\nIndeed, McConnell\u2019s predecessor as Senate majority leader Harry Reid, now retired, took the first step down the \u201cnuclear\u201d road by lowering the threshold for other nominees in 2013 \u2013 a controversial move Republicans frequently brought up on the road to Thursday\u2019s proceedings.\n\nBut lowering the threshold for a Supreme Court pick is a more significant step.

They pointed to past rulings on cases where he sided with businesses against workers, though his allies maintain he was merely applying the law as written.

What happened in Syria is truly one of the egregious crimes and it shouldn't have happened and it shouldn't be allowed to happen,\" the president said. Referring to Assad, he added, \"I think what happened in Syria is a disgrace to humanity, and he's there, and I guess he's running things, so I guess something should happen.\"\n\nTrump was already being pressed by senior Republicans to take military action despite Russia's strong support for Assad and the presence in Syria of Russian troops and warplanes.\n\nSen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and member of the panel, said the U.S. and its partners should ground Assad's warplanes, though any attack on Syrian airfields would also risk hitting Russian aircraft and crews.\n\n\"The U.S. military, together with our allies and partners, has the capability to achieve this objective quickly, precisely, decisively, and in ways that control escalation,\" McCain said in a statement. He did not elaborate on the method of attack.\n\nIn 2013, following a sarin gas attack in the Damascus suburbs that allegedly killed more than 1,500, the U.S. posted destroyers and submarines to the eastern Mediterranean with the potential mission to fire Tomahawk missiles to crater Syrian airfields, but the attack order never came from the Obama administration.\n\nThe Washington Post reported Thursday that the White House was considering a range of military options but had made no decisions. Senior White House officials met Wednesday evening on the Syrian crisis and received input from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the White House national security advisor, the Post reported.\n\nTillerson was expected to meet in Moscow next week with Russian President Vladimir Putin on a previously arranged visit that will now have Syria high on the agenda.\n\nThe talks will come as Trump's high hopes, often expressed during the campaign, for a new and more cooperative relationship with Putin appeared to have been dashed by charges of Russian meddling in the U.S. 2016 elections and congressional investigations of possible collusion between Trump associates and Moscow.\n\nU.S. troops on the ground in Syria have ready access to chemical weapons protective suits but were not wearing them as a precaution following the suspected Syrian air force nerve gas attack, a U.S. military spokesman said Thursday.\n\n\"All forces have access to chemical gear\" in Syria and in Iraq, Army Col. Joseph Scrocca said in fielding questions on the impact for U.S. troops of Trump's statements suggesting that the U.S. might take action. \"None of our forces currently are wearing them.\"\n\nScrocca, a spokesman for Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve, declined comment on the alleged Syrian attack or a possible U.S. response. He said U. S. troops in Syria and Iraq were focused on the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, but \"our forces across Iraq and Syria are prepared to defend themselves\" should they come under fire.\n\nThe Force Management Levels, or limits, on U.S. military personnel set by the Obama administration currently stand at 503 for Syria and 5,262 Iraq. However, those numbers do not include troops on so-called \"temporary assignment.\"\n\nCurrently in Syria, a small contingent of Army Rangers and Stryker combat vehicles is in the northeastern town of Manbij temporarily to discourage any attempt to take the town by a combined Syrian and Russian force on the outskirts.\n\nIn addition, about 200 Marines from the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, also on temporary assignment, are near the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa to set up an firing base for M777 howitzers.\n\nIn Iraq, about 200 troops from the Army's 82nd Airborne Division recently were sent to northeastern Iraq to support the train, advise and assist mission of U.S. troops with the Iraqi Security Forces battling to retake Mosul.\n\nBoth Syrian and Russian officials have denied responsibility for the chemical attack and charged that the deaths may have been caused by nerve agents stored in the area by rebels.\n\n-- Richard Sisk can be reached at Richard.Sisk@Military.com.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/06/us-weighs-military-response-to-syrian-chemical-attack.html"}, {"text": "The Founding Fathers would be mortified if they were to witness the filibuster of Judge Neil Gorsuch.\n\nI can imagine Hamilton, Madison and Jay saying, \u201cwhat are these people in the Senate doing? Why did they dream up this artificial device called a \u2018filibuster\u2019? Don\u2019t they realize it is destructive to the very nature of the democracy which we so carefully devised and envisioned? Didn\u2019t they read what we wrote? This is not what we wanted!\u201d\n\nThe Framers were very deliberate in expressing their intentions of how Congress should operate. They debated, but abandoned, the idea of a requiring a supermajority of two-thirds or three-fifths to pass legislation or confirm presidential appointments. It had been tried with the Articles of Confederation and produced nothing but chronic dysfunction.\n\nSo the Founders rejected the same concept for the new Constitution. They regarded it as a pernicious restraint on representative government grounded in majority rule. It would be, quite simply, undemocratic. And lead to a tyranny of the minority.\n\nThey therefore limited the supermajority imperative to just five specific circumstances: ratifying treaties, overriding presidential vetoes, expelling senators, amending the Constitution, and impeaching presidents. All other acts, by exclusion, were meant to be made by a majority vote which was regarded universally as the natural law of democracy.\n\nThese desires were spelled out in detail in The Federalist Papers, the 85 articles composed by Hamilton, Madison and Jay which serve as their defense of, and rationale for, the principles and text expressed in the Constitution itself. In Federalist 22, Alexander Hamilton derided the supermajority method by warning that \u201csmaller numbers will overrule the greater\u2026and destroy the energy of government.\u201d\n\nThese writings make clear the Framers did not want a minority of Senators to have the equivalent of veto power over congressional acts, which is precisely what the filibuster rule accomplishes by giving 41 Senators the power to block legislation.\n\nThe principle of majority rule was the fundamental feature of democracy at the founding of our republic. Its practice was reflected in the many Articles within the Constitution. Any exceptions were expressly provided.\n\nHence, in the context of the document as a whole, the filibuster is manifestly unconstitutional. The Supreme Court said as much in 1892 when it ruled that the prerogative of each house to determine the rules of its own proceedings \u201ccannot ignore constitutional restraints.\u201d (U.S. v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1)\n\nIgnoring all this or, more likely, in complete ignorance of it, Senators began utilizing in earnest the filibuster in 1917. Their actions prompted then-President Woodrow Wilson to remark, \u201cA little group of willful men, representing no opinion but their own, have rendered the great government of the United States helpless and contemptible\u201d.\n\nWilson was prescient. From that point forward, the fears of the Framers came to ugly and shameful fruition. Much of the civil rights legislation in the 1950\u2019s and 60\u2019s was either defeated or delayed for years. So, too, were bills to outlaw workplace discrimination and gender inequality.\n\nIn the last decade, hundreds of productive bills that would surely have passed but for this tyranny of the minority have fallen victim to the filibuster. The words \u201cobstruction, gridlock and paralysis\u201d are now common lexicon in describing Washington, all thanks to a rule inimical to the Founders\u2019 intent.\n\nThe filibuster is primarily to blame for the palpable anger toward lawmakers and the widespread loss of confidence in our government. But the damage can be repaired and faith restored, though it will demand courage in casting aside the pettiness of partisan politics so engrained in the halls of Congress.\n\nThe upper house has the constitutional authority and the moral obligation to rid itself of this contrived parliamentary scourge, once and for all, by a majority vote. Not just for a presidential nomination to the Supreme Court, as the Senate finally did on Thursday, but for all legislation.\n\nIf Senators bear any allegiance to the history of our democratic republic or fidelity to the hard work of the wise men who risked their lives to create the vital documents upon which future generations could live and prosper, then they will cast that vote.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping that the Gorsuch filibuster drama may serve as the impetus for the kind of permanent and constructive change Washington so desperately needs.\n\nIt is time to say goodbye to the rule forever\u2026 and for everything.\n\nGregg Jarrett is a Fox News Anchor and former defense attorney.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/04/06/gregg-jarrett-time-to-say-goodbye-to-senate-filibuster-forever-and-for-everything.html"}, {"text": "The U.S. Army paid tribute Thursday to the 100th anniversary of the American military entering World War I, a move that would cost the lives of nearly 117,000 Doughboys.\n\nA modest ceremony at the Pentagon marked the decision by Congress on April 6, 1917, to declare war on Imperial Germany for its campaign of unrestricted submarine warfare.\n\nPeriod art and recruitment posters flashed on two digital screens, offering such slogans as \"The Pep of the Yankee Boy,\" \"We've called the Kaiser's Bluff\" and \"Berlin or Bust.\"\n\nSoldiers from the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment, \"The Old Guard,\" dressed in World War I-era uniforms.

Nearly five million Americans entered service. It resulted in more than two million new industrial workers, while women became a major presence in the workforce and joined the armed forces.\n\nOf the 4.8 million Americans who went into the military, four million served in the Army.\n\nThe 99 divisions that made up the American Expeditionary Forces entered the front lines in January 1918 and fought in 13 key battles such as Cantigny, Belleau Wood and the Meuse-Argonne Offensive.\n\n\"If you have ever served at Fort Benning, Fort Bragg, Fort Dix, Fort Jackson or Fort Lee, you have served at one of the 87 camps and installations built by the Army in 1917 or 1918 as part of the wartime mobilization,\" said Charles Bowery Jr., executive director of the Center of Military History. \"If you served in the armor, aviation or chemical branch, your branch was created in World War I.\"\n\nBy the time the war ended on Nov. 11, 1918, 116,516 Americans had been killed in just under a year of combat.\n\nFrank Buckles would become the last American Doughboy to pass away in 2011.

DeWolfe Miller told Military.com that experts have been \"swarming\" three training bases in Meridian, Mississippi; Pensacola, Florida; and Kingsville, Texas, where about 40 percent of T-45 flights were canceled March 31 when instructor pilots cited operational risk management concerns.\n\nAt the root of the issue is a spike in reported physiological episodes akin to hypoxia, with 10 T-45 cockpit incidents in the last month alone, according to an explosive Fox News report.\n\n\"I think what happened is we didn't communicate to the aircrew, to the instructor pilots of our T-45s and their three bases the level of effort that we've been putting forth toward trying to solve this issue,\" Miller said. \"And so we sent a team down there over the last couple days. We sent these guys down now to educate and inform the instructor pilots, 'Here's what we're doing, and what about your situation.' \"\n\nThe Navy announced Wednesday that all 197 T-45s would spend three days on the ground while the service conducts a safety stand-down to address the issue. Miller noted that the Navy had already been collecting cockpit air samples via Sorbent tubes and changed out air filters to improve the quality of cockpit oxygen.\n\nA source quoted by Fox took a dimmer view of the Navy's efforts, however, saying one squadron had received only six of the tubes. And tests remained inconclusive even after air samples from 1,500 flights were screened, according to the report.\n\nBut while one flight instructor and student ejected from their aircraft and let it crash after experiencing a cockpit episode last August, Miller downplayed the severity of the majority of reported incidents.\n\n\"We have procedures that if you get an indication that you have an [onboard oxygen generation system] degrade, you turn off the [OBOGS], you use your emergency oxygen, and we descend to an altitude where the breathing air is good and you land the airplane,\" he said. \"We have done that, pilots are trained on how to do that, and that procedure is working well.\"\n\nWhile a safety stand-down was called for, he said he didn't expect the Navy to ground T-45s for any extended period of time.\n\n\"It's not happening at a rate that we just stop flying,\" he said.\n\nActing Secretary of the Navy Sean Stackley told Military.com on Wednesday that there are a lot of potentially causal factors in play, adding that the service previously contended with cockpit physiological episodes in the F/A-18 Super Hornet.\n\n\"So it's going to take a long time to work our way down,\" he said. \"If it's this many things that are contributing to the problem, you work your way down and get it to the de minimis stage. It's not going to be one single thing that solves the problem. It is taking time to identify the fixes and get them implemented, and then measuring the results.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Stackley said, the Navy is redoubling efforts to collect accurate and specific data from pilots about the different kinds of episodes and symptoms, to help in determining the right fix.\n\n\"We have been trying to capture the experience, the episodes, so we can get down at the root of what's causing them,\" he said. \"So when the pilots come back, we're going to go after data we've never captured before as far as the physiological part, him or herself ... it's a pretty extensive analytical effort to run these causes to ground.\"\n\nMiller said he expects improved communication between Navy brass and instructor pilots to result in greater confidence for the aviators.\n\n\"Over the next couple of days, my expectation is we're back in the air, we're flying, and guys will feel more confident knowing that leadership is listening and doing something about the issue,\" he said.\n\n-- Hope Hodge Seck can be reached at hope.seck@military.com.

And make no mistake, China is a root cause for much of this.\n\nIt will be high stakes poker when Chinese President Xi Jinping arrives at Mar-a-Lago this Thursday for a two day Trump-Xi Summit.\n\nThe Summit, however, presents a huge opportunity for President Trump to seriously confront the real issues between our two countries and do so from a position of strength.\n\nThe fact is that in the early stages of his presidency and before, President Trump has made the right moves to give him real leverage with the Chinese.\n\nIn December, President-elect Trump in his first meeting with a foreign head of state, met with President Abe of Japan. This sent a clear message to the Chinese that Japan is our key strategic partner in Asia.\n\nIn addition, then President-elect Trump\u2019s reaching out to Philippine President Duterte, after being lectured to by the Obama administration, helped to ease U.S. tensions with the longtime ally, which had been drifting towards China in recent months. These and other actions have shown that President Trump is capable of successfully playing the international chess game with the Chinese.\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of what should be some of the top agenda items at the upcoming Trump-Xi Summit:\n\n1. Trade \u2013 A centerpiece of the Trump Campaign, the trade deficit with China will be front and center. It will be important for the Trump Administration to remember that severe demographic problems, due to the aging of its population, are driving much of the Chinese policy. In 2012, China had 180-million citizens who were over 60 years old. By the middle of this century, that number could approach 500-million. Further, the Chinese life expectancy has shot up from just 35 in 1949 to more than 73 today. And with the drastic decline of China\u2019s birthrate, it has now fallen below what is needed to maintain its population. China\u2019s shrinking labor force, due to its demographic challenges, has contributed greatly to its trade policy.\n\n2. Military \u2013 China has the world\u2019s largest military, with roughly 2.3-million active duty troops and 500,000 reserves, compared to the US\u2019 approximately 1.3-million active duty troops and 800,000 in the Guard and Reserves. In addition, China is the only country that can really strain American resources from a military standpoint. Despite the size of its military budget, though, China still spends more on domestic security than on external threats. Something is going on internally in China. China\u2019s growing internal problems present a bigtime headache for President Xi. This is something that the Trump Administration should exploit to avert a serious and unnecessary arms race.\n\n3. The South China Sea \u2013 The free flow of cargo through the South China Sea is vital to the world\u2019s economy. Ships carry approximately $5.3-Trillion in cargo every year through the South China Sea. China has thumbed its nose at last year\u2019s Hague Tribunal ruling against China\u2019s claims to sovereignty over most of the South China Sea. President Trump\u2019s outreach to Philippine President Duterte and Japanese Prime Minister Abe has been a step in the right direction following the Obama Administration. Similar outreach should occur to Malaysia, Singapore and Australia to develop a unified diplomatic, political and military strategy that defends the sovereignty of the South China Sea and contains Chinese aggression.\n\n4. North Korea \u2013 North Korea\u2019s ballistic missile and nuclear technology pose a very real threat to the US. The Chinese have talked out of both sides of their mouth on North Korea. Along with Iran, it has been one of the two great enablers of the North Korean regime. China has helped draft UN Security Council resolutions and sanctions against North Korea, while at the same time helping to launder Iranian payments to North Korea. Further, we see Chinese subcomponents in North Korea\u2019s missile systems. Yes, relations between China and North Korea are at a low point, but China helped create the North Korea situation. President Trump must convince President Xi that we\u2019re in the 59th minute of the 11th hour in dealing with North Korea. It\u2019s a problem for the free world that China helped to create and China needs to fix it. It can begin to do so with an all-out effort to get North Korea to scale back its nuclear program.\n\n5. Cyber Security \u2013 Here\u2019s where President Trump has perhaps his greatest opportunity for a big quick win. China has inflicted real damage on the US from both a national security and an economic standpoint with its cyber-attacks against the US Government and US industry. The US can\u2019t compete if American companies annually spend millions, and in some cases billions, of dollars in research and development while China continues to steal the resulting technology. It\u2019s estimated that 90 percent of Chinese espionage (through cyber-attacks) is committed by two groups \u2013 one in Beijing and the other in Shanghai. One group can be traced to Unit 61398 of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) and the other is also believed to have significant ties to the Chinese Armed Forces. The Chinese Government denies any involvement with these groups. This is an opportunity for President Trump to reach out to President Xi Jinping and tell him that we take him at his word and ask China to join the United States in declaring both of these groups as cyber terrorist organizations, so that we can go after them together. This will call China\u2019s bluff on the world stage and display real American leadership.\n\nYes, the stakes are high for the Trump-Xi Summit. President Trump\u2019s early moves have been the right ones. Now he has a real opportunity to confront China in the right way on North Korea, the South China Sea, military, trade issues and cyber security. In doing so, he\u2019ll show China and the rest of the world that real American leadership is back.\n\nVan D. Hipp, Jr. is the former Deputy Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Army.

Was it Democrats\u2019 filibuster of Judge Neil Gorsuch? Yes. Was it Republicans\u2019 blockade of a raft of Obama lower-court nominees? Yep. Was it the public humiliation of Clarence Thomas? You betcha. Was it the defeat of Robert Bork\u2019s nomination? For sure.\n\nBut who cares about blame? Partisans rely on \u201che started it\u201d arguments for almost everything they do, so trying to unravel who is exactly to blame is a pointless exercise. This ball has been rolling downhill for decades.\n\nA reasonable person should wonder: \u201cSo what?\u201d And they wouldn\u2019t be wrong to think that all of this primate-house behavior in Washington doesn\u2019t have much to do with real life or the real concerns of the people of the republic. Nuke or don\u2019t nuke, the good people of Beech Bottom, W. Va. won\u2019t be able to sense that much is different.\n\nBuuuuttt\u2026\n\nWe have often talked about how politics descends from culture, even though those of us in this world tend to believe it\u2019s the other way around. If our politics are gross \u2013 and they surely are \u2013 they are still not the cause of the current cultural crisis in the United States, but rather its result.\n\nPoliticians are people too, and like most people, they will tend to do only the minimum that is required of them. That applies to standards of honor, patriotism, honesty and selflessness. We only get as good of a government as we demand.\n\nThe scoundrels and scallywags of previous generations would no doubt look upon their heirs in politics today and say \u201cYou kids have it made.\u201d The amount of venal, dishonest, self-interested, shortsightedness that voters will tolerate today in the name of partisan victory would have made Teapot Dome but a teacup.\n\nWith today\u2019s vote, the Senate takes another step toward undoing its original role as an upper chamber in the true sense of the term.\n\nThe Founders gave senators longer terms, a smaller chamber, equal representation among states and shielded them from direct election by voters in the hope that senators would elevate, restrict and refine the populist passions surging up from the House.\n\nStarting with the Progressive Era change to elect senators directly, rather than by their states\u2019 legislatures, we have gradually undone that vision.\n\nThe rule that was changed today, interestingly, was actually a rather belated attempt to restore some of the original function of the Senate, not part of the showroom model. Once, it took two-thirds of the Senate to advance legislation to a final vote and then it was the current three-fifths. And that won\u2019t last long.\n\nThe threshold was lowered for lower court appointments and other presidential picks in 2013, now that includes the Supreme Court. One day, it will, assuredly, cover all legislation.\n\nAs one of that body\u2019s most esteemed former members might have said, they are defining deviancy down\u2026\n\nThe consequence of the current change, though, will be significant enough on its own. Resentments will deepen and chances for bipartisan cooperation will diminish. And the motivations that govern the selection of Supreme Court nominees will be radically altered.\n\nPity the poor judges who have spent decades of their lives meticulously avoiding the appearance of prejudice in all legal matters and avoiding ideological activism for the sake of remaining eligible for the Supreme Court.\n\nThe future belongs not to the Neil Gorsuches of the bench but to those individuals who are best able to stoke the strongest partisan sentiment when activist groups start militating for the \u2013 depending on who is president \u2013 farthest right or farthest left nominee possible.\n\nThe standard until today was to find a nominee who could attract bipartisan support and be viewed as broadly acceptable. Going forward, it will be all about a party\u2019s base trying to force anxious moderates to accept the most hardline choice possible.\n\nIn time, that scorched-earth approach will make things worse at the court, too. It is helpful for the administration of justice when rank partisans try to appear otherwise. The phony politesse of judicial non-partisanship not only allows judges to reason together better but also gives an incentive for deference and decency.\n\nBy the time everybody has gotten to the court by having been the red-hot poker shoved up the backside of one party or the other by activist groups, those niceties will matter a great deal less. That change will be reflected in the conduct of the court, the predictability of its decisions on partisan lines and the esteem in which those decisions are held.\n\nThe Senate is getting to be more like the House, but so will the Supreme Court.\n\nSo, back to the good people of Beech Bottom, W. Va., and what this all has to do with them.\n\nThe Supreme Court is one of very few civic institutions that still counts for much with ordinary Americans. Respect for Congress, the presidency, organized religion, big business, education, the free press and just about everything other than the Easter Bunny, has tanked over the course of recent decades, but the high court has held on to much of its luster.\n\nPolls consistently show that justices are in pretty rare air along with the two perennial favorites for public confidence: the military and small business.\n\nThat will change over time, and the court will descend that slippery slope down to where those folks without robes in the big building on the other side of 1st St., NE reside. It will take time, but the justices will be in the muck just like the members of Congress.\n\nPerhaps you think this is fitting. After all, in many ways over the past two generations, the court has acted like a super legislature. If they are going to behave that way, maybe it\u2019s good that justices live in the same partisan hellscape as their elected counterparts across the street.\n\nWhat we lost today was another chunk of republican virtue. The aloof, apolitical, unelected Supreme Court is a key feature of our Framers\u2019 plan, but the court is moving earthward at a faster pace now.\n\nAs it turns out, the expansion of direct democracy for Americans has been no picnic.\n\nOnce, voters only got to choose the members of the House, with the rest of their government chosen indirectly. Are we better off with a directly elected chief executive and Senate? Do you think they are more accountable? Do you think they are more responsible and diligent?\n\nIt is not a coincidence that the Supreme Court is more respected and that its members don\u2019t seek the votes of their countrymen.

The decision by Republican Rep. Devin Nunes of California comes amid partisan turmoil on the committee.

Remember, this all descends from an effort in the wake of 9/11 to prevent \u201cstove piping\u201d of vital information. The broad supposition was that we could have disrupted the hijackers with proper intelligence sharing between national security and law enforcement agencies. But such decentralization can go too far. The change initiated under the Obama administration was not sudden or unexpected but rather the final result of a lengthy move in the direction of a flatter system. The new Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, didn\u2019t take office until just a few weeks ago.

He knows there is indeed a foreign power that recently spent millions to sway an American presidential election, and a president and vice president who happily held out their hands and let it happen. That power was China, and the president was Bill Clinton.\n\nIf you want to learn how the Clintons and Democrats really view the issue of foreign influence on a sitting president, don\u2019t bother with the Clinton Foundation or its millions of dollars from foreign governments looking for quid pro quos. Look at what happened during Bill Clinton\u2019s re-election campaign in 1996, which was rocked not by one but two scandals with serious implications for foreign manipulation of our national security.\n\nOne involved President Clinton's dalliance with intern Monica Lewinsky, which any foreign intelligent service could have happily used for blackmail. The other, far more consequential, involved agents of Communist China actively supplying money to his campaign.\n\nToday Democrats would like to forget names like Charlie Trie, the Arkansas restauranteur who donated $200,000 dollars to the DNC and $400,000 to Clinton Defense Fund\u2014money that actually came from Macao real estate developer Ng Lap Seng, who had deep connections to the Communist Chinese government. Or Maria Hsai, the fund-raiser for Vice President Al Gore whom the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee later identified as a Chinese intelligence agent, and who set up the notorious event at a Buddhist temple in California where Gore personally took in $100,000 in illegal donations.\n\nGore\u2019s reaction when he was caught with his hand in the Chinese till, became classic. \u201cThere\u2019s no controlling legal authority,\u201d he said with a shrug, \u201cthat says this was in violation of law.\"\n\nJust imagine what the reaction from the mainstream media would be if Michael Flynn or Donald Trump had said something similar for simply having a phone call with the Russian ambassador\u2014let alone accepting money that was being laundered by a KGB agent.\n\nThe most egregious \u201cChinagate\u201d case was Johnny Chung, another Democratic Party fundraiser who funneled thousands of dollars to the Clinton campaign that turned out to be supplied by the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army through Liu Chaoying, a Chinese lieutenant colonel and aerospace executive whose father was a key figure in Chinese military intelligence. Chung later told federal investigators that some of the money Liu gave him actuallycame from Chinese military intelligence accounts, and that it was specifically earmarked to influence U.S. political campaigns.\n\nIn the end, ninety-four people involved in \u201cChinagate\u201d either refused questioning, pled the Fifth Amendment, or fled the country.\n\nEventually Clinton and the Democrats returned the tainted money, but they fought tooth and nail to hamper Congressional and other investigations, including by the FBI.\n\nClinton\u2019s Attorney General Janet Reno resolutely refused to appoint a special prosecutor, even though FBI director Louis Freeh said he never saw a case that warranted one more.\n\nWas there any quid pro quo? Hard to say. It is a fact that after the election the Clinton administration worked overtime to overrule national security officials in order get licenses for Loral Space to export important missile technology to Communist China in 1999\u2014technology that has enabled China to revolutionize its space program, as well as its ballistic missile program, giving them capabilities and platforms for attacking our own space satellites which would be tested out over the next decade.\n\nThe Clinton official who led the campaign to get those Loral licenses is now the sitting governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe (at the same time Loral\u2019s CEO became the DNC\u2019s single biggest contributor).\n\nSo in the midst of the liberal hysteria over a supposed Trump-Putin nexus, it\u2019s worth remembering how Democrats really behave, when a foreign power tries to influence a presidential election\u2014and who really benefits when a Clinton sits in the White House.\n\nHistorian Arthur Herman is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington, D.C.

There are currently 146 Super Stallions in the Marine Corps aviation inventory with an average age of nearly 28 years, according to the 2017 Marine Corps Aviation Plan released late last month.\n\nThe commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Robert Neller, said that Super Stallions were the hardest worn of any Marine Corps aviation platform, telling a congressional panel last year that the service \"probably kept [CH-53s] in theater a little bit too long\" following 15 years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq, deferring needed maintenance. But the CH-53E is now in an intensive recapitalization program that will continue until the introduction of the King Stallion near the end of this decade.\n\nIt's not yet clear if the incident was a result of equipment failure, human error, or some other cause. It's the first hard landing or crash for a Super Stallion since January 2016, when two of the aircraft collided over water during night training off the coast of Hawaii.\n\n-- Hope Hodge Seck can be reached at hope.seck@military.com.

They were set to approve the change last November until House Speaker Paul Ryan \u2013 an earmark critic \u2013convinced the GOP caucus to delay the vote until early 2017. The new vote could occur at any time.\n\nWith a strong \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d majority re-elected just five months ago, bringing back earmarks would be colossally tone deaf.\n\nBecause only 60 of today\u2019s 238 House Republicans were even in office when earmarking peaked \u2013 and cost them control of Congress \u2013 in 2006, a history lesson is in order.\n\nThe issue is the distribution of government grants. Historically, Congress would set a program\u2019s general funding criteria, and then federal agencies would distribute most grants either through a competitive application process, or by formula to state and local governments.\n\nBy contrast, \u201cearmarking\u201d is the practice by which lawmakers personally select the recipients of government grants within the funding legislation itself.\n\nWhile earmarking goes back to the first Congress in 1789, it has historically been reserved for rare Congressional priorities. Yet in the late-1990s, Congressional Republicans realized that politicizing government grants could raise enormous sums of money. Between 1996 and 2005, the number of annual appropriations earmarks leaped from 958 to 13,997. From 1982 to 2005, number of earmarks in highway authorization bills surged from 10 to 6,371.\n\nLawmakers defend earmarking by asserting that they understand their district\u2019s government grant needs better than distant government bureaucrats. In theory, this is persuasive. In reality, earmarking has proven to be a policy and political disaster.\n\nA major challenge is staff resources. As a former Senate aide, I have seen small Congressional staffs work 60 hours per week just to keep up with legislation and votes. Expecting them to also analyze dozens (or sometimes hundreds) of government grant proposals from their state or district is simply unrealistic. They have neither the time nor the expertise to comprehensively audit all the applicants, research the often-technical proposals, and then weigh them against countless other applications competing for the same program funding.\n\nConsequently, as earmarks soared in the early 2000s many lawmakers skipped the full audits and analysis, and instead handed out government grants to donors, friends, and allies they wished to curry favor with. Essentially, government was for sale.\n\nAt the point, the gold rush began. A new industry of highly-paid appropriations lobbyists promised to help clients buy government grants for pennies on the dollar. One study estimated that every $1 companies spent lobbying bought $28 in earmarks. Another study revealed that \u201c60 percent of the members of the House Armed Services Committee who arranged earmarks also received campaign contributions from the companies that received the funding.\u201d\n\nNumerous criminal investigations were launched. Convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff called the Appropriations Committee an \u201cearmark favor factory.\u201d One Congressman went to prison after circulating a menu matching various sizes of earmarks and federal contracts with the required bribes.\n\nPolitics trumped merit: Lawmakers were essentially given individual pots of tax dollars to distribute almost at will. Leadership, appropriators, and vulnerable members were allocated the largest pots, while rank-and-file lawmakers in safe districts received less. Most lawmakers refused to question each other\u2019s pork. Accountability was absent.\n\nTaxpayers, meanwhile, were treated to stories about Alaska\u2019s $223 million \u201cBridge to Nowhere,\u201d and earmarks for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and to combat teen goth culture in Blue Springs, Missouri. And all this pork greased the skids to pass bloated government expansions.\n\nBy 2006, enraged voters had seen enough. An April NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll ranked banning earmarks as voters\u2019 top priority for Congress. Yet the gravy train continued, and seven months later the Republican majority was thrown out of Congress in their worst defeat since Watergate. Exit polls ranked corruption and ethics (mostly tied to earmarks) as the top issue.\n\nRepentant Republicans promised to ban earmarks if returned to power \u2013 a promise they fulfilled shortly after retaking the House in 2011. Now, after six years of strongly re-elected majorities (achieved without earmarks), many want to slouch back into the pork-barrel swamp.\n\nOf course, earmark advocates claim that new controls can prevent abuse. Past experiences and the temptations of power and fundraising merit skepticism.\n\nLawmakers truly concerned with federal agencies\u2019 grantmaking authority could either write more specific grantmaking criteria, or \u2013 even better \u2013 distribute the money to state and local governments by formula and let them decide how to allocate these funds.\n\nAfter all, why should Congress be micromanaging where to build a traffic light in Briarcliff Manor, NY, or a sidewalk in Franklin, TX? Congress should focus on replacing ObamaCare, overhauling the tax code, and fighting terrorism, rather than becoming once again, in the words of former Congressman Dan Lungren, \u201cmere errand boys for local government and constituents.\u201d\n\nIt took 12 years for the 1994 Republican revolutionaries to become the 2006 establishment dealmakers that lost Congress. Six years into a new majority, Republicans must decide whether to go back down that road.\n\nBrian Riedl is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.

Where is he getting these ideas?\u201d\n\nThe next day, over at ABC, Martha Raddatz pretended to interview White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\n\n\u201cThe president of the United States is accusing the former president of wiretapping him,\u201d said Raddatz, who you will remember cried on election night when Hillary Clinton lost.\n\n\u201cI think that this is again something that if this happened, Martha -- ,\u201d Sanders began.\n\n\u201c If, if, if, if!\u201d Raddatz snapped.\n\nIt went on and on.\n\nCNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper threw objectivity aside and determined the president was a liar.\n\n\u201cWe know the president of the United States has no facts, no facts to back up his startling allegation that the former president of the United States, President Obama, wiretapped him at Trump Tower during the campaign,\u201d Cooper said on March 16.\n\n\u201cIt's amazing to watch the White House continue to argue that the Earth is flat,\u201d Cooper\u2019s colleague, Jake Tapper, said.\n\nWhen the fact-challenged, destroy-Trump media finally got bored scolding President Trump over his tweet, they went right back to the same old, tired conspiracy. The one that claims Trump colluded with the Russians to win the election, a baseless assertion the mainstream media has hung onto for months without one single shred of evidence.\n\n\u201cThis Russian connection just keeps building, and every time it builds and expands, you have to wonder if Trump himself isn't worried about what's swirling around under the covers,\u201d said MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews.\n\nCooper and his pals agreed. The evil Russians and the evil Team Trump worked together to steal the election!\n\nThen, on March 22, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes announced that he had credible evidence that President Trump and members of his transition team had been caught up in \"incidental surveillance,\" after which their names were unmasked. Nunes also revealed this intelligence had nothing to do with Russia and was shared among high-level Obama administration officials, apparently for political purposes.\n\nThe media swung into action to investigate the serious claim and accurately reported these shocking new revelations. Oh, wait! No they didn\u2019t. They decided to destroy Nunes.\n\n\u201cWho decided that Devin Nunes was qualified to be the House Intel chair? Because from everybody that I've spoken to who have worked with him, Republicans, Democrats, they say he is not up to that task,\u201d said MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough, a former Republican congressman who now earns a bigger paycheck as a member of the alt-left media.\n\nNunes, who stepped aside in the committee\u2019s investigation Thursday amid a barrage of bogus claims from the media and fellow House members, put his reputation on the line to try to get to the truth.\n\nWhile the alt-left, destroy-Trump-propaganda-media was busy smearing anyone and everyone who didn't echo their biased agenda, real journalists from Fox News, Circa News and Bloomberg were actually doing their jobs. And they reported that it was President Obama\u2019s national security adviser, Susan Rice, who called for the unmasking of members of the Trump transition team.\n\nRice didn't even deny it. But the CNN wants us to think these developments are all just a big distraction. They're back to the Russia conspiracy.\n\n\u201cYou think that this is a diversion from this Russia story?\u201d Don Lemon asked earlier this week. \u201cBecause so far, we've seen no evidence that she's done anything improper, and it seems like an effort to tar and feather her to try to make a lie the truth, the original tweet by the president.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen, Susan Rice is being tarred, feathered and burned alive for doing her job in a good way,\u201d Van Jones replied.\n\nUnmasking Americans just because they are her political opponents was not her job. Over at MSNBC, Chris Matthews, who once gushed that Obama sent a \u201cthrill up my leg,\u201d accused Republicans of being racist and sexist for targeting Susan Rice.\n\nIf they don't like the facts, they just claim racism and sexism. But President Trump is not letting the media define this narrative.\n\n\"It's such an important story for our country and the world. It's one of the big stories of our time,\" Trump said of the Obama administration\u2019s apparent use of national intelligence agencies for political opposition research.\n\nABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and all of their friends in the print media \u2013 especially The New York Times and Washington Post \u2013 need to realize their partisanship and hatred for the president has clouded their judgment in what is now one of the biggest scandals in American history.\n\nAdmit your bias.

Many take just two words: North Korea, fair trade, currency manipulation, patent theft, cyber assault. Two words he should utter, but probably won\u2019t: rare earths.\n\nThat\u2019s because Trump, businessman par excellence, knows he has a weak hand.\n\nTrump has already signaled via Twitter that he expects his meeting with Xi to be difficult. That is like telling an employee \u201cYou are underperforming,\u201d instead of \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. has little leverage over China\u2019s economic support of North Korea, whose madman leader Kim Jong Un could test a nuclear device to mar the Sino-U.S. summit.\n\nAmerica\u2019s nearly $350 billion trade deficit may be partly the result of Beijing\u2019s currency manipulation. But while there may be room for a frank discussion, Americans want to pay the lowest possible prices for their consumer goods. And right now, those come from China.\n\nWhether Trump can get a meaningful promise from Xi to stop its cyber assault on crucial databanks like the Pentagon, U.S. banks and government employees\u2019 records depends on whether the Chinese leader will even admit to such crimes. And Xi needs only point to Russia\u2019s own hacking of U.S. software and shrug.\n\nBut where Trump could take a serious step in his campaign pledge to return jobs to America is the issue of rare earths. Those are the 17 minerals and elements that are essential to making advanced military aircraft, rocket-guided missiles, GPS systems and even the iPhones that everyone at the summit will be toting.\n\nIn the late 20th century, the U.S. was the world\u2019s leading producer of rare earths, ensuring our military and civilian manufacturers with a secure supply of the crucial materials.\n\nGradually, U.S. companies sent rare earth mined in the United States to China for processing, and, to ensure quality control, gave away to Chinese producers the technological secrets that had been developed in America.\n\nNot surprisingly, China, which also has large rare earth deposits, took the technology being offered for free, improved on it, and quickly outstripped U.S. production. Since it pays little attention to the ecological damage done by strip-mining and smelting, it can undercut competitors\u2019 prices.\n\nChina now produces 95 percent of the world\u2019s rare earths. U.S. production: zero. Our military and commercial manufacturers are 100 percent dependent on China for rare earths. And the American jobs created by rare earth mining and separation: gone.\n\nHere\u2019s Bellwether\u2019s advice: Trump need not raise the topic with Xi. Instead, while the Chinese leader is in the room, the president should turn to the top Pentagon hand seated at the summit table and mention casually, \u201cBy the way, we\u2019re going to start mining and producing our own rare earths again. And soon.\u201d\n\nPresident Xi has won accolades for his cool public demeanor and unflappability in dealing with foreign leaders. It would be interesting to see how he\u2019d react to those words. And Trump, a new president who needs to show results soon, could chalk up a rare win.\n\nJohn Moody is Executive Vice President, Executive Editor for Fox News.

Gary Palmer of Alabama and David Schweikert of Arizona \u2013 both of whom are members of the Freedom Caucus, the group that effectively blocked the first health care bill brought by Ryan.\n\nThey voted 9-3 to advance the amendment, which will next go to the House floor for a full vote, though no schedule has been set.\n\nHouse members then headed home for a two-week recess Thursday. Republicans still face deep divisions in their party over the best way to repeal and replace ObamaCare.\n\nBefore lawmakers left, Ryan tried to strike an optimistic tone and praised the Palmer-Schweikert amendment.\n\n\u201cTheir amendment makes this a much better bill,\u201d Ryan said Thursday. \u201cThis amendment alone is real progress and it will help us build momentum toward delivering on our pledge to the country.\u201d\n\nRyan added that there are other ideas Republicans are working on to build consensus but did not provide details.\n\nRyan, who had publicly guaranteed a win with the Republican plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare, was forced to call off a floor vote on the measure two weeks ago after it became clear he did not have enough support from members of his own party.\n\nRyan and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price helped craft the bill that would have scaled back the federal role in health care and cut taxes for the wealthy. Deep differences emerged within the GOP over the bill.\n\nThe defeat came at the hands of conservative members in Ryan\u2019s own party. At the time, Ryan admitted \u201cwe\u2019re going to be living with ObamaCare for the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nVirtually every congressional Republican won election promising to repeal ObamaCare. With a Republican in the White House, that passage seemed almost a done deal.\n\nAfter the debacle, Trump told Republican leaders he would be moving on with his agenda and focusing on tax reform. However, since then, Trump has made public statements that indicate the push to overhaul former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law is still a priority for the White House.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy met with President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/06/ryan-on-obamacare-overhaul-real-progress-being-made.html"}, {"text": "House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes on Thursday stepped down temporarily from his role leading the committee\u2019s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign and possible surveillance of Trump associates by the prior administration.\n\nNunes in a statement cited the efforts of \"several leftwing activist groups\" to lodge \"entirely false and politically motivated\" accusations against him with the Office of Congressional Ethics as his reason for sidelining himself. The House Ethics Committee is set to investigate the allegations against Nunes.\n\nRep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, is now set to lead the Russia/spying probe \"with assistance\" from Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., and Rep. Tom Rooney, R-Fla.\n\nNunes said he would \"continue to fulfill all my other responsibilities as Committee Chairman\" and had requested to speak with the Ethics Committee \"in order to expedite the dismissal of these false claims.\"\n\nNeither House Speaker Paul Ryan nor Nunes gave the White House a heads up about the announcement, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told Fox News. The Nunes news broke as President Trump was leaving a Wounded Warrior event. Spicer said he had not spoken to Trump about it but was expecting to do so shortly aboard Air Force 1.\n\nSpicer wouldn't comment on the specifics of the move, but said that Nunes' absence wouldn't change the \"substance\" of the House Intelligence Committee's investigation and praised Conaway, calling him \"a great guy.\"\n\nIn a written statement, Nunes suggested the accusations against him were timed to distract from reports about the names of Trump associates being \"unmasked\" in intelligence files during the latter weeks of the Obama administration by former National Security Adviser Susan Rice.\n\n\"The charges are entirely false and politically motivated, and are being leveled just as the American people are beginning to learn the truth about the improper unmasking of the identities of U.S. citizens and other abuses of power,\" he said.\n\nA source close to Nunes called the alleged Democrat-led campaign to file complaints with the Office of Congressional Ethics a \"clever political trick.\" Even if vindicated -- which Nunes believes he will be -- too much political damage had already been done for Nunes to remain in his role leading the Russia/spying investigations, the source said.\n\nAnother congressional staffer agreed with the claim that the complaints were a \"coordinated tactic\" organized by Democrats, and said the move was made to get the conversation off of Rice. The staffer said the news came on the eve of the Easter recess in order for it to have maximum impact.\n\nIn a statement, the House Committee on Ethics said it was looking into allegations that Nunes \"may have made unauthorized disclosures of classified information, in violation of House Rules, law, regulations, or other standards of conduct.\"\n\nNunes last month held a news conference in which he discussed viewing classified reports that appeared to show the unmasking of Trump associates. He then controversially went to brief the president before meeting with the Intelligence Committee.\n\nSome detractors have wanted Nunes removed from the investigation for awhile, pointing to his role as a member of Trump's transition team and arguing that he could not lead an impartial investigation. Viewing the classified documents on White House grounds and briefing Trump only added fuel to the fire.\n\nRyan backed Nunes' decision.\n\n\u201cDevin Nunes has earned my trust over many years for his integrity and dedication to the critical work that the intelligence community does to keep America safe,\" Ryan, R-Wis., said in a statement. \"He continues to have that trust, and I know he is eager to demonstrate to the Ethics Committee that he has followed all proper guidelines and laws.\"\n\nIntelligence Committee Ranking Member Adam Schiff, D-Calif., has publicly criticized Nunes' conduct and characterizations for weeks, however, he was conciliatory on Thursday.\n\n\"I know this was not an easy decision for the Chairman, with whom I have worked well for many years,\" Schiff said in a statement. \"He did so in the best interests of the committee and I respect that decision.\"\n\nFox News' Catherine Herridge, Serafin Gomez and John Roberts contributed to this report.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/06/nunes-steps-down-from-russia-trump-investigation.html"}, {"text": "See how your senators voted on Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch\n\nPosition on final confirmation for Gorsuch 54 Support Alexander (TN)\n\nBarrasso (WY)\n\nBlunt (MO)\n\nBoozman (AR)\n\nBurr (NC)\n\nCapito (WV)\n\nCassidy (LA)\n\nCochran (MS)\n\nCollins (ME)\n\nCorker (TN)\n\nCornyn (TX)\n\nCotton (AR)\n\nCrapo (ID)\n\nCruz (TX)\n\nDaines (MT)\n\nDonnelly (IN)\n\nEnzi (WY)\n\nErnst (IA)\n\nFischer (NE)\n\nFlake (AZ)\n\nGardner (CO)\n\nGraham (SC)\n\nGrassley (IA)\n\nHatch (UT)\n\nHeitkamp (ND)\n\nHeller (NV)\n\nHoeven (ND)\n\nInhofe (OK)\n\nJohnson (WI)\n\nKennedy (LA)\n\nLankford (OK)\n\nLee (UT)\n\nManchin III (WV)\n\nMcCain (AZ)\n\nMcConnell (KY)\n\nMoran (KS)\n\nMurkowski (AK)\n\nPaul (KY)\n\nPerdue (GA)\n\nPortman (OH)\n\nRisch (ID)\n\nRoberts (KS)\n\nRounds (SD)\n\nRubio (FL)\n\nSasse (NE)\n\nScott (SC)\n\nShelby (AL)\n\nStrange (AL)\n\nSullivan (AK)\n\nThune (SD)\n\nTillis (NC)\n\nToomey (PA)\n\nWicker (MS)\n\nYoung (IN) 45 Oppose Baldwin (WI)\n\nBennet (CO)\n\nBlumenthal (CT)\n\nBooker (NJ)\n\nBrown (OH)\n\nCantwell (WA)\n\nCardin (MD)\n\nCarper (DE)\n\nCasey (PA)\n\nCoons (DE)\n\nCortez Masto (NV)\n\nDuckworth (IL)\n\nDurbin (IL)\n\nFeinstein (CA)\n\nFranken (MN)\n\nGillibrand (NY)\n\nHarris (CA)\n\nHassan (NH)\n\nHeinrich (NM)\n\nHirono (HI)\n\nKaine (VA)\n\nKing (ME)\n\nKlobuchar (MN)\n\nLeahy (VT)\n\nMarkey (MA)\n\nMcCaskill (MO)\n\nMenendez (NJ)\n\nMerkley (OR)\n\nMurphy (CT)\n\nMurray (WA)\n\nNelson (FL)\n\nPeters (MI)\n\nReed (RI)\n\nSanders (VT)\n\nBrian Schatz (HI)\n\nSchumer (NY)\n\nShaheen (NH)\n\nStabenow (MI)\n\nTester (MT)\n\nUdall (NM)\n\nVan Hollen (MD)\n\nWarner (VA)\n\nWarren (MA)\n\nWhitehouse (RI)\n\nWyden (OR)", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/06/gorsuch-vote-tracker.html"}, {"text": "The Senate is to vote on Judge Neil Gorsuch's nomination.\n\nCheck in below for FoxNews.com's live blog.

But Abrams says Trump could get lucky, again.\n\nTAIWAN: US RELATIONS WON'T BE HARMED BY TRUMP, CHINESE PRESIDENT MEETING\n\n\u201cWe happen to have a very fine festival taking place while the president of China is here, which we have brought to the attention of the White House,\u201d said Abrams.\n\nPalm Beach County is hosting a Chinese Lantern Festival that has a \u201cping pong diplomacy\u201d theme commemorating the Nixon administration's overtures to the country.\n\n\u201cSo it would be quite outstanding to see the two presidents take part,\u201d Abrams said.\n\nThe visit by President Xi was reportedly arranged at the urgent request of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger\u2019s contacts in China who worked with Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law.\n\n\u201cThere simply has not been enough time to arrange a formal visit by Mr. Xi,\u201d said J.J. Tkacik of the Alexandria, Va.-based International Assessment and Strategy Center.\n\nTkacik said he cannot imagine a more appropriate venue to host the Chinese president. Mar-a-Lago, a National Historic Landmark, was designed in the 1920s to be a winter retreat for presidents and foreign dignitaries.\n\n\u201cWashington, D.C., is too hectic, New York\u2019s logistics and security too complicated, Camp David is too rustic,\u201d he said. \u201cAirports, hotels and logistics near Palm Beach are all world class.\u201d\n\nExpand / Contract Mar-a-Lago resort, where President-elect Donald Trump is holding meetings, in Palm Beach, Fla., Monday, Dec. 19, 2016.

President George W. Bush was flogged in the American media when a member of the Falun Gong, outlawed in China, used her press credentials to access the White House South Lawn and heckled the Chinese president during a summit welcome ceremony in 2006.\n\nLess reported in the U.S., according to experts in China, is that President Bush is still more popular there than his successor.\n\n\u201cObama initially tried to build a cordial relationship with China, but soon launched \u2018rebalancing\u2019 with trade and military,\u201d said Shen Dingli, of Shanghai\u2019s Fudan University.\n\nDespite the limited time to prepare for such an important meeting, the pressure will be on, from the Chinese side and the U.S. media, to make the visit go flawlessly.\n\n\u201cIt typically takes a lot of negotiation on protocol, precedent, sequence and scope of topics, press coverage and visuals, who will participate, and ability to keep protesters out of audio and visual range,\u201d said the Brooking Institute\u2019s Kenneth Lieberthal, who served on President Clinton\u2019s National Security Council. \u201cPresident Xi wants to get a feel for a mercurial American leader and wants to do so before bad things happen.

But a clash is inevitable \u2014 if not over this Supreme Court nominee, then surely over the next. Democrats are about to launch the first, partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee, forcing an end to Senate rules that have helped foster centuries of bipartisanship.\n\nBut while everyone is discussing the partisanship over Judge Neil Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation, the real question is being ignored: what has caused this increased rancor?\n\nThere is a lot at stake. In fact, there is more at stake than ever before.\n\nThe Supreme Court has recently considered all kinds of questions that never would have come up before about half a century ago. Can proving discrimination against a few female, Walmart employees serve as proof that the company discriminated against 1.3 million female employees? Does the Federal government have the power to determine who is a religious minister? Are residents undergoing training at a hospital to be considered students or employees? Is carbon dioxide, part of the very air that we breathe out, a pollutant that the EPA can regulate? Does the Constitution forbid prayer at school football games and graduation ceremonies?\n\nWhen more is at stake, people fight harder to win. That general rule explains a lot, from how competitively people play sports to how hard they fight to win business contracts and elections. Two baseball teams playing in the seventh game of the World Series are going to play harder than two teams competing in August with no chance of making the playoffs. It explains why campaign spending has gone up at the size of government has increased.\n\nThe same is true of judicial confirmations. The Supreme Court and judges generally are much more powerful and involved in every aspect of our lives than they were 50 years ago.\n\nThe judiciary's expanding sphere of influence is manifested by the increase in federal cases \u2014 which has far outstripped America\u2019s population growth. Since the 1960s, the number of circuit court cases has increased from 21 per million Americans to 223 per million. District court cases have grown over the same period from 448 to 1,252 per million Americans.\n\nEntire branches of law only recently came into existence as new government agencies were formed. In the 1960s, the Equal Employment and Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) were created. In the 1970s, many new regulatory bodies sprang up such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the Federal Election Commission (FEC), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nEach of these organizations created a host of new, often controversial regulations that fall under the jurisdiction of federal courts. Existing agencies were also granted new regulatory powers, resulting in a greater number of lawsuits.\n\nThere is yet another factor. Courts have increasingly become legislative bodies prone to essentially rewriting the law. As hard as it is to believe, before about eighty years ago it wasn\u2019t that unusual for Republicans and Democrats to appoint judges from the other party. It didn\u2019t matter so much, because judges could almost always be expected to enforce the laws as they were written. But long gone are the times when Republican President Herbert Hoover appointed a Democrat to the Supreme Court.\n\nMy book, \"Dumbing Down the Courts,\" shows that the length of confirmations and the rate at which nominations are defeated has moved very much in tandem with this expansion of judicial power. From 1900 through Franklin Roosevelt, the average Supreme Court confirmation took 17 days from nomination to confirmation. From Truman to Ford, it increased to 31 days. Since Reagan, it went up to 74 days.\n\nFortunately, if you are anguished by the partisan rancor over judicial confirmations, there is a solution: shrink the role of government.\n\nJohn R.

By rule, a cloture petition to break a filibuster \u201cripens\u201d two days later. The Senate then automatically takes a vote to halt debate (known as \u201cinvoking cloture\u201d) one hour after the Senate meets.\n\nThis will happen Thursday.\n\nIt is the current precedent of the Senate to require 60 yeas to stop debate. The problem for Senate Republicans is they only have 52 members. Four Democrats will vote with the GOP to end debate: Sens. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Joe Donnelly, D-Ind. The latter three will also vote to confirm Gorsuch. However, Bennet, who co-introduced Gorsuch at his confirmation hearing, has not said if he will vote to confirm Gorsuch. Bennet has only said he will vote to break the filibuster.\n\nSo, Republicans are four votes shy of ending the filibuster. This is where the nuclear option comes in.\n\nThe cloture vote itself will likely fail, ostensibly blocking Gorsuch\u2019s nomination from going to confirmation. But this is the key place for McConnell to attempt to change the precedent. Expect McConnell to switch his vote on the cloture tally from yea to nay so he can be on the \u201cprevailing side\u201d (in this case, the nays). That gives McConnell the right to ask for a revote.\n\nThat only needs 51 yeas. Then McConnell can make a motion for the Senate to revote the failed cloture vote. Again, this just needs a majority vote.\n\nNow the Senate is back on the cloture vote. Nothing is debatable at this point. In other words, the Senate can\u2019t extend matters by talking.\n\nThis is where McConnell drops the bomb.\n\nMcConnell will likely raise a point of order that \u201cthe vote on cloture under Rule 22 for all nominations to the Supreme Court is by a majority vote.\u201d\n\nThe presiding officer, upon advice from the parliamentarian, will likely rule against McConnell. The officer will cite the Senate\u2019s established precedent of 60 votes, not 51, to break a filibuster. The officer will then declare that the \u201cpoint of order is not sustained.\u201d\n\nBut this is where the Senate can establish a new precedent. McConnell will then ask the Senate to vote to overrule the presiding officer. Expect some fancy language like \u201cShall the decision of the chair stand as the judgment of the Senate?\u201d\n\nAnother roll call vote starts. In this case, Republicans will vote nay, as they don\u2019t want the chair\u2019s ruling to stand. They are voting to establish a new precedent. In other words, the noes must prevail to set a new standard.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the nuclear option. There\u2019s a new precedent.\n\nThen, at some point later Thursday the Senate will take a new vote to invoke cloture and finish debate on the Gorsuch nomination. They\u2019ll just need a simple majority to invoke cloture under the new precedent.\n\nBy rule, opponents of an issue get 30 hours of debate following cloture. That means the Senate likely has to wait until Friday night to get to a final confirmation vote.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/06/what-is-nuclear-option-how-mcconnell-plans-to-get-gorsuch-confirmed.html"}, {"text": "U.S. military officials next month will meet with their counterparts in the airline industry to discuss how the Pentagon and commercial airlines can work together to deal with a nationwide pilot shortage, the head of Air Mobility Command said Wednesday.\n\nThe meeting is set to take place May 18 at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, Gen. Carlton Everhart II said during a breakfast with defense reporters Wednesday in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"We have competing resources,\" he said, referring to the military and the airline industry. \"So how do we complement each other instead of competing against each other? And that is one of the objectives of this meeting.\"\n\nThe head of Air Mobility Command said he stands to potentially lose 1,600 pilots who are eligible to separate from the service in the next four years. The command, which provides airlift and transport services, is among the first place civilian airlines look for potential hires.\n\nEverhart said he plans to attend the meeting -- which is actually the third such get-together involving military and airline officials -- along with Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein, headquarters Air Force and operations personnel, airline industry representatives and regional airline officials, as well as colleagues from the Army, Marine Corps and the Navy.\n\nAcademic institutions such as Embry Riddle University, an aeronautical university specializing in aviation and aerospace, and civil reserve airfleet institutions such as FedEx or UPS may also attend, Everhart said. RAND Corp., a nonprofit institution that provides research and analysis studies on public policy, will also sit in for research purposes, he said.\n\nOne concern Everhart hears repeatedly is the \"1,500 rule,\" he said, referring to the number of hours the Federal Aviation Administration requires civilian pilots to have before they can fly for a major airline.\n\n\"The 1,500 rule -- where did that 1,500 hours come from?\" Everhart said. \"That came out of some aircraft incidents that happened.\"\n\nA military-trained pilot needs only 750 hours under FAA rules, \"which makes us a highly valuable commodity to the airline industry,\" he said.\n\nBut it's not just pilots.\n\nDemand is also surging for aircraft maintainers and air traffic control room operators as well because they, too, are sought after by the airlines, Everhart told reporters and congressional staffers Friday at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.\n\nEverhart said he wants industry to lead the meeting \"with solutions\" for these dilemmas but he also has a few ideas in mind.\n\nTo get around the 1,500-hour threshold for the airlines, Everhart suggested a compromise. What if the airline industry creates pilot training simulation complexes around the country for incoming or potential recruits to train in a simulator to gain \"valuable experience?\" It may get people to stay in aviation and grow the selection pool, he said.\n\nDebt forgiveness from four-year undergraduate schools may be another way to get pilots, he said.\n\nOr \"maybe I can have pilots who come on active-duty take a sabbatical like we're doing with some of the family members right now,\" he said. \"They go on sabbatical for five years and work for the airline industry ... and then come back to me. Or they go to the Guard or Reserve because they're hurting also,\" Everhart said.\n\nIn that case, the pilot is being used by both the military and the civilian world without having to choose a long-term career path.\n\nThrowing more money -- in pilot bonuses and pay -- will never be the only solution, said Everhart, who is currently conducting exit surveys of outgoing pilots.\n\nThe fiscal 2017 National Defense Authorization Act authorizes the Air Force to increase aviation retention pay from $25,000 to $35,000 per year and flight pay up to $1,000 per month \"as needed to address manning shortfalls and challenges,\" according to the service.\n\nEverhart said, \"Most people serve because it's what's in their heart. The bonus was very nice. [But] the bonus is not why I stayed in.\" He has flown aircraft such as the C-130E/H, C-17A, C-21A, C-9A, C-5A, KC-135R, among others, according to his official biography.\n\nA better way to find solutions, Everhart said, is to ask the right questions going forward -- turning from, \"Why did a pilot leave?\" to \"Why did he stay?\"\n\n\"Because once you figure that one out, you can go and assess those people and then bring them on so they stay, and the chances of them staying is in your favor,\" he said.\n\n-- Oriana Pawlyk can be reached at oriana.pawlyk@military.com.

Koch, to the Citizens United Foundation.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump\u2019s legislative affairs director, Marc Short, earned $78,000 from Freedom Partners, a Koch-linked group where he once served as president, plus nearly $380,000 for consulting work, listing clients such as the Club for Growth and Susan B. Anthony List, both right-leaning activist groups, as well as the presidential campaign of Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida.\n\n\u201cAnd Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, reported earning more than $1 million in income tied to conservative-oriented work, with at least $500,000 of that from entities linked to the conservative megadonor Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah, including the Breitbart News Network and Cambridge Analytica, a data mining firm partly owned by Mr. Mercer that worked for the Trump campaign.\u201d\n\nThese disclosures \u201coffer a hint of how an explosion in spending has expanded the lucrative array of private political work in Washington, enriching even the anti-establishment activists and operatives who sided with Mr. Trump.\u201d\n\nOnly later comes the obligatory both-sides-do-it paragraph:\n\n\u201cTo be sure, Democrats take care of their own, as well. When President Barack Obama took office in 2009, his senior adviser, David Axelrod, reported an income of more than $1 million, listing consulting services for Democratic candidates and other political clients.\"\n\nIn fact, Axelrod's firm worked in a Nigerian election, and former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina beat Axelrod in the 2015 British race won by David Cameron.\n\nHillary Clinton loyalist David Brock, meanwhile, drew income not only from his own group, Media Matters, but from the pro-Hillary organizations Correct the Record and American Bridge as well.\n\nIt\u2019s hardly shocking that people with conservative or liberal views want to hire those who will fight for those views and know how to work the system.\n\nWashington is full of folks who came to do good and stayed to do well.

However, it won\u2019t matter whether Medicare, Medicaid, private insurers or individuals pick up the tab, if the most urgent challenge in health care is left out of the next debate in Congress.\n\nIn 2010, there were 11.4 million Americans over the age of 80, and by 2050, there will be over 32 million. That growth is a testament to the power of modern medicine and a cause for celebration, except for one problem: One in two people who reach their 80s will get Alzheimer\u2019s, and the American health care system isn\u2019t even remotely equipped to deal with the coming surge.\n\nLeaders in Washington need to start having adult conversations about this rapidly greying population. Otherwise, we\u2019ll all be bankrupt.\n\nThe annual cost to care for people with Alzheimer\u2019s and other dementias is already $226 billion, with Medicare and Medicaid picking up 68 percent of the costs.\n\nIf recent trends continue, the annual cost of Alzheimer\u2019s could reach $1 trillion, in current dollars, by midcentury, costing Medicare and Medicaid almost $700 billion; approximately one fifth of the federal government\u2019s current budget.\n\nThere are two main things Washington should do to deal with this crisis: Drastically increase the amount of federal money going to Alzheimer\u2019s research and give Americans more control over end of life decisions.\n\nWhen it comes to increasing funding, if ever there was a case of spending a little bit of money now to save a lot later, this is it.\n\nDisease research of all kinds is worthy and important. But Alzheimer\u2019s stands apart for the destruction it wreaks on families and finances.\n\nFive million Americans currently have Alzheimer\u2019s, and the disease\u2019s impact spreads far beyond those who have it. Every person with Alzheimer\u2019s requires three people\u2014children, spouses, friends and health care workers\u2014to serve as caregivers. This can be a full-time job and enact a significant toll on the caregivers themselves.\n\nAlthough the National Institutes of Health (NIH) allocated almost $1 billion to Alzheimer\u2019s research last year, funding still lags well behind what researchers need and what other diseases already receive.\n\nThe five treatments that are available today only treat symptoms\u2014rather than preventing, slowing or reversing the disease.\n\nDr. Greg Petsko of Weill Cornell Medical College believes a significant boost in research funding could lead to breakthroughs in the years ahead.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned more about Alzheimer\u2019s in the last few years than in the previous few decades combined. But turning this insight into treatments requires more funding for more studies, and researchers tend to go where the money is. If NIH doubled research funding for Alzheimer\u2019s tomorrow, it would kick the whole machinery of grant making and academic and pharmaceutical company research into a higher gear.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, a bipartisan group of a dozen senators wrote a letter to President Trump imploring him to increase funding for Alzheimer\u2019s research.\n\nUnfortunately, the president\u2019s budget proposes a staggering 18 percent cut to the NIH budget as part of a broader effort to slash discretionary spending. But there is nothing discretionary about increasing Alzheimer\u2019s research. This is a national and moral imperative.\n\nBut more funding alone won\u2019t do it. In order to properly address this crisis, we also need to rethink how much freedom we give individuals over their own end of life decisions: Americans must be empowered to decide when and where quantity and quality of life are most important.\n\nWe all know someone with a horror story of a loved one subjected to painful, unwanted and unnecessary treatments in his or her dying days. Many of them are Alzheimer\u2019s patients. It costs people their dignity and is a driver of why one out of every four Medicare dollars\u2014more than $125 billion\u2014is spent in the last year of life.\n\nThere is no easy solution to this challenge, but practical and humane answers are available. One proposal from Mount Sinai Health System President Ken Davis would require every new Medicare enrollee to have an advance directive\u2014a written statement of a person\u2019s wishes regarding medical treatment\u2014to ensure their choices are respected if they become unable to communicate them to a doctor.\n\nLast year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services authorized patient reimbursement for end of life counseling, including advance directives, but most Americans still don\u2019t have one.\n\nNo matter what happens to ObamaCare or TrumpCare or whatever devil-may-care bill emerges from Congress, a potential cure for Alzheimer\u2019s should not go undiscovered for lack of a few billion dollars in a four trillion-dollar annual budget.\n\nAn aging and Alzheimer\u2019s tsunami is about to hit the U.S. health care system and Washington needs to do its part to help Americans prepare.\n\nYou can\u2019t say we didn\u2019t see it coming.\n\nAndrew Tisch is the Co-Chairman of Loews Corporation, a cofounder of the political reform group No Labels and Vice Chair of the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/04/06/andrew-tisch-aging-and-alzheimer-s-tsunami-is-about-to-hit-us-heres-what-needs-to-happen-right-now.html"}, {"text": "Stephen Bannon, President Trump\u2019s controversial chief strategist, was removed from the National Security Council on Wednesday and reportedly threatened to resign from the Trump administration.\n\nRebekah Mercer, a top Republican donor, had to urge Bannon not to quit after he was removed from his post, sources told Politico.

Even some very smart colleagues of mine dismissed Trump\u2019s allegations, arguing that no one in Washington found them believable.\n\nThen the director of the FBI, James Comey, and the director of the National Security Agency, America\u2019s 60,000-person-strong domestic spying apparatus, Adm. Mike Rogers, testified under oath that they knew of no surveillance of candidate or President-elect Trump at Trump Tower.\n\nWhen I heard these denials, I thought them to be odd at best and erroneous at worst because I was privy to credible chatter in the intelligence community that Trump\u2019s allegations were correct, and I knew that the FBI had revealed it was examining the activities of the Trump campaign to look for Russian involvement and that such an examination would surely find the surveillance of Trump that the intelligence community was chatting about.\n\nThen the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., revealed that whistleblowers from the intelligence community had approached him with evidence supportive of Trump\u2019s claims. He viewed this evidence and revealed that it showed surveillance of candidate and President-elect Trump, but it had nothing to do with Russia. Then Nunes\u2019 Democratic counterpart on the same committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who had complained loud and long that he had not seen the documents, viewed the same documents and afterward remained essentially mute.\n\nBefore all this happened, unnamed sources released a portion of transcripts of telephone conversations between the Russian ambassador to the United States and retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, then Trump\u2019s national security adviser in the White House. The conversations had taken place before Trump was inaugurated. Though only excerpts were revealed -- excerpts intended to embarrass Flynn and taunt Trump -- they arguably showed Flynn counseling the ambassador to expect different treatment of American sanctions on Russia from the Trump administration than they had received from the Obama administration. However, that was an expectation that any rational person would already have had. This revelation and its aftermath did prove embarrassing to Flynn and to Trump, and Flynn resigned.\n\nHow did anyone obtain transcripts of conversations involving Trump campaign or transition officials? Here is the back story.\n\nThe American public has permitted the most massive and thorough domestic surveillance apparatus in history to come about right under our collective and formerly freedom-loving nose. Beginning in 1978 and continuing up to the present, Congress has passed statutes that purport to confine domestic spying to foreign people communicating with anyone in America. Yet that confinement is a myth -- a myth accepted even by the Congresses that have authorized and reauthorized it.\n\nIn theory, spying in America is done pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and subsequent statutes that provide for the intervention of judges who issue warrants. In practice, the warrants are general warrants. They are not based on suspicion. They do not identify the person whose communications are to be intercepted. They permit the NSA to search where it wishes -- for example, in certain ZIP codes, area codes and service provider customer lists -- and retain whatever it finds.\n\nOn top of this subterfuge is the below-the-radar-screen behavior of the NSA, which looks to a Reagan-era executive order to justify its capture in real time of every telephone conversation and every computer keystroke of everyone in the U.S. since 2005.\n\nThat massive amount of raw data is stored digitally in NSA facilities in Maryland and in Utah, and it is available for examination by select people. One of the people who have access to it is the president\u2019s national security adviser. My colleagues at Fox News and at other media outlets have reported that Susan Rice, President Obama\u2019s final national security adviser, sought and obtained transcripts of conversations of people at Trump Tower, ostensibly looking for a connection to Russia. Rice has admitted this.\n\nYet in that process, someone revealed the name of an American whose communications had been examined -- known as unmasking. Unmasking is lawful in private only if necessary to comprehend a national security-related and lawfully intercepted communication. It is never lawful to leak publicly.\n\nIf unmasking is done for any non-national security purpose -- such as politics, curiosity, embarrassment or revenge -- or if it is from a surveilled conversation that was not national security-related, the unmasking is criminal. The use of intelligence data for political purposes is a felony. Its unlawful use is espionage because the identity of Americans surveilled is top-secret -- the highest level of classification. Someone unmasked Lt. Gen. Flynn and most likely President Trump.\n\nThe wrongful exposure of top-secret material is the same crime committed by Hillary Clinton when she placed top-secret emails in non-secure venues. Yet if the allegations against Rice are true, her behavior was arguably worse. Clinton acted with gross negligence. Rice\u2019s alleged behavior may have been intentional.\n\nMichael Doran, who worked in national security in the George W. Bush White House, has argued that \u201csomebody blew a hole in the wall between national security secrets and partisan politics.\u201d\n\nYet this is far worse than a hole in the wall; it is a hole in the Constitution. Mass spying without suspicion and the select revelation of its fruits for political purposes is far worse than anything the government of King George III did to the colonists, and they fought a war to secede from his country.\n\nHow much longer will Americans permit the government to pull the wool over our eyes? Whatever happened to the constitutional right to privacy? Does the Constitution -- which requires a showing of some evidence of wrongdoing to a judge before the government may intercept any communications -- still mean what it says?\n\nAndrew P.

Rice denies ever having sought such information for political purposes and has defended her requests as routine.\n\nBut the most recent government data shows that unmasking or identifying Americans happens in a limited number of cases. The Office for the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the 17 intelligence agencies, said \"...in 2015, NSA disseminated 4,290 FAA Section 702 intelligence reports that included U.S. person information. Of those 4,290 reports, the U.S. person information was masked in 3,168 reports and unmasked in 1,122 reports.\"\n\nThe report said \"NSA is allowed to unmask the identity for the specific requesting recipient only under certain conditions and where specific additional controls are in place\" and those conditions were met for \"654 U.S. person identities\" in 2015.\n\nThat means Americans were identified in 26 percent of the cases, or roughly one in four intelligence reports.\n\nDuring his March 20 testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, NSA director Admiral Mike Rogers said only 20 individuals within the agency are authorized to approve those requests.\n\n\u201cThey receive specific training, there are specific controls put in place in terms of our ability to disseminate information out of the databases associated with U.S. persons,\u201d Rogers said at the time. What it appears to suggest is that the NSA itself agreed that the instances in which Rice requested unmasking warranted that action.\n\nFBI Director James Comey was less direct. \"I don't know for sure. As I sit here, surely more, given the nature of the FBI's work,\" he testified.\n\n\"It would be nice to know the universe of people who have the power to unmask a U.S. citizen's name,\" South Carolina Republican congressman Trey Gowdy pressed. \"Because that might provide something of a roadmap to investigate who might've actually disseminated a masked U.S. citizen's name.\"\n\nRice told NBC News\u2019 Andrea Mitchell that the reports were requested by the Obama administration, which announced a probe into the Russian election hacking in early December. Two months earlier in October, before the election, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Homeland Security Department put out a joint statement about Moscow's interference.\n\nRice told Mitchell, \"Fulfilling the president's request for such a report, they went back and scrubbed more reports. They began to provide more such reports to American officials, including myself.\"\n\nGiven the late fall timeline, it is not clear the intelligence reports Rice discussed during the NBC interview, are the same files reviewed by Nunes and Schiff.\n\nSpeaking to Fox News Wednesday, President Trump said he believed the former national security adviser may have committed a crime when she sought the identities of the Trump team members. The allegation was first reported by the New York Times.\n\nWhile not commenting on the individual case, a former senior intelligence official explained the request must be approved by the NSA. Rice would have understood that there is an extensive government paper trail, that can be audited within the NSA, that shows who requested the unmasking, on what basis, and whether it was granted. This raises more questions about Rice, her motivation and whether it was authorized higher up, offering cover.\n\nIf approved, the former senior intelligence official said, only the requester, in this case Rice, would receive the information.

The drill instructor also allegedly called the recruit a terrorist and said he had spent 14 years in the military fighting people \"exactly like\" him.\n\nFelix was also the senior drill instructor for 20-year-old Raheel Siddiqui, another Muslim recruit who died in a tragic suicide March 18.\n\nAccording to a command investigation focused on the circumstances surrounding Siddiqui's death, Siddiqui had been performing \"get-backs,\" or back-and-forth sprints of some 150 feet when he fell to the ground, clutching his throat. According to the investigation, his drill instructor, Felix, yelled at him and slapped him in the face to wake him.\n\nShortly thereafter, Siddiqui ran out of the squad bay and vaulted over the third-story stairwell railing, falling to his death. The recruit's treatment at the hands of the drill instructor was found to likely have provided \"impetus\" for the suicide, investigators found.\n\nNotably, Felix's charges do not include assault, a possible indicator that not all the allegations featured in the command investigations ultimately translated into charges.\n\nBoth former drill instructors will receive general court-martial proceedings at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, on dates that have yet to be set, according to the TECOM release. General courts-martial are the highest level of military courts, reserved for the most serious charges.\n\nFelix and Eldridge are the fifth and sixth Parris Island drill instructors to face charges in connection with various incidents of alleged recruit hazing within 3rd Recruit Training Battalion.\n\nStaff Sgts. Matthew Bacchus and Jose Lucena-Martinez, and Sgt. Riley Gress will all face special court-martial, an intermediate-level court for charges with penalties not exceeding a year of confinement.

Last month, both men declined to appear at a private closed door House Intelligence Committee briefing and have not met with the committee members since.\n\nThe meeting was supposed to be a follow-up to public testimony by Comey and Rogers to the committee in late March on the topic of Russian meddling in the presidential election and the alleged mishandling of intelligence related to the Trump transition team.\n\nDuring the public hearing, the pair had declined to answer more than 100 questions, and Comey has been completely unavailable since.\n\nHouse Intelligence Chair Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told Fox News he had hoped that behind closed doors, Comey and Rogers would be more forthcoming.\n\nExpand / Contract Nunes wants answers from the intelligence agencies, but his panel has been stymied, according to sources.

But Rice maintained she is not the leaker, didn\u2019t send the information to the press and did not use the information for political purposes.\n\nAnd while U.S. intelligence sources told Fox News that unmasking requests escalated after Trump was elected, Rice claimed she didn\u2019t remember. \u201cI don\u2019t have a particular recollection of doing that more frequently after the election.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump on Wednesday claimed that he believes Rice may have committed a crime by requesting the identities of Trump associates who were mentioned in U.S. surveillance, though he did not provide proof.\n\nAsked by the New York Times if Rice committed a crime, Trump said, \u201cDo I think?

Even the slightest deviation can lead to accusations of perjury.\n\nMany members of the Trump team were engaged in numerous meetings during the transition period. If they will just go back and look at their schedules of those days and nights, they will realize how difficult it is going to be to reconstruct each conversation and each meeting with the level of accuracy these investigations will demand.\n\nI know how dangerous this can be, because I once handed over one million pages of material to congressional investigators and was then questioned on that massive amount of information by the Office of the Independent Counsel.\n\nWhen I was Speaker, the Democrats tried to use the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Election Commission and the House Ethics Committee to destroy me and stop the momentum of the Contract with America.\n\nDespite the Clinton administration\u2019s best efforts, we defeated the IRS and the FEC.

The struggle took years and cost millions.\n\nThe Trump team should take note of the most extraordinary case in my lifetime of process being used to destroy an innocent person \u2013 the conviction of Scooter Libby.\n\nAn independent counsel was appointed to find out who told the press that a woman named Valerie Plame was a covert Central Intelligence Operative in 2003. Her husband was a diplomat who had been critical of the Bush administration. So, the left (and naturally the media) thought this was a big deal.\n\nThe prosecutor targeted Libby, who was Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, because it would be damaging to the Bush administration before the 2004 election.\n\nThe prosecutor claimed Scooter had shared government secrets with a Pulitzer Prize winning New York Times reporter named Judith Miller.\n\nInitially, Miller refused to testify, so \u2013 in perhaps the greatest attack on American press freedom in our lifetime \u2013 the prosecutor had Miller jailed for 85 days.\n\nFinally, she testified that Scooter was the source after he gave her permission to break reporter confidentiality just to get her out of jail.\n\nLibby was ultimately convicted on four counts \u2013 but not for leaking information. He was charged with perjury and obstruction of justice because of the way in which he answered questions.\n\nThe most relevant part of this story \u2013 which shows the investigation was far from an unbiased pursuit of the truth \u2013 is that Miller never even wrote that Plame was a CIA operative.\n\nWashington Post writer Robert Novak first outed Plame as a member of the CIA in a piece on July 14, 2003. Novak was told by Richard Armitage, the No. 2 person at the State Department about Plame.\n\nThe prosecutor in the Libby case knew this, but he was focused on destroying Libby to hurt Bush \u2013 not uncovering the truth.\n\nThe prosecutor told Armitage to keep quiet in order to continue the investigation. And Armitage \u2013 who undeniably leaked the classified information to the public \u2013 was never charged.\n\nI tell this story to illustrate clearly that the Trump team members are not going to face fair, dispassionate, balanced investigations designed to pursue truth and justice.\n\nThey are going to face a vicious, partisan, blood sport aimed at weakening Trump and destroying his administration.\n\nRemember, 97 percent of the campaign contributions from Department of Justice employees went to Hillary Clinton. The professional ranks of the Justice Department are filled with deeply committed liberals who would consider crippling and destroying the Trump team as their moral duty.\n\nAnd the nature of the House investigation was captured by Democratic House Intelligence Committee Member Rep.

He keeps his private life out of view and rarely goes off script from his core message when speaking publically.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, is a billionaire real estate mogul-turned-politician whose political outsider status paired with his off-the-cuff populism propelled him into the White House. During his decades as a boisterous New York businessman, Trump\u2019s personal life was a constant fodder for the tabloids.\n\nSo there is a great deal of speculation among observers about what will happen when Xi arrives at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Thursday for the first meeting between these two very different world leaders.\n\n\u201cThis meeting will set the tone in looking at the strategic framework between the U.S. and China for the next few years,\u201d Robert Daly, the director of the Kissinger Institute on China and the United States at the Woodrow Wilson Center, told Fox News. \u201cChina wants to know what President Trump\u2019s framework toward Beijing will be and if he is a man they can work with.\u201d\n\nDuring his time on the campaign trail last year, Trump was harshly critical of China \u2013 accusing the country of \u201craping\u201d the U.S. economically \u2013 and he has threatened to impose a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports. As president, he has kept his tough stance on trade relations between Washington and Beijing.\n\nJust last week, the president tweeted that he expects his meeting with Xi to be \u201cvery difficult\u201d and added on Friday that \u201cwe\u2019re going to get down to some serious business\u201d in reference to the trade deficit with China and Trump\u2019s perception that the China is negatively impacting the U.S. economy, especially in regards to the manufacturing sector.\n\nThe meeting next week with China will be a very difficult one in that we can no longer have massive trade deficits... \u2014 Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 30, 2017\n\nTo this end, Trump signed a pair of executive orders last Friday that \u2013 despite assertions from White House aides that the timing was coincidental \u2013 appear to take a shot a China ahead of Xi\u2019s visit. The two orders focused primarily on reducing the trade deficit, which accounted for the majority, $347 billion, of last year\u2019s total $502 billion trade deficit.\n\nChina downplayed Trump\u2019s tweet and executive orders by portraying the issue as one in which both nations had an equal stake in.\n\nThis meeting will set the tone in looking at the strategic framework between the U.S. and China for the next few years. - Robert Daly, the director of the Kissinger Institute on China and the United States at the Woodrow Wilson Center\n\n\u201cChina will continue to work with the United States to think creatively and keeping pushing for greater balance in China-U.S. trade,\u201d Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang told reporters in Beijing.\n\nExperts tend to agree with the Chinese government\u2019s assertion \u2013 noting also that there are many other factors to take into account when looking at the loss of manufacturing jobs in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIt is very important\u2014very important\u2014to keep China engaged in the world economy,\u201d Frances Rosenbluth, a political science professor at Yale University, told Fox News. \u201cWe want them to have an economic stake in our prosperity and in global economic stability and growth, more generally. So trade protectionism is just a bad idea.\u201d\n\nRosenbluth said while it may be convenient to blame China for the loss of American job \u201cthe far bigger cause is automation.\u201d\n\nWhile there are very low expectations that any major trade deal will come out of the meeting between Trump and Xi, observers have noted that China could grant Trump some minor economic concession. This would give the president \u2013 still smarting from the failure of health care reform \u2013 a publicity victory, while also allowing Xi to tout that the relationship with Washington is still strong as he prepares to consolidate his power at the 19th Chinese Communist Party congress later this year.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re probably going to do some chalkboard diplomacy that will enable Trump to have a successful summit at Mar-a-Lago,\u201d Daly said. \u201cXi just wants to stabilize the relationship for the rest of this year.\u201d\n\nAnother issue that has rankled Trump is China\u2019s refusal to take a stronger stance toward North Korea and its burgeoning hopes of developing nuclear weapons. Early Wednesday morning North Korea fired an apparent ballistic missile into the Sea of Japan, just hours after Trump described the country's pursuit of a nuclear arsenal as a \"humanity problem\" and a senior U.S. official told reporters that the \"clock has now run out\" on Pyongyang.\n\nExpand / Contract North Korean leader Kim Jong Un speaks during a ceremony to award party and state commendations to nuclear scientists, technicians, soldier-builders, workers and officials.

The memo also noted that any future right-of-way decisions will be determined by the BLM\u2019s office in Washington, D.C.\n\nCadiz CEO Scott Slater told the Los Angeles Times that he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that the BLM\u2019s reversal will allow the pipeline to be greenlit. Under the Obama administration\u2019s order, Cadiz would have had to go through a lengthy and pricey federal environmental review process if it wanted to construct its pipeline on government-owned land.\n\nThe resource company hopes to pump groundwater stored in its privately-owned Mojave holdings to supply 100,000 households. If successful, Cadiz stands to make between $1 billion and $2 billion in revenue over the project's 50-year lifespan.\n\nThe pipeline has the support of many local lawmakers, including the San Bernardino County Board of Commissioners, which approved the project back in 2012. The board argued that the project would be a boon to the local economy by creating thousands of jobs and also bring water reliability to an area of the country that has suffered through a devastating drought over the past few years.\n\nCadiz also overcame a number of environmental lawsuits under state law. As part of its decision the San Bernardino County supervisors established an independent enforcement role over the project\u2019s operations and authorized groundwater withdrawals that will avoid harm to desert resources.\n\nEnvironmentalists and desert advocates, however, have decried the project, arguing that the project could deplete water needed to support the local wildlife and cause dust storms that would affect regional air quality.\n\nFederal hydrologists have challenged Cadiz\u2019s assertions about the rate of natural recharge of the desert aquifer. Public land advocates say that any pumping will dry up the natural springs on surrounding federal land.\n\n\u201cMany of the springs and seeps are going to dry up because of groundwater extraction,\u201d Ileene Anderson, a biologist with the Center for Biological Diversity, told The Press Enterprise.\n\nExpand / Contract Sen. Dianne Feinstein speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington July 31. (AP)\n\nSen.

It is President Trump\u2019s first urgent national security test.\n\nIn a White House statement following initial reports of Tuesday\u2019s attack, President Trump accused Mr. Assad, whom he has been tacitly supporting as the lesser of evils in the fight against the Islamic State, of conducting a \u201creprehensible act\u201d that \u201ccannot be ignored by the civilized world.\u201d\n\nThe strike, he added in a gratuitous swipe at his predecessor, was the direct result of President Obama\u2019s \u201cweakness and irresolution,\u201d that is, his failure to enforce the \u201cred line\u201d he drew against the use of chemical weapons by intervening militarily after a previous Syrian chemical strike in 2013.\n\nTo be taken seriously, Mr. Trump must now do more than rhetorically condemn \u201cthis intolerable attack.\u201d He must show that he is not merely adept at tweeting tough, but prepared to force President Assad to stop committing war crimes and make him pay a price for having flaunted international law and his new administration\u2019s sympathy for Syria\u2019s struggle against militant Islam.\n\nMake no mistake. While Syria has been dropping chlorine in \u201cbarrel bombs\u201d over the past two years, this strike violates Mr. Assad\u2019s commitment after his 2013 attack to abide by the treaty banning the possession and use of chemical weapons.\n\nUnder American and Russian pressure, Mr. Assad signed the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention and gave up some 1,300 tons of deadly chemical weapons, the Arab world\u2019s largest, deadliest CW stockpile, after as many as 1,400 people died when Syrian forces used a lethal neuro-toxin in the town of Ghouta in August, 2013.\n\nWhile the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) have not yet determined what Syria\u2019s air force reportedly dropped from its aircraft Tuesday, it seems clear to us that the agent was an illegal weapon banned by the treaty \u2013 mostly likely sarin.\n\nThe use of sarin is a war crime, and a far more blatant violation of the treaty than the use of a toxic industrial chemical, like chlorine. The attack suggests, in turn, that Mr. Assad has either retained hidden stocks of the agent he supposedly turned over to international inspectors for destruction, or that Damascus is back in the business of secretly producing small quantities of the banned weapon. Either way, Mr. Assad is testing the new American president\u2019s forbearance, not to mention his stated determination to restore U.S. leadership and respect for America throughout the world.\n\nAlthough Mr. Trump and Nikki Haley, his U.N. Ambassador, have called Mr. Assad a \u201cwar criminal,\u201d the president has also made clear that Washington accepts the need for Mr. Assad to stay in power, at least until the defeat of the Islamic State. But Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to tolerate Mr. Assad\u2019s rule, which effectively aligns Washington in Syria with Russia and Iran in the fight against ISIS, seems only to have emboldened Mr. Assad.\n\nThis must not stand.\n\nIf Mr. Trump fails to respond to Mr. Assad, what signal will be sent to President Kim Jong Un of North Korea, who launched yet another ballistic missile test in violation of U.N. resolutions and American warnings this week? Or to China, whose leader President Trump will try this week to cajole or pressure into doing more to reverse Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear missile program, a direct threat to the U.S.?\n\nPresident Trump has several options in Syria, none without great risk. One is military action against Syria\u2019s air force \u2013 grounding the helicopters and fixed wing aircraft that are believed to have dropped the deadly agent \u2013 and the runways from which they operate. Yes, such strikes risk Russian casualties. But Moscow has consistently blocked U.N. action on Syria but proven unable to contain Mr. Assad\u2019s bad behavior. And President Vladimir Putin would be forewarned. Grounding Syria\u2019s air force, moreover, would help distance Mr. Trump from Mr. Putin, a politically useful benefit at this time.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump mocked Mr. Obama for having failed to enforce his \u201cred line\u201d warning to Mr. Assad against the use of chemical weapons, Andrew Weber, the former assistant secretary of defense who supervised the removal and destruction of the bulk of Syrian\u2019s deadly arsenal, notes that thanks to Mr. Obama\u2019s preference for getting most of Assad\u2019s chemical weapons out of Syria over military action, President Obama has bequeathed Mr. Trump an option he lacked. \u201cThere was no military option in 2013 to destroy, 1,300 tons of CW without dispersing deadly chemical agent and endangering large numbers of innocent civilians,\u201d Mr. Weber said. \u201cBut with the CW stockpile removed and destroyed, a military option now exists.\u201d\n\nA second option would be to implement candidate Trump\u2019s pledge to establish \u201csafe zones\u201d for long-suffering Syrian civilians caught up in Syria\u2019s seven-year civil war with no end in sight. That would require the deployment of more American and foreign soldiers to secure such zones in what could be a dangerous, open-ended commitment. Such a move would be politically divisive at home and abroad.\n\nBoth options, as Mr. Trump is surely now discovering, are precarious, and, well, complicated. But resorting only to tough talk and tweets will send the very message of American vacillation and weakness that candidate Trump so vehemently condemned.

Since then, we've been peeling away all the layers of the president's claim with the help of the investigative reporting from people like Sara Carter and John Solomon.\n\nSara and John uncovered the existence of an FBI investigation into a server at Trump Tower. They also discovered that a federal Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant that allowed federal officials to capture Trump team communications existed prior to the president taking office.\n\nThen they revealed that high-ranking officials with direct access to President Obama may have had access to unmasked federal surveillance of Trump transition team members. And they may have briefed the president about this information.\n\nThen, on March 22, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes revealed that he had seen reports that prove that President Trump and members of his transition team were, in fact, surveilled and unmasked. The intel collected had nothing to do with Russia, Nunes said.\n\nLast week, we uncovered video from March 2, in which Evelyn Farkas, a very prominent Obama administration official who served in the administration until 2015, encouraged her former colleagues to get as much intelligence as they could about the Trump team before they left office.\n\n\u201cI was urging my former colleagues \u2026 \u2018Get as much information as you can, get as much intelligence as you can before President Obama leaves the administration\u2019 because I had a fear that, somehow, that information would disappear with the senior people who left,\u201d Farkas told MSNBC.\n\nFarkas said she feared the Trump administration \u201cwould try to compromise [intel gathering] sources and methods, meaning we would no longer have access to that intelligence.\u201d\n\nFarkas was admitting surveillance took place of the Trump transition team, that there was unmasking of names and that there was also talk about leaking the information, which would be a felony.\n\nBreitbart News unearthed a video from October 2016 in which Farkas predicted the impeachment of Trump if he was elected.\n\n\u201cIf Donald Trump were elected, I believe he'd be impeached pretty quickly or somebody else would have to take over government,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I'm not even joking.\u201d\n\nShe must have thought she knew something.\n\nThis week, we have seen multiple reports that revealed that Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice, was requesting that members of the Trump transition team\u2019s names be unmasked in raw intelligence reports. In what passes for an interview at MSNBC, she was permitted to deny and dodge the allegations.\n\n\u201cThere were occasions when I would receive a report in which a U.S. person was referred to -- name not provided, just U.S. person,\u201d Rice said. \u201cAnd sometimes in that context, in order to understand the importance of the report and assess its significance, it was necessary to find out or request the information as to who that U.S. official was.\u201d\n\nBut wait a second. Just two weeks ago, Susan Rice was on PBS and she said she, \"knew nothing about\" any kind of unmasking. Was she lying then, or this week?\n\nRemember, Susan Rice has a stormy relationship with the truth. She flat-out lied to the faces of the American people about the issue of the Benghazi terror attack.\n\n\u201cWhat sparked the recent violence was the airing on the internet of a very hateful, very offensive video,\u201d she told Fox News on the first Sunday following the attack. She would appear on four other shows that day to spout the same untruth.\n\nA history of lying, a complete 180 on unmasking in just two short weeks. It is clear something is amiss and we are on the brink of yet another scandal.\n\nYet, the alt-left, propaganda, destroy-Trump-media is trying everything they can do to find proof that President Trump and his campaign was colluding with Russia. There's no evidence, even after eight long months.\n\nThe real question is this: Did President Obama and his administration knowingly surveil either an incoming president or an opposition party candidate?

Unfortunately, many of them including their president are still all about Obama.\n\nMuch of the political world, including quite a few Republicans, recoiled when President Trump\u2019s White House issued a statement on the recent savagery in Syria that included a name-checked slam on the 44th president.\n\nWith women and children in a chemical weapons attack presumed to be launched by Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, what kind of creep would take a gratuitous political shot \u2013 no matter how right \u2013 at a predecessor? The answer may be not creepiness but rather a curious form of blindness. For the past nine years, Republicans out ran their own divisions and lingering policy disagreements by rallying around a shared loathing of Obama.\n\nConsider Syria itself. Some Republicans, like Sen. John McCain R-Ariz., and others wanted the U.S. to intervene in Syria\u2019s civil war, even if it meant sending troops. Other, like Trump, wanted America to stay the hell out of this latest Middle Eastern tragedy.\n\nBut they could all agree that Obama, by setting and then forgetting a \u201cred line\u201d about the use of chemical weapons, had made a huge blunder. Many Democrats would agree. But that produces no agreement about what to do next.\n\nSame for ObamaCare almost everyone right of center can agree that the law was ill conceived and poorly executed. As for policy prescriptions to fix it? You will hear everything from nuking the entire status quo to create a nearly absolute free market to others who say it\u2019s time to suck it up and move toward a single-payer system.\n\nOr watch Republicans fixate on former National Security Advisor Susan Rice.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that if Team Obama engaged in improper or illegal targeting or leaking about a political rival\u2019s campaign \u2013 something hardly out of the realm of possibility given some of the hackery in which Obama\u2019s administration engaged - it would be an epochal scandal.\n\nBut similarly it would be no small beer if anyone in Trump\u2019s campaign is found to have colluded with Russian operatives to shape the outcome of the 2016 campaign. Also hardly out of the realm of possibility given the repeated revelations about connections between members of Team Trump and the Kremlin.\n\nA reasonable person can be concerned about both things. But a person seeing their party\u2019s fortunes flagging might eagerly ignore the latter and focus on the former. \u201cLet\u2019s stop worrying about Russia and go back to talking about how much we hate Obama.\u201d\n\nObama himself engaged in much of this conduct and Republicans rightly, if self-interestedly, called him on it repeatedly. The former president\u2019s reflexive Bush bashing was tacky and, ultimately, counterproductive.\n\nBut much from the Obama era we have only intensified the faults of our system and its denizens in the age of Trump.\n\nDemocrats are up in arms over all of the Obama bashing, suddenly imagining that their departed hero was not guilty of any similar transgressions. But it also imagines that they will do differently than Trump & Co. in the future.\n\nIt is easy to imagine that the two-word Democratic platform for 2018 and 2020 will be only \u201cnot Trump.\u201d It seems to be working for them and it requires no discussion about complicated, divisive topics.\n\nBut if they repeat the cycle again and succeed Trump with more graceless, backward-looking leadership they will fail to deliver on the issues that matter most to voters, and they too will be replaced by the next round of \u201canybody but.\u201d\n\n\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: YOU\u2019LL STILL GET BURNED\n\n\u201cBut it could not be less folly to abolish liberty, which is essential to political life, because it nourishes faction, than it would be to wish the annihilation of air, which is essential to animal life, because it imparts to fire its destructive agency.\u201d \u2013 Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 10\n\n\n\nTIME OUT: YOU\u2019RE DOING IT WRONG\n\nNYT: \u201cThe train pulls into Pennsylvania Station during the morning rush, the doors open and you make a beeline for the escalators.

Mike Flynn to make sure Flynn carried through with a directive to depoliticize the NSC, a senior administration official told Fox News. Bannon only attended one meeting of the Principles Committee.

It is one of the big stories of our time.\u2019 He declined to say if he had personally reviewed new intelligence to bolster his claim but pledged to explain himself \u2018at the right time.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump calls for change in Syria policy \u2013 WSJ: President Donald Trump on Wednesday called the suspected chemical weapons attack on civilians in Syria \u201ca terrible affront to humanity\u201d and hinted briefly that a change in U.S. policy on Syria may be coming as a result. Mr. Trump addressed the chemical attack, which has killed at least 74 people, at the beginning a White House meeting with King Abdullah II of Jordan that was likely to focus heavily on the six-year conflict. U.S. officials believe the attack was carried out by the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Just days before the chemical attack, Trump administration officials said the U.S. would no longer prioritize regime change in Syria and that they expect Mr. Assad to remain in power.\n\nTillerson says U.S. has \u2018no further comment\u2019 on NoKo missile launch failure - Fox News\u2019 Lucas Tomlinson reports that the Pentagon considers the North Korean missile launch a likely failure: \u201cThe missile did not go as far as intended, officials with knowledge of the latest intelligence reports said. It did not reach Japanese waters and may have \u2018pinwheeled in flight,\u2019 according to one official\u2026A senior administration official told Fox News the launch didn't represent much of a provocation on North Korea's part. In a 23-word statement, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made it clear the administration was moving in a new direction: \u2018North Korea launched yet another intermediate range ballistic missile. The United States has spoken enough about North Korea. We have no further comment.\u2019\u201d\n\nSchiff open to Rice testifying - The Hill: \u201cRep.

White House officials and leading legislators aimed to resume talks Wednesday. Late Tuesday, they failed in a Capitol basement office meeting to shake hands on a White House proposal to let states seek federal waivers to drop coverage mandates that President Barack Obama's health care law slapped on the insurance industry. \u2026 The White House offers got an uneven reception earlier Tuesday from GOP moderates and conservatives, leaving prospects shaky that the party could salvage one of its leading legislative priorities.\u201d\n\nJonathan Swan, Caitlin Owens and Rebecca Zisser provide latest updates - Axios: \u201cThe Republican talks on patching up Trumpcare sure deteriorated in a hurry. For a while yesterday, they dissolved into bickering and finger-pointing, with members of the Freedom Caucus saying the proposed compromise is getting worse \u2014 and House Republican leaders saying it's bleeding votes. Now, they're back to talking again \u2014 and talking and talking and talking, with no legislative text and no visible signs of progress.\u201d\n\n[Meanwhile recent Gallup Poll shows ObamaCare gaining public support]\n\nDEMS TRY TO MAR GORSUCH AHEAD OF NEAR CERTAIN CONFIRMATION\n\nWaPo: \u201cMostly while we slept Tuesday night, Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) seized the Senate floor for roughly 15 hours in an attempt to launch an old-school filibuster to block Judge Neil Gorsuch from getting on the Supreme Court. He ended it around 10:30 a.m. Wednesday morning. But his filibuster came too late to be able to derail or even delay Gorsuch's confirmation. In fact, it probably wasn't even technically be a filibuster. That's because procedurally, there's nothing he nor his colleagues can do to stop Gorsuch from getting a vote on Thursday to advance his nomination \u2014 and, ultimately, not much they can do stop him from getting on the court.\u201d\n\nKraushaar: Red state Dems acting unafraid - National Journal: \u201cSen.

It\u2019s time for an independent investigation--and a grand jury.\n\nThe more we learn the worse it gets. This week bombshell revelations show that President Obama\u2019s National Security Adviser, Susan Rice, unmasked the names of Trump transition members caught up in Obama Administration surveillance. That unmasked intelligence was then widely disseminated and leaked to numerous media organizations in direct criminal violation of the Espionage Act.\n\nUnmasking U.S. citizens in surveillance requires very specific legal and factual circumstances. By all appearances, the unmasking of Trump transition members was done for political, not national security reasons \u2013 a direct violation of agency policies and likely of federal law.\n\nBut beyond Susan Rice, there needs to be an investigative spotlight focused directly on former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who signed off on the troubling expansion of the distribution of intelligence materials in the final days of the Obama Administration.\n\nIt was Lynch who on January 3 approved changes to Executive Order 12333 that facilitated the spread of raw signals intelligence throughout the intel community, just days before President Obama left office. In effect, that revision expanded the authority of the National Security Agency to share globally intercepted personal communications with the government\u2019s 16 other intelligence agencies.\n\nWhat is not clear is why, after having the opportunity to expand the policy during its 8 prior years in power, the Obama Administration waited to change the policy just before a new administration was set to begin.\n\nThat is why we have filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the Office of the Director of National Security (ODNI), and the National Security Agency (NSA). We demand to know the who, what, and why of this last-minute policy change.\n\nAn independent investigation needs to occur. And a grand jury needs to be impaneled. Lynch, Rice and Evelyn Farkas, a former top Obama Administration defense official who is under also fire for her handling of sensitive intel information and surveillance methods, should be subject to extremely vigorous interrogation.\n\nThey all need to answer questions before a grand jury, where there are severe penalties for avoiding the truth.\n\nThis surveillance scandal is deeply disturbing, in constitutional as well as political terms. By greatly expanding access to classified information by unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats, the Obama Administration paved the way for a shadow government to leak that classified information, endangering our national security, in an attempt to undermine President Trump.\n\nThe American Center for Law and Justice will continue to dig to get to the truth and will, where appropriate, file additional FOIA requests to get to the bottom of this situation.\n\nMisconduct by federal government officials calculated to subvert the Constitution for their own political and ideological agenda must end now.\n\nWhether this misconduct was accomplished through the unmasking of sensitive information, the dissemination of raw intelligence signals information, or the leaking of classified information by bureaucrats who owe their primary allegiance to the shadow government as opposed to the Constitution, all individuals involved in this effort must be subjected to a vigorous and impartial investigation.\n\nThe American people deserve to know the truth about how their government operates and the true reasons for the decisions it makes.\n\nAnd, individuals who violate our laws must be brought to justice without delay.\n\nJay Sekulow is Chief Counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), which focuses on constitutional law.

McMaster has served as the President's National Security Advisor since February, but it was the removal of one of the president's closest aides, Steven Bannon, from the National Security Council's Principals Committee that is drawing the most attention.\n\nThe Principals Committee is made up of people who are considered the President's top national security officials, and is tasked with a variety of issues that affect our national security. In a new White House memo that lists the committee\u2019s members, Bannon is not mentioned.\n\nAccording to the memo, the Principals Committee is now comprised of \"the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Chief of Staff to the President, the Director of National Intelligence, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Advisor, the Homeland Security Advisor, and the Representative of the United States to the United Nations.\"\n\nIn addition to those members, the memo states that \"[t]he Counsel to the President, the Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget may attend all [Principals Committee] meetings.\"\n\nIn a statement, Bannon suggested that President Obama's National Security Adviser, Susan Rice, had \"operationalized the [National Security Council] during the last administration,\" adding that he was only ever put on to \"ensure that it was de-operationalized.\"\n\nBannon added that he believes McMaster \"has returned the NSC to its proper function.\"\n\nA senior administration official tells Fox that Bannon was only ever put on the committee as a check on former National Security Advisor, Lt Gen Michael Flynn. According to the official, the President saw no need for Bannon to stay on after McMaster assumed the role of advisor, but suggested that Bannon will still be able to attend NSC meetings.\n\nBannon\u2019s initial placement on the NSC created controversy among both Republicans and Democrats, who suggested that Bannon could wind up inserting domestic politics into discussions of national security. Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in February that the President would be willing to reconsider Bannon\u2019s role on the NSC if McMaster asked.\n\nThe National Security Council was created in July, 1947, as part of President Truman's National Security Act. According to the Nixon Presidential Library, the NSC was created \"to assist and advise the President on domestic, foreign and military policies relating to national security.\" At the time, the council consisted of just seven permanent members, with the President serving as chairman.\n\nJust a few years later, the NSC went through a reorganization that placed the NSC within the executive office of the President. A series of amendments resulted in the council being divided into three groups: the Executive Secretary and his staff, personnel on detail, and Consultants to the Executive Secretary.\n\nFormer National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft pointed out in an interview with the Council on Foreign Relations that the size of the NSC has \"varied dramatically from the minimum, which was five people under Kennedy, with virtually no staff, to what it is now, which I think is about 350.\"\n\nAccording to a Congressional Research Service report on the NSC, the group\u2019s organization and even influence \u201chave varied significantly from one Administration to another, ranging from highly structured and formal systems to loose-knit teams of experts.\u201d\n\nToday, the council's members include (by statute) the president, the vice president, and the secretaries of state, defense and energy. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of National Intelligence are said to serve in advisory roles, and the president has the discretion to add other members as they see fit.\n\nAt the time of publishing Wednesday afternoon, visitors to the NSC's White House website were being told to \u201c[c]heck back soon for more information.\u201d", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/05/what-is-national-security-council-bannon-off-key-panel.html"}, {"text": "First the Obamas, now the Bidens. Former Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, have book deals.\n\nFlatiron Books told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it will release two books by Joe Biden and one by Jill.\n\nJoe Biden's first book will \"explore one momentous year,\" when his son Beau died in 2015 and his agonized decision against running for president. Biden has said recently that he regrets his choice and believes he could have defeated Republican Donald Trump, who pulled off a stunning upset against the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton.\n\nBiden's memoir is currently untitled and no release date was announced. Flatiron, a Macmillan imprint, is calling the book \"the story of not just a politician, but of a father, grandfather, friend and husband.\"\n\n\"We're so deeply honored to be the publisher of these books by Vice President and Dr. Biden,\" Flatiron president and publisher said in a statement. \"The Vice President's book promises to give us all a deeper understanding of recent political history, but it will clearly also be a book about the values that have given the Vice President strength in both good times and bad.\"\n\nFlatiron did not provide details about the two other books it acquired or about financial terms. Two publishing officials with knowledge of negotiations said bidding went at least into seven figures. The officials were not authorized to discuss negotiations and asked not to be identified. The Bidens were represented by Creative Artists Agency.\n\nIn late February, former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, jointly agreed to write book deals with Crown, a Penguin Random House imprint. Their combined deals are worth well into eight figures.\n\nBiden was a popular vice president and the death of Beau Biden brought him widespread sympathy.\n\nHis book stands a good chance of becoming the rare notable vice presidential memoir, a list even shorter than the list of notable vice presidents. The job had little influence until well into the 20th century and only in recent decades have books by former vice presidents, at least the ones who never became president, attracted much attention.\n\nThe most widely read vice presidential memoir is likely Dick Cheney's \"In My Time,\" a best-seller published in 2011.\n\nBoth Bidens have written books before.

Jack Keane.\n\nKeane said going to war is undesirable to the Trump administration because of the toll it would take on human lives.\n\nNORTH KOREA FIRES MISSILE AS US OFFICIAL SAYS 'CLOCK HAS NOW RUN OUT' ON PYONGYANG\n\n\u201cBut the Trump administration cannot accept a nuclear launch,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot rely on our missile-defense system to defeat it and expose the American people to a nuclear attack. Therefore if an ICBM attack was imminent the president would have to conduct a preemptive strike.\u201d\n\nSuch a position is intended to send a message to Chinese leaders ahead of tomorrow\u2019s meeting at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida.\n\n\u201cThree past presidents have sought political, economic and diplomatic steps to get North Korea to denuclearize but failed miserably,\u201d Keane said. \u201cAll three tried to leverage China but also failed.\u201d\n\nKeane said that while former President Obama never fully removed the military option \u2013 a move Obama called \u201cstrategic patience\u201d \u2013 both China and North Korea believed he had done so.\n\nNORTH KOREA LIKELY BEHIND $81M HACK AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE, REPORT SAYS\n\nThe Trump administration has said that policy is not working and plan to put the military option back on the table, Keane said.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea ought to be at the top of the agenda in Mar-a-Lago,\u201d said John Bolton, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. \u201cHow much do you fear a nuclear weapon? That's the question. We have to look at preemptive military action. If China doesn't like that prospect maybe we can start bringing down the regime with other measures, like cutting off the supply of food and fuel to North Korea.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration is said to be considering a range of new sanctions against the North Korean regime. But, as in the past, such moves require help from Beijing. That help has not often been forthcoming.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has tried to get the Chinese to cut off oil and food to the North Koreans for 23 years, only to be told that Beijing does not believe in cut-offs of anything,\u201d said J.J. Tkacik of the International Strategy and Assessment Center. \u201cThe Chinese have acquiesced in several UN Security Council resolutions that involve some level of trade and economic sanctions, but there has never been any indication that they actually have implemented those sanctions.\u201d\n\nThere is broad agreement that what North Korea is doing is dangerous and unprecedented. In his first five years as North Korean leader, the Center for Strategic and International Studies points out that Kim Jong-Un has ordered more than twice the number of missile tests than his father, Kim Jong-Il, did during his 17-year rule.\n\n\u201cIt has invested heavily in the development of increasingly longer range ballistic missiles, and the miniaturization of its nascent nuclear weapons stockpile,\u201d according to a report by the non-partisan CSIS. \u201cNorth Korea is reliant on these capabilities to hold U.S., allied forces and civilian areas at risk.\u201d\n\nKeane said what is particularly dangerous is Kim Jong-Un\u2019s rhetoric that he intends to use these weapons against the United States.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not another world leader who says he intends to use nukes against the U.S.,\u201d Keane said. \u201cWe have to take this threat very seriously.\u201d\n\nIn his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump could try to get help from China. But experts say even if that does come up, China would likely not agree to it.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea has strategic value to China,\u201d said Shen Dingli, vice dean of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai, and a frequent commentator on U.S.-China relations. \u201cThe U.S. has to end its military threat to China, on the issue of Taiwan, before asking China to do it a favor by demanding something from North Korea.\u201d\n\nBut experts said Trump\u2019s candor and blunt approach is appreciated in China and could help him.\n\n\u201cBeing unpredictable and questioning conventional wisdom can be an effective strategy at times,\u201d said Paul Haenle, who served on the national security staffs of Presidents Bush and Obama. \u201cA healthy dose of unpredictability is useful in our strategy with China.\u201d\n\nStill, some experts said Trump has to be careful in how he deals with China and North Korea. Any provocation, they say, could backfire.\n\n\u201cIf the U.S. attacks without provocation, China is legally bound to defend North Korea,\u201d said Shen Dingli, vice dean of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai, and a frequent commentator on U.S.-China relations. \u201cDon\u2019t expect China to let North Korea collapse. China will join North Korea to a level that will prevent its collapse.\u201d\n\nKeane said President Trump is going to be diplomatic, but he isn\u2019t afraid to urge China to take sides.\n\n\u201c[Thursday], we\u2019re going to try the diplomatic option to reverse North Korea\u2019s nuclear program,\u201d Keane said. \u201cAs for the military option, we\u2019re moving there because Beijing, you\u2019ve painted us into a corner. Let\u2019s work together and denuclearize North Korea. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to do that.

Security Council, where a resolution condemning the use of chemical weapons by Syria was proposed.\n\nThe Trump administration has pointed its finger at Assad, but Russia has claimed that the chemicals were released when Syrian aircraft bombed a rebel-held factory making chemical weapons. At the emergency session, Haley ripped Russia for getting in the way of the United Nations holding Assad accountable after a prior attack in 2013 and accused Russia of defying \u201cthe conscience of the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cRussia stood in the way of this accountability, they made an unconscionable choice,\u201d she said, before calling on Russia, which opposed the resolution, to use its influence to effect peace in the region.\n\n\u201cHow many more children have to die before Russia cares?\u201d she asked.\n\nHaley then turned her criticism to the U.N. itself, saying it had proved ineffective in dealing with an \u201cillegitimate\u201d regime which she said \u201chas no interest in peace.\u201d\n\nShe went on to warn that if the United Nations fails to act collectively, \"there are times in the life of states that we are compelled to take our own action.\"\n\n\u201cWe regularly repeat tired taking points in support of a peace process that is regularly undermined by the Assad regime,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added, \u201cIf we\u2019re not able to enforce resolutions preventing use of chemical weapons, what does that say for our chance of ending the broader conflict in Syria?

Everyone would pay more -- for no useful reason.\n\nI say \"would\" because the Supreme Court put a \"stay\" on the regulation, saying there may be no authority for it.\n\nSo Trump proposes a sensible cut: He'll dump an Obama proposal that was already dumped by courts. He'd also reduce Environmental Protection Agency spending by 31 percent.\n\nGood!\n\nSome of what regulators do now resembles the work of sadists who like crushing people. In Idaho, Jack and Jill Barron tried to build a house on their own property. Jack got permission from his county. So they started building.\n\nThey got as far as the foundation when the EPA suddenly declared that the Barrons' property was a \"wetland.\"\n\nSome of their land was wet. But that was only because state government had not maintained its own land, adjacent to the Barrons' property, and water backed up from the state's land to the Barrons'.\n\nThe EPA suddenly said, \"You are building on a wetland!\" and filed criminal charges against them. Felonies. When government does that, most of us cringe and give up. It costs too much to fight the state. Government regulators seem to have unlimited time and nearly unlimited money.\n\nBut Jack was mad enough to fight. He spent $200,000 on his own lawyers.\n\nThree years later, a jury cleared Jack of all charges.\n\nBut even that didn't stop the EPA.\n\nJill Barron told me, \"We won, but after we were home for a month maybe, the Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA sent us another letter saying, 'how nice for you that you won in the criminal court, but we still feel it's a wetlands.' And the decision made by the jury did not matter to them. 'And if you don't get off the property, we're going to fine you (in) civil (court).'\"\n\nThe EPA threatened a fine of $37,500 a day.\n\nThe Barrons sold their home and moved into a trailer.\n\n\"We'll be bankrupt, obviously.\" Jill told me, \"You have no idea what you're up against. You don't know the power that is the EPA.\"\n\nSo I'm glad that Trump wants to limit the EPA. Scott Pruitt, the agency's new director, understands that bureaucrats often abuse their power. When he was Oklahoma attorney general, he sued the EPA 13 times for regulatory overreach.\n\nI hope he cuts the bureaucrats back to proper size.\n\nThe agency was necessary in 1970, when it was created. At the time, cities dumped whatever we flushed into nearby waterways -- with no treatment.\n\nSmokestacks filled the air with actual pollutants: soot, sulfur dioxide, etc. In New York City, we didn't dare leave windows open because filth would blow in.\n\nThe EPA required sewage treatment, scrubbers in smokestacks and catalytic converters in car exhaust systems. The regulations worked. America's air and water is cleaner than it's been for decades. I can even swim in the Hudson River, right next to millions of people -- who are still flushing.\n\nNow, in a rational world, the EPA would say, \"Stick a fork in it, it's done! EPA now stands for 'Enough Protection Already.'\" But bureaucracies never say they're done. \"Done\" means bureaucrats are out of work. Can't have that.\n\nSo politicians keep adding unnecessary new rules and keep harassing people like the Barrons.\n\nJohn Stossel is the author of \"No They Can't!

Air National Guard's 113th Wing safely ejected from the fourth-generation fighter made by Lockheed Martin Corp. \"and sustained non-life threatening injuries,\" according to an email from Tech. Sgt. Robert Cloys, a spokesman for Joint Base Andrews.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear what caused the accident, which apparently destroyed the roughly $20 million aircraft. At the time of the incident, the pilot was flying the plane alongside other aircraft in a routine training mission in the greater Washington area, according to the release.\n\nThe F-16 is a single-engine multirole fighter. As of Sept. 30, the Air Force had a total of 949 Fighting Falcons in the inventory, according to service inventory figures obtained by Military.com. That figure includes 334 of the aircraft in the Guard, with 289 single-seat F-16Cs and 45 two-seat F-16Ds.\n\nLast March, an F-16CM crashed in Afghanistan after experiencing a turbine malfunction in its engine. Months later, an Air Force Thunderbirds jet was returning to Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado, after the Air Force Academy graduation flyover -- attended by President Barack Obama -- when it crashed in a nearby field. Air Combat Command later disclosed an accidental throttle rotation led to a malfunction and subsequent engine stall in the F-16 contributed to its crash.\n\nService officials recently said they're considering retiring the F-15C/D Eagle as early as the mid-2020s. While the decision would mean divesting an entire aircraft class, officials said F-15 missions would be carried out by F-16s -- a potential cost-saving measure that would allow pilots to train on fewer platforms.\n\n-- Oriana Pawlyk can be reached at oriana.pawlyk@military.com.

North Korea launched a KN-15 missile in February -- as President Trump hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Florida.\n\nA senior administration official told Fox News the launch didn't represent much of a provocation on North Korea's part.\n\nIn a 23-word statement, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made it clear the administration was moving in a new direction: \"North Korea launched yet another intermediate range ballistic missile. The United States has spoken enough about North Korea. We have no further comment.\"\n\nTILLERSON'S TERSE WORDS SEEN AS TACTICAL CHANGE OVER NORTH KOREA\n\nU.S. officials have said they hope China will play a larger role in easing tensions in the region. While China opposes the deployment of a U.S. military anti-ballistic missile system to North Korea, China's foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying on Wednesday called for de-escalation of tensions. \"China has noticed such reports, we all know that the Security Council at the United Nations has issued regulations related to the missile launch by North Korea. We think that all sides involved should exercise restraint and not do anything that will escalate the difficult situation in the region.\"\n\nThe Pentagon continues to see signs North Korea is close to conducting another nuclear test, after two tests last year.\n\nThe KN-15, known as \"Pukguksong-2\" in North Korea, uses pre-loaded solid fuel, which shortens launch preparation times, boosts its mobility and makes it harder for outsiders to detect ahead of liftoff. Most North Korean missiles use liquid propellant, which generally must be added to the missile on the launch pad before firing.\n\nThe South Korean military said the missile was fired from land near the east coast city of Sinpo and flew about 40 miles.\n\nRalph Cossa, president of the Pacific Forum CSIS think tank in Honolulu, said he was expecting North Korea would do something significant to coincide with President Trump's first meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this week.\n\nThe missile launch may be a precursor, with more to come as the summit starts Thursday, Cossa said. \"I've joked before that they don't mind being hated but they definitely hate to be ignored.\"\n\nAnalysts also say North Korea might time nuclear and long-range rocket tests to the April 15 birthday of North Korea founder Kim Il Sung, the late grandfather of current leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nNorth Korea is pushing hard to upgrade its weapons systems to cope with what it calls U.S. hostility. Many weapons experts say the North could have a functioning nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the continental U.S. within a few years. North Korea carried out two nuclear tests last year.\n\nThe rogue nation's latest missile launch also came during annual military drills between the United States and South Korea.

With any luck, it will lead to an even more important reform: elimination of the Senate filibuster.\n\nThe Senate filibuster is the modern descendant of the Senate\u2019s one-time tradition of unlimited debate. Unlike in the far larger House of Representatives, where every speech is of limited duration, a senator who has the floor can keep it until overcome by exhaustion or an irresistible call of nature. (Once upon a time, even that was no obstacle: a senator could take a bucket onto the floor with him.)\n\nNowadays, however, it has essentially nothing to do with debate. Instead, a \u201cfilibuster\u201d is just a 41-vote Senate minority\u2019s mechanism for preventing a vote on an issue it wants to prevent the majority from deciding.\n\nThat\u2019s right: a minority can prevent the Senate from making a decision. For example, Senate Democrats could, under the current rules, prevent the Gorsuch nomination from ever coming to a vote.\n\nYes, technically, there are a couple of ways around this kind of impasse, but they would involve the Senate in months-long dilatory measures if the minority wanted them to. Because the Senate has voluminous pending business, the majority cannot afford to endure such stalling tactics.\n\nFrom a theoretical point of view, in the context of a republican government, this kind of situation is intolerable. Not only has the form swallowed the substance, with \u201cfilibusters\u201d bedeviling Senate majorities long since unlimited debate was actually the issue, but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., seems intent on using this faux filibuster in a context in which it has never been used before: a perfectly partisan attempt to prevent the Senate from voting on a Supreme Court nomination. This would be a minority veto, plain and simple.\n\nMinority veto is contrary to our republican tradition, in which each branch is governed by a majority.\n\nThe Constitution establishes numerous different types of majorities. Each of them controls its own institution. Thus, for example, the House of Representatives is composed of members elected from a number of districts assigned to their respective states according to a decennial census.\n\nThe Constitution contemplates that the House will elect its own speaker. Its authors did not envision political parties, but soon after the Constitution\u2019s implementation, speakers began to be chosen by the majority party in the House.\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan, like many speakers before him, chooses committee members from his party. His Democratic opposite number, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, assigns members of her caucus to each committee. The number of seats each party has on a given committee is in the control of the majority party too.\n\nThe Senate is structured much differently. The difference dates to the Framing of the Constitution.\n\n\n\nIn the Philadelphia Convention, men like Delaware\u2019s John Dickinson told delegates from populous states that the small states would reject any proposal that deprived the small states of equality in Congress. Each state had one vote in the Confederation Congress, and Dickinson and others said they would prefer a breakup of the Union to population apportionment. This is the basis of the two-senators-per-state apportionment of the Upper House.\n\nThat protection for small states, uniquely among the Constitution\u2019s provisions, cannot be taken away from a small state by amendment unless that state agrees. We may guess that none ever will. Still, the Constitution establishes majority control of the Senate.\n\nState equality in the Senate radiated through other portions of the Constitution. So, each state\u2019s representation in the Electoral College equals its number of representatives plus its numbers of senators. That means small states have greater shares of the Electoral College than they would have under a bare population apportionment rule.\n\nBecause Senate apportionment ignores population differences and the president is chosen by an Electoral College in which state equality plays a role, the Constitution\u2019s provision that all high-level appointed officials are chosen by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate means that the composition of the Senate has its role there, too.\n\nYet, although states are represented in the Senate as states rather than according to population, it is majorities thus configured that rule, just as majorities rule in the House and the Electoral College. The Constitution provides that the Senate can make its own rules. The Republican majority can get rid of the filibuster, an artifact of a former Senate age, by majority vote.\n\nAmericans commonly complain that their federal government is dysfunctional. The less attentive among us think that all congressmen are equally to blame for Congress\u2019s failure to adopt popular policies.\n\nAbolishing the filibuster would clear up confusion about responsibility for Congress\u2019s policy decisions. The duty to govern would fall upon the majority, as it should.\n\nKevin Gutzman is Professor and Chairman in the Department of History at Western Connecticut State University and author of \u201cThomas Jefferson--Revolutionary: A Radical's Struggle to Remake America.\u201d", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/04/05/should-be-cheering-likely-end-senate-filibuster-not-mourning-it.html"}, {"text": "President Trump on Wednesday is hosting Jordan's King Abdullah II, with the question of how world leaders will respond to the deadly chemical attack in Syria likely to surge to the top of the agenda.\n\nTrump has already condemned the attack, which reportedly killed dozens of civilians, calling it \"reprehensible\u201d and blaming Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\nThe president is also scheduled to speak Wednesday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel about the Syria issue and with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe about North Korea earlier in the day firing a newly developed powerful ballistic missile into its eastern waters.\n\nThe latest attack also has prompted calls from Capitol Hill for a strong response.

Every scandal needs a catchy nickname so we can avoid repeating drawn-out descriptions. One-word nicknames are best, especially for those who traffic in tabloids and television.\n\nAbsent a better choice, this one shall be known as SpyGate. Spy because there is mounting evidence the Obama administration spied on Team Trump. And Gate because ever since Watergate, big scandals and wannabe big scandals must be Gate. It\u2019s a rule.\n\nWe also need a memorable question or two that points toward the endgame. When Richard Nixon\u2019s fate hung in the balance, the case turned on these: What did the president know and when did he know it?\n\nIn SpyGate, the crucial question is this: How do we know that the Obama spying on Team Trump was incidental?\n\nWhat if it was intentional? What if spying was part of a plot to destroy Trump\u2019s candidacy and, when that failed, sabotage his presidency?\n\nWe don\u2019t have verifiable answers yet, despite being assured repeatedly that Trump and his associates merely were picked up in conversations with Russian and other foreign officials who were being spied on. Those doing the assuring said that since the Trumpsters were not the targets, it was incidental and thus no harm, no foul.\n\nBut there were lots of harms and fouls. For months, stories about possible collusion between Trump and Russia turned exclusively on leaks about members of Trump\u2019s inner circle being caught talking to Russians.\n\nGen. Mike Flynn was the first example, Attorney General Jeff Sessions was second and others include Jared Kushner. Those leaks, always from anonymous officials, serve to undermine the new president and encourage Democrats to obstruct the administration in the hope that impeachment is coming.\n\nBy my count, at least six people \u2014 including Trump himself \u2014 have been identified as having their communications intercepted by American law enforcement or intelligence. Always, it was \u201cincidental.\u201d\n\nWhich gets us to Susan Rice and the importance of her role in seeking the unmasking of those Trump officials. Weeks after she denied any knowledge of unmasking, Obama\u2019s national security adviser flip-flopped Tuesday and admitted she had \u201csometimes\u201d asked intelligence agencies to identify American citizens whose names had been withheld, as required, in initial \u00adreports.\n\n\u201cAnd sometimes, in that context, in order to understand the importance of the report and assess its significance, it was necessary to find out, or request the information as to find out who that US official was,\u201d she told MSNBC.\n\nCount that as one mystery solved. But Rice made two other denials. One, that she didn\u2019t leak any names to the media. And two, that the unmasking was never done for political purposes.\n\nHer track record doesn\u2019t help her credibility. Rice infamously went on five Sunday television shows in 2012 to assure the nation that the Benghazi attack that killed four Americans was in response to an Internet video.

Chris Collins, R-N.Y., was on fire after House Republicans snatched their health care bill off the floor late last month. Waylaid by the internal collapse, recriminations were under way.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one place the finger-pointing should go,\u201d thundered Collins, one of President Trump\u2019s first allies on Capitol Hill. \u201cThat\u2019s [toward] the Freedom Caucus.\u201d\n\nThe Freedom Caucus is the bloc of conservative House Republicans who many, including President Trump, pilloried for thwarting the health care bill. Collins is a member of the \u201cTuesday Group,\u201d the amalgam of moderate House Republicans. Many of those members also struggled to get to yes.\n\nSo what advice did Collins have if the sides try to jumpstart negotiations?\n\n\u201cNext time one of those calls come in, hang up,\u201d barked Collins. \u201cThe Tuesday Group will never meet with the Freedom Caucus. With a capital N-E-V-E-R.\u201d\n\nObamaCare remains intact while internecine GOP bloodletting is grisly.\n\n\u201cI believe health care has moved on and won\u2019t be dealt with again until 2019,\u201d predicted Collins.\n\nUntil it hadn\u2019t.\n\nOn Monday, Collins found himself among a group of moderate Republicans summoned to the White House for a session on trying to salvage the ObamaCare repeal and replace package\n\nSo much for soothsaying.\n\n\u201cI thought it was [dead],\u201d said Collins later. \u201cI also thought South Carolina would play North Carolina.\u201d\n\nYeah. Gonzaga.\n\nCollins seemed invigorated.\n\n\u201cWe are all happy the discussions are open again. I think it was a wake-up calls for some who voted no and went home and they maybe did not get a ticker tape parade,\u201d said Collins.\n\nRep. Rodney Davis, R-Ill., also backed the package and was among those called to the White House Monday. Still, Davis wondered if the party could seal its own fissures. Davis called out the Freedom Caucus.\n\n\u201cWhat do they need?\u201d asked Davis.\n\nBy nightfall Monday, Vice President Pence journeyed to the Capitol to meet with the Freedom Caucus.\n\n\u201cWe continue to work earnestly with Congress for a new future on health care reform,\u201d said Pence Tuesday. \u201cThe president and I remain confident we will repeal and replace ObamaCare.\u201d\n\nPence, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney descended on the Capitol around 8:30 p.m. Tuesday for another conclave with key Republicans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just talking. Any time we\u2019re talking is good,\u201d said Price.\n\nAnd they talked. For more than two hours. But most lawmakers left the confab uttering bromides.\n\n\u201cGood talk,\u201d said House Budget Committee Chairwoman Diane Black, R-Tenn. \u201cMaking progress.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat meeting and great conversations,\u201d said Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn.\n\n\u201cGood conversation. Making progress,\u201d said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas.\n\nBut while some lawmakers are upbeat, it\u2019s unclear if they\u2019re truly getting anywhere. Sources tell Fox News the consultations may pick up some Republicans but lose others.\n\n\u201cThere were no agreements tonight and no agreements in principle, and, certainly no agreements in terms of a foundation,\u201d said House Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C. \u201cThere was a general agreement that the progress we\u2019re making is certainly progress.\u201d\n\nMeadows expressed mild disappointment that the administration and committee chairs didn\u2019t present updated legislative text.\n\nHouse Republicans fear jetting out of Washington for the Easter/Passover break without a new health care bill. Time is short to retrench the bill, walk lawmakers through the legislation and whip it for a vote count.\n\n\u201cI think to suggest that we can\u2019t get it done by the end of the week would be premature,\u201d said Meadows. \u201cThere\u2019s concern on my part that if we are making real progress that going home sends a wrong message.\u201d\n\nOne source familiar with the talks speculated that there was only a \u201c30 percent\u201d chance the House could act this week even if the sides forged a pact.\n\n\u201cNothing has happened which would change the votes,\u201d said one senior House leadership aide.\n\nAnother senior House Republican source was emphatic that the House wouldn\u2019t remain in session over the weekend and would cut short the recess \u201conly if we have a deal.\u201d Some lawmakers are concerned the sides are exhausting too much effort extricating the health care bill from doom and not focusing on how to avoid a government shutdown at the end of the month.\n\n\u201cThis is all about saving face,\u201d said one House Republican source. \u201cThe speaker. The president. The committee chairs. The Freedom Caucus.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether saving face justified the exercise, the source replied, \u201cYes. Anything that gets us to yes, at this point.\u201d\n\nRepublicans long criticized Democrats for what they perceived were efforts to \u201cmuscle through\u201d ObamaCare. Republicans piously touted their own process to advance their own health care measure. Now? Well, it\u2019s messy.\n\nAlso, an important operational issue lingers. The health care measure is tucked into what\u2019s called a special \u201cbudget reconciliation package,\u201d structured in a way to avoid a Senate filibuster. The House must soon pass a budget for the next spending round. But congressional rules bar the House and Senate from having two \u201clive\u201d budget packages at once. So, the House and Senate could be forced to delay passing a budget for fiscal 2018 if they haven\u2019t disposed of the budget reconciliation vehicle crafted for health care.\n\nOf course, that presumes the House can approve a budget this year. Republicans browbeat Senate Democrats for not adopting budgets. But House Republicans failed to okay a budget last year.\n\nDo lawmakers believe negotiations can lug the legislation across the finish line?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s real or not,\u201d said one senior Republican source of the recent machinations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of noise. Busywork,\u201d declared another skeptical Republican.\n\nSome Republicans are leery of the fire drill approach. But they concede, people talking.\n\n\u201cAs soon as people quit talking, then you know there is trouble,\u201d said a source familiar with the conversation.\n\nCapitol Attitude is a weekly column written by members of the Fox News Capitol Hill team.

Mike Malandra, the lab's ground branch head for science and technology.\n\n\"It's not a tracked vehicle so it can turn around on a dime. The other benefit of something like that is it can get up when it falls over, whereas MAARS can't,\" Malandra said. \"So that's really what we're looking at doing, potentially, with those kinds of things moving forward here in fall: Use it as a surrogate platform for something that is maneuverable in a way similar to a human.\"\n\nThe Corps has had a long flirtation with the idea of incorporating four-legged robots into infantry operations.\n\nA $32 million Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency program was launched in collaboration with the Marine Corps in 2010 to test the potential of the Legged Squad Support System, a hulking robotic pack animal known more affectionately as the robo-mule. Made by Google Inc.'s Boston Dynamics, the LS3 was trotted out in front of then-commandant Gen. Jim Amos in 2012 and featured prominently alongside Marines in the massive Rim of the Pacific exercise in 2014.\n\nBut as Military.com reported in late 2015, the experimental program ultimately came to an end without a commitment from the Corps to develop the concept further. Among issues cited: the robot's noisy diesel engine, which would be a liability on patrols, and the logistical challenge of fixing the system if it broke.\n\nSpot, a much smaller battery-powered robot also made by Boston Dynamics, was bequeathed to the service after the experiment ended and has sat in the kennel ever since, Malandra said.\n\n\"It's been pretty dormant,\" he said. \"It's been a showpiece, really.\"\n\nBut the recently released Marine Corps Operating Concept, which highlights the significance of Marine-robot teaming in future conflicts, may create new opportunities for Spot to show off his tricks. Two of the little robots were delivered to the service Monday after spending months at Boston Dynamics getting strategic upgrades.\n\nNow, the system features a radio and a 180-degree camera in the nose, as well as Teleop-assist logic, which will keep Spot from crashing into physical obstacles, even if the human operator directs it to do so.\n\nMalandra said developmental testing this fall will set the stage for a limited technical assessment in 2018. The ultimate goal, he said, is to develop requirements for an unmanned partner that can assist a Marine in the field, whether with patrolling, reconnaissance or other ground warfare capabilities.\n\n\"We're looking to put them in environments and lanes that are similar to things we've come up with through wargaming and through other things, that fit our operational concept that was just published for 2025,\" Malandra said.\n\n\"To be able to put them in lanes where we can evaluate metrics such as lethality and tempo, which are very fluid, and what they actually mean,\" he said. \"So how do we quantify that, how do we create a baseline ... to evaluate whether or not a system that can provide autonomous tasking is beneficial or not.\"\n\n-- Hope Hodge Seck can be reached at hope.seck@military.com.

She needed to know the names of the Americans picked up on the intercepts, but it\u2019s \u201cabsolutely false\u201d to say this was done \u201cfor political purposes.\u201d\n\nSo she\u2019s now gone from professed ignorance to nothing improper.\n\nIn fairness to Rice, it may turn out that what she did was perfectly legal. But there are now a whole host of troubling questions.\n\nDid she seek the identities of Trump folks solely for intelligence reasons, or did she have political motivations?\n\nWho did she share the information with?\n\nDid she leak any of the findings, or cause them to be leaked? Rice denied leaking anything to do with her successor, Michael Flynn, whose false denials about contacts with the Russian ambassador led President Trump to fire him. \u201cI leaked nothing to nobody and never have and never would,\u201d she said.\n\nThis brings us to the role of the media.\n\nSince the allegations were minimized yesterday by the Washington Post and New York Times (with the Times depicting them as something bouncing around conservative media), some critics on the right say they are covering for Rice. ABC and NBC didn't cover them on Monday's evening newscasts, while the \"CBS Evening News\" quoted a former official as saying Rice did \"nothing improper or political.\"\n\nI\u2019d suggest the situation is complicated. It looks to me that many news outlets were unable to confirm the allegations, which raises the dilemma of whether you publish something based on other outlets citing unnamed sources when your own reporters can\u2019t verify it.\n\nOf course, some of these same outlets have run with stories, also involving anonymous sources, about alleged collusion between Trump associates and Russia.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say they are more enthusiastic about that story.\n\nBut there\u2019s a difference between not confirming publishing allegations and denigrating them, which is what some at CNN have been doing.\n\nAnchor Don Lemon told viewers \u201cwe will not insult your intelligence\u201d by suggesting the Trump team was spied on illegally, \u201cnor will we aid and abet the people who are trying to misinform you, the American people, by creating a diversion.\u201d\n\nHow does Lemon know it\u2019s a diversion? Shouldn\u2019t he want to know all the facts? It\u2019s true that the latest story does not confirm Trump\u2019s original charge that the previous administration targeted him for wiretapping, but that doesn\u2019t mean other surveillance was properly handled.\n\nCNN\u2019s national security correspondent, Jim Sciutto, was equally condescending, saying the Bloomberg scoop on Rice was \u201clargely ginned up, partly as a distraction from this larger investigation.\u201d\n\nNot only is Sciutto dismissing legitimate questions, he worked for the Obama State Department as a diplomat from 2011 to 2013. I think the better course would have been to recuse himself.\n\nRight now the media are on two different planets: Those more interested in proving a Russia/Trump conspiracy and those more interested in proving an Obama surveillance conspiracy. Hard facts are hard to come by, but it would be nice if the same standards were applied to both parts of this bizarre story.\n\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

A whopping 87 percent of American Catholics view him favorably; in contrast, Donald Trump\u2019s job approval hovers just over 40 percent.\n\nYet the pope has had trouble translating that sky-high approval rating into results. Not much happened after the pope asked parishes to welcome refugees. Nor were his inauguration of a homeless shelter and medical clinic in the Vatican precincts matched by a surge of similar initiatives elsewhere.\n\nEnter President Trump. As soon as his administration announced its new immigration laws, Catholic Church entities responded. Chicago\u2019s Catholic schools barred their doors to immigration agents who cannot produce warrants, and churches in various cities opened their doors as sanctuaries.\n\nNext up was the Trump-endorsed health care proposal. I\u2019m privileged to chair the board of one of America\u2019s largest Catholic hospital systems, and we\u2019re now even more committed than ever to keeping our doors open to the poor, elderly, and disabled whose health care access is suddenly threatened.

Even bishops who had voiced serious reservations about certain ObamaCare provisions have argued against a repeal that leaves the vulnerable without meaningful access.\n\nAs I point out in my book \"Everyone Leads,\" the Catholic Church faces a plethora of challenges: declining clergy numbers, the lingering fallout from sex abuse scandals, fading interest among young adults in organized religion, and so on. And when faced with grave challenges, organizations need to pull themselves together around strategies for concerted action. Unfortunately, that unity has too often eluded Catholics; we\u2019ve been mired in intramural squabbles over everything from prayer translations at Mass to communion for divorced and remarried Catholics.\n\nPope Francis hasn\u2019t completely unified us around his vision of a church that stands up for poor, marginalized, and excluded communities; it's President Trump who just may have provided the catalytic spark.\n\nGranted, it will be small consolation, indeed no consolation whatsoever, if at the end of all this, we Catholics are better united but our brothers and sisters in need still bear the brunt of unjust initiatives.\n\nBut I hope for something different: that we Catholics, of all ideological stripes, in concert with those of all other religious traditions, will continue to act together to ensure the \u201cdignified work, education, and healthcare\u201d that the Pope called for.\n\nIn order to pull that off, I think we\u2019ll have to heed another call of Francis, who voiced preference for a church that is, \u201cbruised, hurting and dirty because it has been out on the streets.\u201d\n\nNow is the time for Catholics to unite not only on Sunday morning in church, but on every day and in every place where the vulnerable are threatened.\n\nChris Lowney is author of Everyone Leads: How to Revitalize the Catholic Church.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/04/05/why-pope-francis-should-thank-president-trump.html"}, {"text": "After more than 15 hours on the Senate floor, Oregon Democratic Sen.

But meeting participants said differences remained over giving states flexibility to drop those mandates. Meetings were set to continue Wednesday.\n\n\"Good talk. Making progress,\" House Budget Committee chair Diane Black, R-Tenn., told reporters as the meeting broke up.\n\n\"It was a very good exchange of ideas, with concerns that represent the very broad spectrum of our conference,\" said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., who leads the conservative House Freedom Caucus. The group's roughly three dozen members have largely opposed the GOP legislation for not repealing enough of Obama's law.\n\n\n\nAt the White House, Pence said he and President Donald Trump \"remain confident that working with the Congress we will repeal and replace Obamacare.\"\n\n\n\nBut there was no evidence that the proposal won over any GOP opponents who'd forced Trump and party leaders to beat an unceremonious retreat on their bill on March 24, when they canceled a House vote that was doomed to failure.\n\n\n\n\"We want to make sure that when we go, we have the votes to pass this bill,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters. He said talks were in \"the conceptual stage\" and declined to predict a vote before Congress leaves town shortly for a two-week recess -- when lawmakers could face antagonistic grilling from voters at town hall meetings.\n\n\n\nLater in the day, Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., his party's chief vote counter, said talks were not at \"a place where there is consensus\" on health care and indicated a vote this week was unlikely.\n\n\n\nUnder the White House proposal, states could apply for a federal waiver from a provision in Obama's statute obliging insurers to cover \"essential health benefits,\" including mental health, maternity and substance abuse services. The current version of the GOP legislation would erase that coverage requirement but let states reimpose it themselves, language that is opposed by many moderates.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the White House would let states seek an exemption to the law's provision banning insurers from charging higher premiums for seriously ill people. Conservatives have argued that such restrictions inflate consumers' costs.\n\n\n\nReaction from rank-and-file GOP lawmakers was mixed. Moderate Rep. Frank LoBiondo, R-N.J., and conservative Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., each said they remained \"no\" votes, with Brooks saying states should be allowed to opt out of Obama's insurance requirements without seeking federal permission.\n\n\n\nRep. Jim Renacci, R-Ohio, was among several moderates warning that a quick vote would be counter-productive.\n\n\n\n\"If leadership hasn't learned the lessons of the failures of two weeks ago, then they'll bring something forward where nobody knows about it and try and get it passed,\" Renacci said.\n\n\n\nEven so, some members of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus were showing signs of accepting less than many originally wanted. Meadows said talks were boiling down to curbing several of Obama's coverage requirements -- a far cry from the full repeal of the statute that many initially preferred.\n\n\n\n\"It perhaps is as much of a repeal as we can get done,\" Meadows told reporters. He added, \"That's the calculation we have to make.\"\n\n\n\nSimilarly, some moderates whose opposition was also instrumental in the legislation's failure expressed cautious optimism that the White House offer would produce results.\n\n\n\n\"We have to do things that will win people from both sides of the spectrum.

But people split evenly between wanting to keep or repeal Obama's statute.\n\n\n\nThe underlying House Republican bill would repeal much of Obama's 2010 law. It would erase its tax fines for consumers who don't buy policies, federal aid to help many afford coverage and Medicaid expansion for additional poor people.\n\n\n\nInstead, substitute GOP tax subsidies would be less generous than Obama's for many lower earners and people in their 50s and 60s, the overall Medicaid program would be cut, tax boosts on higher earners would be ended and consumers who let coverage lapse would face 30 percent premium hikes.\n\n\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram and Jason Donner contributed to this report.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/05/house-gop-gives-attempt-to-revive-obamacare-repeal-mixed-reviews.html"}, {"text": "A Fox reporter investigating the \"unmasking\" of Trump transition officials by former national security adviser Susan Rice told \"The O'Reilly Factor\" Tuesday that they were examining whether Rice was told to request records about the president's associates.\n\nFoxNews.com investigative reporter Malia Zimmerman told host Bill O'Reilly that she and Adam Housely were investigating whether \"somebody from the [National Security Agency], for example, would have told [Rice] to ask for those reports, to ask for those names to be unmasked.\n\n\"That is what we\u2019ve heard from some of our sources and so we\u2019re looking into that angle as a possibility,\" she said.\n\nZimmerman and Housely reported Monday that the names were part of incidental electronic surveillance of candidate and President-elect Trump and people close to him, including family members, for up to a year before he took office.\n\n\"It\u2019s just so vast, because we don\u2019t know so many things,\" Zimmerman told O'Reilly. \"We don\u2019t know why they were surveilled \u2013 why they came up in the surveillance as incidental communications ...

Both pilots ejected safely and were not seriously injured.\n\nLast month, there were 10 episodes in T-45s, according to Shoemaker.\n\nAnticipating the pilot protest, the Navy sent a team of engineers and other specialists this week to its T-45 training bases in Kingsville, Meridian and Pensacola for talks with the pilots.\n\nA meeting Tuesday in Meridian \u201cgot heated,\u201d Fox News is told. The pilots told the civilians from Navy Air Systems Command their complaints about the oxygen system were being ignored.

Jeannie Groeneveld acknowledged that 40 percent of instructor pilots refused to fly their training flights Friday. A flight instructor said the number was closer to 75 percent, because the Navy reduced the flight schedule knowing more than half the pilots would refuse to fly.\n\nShoemaker said following a meeting in Kingsville, flights there had resumed.\n\nJust last week, the vice president\u2019s wife Karen Pence visited her son at Naval Air Station Meridian, where her son is in flight training. A source told Fox News she told the commodore in charge of flight training, \u201cTake care of my son\u201d \u2013 and a day later the senior Navy officer told a group of instructor pilots he feared he was unable to do that because of the danger posed by the faulty oxygen system.\n\nAcross the Navy, training squadron skippers and commodores are telling their instructors to follow their instincts -- and not forcing them to fly -- much to the appreciation of those boycotting until they feel the issue is resolved, Fox News is told.\n\n\u201cThere is not a, you know, \u2018Fly or else,\u2019\u201d Shoemaker said.\n\nSome instructor pilots point to Rear Adm. Dell D.

After each flight, the tubes were sent to a lab in Maryland for analysis. After 1,500 flights worth of air samples, the results remain inconclusive.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t come up with anything conclusive \u2026 showing a contaminant or something like that,\u201d a senior official said.\n\nThe instructor pilots see it differently.\n\n\u201cThey sent our squadron six tubes,\u201d one pilot said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the frustration.

It suggests most young Americans won't be content with a law offering \"access\" to coverage, as Trump and Republicans in Congress proposed in doomed legislation they dropped March 24. The Trump administration is talking this week of somehow reviving the legislation.\n\nConducted Feb. 16 through March 6, before the collapse of the GOP bill, the poll shows that 63 percent of young Americans approve of the Obama-era health care law. It did not measure reactions to the Republican proposal.\n\nThe most popular element of the law is allowing young adults to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26, which is favored by 75 percent of 18-30 year olds. It's not just that they personally benefit \u2014 an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in January found that provision was equally popular among all adults. That proposal was included in the failed GOP overhaul.\n\nBut the Republican plan also contained provisions that most young Americans \u2014 the racially diverse electorate of the future \u2014 do not support, according to the poll. Two-thirds of young people agree with a smaller majority of Americans overall that the government should make sure people have health care coverage. And they understand that will cost more: Sixty-three percent want the government to increase spending to help people afford insurance.\n\nThose feelings cut across racial lines and include most whites, who formed the base of Trump's political support in the presidential election.\n\n\"I do believe the government should offer it because we pay taxes,\" said Rachel Haney, 27, of Tempe, Arizona. \"I do feel like it's a right.\"\n\nGenForward is a survey of adults age 18 to 30 by the Black Youth Project at the University of Chicago with the AP-NORC Center. The poll pays special attention to the voices of young adults of color, highlighting how race and ethnicity shape the opinions of a new generation.\n\nOnly about a quarter of young people want \"Obamacare\" repealed. That includes 16 percent of young adults who want it repealed and replaced as Trump has vowed and another 10 percent who want it repealed without a replacement.\n\nJust over a third of young whites want to see the law repealed, making them more likely than those of other racial and ethnic groups to say so.\n\n\"He just wants to protect us from al-Qaida, and terrorism,\" said Kervin Dorsainvil, 18, a computer technician from Port Charlotte, Florida. \"I feel like health care should be much higher on the list. I feel like we have the resources, the medical technology and everything in place to provide the health care to the people. So why wouldn't we do that?\"\n\nYoung people are more likely than Americans overall to say the government should make sure people have health care. A recent AP-NORC poll of U.S. adults, conducted during and after the collapse of the GOP proposal, found just 52 percent called it a federal government responsibility to make sure all Americans have coverage.\n\nDespite their overall approval of \"Obamacare,\" young Americans' views on the law aren't all rosy. Just a third say the law is working relatively well, while another third think the health care policy has serious problems. About 2 in 10 consider the law to be fatally flawed.\n\nThe law's requirement that all Americans buy insurance or pay a fine is opposed by 54 percent of young people and favored by just 28 percent.\n\nOn the other hand, 71 percent favor the law's Medicaid expansion, 66 percent of young adults favor the prohibition on denying people coverage because of a person's medical history, 65 percent favor requiring insurance plans to cover the full cost of birth control, 63 percent favor requiring most employers to pay a fine if they don't offer insurance and 53 percent favor paying for benefit increases with higher payroll taxes for higher earners.\n\nAbout a quarter of young adults say they personally have insurance through their parents, while another 1 in 10 have purchased insurance through an exchange.\n\n___\n\nThe poll of 1,833 adults age 18-30 was conducted using a sample drawn from the probability-based GenForward panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. young adult population.

Dick Durbin, the Senate\u2019s No. 2 Democrat, took to the Senate floor earlier in the day to again rail against Republicans for not allowing confirmation hearings last year for Merrick Garland, then-President Barack Obama\u2019s high court pick.\n\n\u201cMerrick Garland -- the only presidential nomination to the Supreme Court, in the history of the United States Senate, to be denied a hearing and a vote,\u201d Durbin said.\n\nAfter four days of Senate confirmation hearings and dozens of one-on-ones between Gorsuch and senators, the partisan divide is clear.\n\nRepublicans argue that Gorsuch, a conservative on the federal appeals court in Denver, would render his high court decisions based on the law as it exists, not how\u2019d he like it to be, and that his lower court decisions are clearly in line with the mainstream.\n\nBeyond the Garland issue, Democrats argue that Gorsuch is a sendup from conservative groups and their \u201cdark money,\u201d and that his legal record shows he would side with corporations and special interest groups over the \u201clittle man.\u201d\n\nTexas Sen. John Cornyn, the chamber\u2019s No. 2 Republican, argued Tuesday that Democrats continue to use \u201cthe same, old tired arguments\u201d against Gorsuch, including many that have nothing to do with him, and that their opposition results from them \u201cnot getting over the fact they lost the lost the [2016 presidential] election.\u201d\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, took perhaps the most extreme view Tuesday of what Gorsuch might do on the court.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a strong possibility he\u2019d overturn Roe v. Wade,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd I do not want to be a party to what happens.\u201d\n\nAfter hours of debate Monday, the Judiciary Committee voted 11-9, along party lines, to send Gorsuch's nomination to the full Senate.\n\nIf confirmed, Gorsuch, who has spent more than a decade on the Denver federal appeals bench, would take the seat of Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016, and maintain conservatives\u2019 5-4 majority in the high court.\n\nThe long-term consequences of the bipartisan confrontation could be profound, as the procedural change Republicans intend to enact would also apply to future Supreme Court nominees, allowing them to be voted onto the court without any input from the minority party.\n\nThe showdown over the \"nuclear option,\" expected on the Senate floor Thursday, is likely to be accompanied by much hand-wringing from senators bemoaning the decay of the chamber's traditions of bipartisanship and comity.\n\nBut both parties are to blame. When the Democrats were in the majority, they removed the 60-vote threshold for nominees to federal benches lower in the judicial system than the Supreme Court.\n\nThis change came in 2013 as Republicans, who were in the minority at the time, were blocking Obama picks for critical court vacancies. Republicans said at the time that Democrats would come to regret the move.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/04/final-senate-debate-on-gorsuch-begins-with-no-sign-averting-nuclear-option.html"}, {"text": "Tuesday was the deadline for companies to propose designs for President Donald Trump's border wall with Mexico.

Late in January, the White House declared Trump would enforce an Obama administration order barring companies that do federal work from workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual identity. But in February, it revoked guidance on transgender students' use of public school bathrooms, deferring to states.\n\nThe case stems from a lawsuit by Indiana teacher Kimberly Hively alleging that the Ivy Tech Community College in South Bend didn't hire her full time because she is a lesbian.\n\nHively said she agreed to bring the case because she felt she was being \"bullied.\"\n\nShe told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that the time has come \"to stop punishing people for being gay, being lesbian, being transgender.\"\n\nThe Chicago ruling followed a so-called en banc hearing of all the judges in the appeals court, with eight agreeing that the civil rights law prohibits discrimination because of sexual orientation, and three dissenting. The vote is notable because the 7th Circuit is considered a relatively conservative appeals court. Eight out of the 11 judges were appointed by Republican presidents.\n\n\"This decision is game changer for lesbian and gay employees facing discrimination in the workplace and sends a clear message to employers: it is against the law to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation,\" said Greg Nevins, Employment Fairness Program Director for Lambda Legal, which brought the case on behalf of Hively.\n\nThe issue could still land before the Supreme Court at some point. A GOP-majority House and Senate make it unlikely the Congress will amend the Civil Rights Act, which outlaws discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin and requires equal access to public places and employment.\n\nThe debate in the Hively case revolved around the meaning of the word 'sex' in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Some courts have concluded that Congress meant for the word to refer only to whether a worker was male or female. They said that it would be wrong to stretch the meaning of 'sex' in the statute to also include sexual orientation.\n\nThe lawyer representing the teacher, Gregory Nevins of the Lambda Legal advocacy group of LGBT rights, pointed to what he described as the absurdity of a 1980s Supreme Court finding that if workers are discriminated against because they don't behave around the office by norms of how men or women should behave, then that does violate the Civil Rights Law. But if a man or woman is discriminated against at work for being gay that was found not to violate the Civil Rights Act.\n\n\"You can't discriminate against a woman because she rides a Harley, had Bears tickets or has tattoos,\" he said. \"But you can if she's lesbian.\"", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/04/civil-rights-law-prohibits-discrimination-lgbt-court-says.html"}, {"text": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has told Fox News' \"The First 100 Days\" Tuesday that the GOP's use of the so-called \"nuclear option\" to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch is their response to the Democrats' \"breaking the rules of the Senate\" in 2013.\n\n\"For 230 years, up or down, simple majority [required] for Supreme Court, Cabinet, everything until [Senate Minority Leader Chuck] Schumer invented this, so it\u2019s a fairly recent thing to filibuster executive branch appointments,\" McConnell told host Dana Perino. \"All we\u2019ll do faced with this filibuster is even that up so the Supreme Court confirmation process is dealt with just like it was throughout the history of the country.\"\n\nMcConnell also told Perino that that Senate was \"going to confirm Judge Gorsuch on Friday.

But without tankers, those aircraft are short on flight time. And without airlift support, the pilots, crew and maintenance units needed to keep them flying stay stateside.\n\nThat connection is what Air Mobility Commander Gen. Carlton D. Everhart II wants lawmakers to remember. And it's why the service is working to upgrade its C-5 Galaxy fleet and keep its C-17 Globemaster III aircraft in key condition.\n\n\"Just a few years ago, we had 112 C-5s. Today, we have 56,\" Everhart told congressional staffers during a demonstration day here March 31. The presentation included a tour a C-5, plus two C-17s and a C-130 Hercules.\n\nSequestration resulted \"in moving eight C-5s into backup aircraft inventory \u2026 which means we still have the aircraft but lost all manning and funding to operate them,\" he said.\n\nNow Everhart wants them back, and he's making it his top priority.\n\n\"I need them back because there's real world things that we've got to move, and they give me that \u2026 added assurance capability,\" he said.\n\n\"Those eight C-5Ms? I was going to buy them back within a two-year period,\" Everhart said. With budget caps in place and without an appropriations bill, \"that's been delayed twice \u2026 in two budget cycles.\"\n\nAMC hopes to make up for lost time in part by upgrading the largest airlifter in the Air Force's inventory. The C-5, made by Lockheed Martin Corp., is undergoing a modernization program that includes upgrading the avionics \"to improve communications, navigation and surveillance/air traffic management compliance as well as adding new safety equipment and installing a new autopilot system,\" according to a release.\n\nThe modernization also involves \"modifying C-5A/B/Cs into the C-5M Super Galaxy by upgrading to the F-138 commercial engine,\" the release said. The engine delivers more than a 20-percent \"increase in thrust, a 30-percent shorter takeoff roll, a 58-percent faster climb rate and will allow significantly more cargo to be carried over longer distances.\"\n\nThe Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program program, which began in 2008, is scheduled to be completed in 2018, officials said Friday. That means 52 C-5s -- one \"A\" variant, 49 \"B\" variants, and two \"C\" variants -- are scheduled to receive the RERP modification.\n\nEverhart said that a C-5M recently aircraft flew from Travis Air Force Base, California, to Yokota, Japan, a major feat for the 247-foot-long airlifter, which can take off at a max weight of 840,000 pounds. Normally, it would stop in Hawaii. But it kept going.\n\n\"It's the only airlifter in the inventory that can make the flight non-stop, which means we can put the American flag on the ground in hours versus days,\" Everhart said.\n\nAn average C-5 flight is roughly eight to 10 hours, said Capt. Robert Drye. A third of the fleet is cycling through maintenance at any given time, the pilot said.\n\nRe-engining the C-5M gets crews \"so much farther, faster,\" he added.\n\nThe Air Force is rotating its C-17 fleet between the active duty, Reserve and Guard to stretch its lifespan -- or enterprise fleet management, as AMC calls it, said Capt. Theresa Izell, a maintenance officer.\n\n\"This isn't really revolutionary,\" Izell said of sharing resources throughout the total force. But it's a band-aid solution for the near term.\n\n\"Our strategic planners and programmers are not predicting that we're bringing on a new airlifter in the future fast enough to outpace the retirements of our C-17s,\" she said.\n\nOther upgrades continue.\n\nSome C-17s are undergoing modification and are slated for future upgrades that include replacing the Head Up Display, or HUD, a transparent data display in front of the pilot that provides situational awareness; inputting Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out for aircraft location and tracking; Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) for command and control; and Secure Line of Sight/Beyond Line of Sight (LOS/BLOS) Voice and Data Communications, Maj. Korry Leverett told Military.com on Tuesday.\n\nBefore budget caps, the Air Force had high hopes of a next-generation airlift capability. But after major drawdowns -- plus an ongoing continuing resolution from Congress instead of an appropriations bill -- the service isn't hopeful for immediate airlift support.\n\nIn 2012, it retired its first C-17 \"T-1\" test aircraft. The C-17 is set to reach the end of its service in the early 2030s, officials have said. The Air Force has 213 Globemasters, made by Boeing Co., according to its inventory.\n\nBy rotating the Globemasters among the three components, Air Mobility Command believes \"we'll gain 10 to 20 years for service life on the C-17,\" Izell said.\n\nThrough enterprise fleet management, \"we're going to shrink that, and no longer have that airlift gap,\" she said.\n\nThe command's second priority, Everhart said, is to move toward a synchronous system.\n\n\"We've got to get fleets standardized,\" he said. \"We kind of joke about it, but we call [the C-130 Hercules] the Frankenherc,\" alluding to the use of different parts to construct Frankenstein's monster. But in the case of the Hercules, \"I have H models, I have J models\" plus different variations of the H models.\n\n\"I've got to do the same thing with the C-17, because I have Block 17s, Block 18s, Block 19 [versions], and we keep modernizing -- but we need to standardize,\" he said.\n\nHow that happens will be determined by the budget, and how industry partners can aid in creating a modular system, he said, adding that standardization would enable the command to better determine deployment schedules and crews it would send based on platform.\n\nEverhart added, \"Right now, the Army is considering systems that will not fit on the C-130H or J,\" but would on the larger airlift platforms. \"We need to consider that fact when deciding to buy more of what we have, versus developing the next airlifter to maximize effectiveness with our joint partners.\"\n\nAll these efforts are the \"positive steps we need to take to restore lost capacity to enable agile response for the joint team,\" he said.\n\n-- Oriana Pawlyk can be reached at oriana.pawlyk@military.com.

The Associated Press obtained a copy of his testimony.\n\n\n\nThough the Trump administration has not yet changed how the border is patrolled, the president's tough talk on immigration -- including plans to build a border wall -- and his stepped-up arrests of immigrants living in the country illegally have likely acted as deterrents.\n\n\n\nIt's unclear if the declines will continue. The number of people caught trying to enter the United States typically increases as the weather warms. Arrests during the normally slower winter months were higher than in past years. It is possible that some migrants rushed to the border after the election and before Trump took office.\n\n\n\nIt's also unclear if migrants are waiting south of the border to see how Trump's border security efforts and plans for a wall develop.\n\n\n\nIn his testimony for the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Kelly said fewer than 12,500 people were caught crossing the border illegally last month. That compares with more than 43,000 in December.\n\n\n\nKelly told lawmakers that the number of families and children traveling alone -- groups that accounted for hundreds of thousands of illegal border crossers in recent years -- also declined steeply. Last month fewer than 1,000 children were caught at the border and fewer than 1,100 people traveling as families were found. In recent years most of the families and children traveling alone have been from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.\n\n\n\nKelly has said his agency is considering separating parents and children as a way to dissuade parents from making the trek from Central America.\n\n\n\nNews of the dramatic decrease in arrests comes on the same day that proposals for Trump's border wall were due to the government.

Bush. \"Unless you know the answer to that question, you can't appreciate the meaning and importance of the intelligence.\"\n\nWHO CAN UNMASK AN AMERICANS NAME?\n\nThe answer varies by U.S. intelligence agency.

Rice confirmed that she requested the demasking of Americans while she was National Security Adviser. While Rice would not deny that she asked that names of Trump officials be demasked, she insisted the Obama administration did not spy on Mr. Trump or his staff for political purposes. She also offered some questionable explanations for the demasking process.\n\nAs a former CIA analyst who has handled requests for demasking the names of American citizens for a U.S. policymaker, I thought Rice\u2019s claims in her interview did not add up.\n\nThe names of U.S. citizens \u201cincidentally\u201d mentioned in NSA reports are masked to preserve their identities because America\u2019s intelligence agencies are barred from spying on American citizens except in extraordinary circumstances with court approval.\n\nRice correctly said in her interview that policymakers sometimes request to know the identities of Americans from NSA reports to understand these reports in certain circumstances. She also tried to dismiss this controversy by claiming NSA demasking requests are routine.\n\nThey actually are not routine and taken very seriously by NSA.\n\nRice also said there is an Intelligence Community process to review whether to approve demasking requests. This seemed to be an attempt by Rice to make her requests look legitimate because NSA carefully reviewed them.\n\nIn fact, this review is pro forma. If a senior official gives what appears to be a national security reason, demasking requests are almost always approved.\n\nRice\u2019s interview came amid a growing controversy that the Obama administration abused U.S. intelligence to spy on the Trump campaign and leak intelligence to the press to hurt Trump. This included the illegal leaking of General Michael Flynn\u2019s name from an NSA report and press reports that the Obama administration in its final weeks lowered the threshold for access to NSA information and spread intelligence about Russian interference in the election and alleged collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign throughout the government.\n\nAlso factor in House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes\u2019s disclosure in a March 22 press conference that the names of Trump campaign or transition officials were demasked from NSA reports that had nothing to do with Russia or alleged wrongdoing by the Trump campaign.\n\nBloomberg reporter Eli Lake confirmed this in a bombshell April 3 report in which he said the demasked reports \u201ccontained valuable political information on the Trump transition.\u201d Lake also broke the story that Rice asked for the demaskings in this report.\n\nAn April 3 Daily Caller report that Rice ordered U.S. spy agencies to produce \u201cdetailed spreadsheets\u201d of legal phone calls involving Donald Trump and his aides when he was running for president makes this story more interesting. Rice denied this allegation during her MSNBC interview.\n\nRice\u2019s denials don\u2019t add up. It is hard to fathom how the demasking of multiple Trump campaign and transition officials was not politically motivated. While it was legal for her to do this, it was highly unethical and would be a huge scandal if a Republican senior official sought the names of Democratic political opponents from U.S. intelligence reports.\n\nMy guess is that Rice\u2019s demasking requests were on behalf of the Obama National Security Council and were part of a broad campaign that began in early 2016 to abuse U.S. intelligence to hurt the Trump candidacy and then his presidency.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if former Deputy National Security Council Ben Rhodes was deeply involved in this campaign.\n\nDespite determined efforts by the mainstream media to stamp out this story, the smoke of this scandal continues to grow.\n\nSusan Rice\u2019s interview Tuesday added more smoke.\n\nFred Fleitz is senior vice president for policy and programs with the Center for Security Policy, a Washington, DC national security think tank. He held U.S. government national security positions for 25 years with the CIA, DIA, and the House Intelligence Committee staff. Fleitz also served as Chief of Staff to John R.

When his/her lips move.\n\nTuesday, Susan Rice was flapping her lips like a loose sail in a stiff breeze. She should have known better. Whenever she talks, trouble is sure to follow. For her.\n\nRice chose a benign venue in appearing on \"Andrea Mitchell Reports\" on MSNBC, but even that didn\u2019t help.\n\nThe story she peddled was blatantly self-serving and punctuated with a glaring contradiction.\n\nAll of which invites the question, did she break the law in the waning days of the Obama administration when she served as National Security Adviser?\n\nRice denied leaking intelligence information about President Trump\u2019s associates, yet she defended her requests to unmask the identities of U.S. citizens caught up in surveillance operations.\n\nHere is how the law applies to Rice\u2019s conduct. Or at least her version of it.\n\nUnmasking Names\n\nRice acknowledged in the interview with Mitchell that she requested that names be unmasked, but she insists she did not do it for political purposes. It is an important distinction.\n\nUnder the U.S. Signals Intelligence Directive (section 18), Rice was authorized to unmask the names of U.S. citizens, as long as it was essential to national security. Sure enough, Rice claims that national security was her reason.\n\nHere is the rub. It would be difficult for a prosecutor to prove otherwise. Likely, only Rice knows her true intent, and it is doubtful she authored a smoking-gun memo that reads, \u201clet\u2019s unmask these names so we can use their identities for political gain.\u201d\n\nBut if such an email exists or if someone were to come forward to allege that Rice verbally confided her motivation was for political reasons, then she would be looking at a serious felony punishable by up to 5 years behind bars.\n\nRice could face an additional problem. If she requested that a name be unmasked in a document that had nothing whatsoever to do with foreign surveillance involving national security, an argument could be made that she created a false statement in her unmasking request, which is a crime under 18 USC 1001.\n\nLeaking Names\n\nWhoever leaked Michael Flynn\u2019s name or any other names collected incidentally during surveillance, committed multiple crimes because those names are classified information.\n\nUnder 18 USC 798, it is a felony to knowingly and willfully communicate classified material to an unauthorized person.\n\nA similar law, 50 USC 1809, forbids the unauthorized disclosure of national security information. Three other statutes may also have been violated.\n\nThe Washington Post reporter who received Flynn\u2019s name described his source in a January 12, 2017 column as \u201ca senior U.S. government official.\u201d That would be a description of many people in Washington, Rice included. But she was in a unique position to have had access to what was supposed to be classified material.\n\nNevertheless, Rice insists she did not leak any names. Absent some proof that she is lying, she cannot be prosecuted. However, there is ample reason for people to suspect Rice is not telling the truth.\n\nRice\u2019s Changing Story\n\nIn the course of less than 2 weeks, the story Rice has told seems to have changed significantly.\n\nOn March 22, she was asked by Judy Woodruff on PBS' \"NewsHour\u201d if she knew whether \u201cTrump transition officials, including the president, may have been swept up in surveillance of foreigners at the end of the Obama administration\u201d. In other words, incidental collection.\n\nRice responded, \u201cI know nothing about this.\u201d\n\nYet Tuesday she reversed herself completely, claiming she knew all about it. That is, she knew of the incidental collection and, further, she is the one who requested that names be unmasked. Yes, she spoke in generalities, but is there any doubt she was referring to Trump associates?\n\nIt is an understatement to say that Susan Rice lacks credibility. And this would not be the first time she conjured up a false narrative.\n\nShe infamously hustled the deception that a videotape triggered the Benghazi attack in September 2012. Later, when incriminating emails surfaced, she admitted the story was untrue.\n\nShe further tarnished her reputation when she said that Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who faces charges of desertion and consorting with the enemy, served with \u201chonor and distinction.\u201d\n\nSusan Rice has an abysmal track record of telling the truth. Her remarks Tuesday about the unmasking of surveillance may be another example.\n\nNever Leaked Anything?\n\nRice seems to have taken her denials one step too far. During her MSNBC interview she declared, \u201cI leaked nothing to nobody, and never have.\u201d Really?\n\nThat\u2019s next to impossible. Is there a person in Washington who hasn\u2019t leaked something at some time to someone? If you can find that person, we should throw a parade.\n\nSo, when Rice makes a ludicrous statement like that, there is even more reason to doubt her veracity.\n\nWhen asked if she would testify before Congress, Rice refused to answer. I hope she has good counsel. She would be testifying under oath. It is a serious crime to lie to Congress.\n\nMy guess is she\u2019ll do everything she can to avoid raising her right hand.\n\nGregg Jarrett is a Fox News Anchor and former defense attorney.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/04/04/gregg-jarrett-did-susan-rice-break-law.html"}, {"text": "This week it\u2019s all about Gorsuch. Will the Senate confirm him as the Republican replacement of Antonin Scalia?\n\nLike the rest of America, I caught a bit of his confirmation hearing while driving in my car.\n\nIt was the normal grilling by some, including Senator Al Franken who reminded me at times of my favorite character he played on \"Saturday Night Live,\" Stuart Smalley.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m good enough. I\u2019m smart enough. And doggone it, people like me!\u201d\n\nBut things took an unusual turn when Neil Gorsuch was asked by Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse about how Gorsuch will know when he retires whether or not he had been a good judge.\n\n\u201cWhat an amazing question,\u201d I thought.\n\nAs a pastor, I\u2019ve spent my life walking through life with people, and one of the things I\u2019m most convinced of is competence is insufficient without character. Questions like the one asked by the Nebraska Senator get to the heart of the matter.\n\nGorsuch\u2019s answer was even more surprising than Sen. Sasse\u2019s question.\n\nIn addition to being an appellate judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals Gorsuch also teaches ethics at the University of Colorado Law School, \u201cSenator, that\u2019s a question I ask my kids every semester.\n\nAs part of his course, Judge Gorsuch revealed how he asks his students to take five minutes to write their own obituary. He said that some of the students find this \u201ccorny,\u201d but others actually are willing to read them aloud to the class.\n\nIt\u2019s within this context that Gorsuch chose to speak about how he himself wanted to be remembered, and at one point he even choked up discussing it.\n\n\u201cWhat I try to point out is \u2026 it\u2019s not how big your bank account balance is -- nobody ever puts that in their draft obituary -- or that they billed the most hours, or that they won the most cases. It\u2019s how they treated other people along the way,\u201d said Gorsuch to a committee room full of affluent, successful Senators. \u201cFor me, [I think of the] the words I read [just] yesterday from Increase Sumner\u2019s tombstone. I\u2019d like to be remembered as a good dad, a good husband, kind and mild in private life, dignified and firm in public life...I have no illusions that I\u2019ll be remembered for very long.\u201d\n\nThat answer was the biggest indication to me that Judge Gorsuch isn\u2019t just a qualified jurist, but a good man. He has character and competence.\n\nWhen people speak from their heart, as Judge Gorsuch seemed to do in that moment, we learn about the person behind the position. It\u2019s also good advice the Judge gave those Senators, and the rest of us too. We ought to be thinking about our obituary.\n\nHow will we be remembered when we are gone?\n\nWe must not think only of the here and now for the person who is ready to die is really only ready to live. We always must have the end in mind or we will not know the next step to take.\n\nBy the way, I\u2019m not speaking in theory either.\n\nMy son died unexpectedly at age 33, in a car accident. Here are the words on his tombstone: \u201cI have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, and I have remained faithful. And now the prize awaits me\u2014the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give me on the day of his return\u201d (2 Timothy 4:7\u20138 NLT).\n\nEver since he left us, I find myself thinking a lot more of the afterlife. Because he put his faith in Jesus Christ, I know I will see him again . . . in Heaven. His death has also caused me to begin to think more frequently about the question Judge Gorsuch asked his students.\n\nIf I were a Senator, Democratic or Republican, I\u2019d have to vote for him. Not just because the American Bar Association unanimously rated him as \u201cqualified\u201d but also because he has his priorities in the right place.\n\nAnd you know what\u2019s unfortunate?\n\nSome people will read politics into my endorsement of Gorsuch. Yet, there\u2019s nothing political about it. I\u2019m a pastor and evangelist who is focused on people, not politics.\n\nIt\u2019s a sad fact that our society has digressed to the point that one can\u2019t comment on a public figure without being accused of partisanship.\n\nIt\u2019s another indication of how objective truth lies in ruins on Capitol Hill.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because we aren\u2019t thinking enough about how people will remember us?\n\nPastor Greg Laurie serves as the senior pastor of Harvest Christian Fellowship in Riverside, California, one of the largest churches in America; is the author of more than 70 books; hosts the nationally syndicated radio broadcast, A New Beginning; and is the founder of Harvest Crusades, a large-scale evangelistic ministry whose next event, Harvest America, will be held June 11 in Phoenix at the University of Phoenix Stadium and broadcast live nationwide.

The initial endorsement could boost the chances of swaying conservatives concerned the initial bill did not go far enough in replacing the 2010 law.\n\nMcIntosh pointed to a new proposed provision that would allow states to apply for a federal waiver to opt out of what they see as cumbersome ObamaCare regulations.\n\n\u201c[We have to] see the language, see the bill, but if it\u2019s there, I agree with Mike Pence that it\u2019s a good provision and the bill should go forward,\u201d he said.\n\nPence, who has been pushing the effort to House Republicans, met with House Speaker Paul Ryan Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"The president and I remain confident that working with the Congress we will repeal and replace Obamacare with health care reform that will work for the American people and work for the American economy,\" Pence said.\n\nRyan said that while he believes the party is moving toward a consensus on the issue, he warned that they were still \u201cat the concept stage now.\u201d\n\nPence and Ryan\u2019s meeting came after Pence met behind closed-doors with Freedom Caucus members as part of the bid to overcome the opposition that killed the first bill. Also present were budget director Mick Mulvaney and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus.\n\nFreedom Caucus Chair Mark Meadows, R-N.C., called it a \u201cgood meeting\u201d but members said they want to see the offer in writing before getting on board.\n\nWhile courting conservatives, parts of the bill also look to allay the fears of moderates, such as the Tuesday Morning group. While the new proposal includes the ability for states to apply for a waiver from an obligation for insurers to cover \u201cessential health benefits\u201d such as mental health and maternity services, the failed bill removed that requirement completely -- only later allowing states to reimpose it on their own.\n\n\"The biggest change was putting the essential health benefits back in,\" said Rep.

And as it turns out, many Republicans were only too pleased to have the issue lifted from their shoulders and allow the newly popular ObamaCare to stay in place.\n\nNow, the White House says the president didn\u2019t mean it when he made his now-or-never vow and instead is going to keep the rest of his agenda on hold until the health-insurance overhaul is done.\n\nThis poses an unhappy question for the GOP: If TrumpCare failing made the rest of his agenda harder to pass, what happens if it fails twice?\n\nWeeks of pressure from Trump against the members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus combined with warnings from good-cop Speaker Paul Ryan that the president was ready to work with Democrats on the rest of his agenda seemed to have worked at getting the right wingers in a mood to deal.\n\nConservative House members tell Halftime Report that they still have considerable uneasiness about how a final deal might be structured, but are enthusiastic about what they see as a new willingness on the part of the administration and House leadership to make deeper cuts to ObamaCare subsidies and the law\u2019s requirements for insurance companies\u2019 coverage.\n\nThat\u2019s all great when it comes to the three dozen or so most conservative members of the House, but it does nothing for the moderate members who were already anxious about the existing cuts in the bill and its already-low popularity with voters.\n\nFundamental changes to things like the rules requiring health insurers to cover customers with pre-existing conditions are not likely to be received warmly by anxious suburban Republicans who are already worried about a difficult 2018.\n\nNow, these members can be encouraged by whatever legislation the Senate would return \u2013 if it does \u2013 would be more moderate than the House version. But, the deal being discussed would still rely on House members taking the first step and casting potentially dangerous votes.\n\nNone of that means that a new deal can\u2019t be crafted. Freedom Caucus members seem more amenable to a bill that leaves more key components of ObamaCare in place if they\u2019re reduced in stature. If they\u2019re willing to make a deal and moderates remain at the table, who knows?\n\nBut here we are talking about starting over, not patching the original version of TrumpCare. That might please conservatives, but it would hardly gratify a White House that seems focused on racking up some wins after a bumpy opening act.\n\nWe can\u2019t know whether Trump has come to accept Ryan\u2019s logic that TrumpCare must be passed before tax reform hits the floor because of the interconnectedness of the two issues and the rules of budget reconciliation, the only means for Republicans to push through their plan on a simple majority in the Senate.\n\nIf the president has reached that conclusion, we are in for months of wrangling over a controversial and currently unpopular policy provision even Trump gets to his goodies.\n\nThat would be an admirable commitment to process and protocol for the new chief executive who has already expressed considerable frustration with how Washington works.\n\nBut the problem is that every day brings us closer to Midterms. Special elections in Georgia, Montana and California are heightening awareness of next year\u2019s vote and increasing anxieties among Republicans who have continued to watch the president\u2019s approval ratings drop.\n\nWhatever Republicans do on health insurance is likely to be unpopular to begin with. Anytime you mess with that subject, voters get nervous. Can you imagine the sales of Pepto-Bismol on Capitol Hill if lawmakers were staring down a September vote on the health law?\n\nThis may also be something of an acknowledgement from Trump that without any significant Democratic support and a White House consumed with things other than his agenda, the president simply can\u2019t try to override Ryan & Co. and try to jam through other agenda items.\n\nEither way, the return of TrumpCare is not the kind of nostalgia trip many in Congress were looking for.\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: NARROW MINDED\n\n\u201cSuch an infatuated policy, such a desperate expedient, might, by the multiplication of petty offices, answer the views of men who possess not qualifications to extend their influence beyond the narrow circles of personal intrigue, but it could never promote the greatness or happiness of the people of America.\u201d \u2013 Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 9\n\n\n\nTIME OUT: NOT SO VANILLA\n\nSmithsonian: \u201cVanilla was cultivated in botanical gardens in France and England, but never offered up its glorious seeds.

Historically, that has meant jamming Global Positioning System and satellite communications signals, making it so troops can't access the space assets they rely upon and forcing them to think of alternatives.\n\n\"There really is no such thing as a space war -- it's just war,\" said Lt. Col. Kyle Pumroy, chief of Space Force Structure Plans for the Space and Cyberspace Superiority Division of the Air Force's Directorate of Strategic Plans. Military.com sat down with Pumroy at the Pentagon before he was awarded the General Bernard Schriever Award by the National Space Club last month for his service and enhanced training techniques while leading the space aggressors in 2016.\n\n\"We're preparing for an age in which war extends into space because that's where the capabilities are going to be able to operate, in addition to on sea, under sea and in the air,\" Pumroy said.\n\nThis week, as Defense Department and industry officials meet at the National Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, the conversation about threats -- mainly from China and Russia -- is likely to not only include defensive space capabilities, but also offensive options, or as leaders have called them, \"space control.\"\n\n\"The nature of the threat has changed,\" Pumroy said. \"It drives the need for the space aggressors to also provide \u2026 a training avenue that prepares the joint warfighter for those types of threats, whether that be anti-satellite weapons launched to blow up satellites, or nefarious [weapons] in orbit. Those are the types of things we need to prepare the warfighter for now.\"\n\nIn 2015, Gen. John Hyten, then-head of Air Force Space Command who has since been promoted to commander of U.S. Strategic Command, and then-Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James told \"60 Minutes\" that the U.S. has been looking for ways to launch countermeasures that can disrupt adversarial anti-satellite weapons without sending more debris into orbit. Space operators in recent years have already seen such attempts to disrupt U.S. signals.\n\n\"We'd want to know when they've launched that weapon, what the intended target is and then either try to move out of the way or [use] whatever capability we have to prevent [a collision],\" Pumroy said.\n\nAnd it's not simple. Moving a satellite, for example, expends fuel and resources, so a trade-off may be a degraded lifespan as a result, Pumroy explained.\n\nHaving communications capabilities in space provides \"us a tremendous operational advantage \u2026 which results in a reliance, which is OK, except some of those capabilities are vulnerable,\" Pumroy said.\n\nTo get ahead of such an attack, the U.S. \"must invest in more survivable, resilient capabilities and train on how to fight against those threats for when [the high-end space attack] comes,\" he said.\n\nIn recent months, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein has said he wants the service to be \"the lead service for space.\"\n\n\"We have suffered some difficulties in acquiring space systems, historically,\" Pumroy said. \"Some of that comes from potentially overlapping roles and responsibilities [that] can sometimes slow us down. If the Air Force is the lead service for space, we can just own it, and make more rapid decisions rather than leading by committee.\"\n\nThe service is working to create \"more unity of command,\" he said.\n\nThe Air Force wants space operators to see high-end attacks as part of their normal training to be \"ready for those threats, so if another country tries to attack those assets, they've seen this type of thing before, they defend, and the adversary loses,\" which also acts as a deterrent, Pumroy said.\n\n\"There are many experiments going on right now to help aid the development of what the right countermeasures and tactics are,\" he said.\n\nThe 527th is linked with Reserve's 26th Space Aggressor Squadron. Both fall under the 57th Adversary Tactics Group out of Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada.\n\n\"That group owns the air aggressors, the air defense aggressors, the information aggressors and the space aggressors,\" said Pumroy, who commanded the 527th from 2014 to 2016.\n\nThe squadron has had many missions since 1942, but was redesignated for a space mission in 2000. The unit has about 35 people, including civilians and contractors. The Reserve squadron also has roughly 35 billets, Pumroy said, so of \"70 or so people, it's a small group that provides these capabilities to the entire joint force.\"\n\nAdditionally, the space aggressors are training Army soldiers over the next two years for their space aggressor certification and also work with the Navy and Canadian forces, according to the unit.\n\nTheir training isn't just simulated at home station.\n\nMembers take temporary duty assignments where they're needed, Pumroy said, supporting various exercises such as Red Flag in Nevada, coastal drills with the Navy, and weeks-long exercises in the Pacific and European Command theaters.\n\nLast year, the space aggressors supported their first ever Polish exercise during Anakonda 2016, replicating satellite communications and GPS jamming capabilities with more than 200 soldiers from the Army's 10th Special Forces Group prior to their deployment to Eastern Europe.\n\nWith Pumroy's leadership, the unit also \"provided both SATCOM and GPS jamming training capabilities to the USS Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group,\" marking another first for the unit as they \"conducted GPS electronic warfare training against ships at sea.\" The efforts trained sailors for regional threats, while the carrier subsequently \"executed hundreds of strikes against [the Islamic State] in Iraq and Syria,\" according to information provided to Military.com about the mission.\n\nThe training is designed to help troops identify when an adversary is trying to electronically attack or destroy technology that supports air, land or sea missions, Pumroy said. \"How do I identify that, and recover from it?\" he said.\n\nIn his current assignment, Pumroy is helping the Pentagon advance its space portfolio. He supports allocating about $6.7 billion in planned funding for the advancement of space systems as part of the Air Force's fiscal 2019 budget.\n\nPumroy cited the 2007 incident when China conducted an anti-satellite missile test, destroying one of its own weather satellites and creating more than 3,000 pieces of debris.\n\n\"You see in the news that [China] is still developing these capabilities and they're probably more advanced than they were in 2007,\" he said. \"That's a concern when you look and say, 'We don't really train against that,' and you can't just say, 'We hope that never happens.'\"\n\nAnother concern is random satellites in orbit that officials aren't sure what they're there for or what they're doing, Pumroy said.\n\nThese were things the squadron saw as the future, but they are quickly \"becoming real,\" he said. \"What I wanted to do is prepare the squadron to represent those threats, because that is our mission.\"\n\nThe service can afford to lose one or maybe a few remotely piloted aircraft such as an MQ-1 Predator or MQ-9 Reaper \"to electronic warfare ... [because] in the grand scheme of things, those things happen,\" Pumroy said. \"Compare that to losing a satellite -- that is a game changer.\"\n\n-- Oriana Pawlyk can be reached at oriana.pawlyk@military.com.

Four days earlier, Joyal had appeared on NBC\u2019s \u201cDateline\u201d effectively accusing the Putin government of playing a role in the death of Alexander Litvinenko, a former KGB agent fatally poisoned in London.\n\n'Ambushing people when they come home at night is the tradition of most Russian contract killings.' - Paul Joyal\n\nAs Joyal returned home that rainy March night, two people were waiting for him in the bushes. He only set eyes on one of them, \u201cthe man I fought with face to face\u201d \u2013 Joyal ball-parked his age at between 28 and 32.\n\nThe attackers shot him before they fled. His wife, Elizabeth, ran outside and called 911.\n\nSpeculation quickly spread that Joyal, a former Senate staffer and frequent commentator on Russian issues, could have been targeted because of his anti-Kremlin statements.\n\nIn a 2009 Associated Press article revisiting the case, a Prince George\u2019s County police spokesman said the department, which investigated the attack, had no reason to think it was anything but street crime. A Russian Embassy spokesman quoted in the same report said any suggestion the attack was committed at the direction of Moscow is \u201cnonsense.\u201d An embassy representative did not return a request for comment for this article.\n\nBut Joyal and others have their doubts, noting nothing was stolen during the ambush.\n\n\u201cNo one requested anything from me at the time, and nothing was taken,\u201d he told Fox News.\n\nAsked whether he has learned anything about the suspects, Joyal said he was \u201cnot at liberty to discuss it,\u201d noting only that \u201cthe case is technically still open.\u201d\n\nHis case could be newly relevant given escalating, bipartisan warnings in Washington over everything from Russian interference in last year\u2019s political campaign to what the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee called \u201cinformation warfare\u201d that continues to this day.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all targets of a sophisticated and capable adversary,\u201d Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., said at a hearing last Thursday.\n\nFurther, another Kremlin critic, Denis Voronenkov, was fatally shot last month in Kiev. Ukraine\u2019s president blamed Russia, a claim a Putin spokesman reportedly called \u201cabsurd.\u201d\n\n\u201cFollow the trail of dead Russians,\u201d former FBI Special Agent Clint Watts testified at Burr\u2019s hearing on Thursday, an ominous warning that referred to recent killings.\n\nAsked about the Joyal case, an FBI Baltimore spokesman told Fox News that the bureau provided \u201climited support\u201d to Prince George\u2019s County on the matter in 2007. But spokesman Dave Fitz said the bureau could not discuss the investigation, as \u201cthis wasn\u2019t an FBI case, and we were only assisting the PD.\u201d\n\nFox News has asked the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department for information on the status of the case.\n\nJoyal said it took five years and seven operations for him to fully recover from his injuries. But, he said in an email, he is now thriving.\n\n\u201cI am a very lucky man,\u201d he wrote.\n\nA former director of security for the Senate Intelligence Committee, Joyal now works as managing director for public safety at the National Strategies consulting firm.\n\nHe continues to speak out on Russia, publishing a recent paper on, of all things, \u201cRussian information warfare.\u201d\n\nBut the shooting stays with him.\n\nAsked what he still recalls, Joyal said, \u201cI remember everything about that night.\u201d", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/04/who-shot-putin-critic-2007-maryland-attack-remains-unsolved.html"}, {"text": "Border enforcement veterans told lawmakers Tuesday that fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border has been \"absolutely critical\" in reducing violence, drug-smuggling and illegal entry -- in testimony boosting President Trump's call for a Texas-to-California wall.\n\nRonald Colburn, former Border Patrol deputy chief, and David Aguilar, former acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, testified to the Senate Homeland Security Committee about their experiences in the Bush administration when the first fencing was implemented.\n\nColburn also served as chief of the Yuma Border Patrol Sector, a stretch spanning southwestern Arizona and southeastern California, and was part of Operation Jump Start, which began in 2006 with the construction of a border fence.\n\nBefore the fence, the sector recorded 2,706 drive-throughs where illegal immigrants crossed the \"unfettered\" border with \"contraband of drugs and people,\" Colburn said. Of those, Yuma Border Patrol captured just 13.\n\n\u201cThe rest all got away, with no idea what, or who, they brought in,\u201d Colburn said. \u201cYuma had become the most dangerous part of the border.\u201d\n\nColburn also catalogued more than 200 attacks by \u201cborder bandits\u201d \u2014 gangs that would \u201cprey on their own,\u201d sexually assaulting, robbing and murdering Mexican migrants.\n\nBut once the fence was installed in 2006, violent bandit attacks went from 200 to zero, he said. The implementation of the fencing barrier also cut the number of so-called drive-throughs from 2,706 to six.\n\n\u201cYuma became the \u2018proof of concept\u2019 that America can protect and control its border when the proper mix of resources are placed almost instantaneously,\u201d Colburn said. \u201cBy 2008, Yuma Sector arrests of illicit border crossers and traffickers had dwindled from over 138,000 to 8,363.\u201d\n\nColburn, who has long supported the idea of physical barriers at the border, called fences critical, saying, \u201cIt marked our border; our line in the sand.\u201d\n\nAguilar agreed that physical barriers at the border are an \u201cintegral part\u201d of an enforcement system, but acknowledged that \u201cchallenges remain.\u201d He cited environmental considerations; eminent domain; and tribal autonomy\u2014the Tohono O\u2019odham nation occupies 75 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\u201cThe noted issues will have to be taken into consideration, but it is important to note that there is nothing more destructive to environmentally sensitive land and communities than the uncontrolled illegal flow of people, vehicles, smugglers, and criminal organizations,\u201d Aguilar said. \u201cThe placement of fences and deterrent infrastructure in previously uncontrolled parts of the border have actually allowed for the rejuvenation of areas that had previously been devastated due to heavy illegal pedestrian and vehicular traffic.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, DHS installed 353 miles of primary pedestrian fencing and 300 miles of vehicle fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border, which Aguilar said improved detection and surveillance capabilities, dropping migrant apprehensions from 1.7 million in fiscal 2000, to 408,870 in fiscal 2016.\n\n\u201cWe have done much to secure the border, but there is much more to do,\u201d Aguilar said.\n\nDHS Secretary John Kelly will testify before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday, just one day after the deadline for companies to bid to design and create President Trump\u2019s border wall.\n\nThe plan continues to face intense Democratic criticism, as lawmakers warn the costly project would be an unfair burden on taxpayers.\n\n\"I don't think there's anyone in this Senate who doesn't want our border to be secure,\" Ranking Member Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said Tuesday. \"But the wall that President Trump has promised could cost nearly $70 billion -- that's $200 for every man, woman and child in the United States.\"\n\nBut the Republican chairman of the committee backed the call for more fencing along the border.\n\n\u201cWe need a layered approach to border security, one that includes technology, manpower, a commitment to the rule of law, and the elimination of incentives for illegal immigration,\u201d Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said. \u201cFencing does work, and we need more of it.\u201d\n\nBrooke Singman is a Reporter for Fox News.

Rhodes himself knows this history but that doesn\u2019t seem to matter as he once again attempts to make people believe he fell out of the sky and onto Twitter on January 21st, 2017.\n\nTo help jog Rhodes\u2019 memory, below are all the documented instances of the Obama administration using and in some cases abusing surveillance.\n\n1. Fox News reporter James Rosen\n\nIn 2013 the news broke that Eric Holder\u2019s Justice Department had spied on James Rosen. Obama\u2019s DOJ collected Rosen\u2019s telephone records as well as tracked his movements to and from the State Department from where he reported. Rosen was named as a possible co-conspirator in a Justice Department affidavit. Rosen claims that his parents phone line was also swept up in the collection of his records and DOJ records seem to confirm that. Despite the targeting of Rosen, there were no brave calls to boycott the White House Correspondents Dinner.\n\n2. Senate Intelligence Committee and the CIA\n\nCIA officers penetrated a network used to share information by Senate Intel committee members, including Sen. Diane Feinstein, the committee\u2019s Democrat chair. The bombshell New York Times report went on to disclose:\n\nThe C.I.A. officials penetrated the computer network when they came to suspect that the committee\u2019s staff had gained unauthorized access to an internal C.I.A. review of the detention program that the spy agency never intended to give to Congress. A C.I.A. lawyer then referred the agency\u2019s suspicions to the Justice Department to determine whether the committee staff broke the law when it obtained that document. The inspector general report said that there was no \u201cfactual basis\u201d for this referral, which the Justice Department has declined to investigate, because the lawyer had been provided inaccurate information. The report said that the three information technology officers \u201cdemonstrated a lack of candor about their activities\u201d during interviews with the inspector general.\n\nThe Obama White House defended CIA director John Brennan\u2019s actions and response. Imagine that.\n\n3. Associated Press Phone Records\n\nMuch like James Rosen and his shady al Qaeda looking parents, Obama\u2019s Justice Department secretly obtained months of phone records belonging to AP journalists while investigating a failed terror attack. And much like the Rosen spying, this was personally approved by Attorney General Holder.\n\nMass surveillance and expansion of such under the Patriot Act is one of the most historically prevalent things about the Obama administration. There\u2019s even a Wikipedia page dedicated to that alone. So why do the media and former administration officials act shocked and surprised when someone points the finger in their direction and asks if targeting an incoming President is possible?\n\nThere is a long, decorated history of questionable\u2014even unconstitutional\u2014surveillance from the Obama administration none of which proves Trump\u2019s twitter ravings to be true. But it certainly is enough to raise suspicions among Trump\u2019s supporters and even some of this critics that he could be perfectly correct.\n\nClick for more from Heat Street", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/04/obama-administration-spying-included-press-allies-americans.html"}, {"text": "Editor's note: The following article originally appeared on the Media Research Center's NewsBusters blog.\n\nA massive revelation in the alleged surveillance of President Trump\u2019s aides broke Monday morning when Bloomberg reported that, \u201cFormer National Security Adviser Susan Rice requested the identities of U.S. persons in raw intelligence reports on dozens of occasions that connect to the Donald Trump transition and campaign.\u201d With their identities unmasked, it allowed for someone to freely and illegally leak their names to the press. It\u2019s controversial news but ABC and NBC both chose to ignore it that night, while CBS defended Rice.\n\n\u201cWe learned more today about the President's allegation that he and his aides were caught up in Obama-era surveillance,\u201d Anchor Scott Pelley said, teeing up reporter Margaret Brennan on CBS\u2019s \u201cEvening News.\u201d Strangely, Pelley stayed away from flinging the fiery insults which drew him much praise from the left. Instead of calling Trump\u2019s claims \u2018baseless\u2019 he kept it neutral, only referring to them as \u201callegations.\u201d He also described what the concern was as \u201cObama-era surveillance,\u201d something he had not done in the past.\n\nBrennan played defense for Rice, stating, \u201cWell, Scott, as national security adviser to the president, Susan Rice could and did request the names of individuals who were picked up during legal surveillance of foreign nationals.\u201d She then cited unnamed sources who told her there was nothing wrong with what Rice did:\n\nNow, according to a former national security official, Trump associates were not the sole focus of Rice's request, but they may have been revealed when she asked to understand why they were appearing in intelligence reports. However, Rice did not spread the information according to this former official, who insisted that there was nothing improper or political involved.\n\nOn Fox News\u2019 \u201cSpecial Report,\u201d it was a whole different story as they kicked off the program with the Rice\u2019s unmasking efforts. \u201cThe surveillance of people close to President Trump, possibly the president himself, now has a name and a face attached to it. And it's one you've seen in major scandals before,\u201d declared James Rosen, who was filling-in for Bret Baier, during the opening tease.\n\n\u201cTwo weeks ago, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee announced to the press and President he had uncovered a disturbing trend of intelligence collection on Trump officials, some of which was made public,\u201d reported Chief White House Correspondent John Roberts, \u201cToday we learn more about the \u2018how\u2019 and \u2018who\u2019 of what's going on.\u201d\n\nThe Fox News reporter noted that when it came to statements from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes about Trump aides being swept up in incidental collection, Rice claimed not to know a thing about it. \u201cI know nothing about this. I was surprised to see reports from Chairman Nunes on that count today,\u201d she claimed on PBS\u2019s \u201cNewsHour.\u201d That is now exposed as a lie, just like then she lied about what caused the Benghazi attack.\n\nAll of that and more went unreported on the Big Three networks.\n\nIronically, during the White House press briefing on Monday, Press Secretary Sean Spicer called the media out for doing just that.\n\n\u201cI think that it is interesting the level or lack of interest that I've seen in these developments when it goes in one direction,\u201d he declared, referencing when the press rushed to wrongly finger NSC Director Ezra Cohen-Watnik as the source of Nunes\u2019 information.

Democrats, aided and abetted by their friends in the media, have long dismissed President Trump\u2019s charges that he was \u201cwiretapped\u201d by former President Obama, even as evidence mounts that indeed surveillance of the Trump camp took place, and that information collected by so-called \u201cincidental\u201d monitoring was illegally leaked to the public.\n\nThe left would rather focus on speculation that the Trump campaign colluded with Russian agents to undermine Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy, even though to date there has been zero evidence to support any such charge.\n\nOn Monday, in a revelation that Senator Rand Paul describes as a \u201csmoking gun,\u201d numerous sources outed former Obama National Security Adviser Susan Rice as behind the \u201cunmasking\u201d of Trump associates picked up through surveillance of foreign nationals.\n\nWhile Rice had legal access to the electronic eavesdropping, and though her exposure of the identities of the individuals involved might be excused under certain circumstances, it is clear she has lied about her involvement and also about what took place in the Obama White House.\n\nUnder the harshest interpretation, it appears that Rice, possibly at the behest of President Obama, collected and distributed classified information about Trump and his associates with the sole purpose of politically damaging the incoming president.\n\nIf that is true, President Obama and one of his closest advisers committed a massive breach of trust with the American people; they have also confirmed that their White House was the most politicized in our history.\n\nThe story begins with a group within the National Security Council, headed by the senior director of intelligence, Ezra Cohen-Watnick, undertaking a review of the government\u2019s policy on \u201cunmasking.\u201d Presumably they were intent on finding out who discovered, and then illegally leaked, the contents of phone calls between former Security Council chief Mike Flynn and the Russian ambassador, which ultimately led to Flynn\u2019s ouster.\n\nAccording to journalist Mike Cernovich, who broke the story, \u201cThe White House Counsel\u2019s office identified Rice as the person responsible for the unmasking after examining Rice\u2019s document log requests. The reports Rice requested to see are kept under tightly-controlled conditions. Each person must log her name before being granted access to them.\u201d\n\nThe logs led National Security Adviser General H.R. McMaster to conclude that Rice had been responsible for uncovering the identities of individuals who were picked up in \u201cincidental\u201d surveillance of foreign nationals. Usually, such persons are reported anonymously to protect their privacy. No one has yet accused Rice of leaking the information that she collected.\n\nMcMaster sent an aide, Derek Harvey, to convey that information to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes. The Intelligence Committee chief was widely criticized for going alone to the White House to examine computers which contain the logs, and for meeting with the president afterwards.\n\nNow the ranking minority member on the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff, has also seen the data.\n\nIt is telling that after visiting the White House himself and reviewing the information, Rep. Schiff refused to discuss the contents of the documents, but rather focused on the process by which they had come to light. He managed that sleight of hand while chiding President Trump for trying to divert attention away from the Russia probe. Neat.\n\nIt is noteworthy that in an interview with PBS \u201cNews Hour\u201d anchor Judy Woodruff on March 22, Rice denied Trump\u2019s charges of wiretapping, saying \u201cnothing of the sort occurred.\u201d Rice can argue that Trump\u2019s tweet: \u201cjust found out that Obama had my \u2018wires tapped\u2019 in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!\u201d may not be exactly accurate, but Rice\u2019s denial is not truthful either.\n\nThat won\u2019t shock us. Many Americans will remember that Rice was the White House point person on Benghazi, telling Americans on the Sunday morning talk shows that the assault on the U.S. compound was a spontaneous outburst caused by an anti-Muslim video.\n\nShe knew better, as did the White House.\n\nThey knew the attack, which cost the lives of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans, was carefully planned and executed \u2013 a horrible jihadi assault that contradicted Obama\u2019s narrative of winning the war on terror.\n\nThe surveillance that apparently caught up Trump campaign workers and aides, including Michael Flynn, is said to have been legal. Foreign individuals who were wiretapped or otherwise spied on were apparently targeted by U.S. intelligence; some of the information was then handed over to the FBI. Reviewing the reporting on Flynn\u2019s conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey I. Kislyak \u2013 which got him fired \u2013 it is remarkable how little interest was shown by the New York Times and other news organizations in how the sensitive material was collected and distributed. Now those questions appear more pertinent.\n\nIt is possible that the surveillance of Trump\u2019s people was not entirely \u201cincidental.\u201d If someone wanted to track Jared Kushner, for instance, who was known to be in communication with Cui Tiankai, the Chinese ambassador to the U.S., intel groups could decide to surveil the latter, and pick up the desired information about Kushner simultaneously. There is no indication that such methods were used to spy on the Trump team, but remember that Nunes said the information he viewed at the White House had nothing to do with Russia. So the surveillance was presumably not an attempt to unearth collusion between the Trump team and Moscow. Also, the logs indicate intelligence gathering on persons associated with Trump that stretch back a year or more. One wonders about the purpose.\n\nThere are reports that Rice shared the \u201cunmasked\u201d reports with numerous intelligence organizations. Towards the end of the Obama presidency, the White House loosened the rules on who could receive \u201craw\u201d intelligence reports. Those changes made it easier to more broadly disseminate materials thought injurious to the incoming president.\n\nThese are early days yet in the investigation into the Obama White House\u2019s possible spying on the Trump team. Much remains unknown, including who directed the effort. Was President Obama involved? Did former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper lie when he denied that any wiretapping took place against Trump or his associates? Did FBI Director James Comey lie as well?\n\nIt is infuriating to see Democrats and the liberal media doing backflips to direct the focus elsewhere \u2013 and especially back to possible collusion between members of the Trump camp and Russia.\n\nTo those who would allege that Trump was in cahoots with Putin, I offer this: General James Mattis aka Russia\u2019s worst nightmare. For those not paying attention, President Trump tapped Mattis to be his Secretary of Defense. Does that really jive with a White House eager to cozy up to Putin?\n\nAll Americans deserve the truth in both these inquiries. We need to know whether the Trump camp conspired with Russian agents to hack the DNC and John Podesta\u2019s emails, and we need to know whether the Obama White House gathered and leaked surveillance information on Trump or his aides illegally in order to discredit him. Let us hope that our Congressional Committees are up to the task, because it is clear the liberal media is content to investigate only one of these stories.\n\n\n\nLiz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

The Democrats intend to filibuster Gorsuch, meaning he\u2019ll need 60votes or a change of Senate rules to get through.\n\n\u201cTo my Republican friends who think that if Judge Gorsuch fails to reach 60 votes, we ought to change the rules, I say if this nominee cannot earn 60 votes, a bar met by each of President Obama's nominees and George Bush's last two nominees, the answer isn't to change the rules,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cIt's to change the nominee.\n\nThis obstruction comes on the heels of an impressive performance by Judge Gorsuch during the confirmation hearings. Democrats tried and failed to smear President Trump's Supreme Court pick, and they didn't land a punch.\n\nNow Senate Democrats including Warren are vowing to use the last arrow in their obstruction quiver - the filibuster she once denounced. If they go through with it, Senate Republicans will have no choice but to invoke the nuclear option by extending Harry Reid's 50-vote threshold Supreme Court nominees.\n\nAfter all, as one noteworthy politician once said: Elections have consequences.\n\nAdapted from Sean Hannity's monologue on \"Hannity,\" April 3, 2017\n\nSean Hannity currently serves as host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) Hannity (weekdays 10-11PM/ET).

They maintain it\u2019s much safer for the agents to make arrests at courthouses than on the street or at the illegal immigrant\u2019s home.

In a letter signed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions and DHS Secretary John Kelly, the federal government admonished Justice Cantil-Sakauye for using the term \u201cstalking\u201d to describe ICE agents.\n\n\u201cStalking has a specific legal meaning in American law, which describes criminal activity,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThe arrest of persons in a public place based upon probable cause has long been held by the United States Supreme Court as constitutionally permissible.\u201d\n\nThe letter also encourages Cantil-Sakauye to raise her concerns with politicians in California who support sanctuary city policies. Officials argue the release of criminal aliens from jails that refuse to honor ICE detainer requests force agents to make arrests in places like courthouses.\n\nDan Springer joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in August 2001 as a Seattle-based correspondent.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/04/04/ice-raids-in-courthouses-pits-immigration-agency-against-federal-judges.html"}, {"text": "A self-styled populist Democratic candidate for the Virginia governorship received an honorarium payment from the alumni organization of an elite secret society at Yale University, according to financial disclosure forms.\n\nTom Perriello, a progressive who served as a representative from Virginia's 5th Congressional district from 2009 to 2010 but lost his congressional seat during the Tea Party wave, is running against Ralph Northam, the state's lieutenant governor, in June's Democratic gubernatorial primary.\n\nPerriello attended Yale as an undergrad and again for law school and has described himself on numerous occasions as a \"pragmatic populist.\"\n\n\"I'm a populist in the sense that I think the people are often smarter about what's going on than the leadership in Washington,\" Perriello said in an interview with the Collegiate Times. \"I'm a populist in the sense that I think we need to understand that growth really comes from the purchasing power of the working middle class out, it doesn't trickle down from the top.

That would contradict what Rice recently told PBS, when she said she knew \"nothing\" about the claims that Trump transition officials, including President Trump, may have been swept up in the surveillance of foreigners at the end of the Obama administration.\n\nUnder the federal Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Americans who turn up incidentally on surveillance of foreign targets must have their identities \"masked.\" Although Rice and other key intelligence community officials had the authority to order the names unmasked, the information cannot then be revealed for reasons other than national security.\n\n\"I regret that the information I was provided was wrong.\" - Susan Rice, explaining her comments following the Benghazi attacks\n\nThe revelations are rocking Washington, but it is not the first time Rice has found herself in the eye of the storm.\n\nIn 2012, Rice, who was then serving as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, appeared on five different Sunday talk shows to suggest that the Benghazi terror attacks were the result of spontaneous protests over what she called a \u201chateful\u201d Internet video.\n\nE-mails uncovered after the fact revealed that administration officials knew the Benghazi attacks were the result of terrorism, not an internet video, and indicate that even folks within the State Department were stunned by Rice's appearances. One State Department employee suggested Rice had gone \"off the reservation.\"\n\nJust a few months after her Sunday show appearances, Rice was blaming the intelligence community and admitting that at least part of the information she was disseminating \"turned out to be wrong.\n\n\"I regret that the information I was provided was wrong,\" Rice said in an interview. \"That doesn\u2019t make me a liar. That makes me a public servant trying to say what we knew at the time.\"\n\nIt was less than a year later, in June 2013, that Rice was tapped by President Obama to serve as National Security Advisor. At the time, then-Fox News national security analyst KT McFarland, now White House Deputy National Security Adviser, wrote that Rice would be a \"disaster\" in the post.\n\n\"[Rice] has zero credibility with the media, on Capitol Hill, with the foreign policy community and foreign leaders, and is so badly tarnished by the Benghazi scandal that she walks into the job on Day One weak and wounded,\" according to McFarland.\n\nMcFarland added that the most concerning aspect of Rice\u2019s resume was \u201cher disastrous performance on the Sunday talk shows peddling the administration\u2019s fairy tale on Benghazi; when she was either complicit in the cover-up or incompetent. Either she knew what really happened and deliberately lied to the American people or she was a mere actress who read the script she was given and didn\u2019t know enough to question whether the words she spoke were accurate.\"\n\nIn a video for the Council on Foreign Relations, four former National Security Advisors indicated just how close the person in the role of national security adviser can be with the commander in chief, and exactly how much power that person wields.\n\nSandy Berger, who held the post in the Clinton administration, said it \"reflects how the president wants to conduct foreign policy,\" but added that the job \"is really at least four roles wrapped in one.\"\n\nThose roles, Berger said, include: being a personal advisor to the president, running what's called the inter-agency process (the meetings convened by the president between government agencies), overseeing the implementation and execution of a president's policies, public speaking and sometimes negotiating.\n\nFormer National Security Adviser Colin Powell was more explicit about how much power comes with the territory.\n\n\"You know that you are about to make a recommendation that is going to be approved or not approved by the President of the United States,\" adding that those recommendations can \"become the position of the United States of America,\" he said.\n\nJust under a year into her tenure as a National Security Advisor, Rice found herself in the headlines again. This time, Rice drew the ire of many by offering what seemed to be kind words for accused Army deserter, Bowe Bergdahl, in 2014.\n\nBergdahl was accused of deserting his unit, and seeking out the enemy back in 2009. His fellow soldiers searched the deserts of Afghanistan for their missing brother, and five Taliban prisoners were eventually exchanged for his release. When Rice was asked about the accusations against Bergdahl upon news of his return, she suggested \"anybody who has been held in those conditions... has paid an extraordinary price.\"\n\nRice added that she believed Bergdahl \"served the United States with honor and distinction,\" something that Fox News contributor Charles Krauthammer called \u201cthe biggest whopper\u201d since her Benghazi comments.\n\nRice would go on to defend her \u201chonor and distinction\u201d comments in a subsequent interview, suggesting \"what we need to care the most about is his health and wellbeing and recovery.\"\n\nRice is a former Rhodes Scholar who served as a U.S. Assistant Secretary of State from 1997-2001 (the youngest-ever in her position). She was named \"One of the Most Powerful Women in Washington\" by Glamour magazine in December 2016, and was the first African American woman to be named U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. In 2004, she spent some time as an advisor for John Kerry's presidential campaign.\n\nShortly after President Obama's second term ended, Rice signed with the talent agency Creative Arts Agency, a group whose membership also includes former senior advisor Valerie Jarrett, former Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill Biden. The agency also boasts Hollywood icons like Robert Downey Jr. and Matthew McConaughey as clients, along with NFL Legend Peyton Manning, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nMost recently, Rice signed on as a Distinguished Visiting Research Fellow with American University, where she will apparently begin work on a new book.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/04/who-is-susan-rice-obama-administration-stalwart-at-center-scandals.html"}, {"text": "What goes around comes around is one of life\u2019s undeniable truisms and never more than in the politics of Washington, D.C. (the \u201cD.C.\u201d increasingly standing for dysfunctional city).\n\nLast week was Cherry Blossom week in D.C. This week it\u2019s Neil Gorsuch week. Republicans must now decide whether to use the \u201cnuclear option,\u201d a parliamentary procedure that allows the U.S. Senate to override a rule or precedent by a simple majority of 51 votes, instead of by a supermajority of 60 votes, as a tool for confirming President Trump\u2019s nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nFor those whose primary diet is not politics, a little history will help explain the pedigree of the nuclear option.\n\nThe constitutional option has been around in one form or another for more than a century. Writing on the website Think Progress, Ian Millhiser references a Federalist Society article in 2004: \u201cThe basic mechanism was devised by Republicans in 1890 to defeat a Democratic filibuster of a bill permitting military intervention in Southern states that prevented African-Americans from voting.\u201d\n\nThat in itself is interesting since the history of Democratic opposition to civil rights, especially in the South, has largely been forgotten as modern Democrats smear Republicans for their alleged \u201cvoter suppression\u201d of minorities. But I digress.\n\nUnder the 1890 plan, notes Millhiser, \u201cSen. Nelson Aldrich (R-RI) proposed introducing a motion asserting that \u2018when any bill, resolution, or other question shall have been under consideration for a considerable time, it shall be in order for any senator to demand that debate thereon be closed.\u2019\u201d\n\nAldrich then envisioned, notes Millhiser, \u201ca series of steps where the presiding officer of the Senate would reject the process proposed by his motion, and a simple majority of the Senate would reverse the presiding officer\u2019s decision.\u201d The plan was never activated because \u201cDemocrats caved and allowed a vote on the bill out of concerns that Aldrich would succeed.\u201d\n\nThat is the choice for Democrats this week with the Gorsuch nomination. Should enough of them vote to get to the 60-vote majority currently required for a Supreme Court nominee, or should they do what their liberal base is demanding and vote \u201cno,\u201d prompting Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), to change Senate rules to allow Gorsuch to be confirmed by a simple majority?\n\nDemocrats don\u2019t have a credible leg to stand on in opposing a change in Senate rules. That\u2019s because their former Majority Leader, Harry Reid (D-NV), changed the rules to confirm federal judges nominated by President Obama by a simple majority over Republican objections.\n\n\u201cPower\u201d is defined as the \u201cability to do or act\u201d and having the \u201ccapability of doing or accomplishing something.\u201d As long as Republicans have the majority, they should consider using their power. They have the numbers so they have the ability. The question is, are they capable enough to confirm Gorsuch with little support from Democrats?\n\nSometimes it appears Republicans are more concerned about negative press coverage, which they will get simply because they are Republicans, than about the wrath of voters. All politicians use power to advance their agenda. And now that Democrats are in the minority, they are using what little power they have, aided by their like-minded media colleagues, to stymie the Republican agenda.\n\nIf the nuclear option is necessary to confirm Judge Gorsuch, Republican senators should use it. And they should keep it for all federal judges, just as Democrats did with President Obama\u2019s nominees. This is what Democrats fear most, because with a clear conservative majority on the Supreme Court and more conservatives on lower courts they could no longer expect judges, rather than legislators, to advance their agenda and they would have to be accountable to voters.\n\nSounds to me like a good option.\n\nCal Thomas is America's most widely syndicated op-ed columnist.

They can represent a legitimate effort to understand the thinking of those who voted for Trump and how they view him now. Or they can have a condescending quality, hoping to discover how deeply these voters regret what they have done.\n\nBut at least journalists are getting out of the Acela corridor and trying to take the pulse in conservative communities.\n\nThe New York Times ran such a story yesterday, headlined \u201cIn Ohio County That Backed Trump, Word of Housing Cuts Stirs Fear.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post ran a similar dispatch from Oklahoma yesterday, with the headline \u201cTrump\u2019s Budget Would Hit Rural Towns Especially Hard\u2014But They\u2019re Willing to Trust Him.\u201d\n\nFear versus trust.\n\nThe Times piece opens in Kinsman, Ohio with Joseph Pavlic, who can no longer work because he has multiple sclerosis, and his wife Tammy.

She cried as she described her regret at voting for Trump: \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have these programs, I wouldn\u2019t have any kind of support, I wouldn\u2019t have any kind of direction as to what to do, where to go, and I wouldn\u2019t have any money to help me find resources.\u201d\n\nThe Post story, in Durant, Okla., which voted 76 percent for Trump, quotes the city manager as saying it is easy to cut programs derided as \u201cwasteful spending\u201d without \u201creally understanding the true impact.\u201d\n\nBetty Harris, a 77-year-old widow, is upset that Trump\u2019s budget would dramatically cut funding for the senior center that is her lifeline. She gives presidents 10 strikes, and says \u201cI have high hopes for Trump, but if he\u2019s going to be cutting these kinds of programs, that\u2019s going to be one.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, it\u2019s important for Beltway honchos to be reminded that cutting domestic programs affects the lives of real people, some of whom are struggling just to get by.\n\nOn the other hand, government is clearly living beyond its means, and no one ever said federal spending cutbacks wouldn\u2019t be painful.\n\nThis was at the heart of the impasse over replacing ObamaCare: How much pain was the Republican Party willing to accept in exchange for a smaller, less intrusive program?\n\nAmericans are always conflicted about federal spending: They hate it in the abstract, love it when they benefit.

Even with the demise of Republican efforts to replace the Affordable Care Act, equities have proven remarkably resilient as investors continue to bet on growth.\n\nNo doubt, corporate profits surging 22 percent last year have a lot to do with keeping equities strong, but history teaches when expectations are most buoyant, investors and decision makers are inclined to overlook festering problems that could abscess into a systemic collapse.\n\nHere are five hot spots that could saddle Trump with the next financial crisis.\n\n1. The Housing Bubble\n\nHome prices and property values have soared in big cities where the economic recovery has been strongest \u2014 aided by low mortgage rates and Dodd-Frank regulations that push banks toward lending to the upper middle class and wealthy.\n\nNow, Federal Reserve tightening could push up interest rates enough to depress the monthly payments and prices that would-be homeowners can afford. Similarly, overbuilding of apartments is stressing the rents big-city landlords can charge.\n\nAs during the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and the more recent financial meltdown, homeowners and investors may find they have overpaid, and property values in affluent urban centers could be headed for an \u201cadjustment.\u201d\n\n2. Student Debt\n\nOutstanding student loans now exceed $1.4 trillion and more than 40 percent of borrowers are in default or behind on payments.\n\nEventually, the federal government will either have to make good on hundreds of billions of dollars of debt or let banks and bond investors take big losses.\n\nIt\u2019s another unpopular bailout in the offing or, as we saw with Lehman Brothers in 2008, another opportunity for federal authorities to risk financial instability.\n\nThe Trump administration will have few pleasant choices.\n\n3. European Banks\n\nEuropean banks are suffering from slow-growing economies and ultra-low interest rates that make difficult moving bad loans off their books. About 17 percent of Italian bank loans are underwater, and conditions are troubling elsewhere too.\n\nGermany\u2019s largest bank, Deutsche Bank, was recently hit with a large fine by the Justice Department for its role in the financial crisis. The incident highlighted that the bank is not well run or profitable but has wide interconnections with other banks in Europe and the United States.\n\nIt has repeatedly raised new capital and eventually could be forced by European banking authorities to resort to a bail-in \u2014 namely, force bondholders to accept stock for their securities and take huge losses.\n\nThat could easily ignite panic elsewhere. In Italy, ordinary depositors have been encouraged to purchase bonds in the manner that Americans invest in certificates of deposits. Bail-ins would impose huge losses of savings and purchasing power, and a contagious recession with severe repercussions for other European and American banks.\n\n4. China\n\nChina\u2019s national and provincial governments have subsidized inefficient state-owned enterprises and exporters with easy credit and propped up growth through excessive borrowing for wasteful public works and urbanization projects. Government deficits are estimated at least 15 percent of gross domestic product, and cumulative public and private debt at 250 percent.\n\nPrinting money has pushed stocks, bonds, commodities and housing prices to threatening levels, and large investors are fleeing China, driving down the dollar value of the yuan.\n\nShould those bubbles burst and the yuan collapse, Asian and other developing economies dependent on exports to China could easily become unable to service their dollar-denominated debt. All this is reminiscent of the Asian currency crisis of the 1990s, which left many American lenders holding the bag.\n\n5. Trump\u2019s Promises and Political Divisions\n\nTrump\u2019s economic program to boost U.S. growth could easily be stalled in Congress. Any tax change requires at least accomplishing consensus within the Republican caucuses in the House and Senate. Many business regulations may be changed by executive order, but Mr. Trump can count on Democrats bringing challenges before liberal judges and new legislation would be much more efficient.\n\nFacing opposition from the House Freedom Caucus and with only 52 Republican senators, Trump must find ways to build centrist coalitions. However, with moderate Democrats unwilling to break from party solidarity in opposing all of his initiatives, he lacks the opportunities enjoyed by Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush to build a bipartisan majority for even moderate legislation.\n\nThe hard right and the Democrats appear willing to cripple an American president to serve ideological purity and win political advantage \u2014 even at the risk of plunging the global economy into yet another massive crisis.\n\nPeter Morici served as Chief Economist at the U.S. International Trade Commission from 1993 to 1995.

Two related but distinct problems stand out with what's known of the president's approach to the summit - the first tactical and recent, the second strategic and deeper-rooted.\n\nThe recent problem is the one that should be dropped immediately: The President's apparent decision to use America's trade leverage over China (which he rightly views as considerable) to press Beijing to use its own major economic influence to curb a North Korea nuclear weapons program that increasingly threatens the United States directly - and has the entire world on edge.\n\nCandidate Trump unmistakably realized that these U.S. alliances ... are now creating the kinds of dangers to America's homeland security that simply didn't exist when they were established.\n\nAs Mr. Trump told the Financial Times in a Sunday interview: \"China has great influence over North Korea. And China will either decide to help us with North Korea, or they won't. And if they do that will be very good for China, and if they don't it won't be good for anyone. I think trade is the incentive. It is all about trade.\"\n\nBut even if this plan works perfectly, and China persuades the North to verifiably give up its nukes, he will have sacrificed for the time being all of America's available clout for dealing with the Chinese trade predation that he's repeatedly (and rightly) described as a mortal economic threat. In addition, the president could easily wind up with the worst of all worlds - ever more strongly worded but bogus Beijing promises to pressure the North but little action; ever more subsidized and dumped Chinese goods destroying production and jobs in the United States; and ever higher Chinese trade barriers against American products and services.\n\nOf course, Mr. Trump's definition of \"great deals\" could well include \"great monitoring and enforcement\" mechanisms. So maybe he'd quickly see through any Chinese game-playing and return to a hard trade line. But it's certain that his administration would face intense foreign and domestic pressure to keep the faith with China - while it keeps undermining the American economy and North Korea keeps improving nuclear weapons already dangerously close to reaching the U.S. homeland. And again, if China finally delivered on its promise, the American economy would be back behind the eight-ball again.\n\nThe strategic problem concerns the tension between candidate Trump's willingness to question whether America's comprehensive approach to dealing with East Asia has become dangerously obsolete decades after the end of the Cold War that spawned it, and President Trump's apparent decision to preserve this status quo. Further, because ever more capable North Korean (and to a lesser extent, Chinese) nuclear forces mean that the stakes will soon entail nothing less than the survival of a growing list of American cities, he needs to pick an alternative sooner rather than later.\n\nThe status quo's attractions are obvious, especially to the diplomatic mandarins in both major political parties. Consistent with their conviction about history teaching that American security and prosperity require creating a secure and prosperous world, they claim that staying the East Asia course has long buttressed the stability of an especially vibrant but historically conflict-prone part of a closely connected global economy. Although establishmentarians agree that this strategy poses risks, they consider them well-known and eminently manageable. As for costs - like damage to America's economy from East Asian protectionism - these are either defined out of existence by citing win-win free trade mantras, or viewed as an affordable price for peace in our time.\n\nThis case has certainly been made to President Trump by the mandarins who have filled the top spots of his foreign policy and national security agencies, and from all appearances, he's listened. Just think of his February summit with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Defense Secretary James Mathis' trip to Japan and South Korea. Nary a word was heard about predatory trade, and the administration affirmed that the U.S. commitment to Tokyo and Seoul against all enemies (i.e., North Korea and China) was \"ironclad.\"\n\nAnd yet as a candidate, the president recognized two major and urgent reasons for changing the alliance status quo. First, as he frequently lamented, America's heavy spending on alliances and foreign aid has drained the wealth needed to address keep its economy thriving. Mr. Trump most often called for ending European and Asian defense free-riding. But his pointed threat to consider letting \"these countries defend themselves\" demonstrated his awareness that - as he argued on another occasion - \"When the other side knows you're not going to walk, it becomes absolutely impossible to win.\" If Mr. Trump keeps calling America's alliance guarantees inviolable, however, and reduces his criticisms to quarrels about contributions, he fires those same shots into his feet.\n\nSecond, and more important, candidate Trump unmistakably realized that these U.S. alliances - and especially in Asia due to the North Korea threat - are now creating the kinds of dangers to America's homeland security that simply didn't exist when they were established.\n\nFor most of the Cold War, the U.S. nuclear umbrella covered East Asia at modest risk because America enjoyed overwhelming strategic superiority over China and North Korea had no nuclear arsenal at all. (The much stronger Soviet Union was considered a prudent and predictable rival.)\n\nIn fact, Washington felt so confident that it stationed tens of thousands of American soldiers right along the North-South Korean border. Their mission: to all but guarantee that if North Korea conventional forces invaded their neighbor, Americans would die and trigger a massive U.S. nuclear response. This gambit violated a fundamental maxim of strategy by virtually denying the nation the option of sitting a conflict out. But because the North lacked its own weapons of mass destruction, it could do little or nothing to keep U.S. nukes safely in their silos, and, deterrence held firm. Just as important from Washington's perspective, its strategy prevented Japan's full rearmament - and possible relapse back into World War II-type militarism.\n\nNowadays, however, this American \"escalation dominance\" may already be gone. That is, if defending South Korea might not yet result in the nuclear destruction of an American city - or two - it soon will. Yet the G.I.s remain right along the North Korean border, their mission remains, in effect, getting killed, and the American foreign policy establishment is pretending that the situation remains well in hand.\n\nIn a March interview with the New York Times, Mr. Trump strongly indicated that because of North Korea's emerging ability to strike American targets, the United States might now be better off if Japan and South Korea defended themselves with their own nukes - and in the process, leave the United States on the sidelines.\n\nOf course, establishmentarians and their Mainstream Media parrots pilloried these views as dangerous know-nothing-ism. In fact, he was the only adult in the room - and should have gone further. For the United States is more than 6,000 miles from Japan, North Korea, and South Korea. Because of its own immense nuclear arsenal, it is surely credibly deterring the North against attacking American territory in the only way possible,whether dictator Kim Jong Un is deranged or not: by promising to annihilate his country if its nukes ever hit the United States. But even despite the North's undeniable hostility, its only plausible reason for threatening such an attack on America is because of possible U.S. involvement in a Korean peninsula war.\n\nIn contrast with the United States, North Korea's neighbors are located right next door. Their stakes (including China's and Russia's) in successfully coping with the North's nuclear program and unpredictability are therefore infinitely greater than America's. So the real \"America First\" strategy is for President Trump to tell Xi Jinping that henceforth, the North is a problem that needs to be dealt with by him and the other locals, that the United States is pulling out militarily to reduce its nuclear vulnerability, that he wishes them well in this regard - and that now it's time to reduce that huge trade surplus you're running with us.\n\nAlan Tonelson, who writes on economic and security policy at RealityChek, is the author of \"The Race to the Bottom\" (Westview Press, 2002).

According to the documents, Podobnyy tried to recruit Page, an energy consultant working in New York at the time, as an intelligence source. Page is referred to in the filing as \"Male-1.\"\n\nPage was hired by the Trump campaign as a foreign policy adviser in March 2016, but left the campaign that September because, as he put it, \"these stories kept coming out based on the dodgy dossier.\" Page was referencing a now-infamous file on Trump that was created by Christopher Steele, a former British MI-6 agent who was working for a U.S. political research group called Fusion GPS on behalf of both Republicans and Democrats.\n\nEX-TRUMP ADVISER CARTER PAGE RIPS 'FALSE NARRATIVE' ON RUSSIA COLLUSION\n\nPage is among the Trump associates under scrutiny as the FBI and the House and Senate intelligence committees investigate Russian interference in the 2016 campaign and possible ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News last week, Page denied that he ever worked with Russian officials to help Trump's campaign, decrying stories to the contrary as \"propaganda\" driven by a \"false narrative.\"\n\nPage acknowledged in a statement Monday night that he \"shared basic immaterial information and publicly available research documents\" with Podobnyy. He described the information as \"nothing more than a few samples from the far more detailed lectures\" he delivered at New York University in 2013.\n\nBuzzFeed News first reported on the filings.\n\nTrump has vigorously denied that he or his associates were in contact with Russia during the election.

The full agenda remains unclear, the newspaper said.\n\nThe meeting took place nine days before Trump's inauguration and involved businessman Erik Prince, the Post reported. Prince, the founder of the security firm Blackwater and now the head of the Hong Kong-based company Frontier Services Group, has ties to Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon and is the brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.\n\nU.S. officials said the FBI has been scrutinizing the meeting in the Seychelles islands in the Indian Ocean as part of the broader probe of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and alleged contacts between associates of Putin and Trump, the Post reported.

Such trips are usually kept quiet, with the cooperation of journalists, until the officials arrive in order to ensure maximum security.\n\nA senior administration official told reporters Sunday evening that Kushner \u2014 President Donald Trump's son-in-law \u2014 was in Iraq, even though he was still en route. For the military and security professionals managing the mission, the public disclosure of the unannounced trip was a security breach. Gen. Joseph Dunford, the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, also was on board.\n\nAlthough the plane landed safely in Baghdad on Monday, the Iraqi capital is hardly a secure location, having suffered countless extremist attacks over the years. The threat is no less acute today as Iraq wages a bitter battle to try to rid the Islamic State from its territory. For trips to the city, the military seeks to avoid public mention of plans ahead of time so extremist groups can't plot attacks.\n\n\"It's been longstanding practice to strictly avoid announcing the visits of senior U.S. officials in advance of their travels to warzones,\" said George Little, a Pentagon and CIA press secretary for Leon Panetta, who managed both departments under President Barack Obama. \"The main reason is obvious. You want to avoid giving the enemy any information that could help them to target these delegations, especially in areas where the battle lines aren't clear on the map.\"\n\nKnowing when and where a senior U.S. military or civilian official might arrive makes attacks easier. Such details could help groups target the plane as it takes off or lands, or use roadside bombs or shoulder-launched rockets to strike dignitaries while they're on the ground.\n\nU.S. security details work with host countries to make sure routes and buildings are secure, trying to do so in the most inconspicuous manner possible.\n\nThe choice of plane, too, is determined by danger level. In warzones, officials often fly more rugged combat aircraft, such as the Air Force's heavy C-17 transport plane. These can take off and land quicker on shorter runways. Steeper, corkscrew landings are sometimes preferred to minimize the threat from surface-to-air missiles.\n\nReporters cooperate, too. Those traveling with top leaders into conflict areas must keep the trip secret, with reports generally \"embargoed\" until landing. Restrictions can be tighter on rare occasions.\n\nBut these practices all are predicated on the administration not making the trip public prematurely.\n\n\"The moment of vulnerability is, if they know you're coming, a surface-to-air missile going after the airplane,\" said Ari Fleischer, President George W. Bush's White House press secretary. \"If you can diminish the time they know \u2014 and by the time you're there, the whole thing is a flood of security agents \u2014 it makes it almost impossible in theory for them to do anything bad.\"\n\nFor the Trump administration, Kushner's voyage marks the second time a secret trip hasn't gone as planned.\n\nIn February, the White House arranged for Trump to visit Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to honor the returning remains of a U.S. Navy SEAL killed a week earlier. In keeping with the practice of past White Houses, the trip wasn't announced. News organizations agreed not to report on the trip until after Trump arrived at the base.\n\nBut unlike past occurrences, Trump left the White House in broad daylight in Marine One from the South Lawn of the White House, taking off in full view of pedestrians. The AP was forced to report that Trump had left the building.\n\nFor the last 15 years, as Republican and Democratic presidents and Cabinet members have traveled in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan, media have largely adhered to the unwritten rules.\n\nIn 2003, when then-President George W. Bush secretly traveled to Iraq to see troops on Thanksgiving Day, about a dozen reporters accompanying him had to hand over their cellphones, pagers and other electronics upon boarding Air Force One. They couldn't file stories while Bush was on the ground, only after he left Iraqi airspace.\n\nThere have been occasional mistakes and misunderstandings. Host countries sometimes spill the beans and Cabinet members also slip up, though rarely with details about flights as they're incoming.\n\nSecurity incidents aren't uncommon.\n\nWhen Defense Secretary Panetta's plane was taxiing after landing in Afghanistan in 2012, an Afghan contractor hijacked an SUV and tried to run down senior Marine officers waiting on the ramp to welcome the Pentagon chief. The contractor then set himself aflame inside the vehicle, forcing the plane to taxi elsewhere on the runway to avoid the fire.\n\nOfficials said they didn't think the man knew about Panetta's arrival.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/04/03/news-iraq-trip-with-kushner-mid-air-poses-security-risks.html"}, {"text": "Connecticut lawmakers are considering whether the state should become the first in the country to allow police to use drones outfitted with deadly weapons, a proposal immediately met with concern by civil rights and liberties advocates.\n\nThe bill would ban the use of weaponized drones, but exempt police.

However, the steep terrain and rugged topography make West Virginia infrastructure projects expensive and technically tricky.\n\nMost of the area developed as a result of the coal industry. Coal\u2019s success \u2013 and its decline \u2013 has affected land use, the economy and transportation opportunities.\n\nWhen the industry fell on hard times, so did its communities. Jobs were lost, people moved away, schools and hospitals shut down and efforts to fix crumbling infrastructure were put on the back burner.\n\nAccording to an American Society of Civil Engineers infrastructure report, the state currently has 1,247 bridges that are \u201cstructurally deficient.\u201d It also has 7,366 miles of public roads in \u201cpoor\u201d condition that could cause problems for not only transporting coal but also courting new investments to the area. Trump's call for major infrastructure spending nationwide could resonate strongly here.\n\nWest Virginia\u2019s infamous King Coal Highway, for example, is a 100-mile two-lane stretch of road connecting the state's coalfield communities to the rest of the region. Huge chunks of it are in desperate need of repair.\n\nIt\u2019s common to see overloaded coal trucks and debris littered along the blacktop, as well as warning signs along the way.\n\nPeople in the southwestern part of the state are waiting for Trump to make good on campaign promises to get coal miners back to work.\n\nLast week, he started the process by rolling back Obama-era environmental regulations. The president ordered a review of the Clean Power Plan, which was crafted to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants. Trump also lifted a moratorium on the sale of coal mining leases on federal lands.\n\nCOAL TOWNS SEE HOPE FOR COMEBACK AS TRUMP ENDS 'WAR'\n\nDeskins, an associate professor of economics, says while the baseline economic forecast for West Virginia calls for short-term job losses in coal to subside, the long-term future isn\u2019t as clear.\n\nThe coal industry is subject to considerable risk and at the mercy of the regulatory climate and conditions in the global market, he said. The Trump administration\u2019s moves largely were seen as a morale booster for coal communities that have been pummeled by these factors -- including tough competition from cheaper forms of energy like natural gas, wind and solar.\n\nBut West Virginians say Trump\u2019s $1 trillion infrastructure investment push would also go a long way to boosting the region.\n\nNot only would better roads allow coal to be moved more effectively, infrastructure projects would help states like West Virginia branch out into other industries like manufacturing and tourism.\n\n\u201cInfrastructure and coal go hand-in-hand,\u201d Chris Hamilton, senior vice president of the West Virginia Coal Association, told Fox News.\n\nYet despite Trump\u2019s widespread promises and smiling photo ops with miners in hard hats, the fiscal 2018 budget plan the president floated last month cuts out crucial federal funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission.\n\nThe ARC is an economic development agency of the federal government that partners with 13 state governments and focuses on 420 counties across the region. It supports 500 jobs and brings in $15.7 million in earnings every year.\n\nOne of the core ARC projects is the Appalachian Development Highway System, which connects counties and promotes economic development.\n\nThe current highway system is 88 percent completed. Once done, it\u2019s predicted to bring in 80,500 jobs and $5 billion in increased value-added production.\n\nThe ARC also has a POWER initiative that focuses on diversifying coal communities and making sure the Appalachia workforce is prepared for jobs, spokeswoman Wendy Wasserman said.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, Congress approved a $146 million budget for the agency. The money goes toward teaching coal miners how to code, develop agricultural activity on coal land and other skills.\n\nSunny Frothingham, a senior researcher at the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress, pointed to the proposed ARC cuts as a \"betrayal\" for coal country voters.\n\n\u201cAppalachian voters trusted President Trump to understand their needs and create good jobs \u2013 95 percent of the counties covered by the Appalachian Regional Commission voted for him in 2016,\u201d Frothingham said. \u201cCutting the ARC is an outright betrayal of Appalachian communities and would leave them without the funds to implement critical workforce, education and infrastructure projects.\u201d\n\nWhile coal has long been the heartbeat of West Virginia, \u201ca more diverse economy is necessary in order to steer West Virginia toward a brighter economic future,\u201d Deskins said.\n\nNo matter what the future of West Virginia is, residents will need better roads.\n\n\u201cNow is the time,\u201d Gordon Lambert, McDowell County commissioner, recently told USA Today. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get our highways this time, we won\u2019t get them in our lifetime.\u201d", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/03/road-to-rebuilding-coal-country-starts-with-literally-roads.html"}, {"text": "The Interior Department said Monday it is scrapping an Obama-era rule aimed at ensuring that coal companies don't shortchange taxpayers on huge volumes of coal extracted from public lands, primarily in the West.\n\nThe Trump administration had put the rule on hold after mining companies challenged the regulation in federal court. Monday's action repeals the Obama-era rule and begins a process seeking public comments on whether to change the way the government values coal mined on federal lands.\n\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke described the repeal as another sign the Trump administration has stopped what it saw as a \"war on coal\" by the federal government.\n\nPresident Donald Trump lifted a moratorium on the sale of coal mining leases on federal lands last week and rolled back Obama-era regulations aimed at curbing climate-changing emissions from coal-fired power plants.\n\n\"We need reliable, affordable and abundant energy,\" Zinke said at a ceremony last week marking the end of the coal moratorium. \"Energy independence is what makes us strong.\"\n\nThe process of setting royalty rates for coal and other energy sources \"needs to be fair -- not arbitrary -- and make sure that the taxpayer at the end is the winner,\" Zinke said.\n\nHe promised that coal royalty rates set under his leadership will be \"transparent\" and vowed to treat energy companies in the same way President Ronald Reagan treated the Soviet Union: \"Trust but verify.\"\n\nMonday's action repeals an Obama-era change aimed at ensuring that coal companies don't shortchange taxpayers on coal sales to Asia and other markets. Coal exports surged over the past decade even as domestic sales declined.\n\nRules in place since the 1980s have allowed companies to sell their fuel to affiliates and pay royalties to the government on that price, then turn around and sell the coal at higher prices, often overseas. Under the now-repealed rule, the royalty rate would have been determined at the time the coal is leased, with revenue based on the price paid by an outside entity, rather than an interim sale to an affiliated company.\n\nConservationists criticized the Trump administration's move, calling it a \"sweetheart deal\" for the industry that will deprive states of much-needed revenues. About half the coal royalties collected by the federal government is disbursed to states including Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, Utah and New Mexico.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers and watchdog groups have long complained that taxpayers are losing hundreds of millions of dollars annually because royalties on coal from public lands were being improperly calculated.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/03/interior-department-repeals-obama-era-rule-on-coal-royalties.html"}, {"text": "Reversing the steps of his predecessor, President Trump on Monday welcomed Egyptian President Abdel- Fattah al-Sissi to the White House, praising him for doing a \u201cfantastic job\u201d and pledging U.S. support.\n\nAl-Sissi and Trump were expected to discuss ways the two countries can collaborate in the fight against terrorism as well as ways to bolster Egypt\u2019s economy.\n\nLike Trump, al-Sissi believes he can eradicate radical Islamic extremism.\n\nThe Egyptian president hailed Trump on Monday for his \"unique personality\" and vowed to work with the U.S. \"to counter this evil ideology that is claiming innocent lives, that is bringing devastation to communities and nations and that is terrorizing the innocent people.\"\n\nSince the military overthrew Egypt's first post-revolution president, the popularly elected Mohamed Morsi, a Muslim Brotherhood member, al-Sissi has cracked down on political Islamists. Al-Sissi also has shown a heavy hand to Egyptians who've deemed his presidency illegitimate, often relegating human rights concerns to national security.\n\nTrump and al-Sissi met in September during the presidential campaign. Al-Sissi was the first foreign leader to reach out to Trump after his November win against Hillary Clinton.\n\nReflecting on their first encounter in New York shortly before the general election, Trump said al-Sissi is someone \"very close to me.\"\n\n\"Together, we will fight terrorism and other things and we're going to be friends for a very, very long time,\" the American leader said, citing a \"great bond with the people of Egypt.\u201d\n\nAl-Sissi\u2019s government believes its success in fighting radicalism depends critically on U.S. aid.\n\nEgypt is among the top recipients of U.S. military and economic assistance, but the aid is being evaluated as part of the Trump administration's push for dramatic budget cuts to diplomacy and development. It receives $1.3 billion annually in aid, plus hundreds of millions in economic assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development and other programs potentially on the chopping block.\n\nTrump has vowed to work closely with Arab allies in the fight against the Islamic State group. As a neighbor to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, Libya and Sudan, maintaining stability in Egypt is a high priority. But it has sometimes been a relationship from which the U.S. receives little in return, and Trump has said he won't tolerate imbalances in other partnerships, as with China and many European allies.\n\nEgypt's economy is forecast to grow by 4 percent this year, according to the World Bank, but the figure heavily accounts for capital gains in oil and gas.\n\nConditions on the Egyptian streets tell a very different story.\n\nUnemployment hovers at 12.7 percent -- a sore spot for millions of Egyptians who protested in 2011 to demand the removal of then-President Hosni Mubarak. Then, unemployment was 9 percent. Youth are hardest hit by job shortages, with about 30 percent out of work.\n\nEgyptians supporters of al-Sissi criticize the Obama administration's handling of the Egyptian uprising six years ago, believing American complacency ushered in Muslim Brotherhood control.\n\nSince then, extremist attacks have spiked, particularly on the Sinai Peninsula which borders Israel and Gaza. Cairo -- home to some 20 million people -- has seen several militant attacks, including a December bombing at a church that killed more than two dozen people.\n\nEgypt's minority Christians, who comprise about a tenth of the population, are particularly encouraged by Trump's presidency, hoping the American president will team up with al-Sissi to more forcefully address Egypt's growing extremism.\n\nFor Trump and al-Sissi, it's also a meeting of kindred spirits.\n\nBoth maintain a contentious relationship with the media and believe \"bad\" or \"evil\" people are infiltrating their borders. Both whip up supporters with talk of victories and seek to project a mystic sense of inevitable success. They've both challenged whether their country's judges are acting as roadblocks to democracy.\n\nAl-Sissi, like Trump, is widely viewed as a polarizing figure in his country. That view manifesting itself on the streets outside the White House Monday, where rival protests for Trump and opposing both Trump and al-Sisi swelled before the Egyptian's arrival.\n\nIn the sea of American and Egyptian flags, some chanted \"We love Sisi, we love Trump!\" Others held signs of al-Sissi and Trump and chanted \"Illegitimate,\" a cry harkening back to the Arab Spring.\n\nFormer President Obama repeatedly admonished al-Sisi during his tenure and briefly froze some U.S. military aid to Egypt in 2013 but had it restored in 2015 because it was in the \u201cinterest of U.S. national security.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/03/trump-egypts-leader-meet-at-white-house-expected-to-discuss-defeating-terrorism.html"}, {"text": "**Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day?

Aside from his long rapport with President Trump from their New York days, Schumer is the kind of cagy pragmatist that many thought would be a relief after the curdled partisanship of his predecessor, Harry Reid.\n\nBut in his first test, Schumer is so far proving unequal to the moment.\n\nIt\u2019s like this: because Gorsuch is so well respected, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has had no trouble getting even the most moderate Republicans on board with a change to Senate rules that would allow a Supreme Court nomination with just a simple majority rather than the current 60 votes.\n\nSchumer himself has joined the filibuster crew in what may still prove to be a smart gambit of placating liberals but still preventing the deployment of the so-called \u201cnuclear option.\u201d\n\nThe broad assumption in Washington is that Trump will get to make at least one more Supreme Court pick during his term. And there is no guarantee that the next one will be as broadly admired and qualified as Gorsuch. If Republicans were trying to ram through a less well-regarded jurist, it might be harder for McConnell to get the votes for rule change.\n\nWhile you only need 51 votes to change the rule of 60, plenty of Republicans might balk at blowing up long-standing procedures for the sake of a nominee of whom they were less enamored.\n\nBut the thinking here is clear: if Democrats will filibuster Gorusch, they will filibuster anybody.\n\nNow, Democrats\u2019 thinking may be that nuclear winter is coming no matter what, so why bother being the goat to liberals who votes to advance the nominee of a president universally and passionately despised on the left.\n\nThis is one of those moments when if senators voted by secret ballot, the outcome would be enormously different.\n\nA Senate leader\u2019s job involves a great deal, but the crucial skill is the ability to get members of your conference to do politically painful things in the name of helping the party.\n\nIf on Friday, Schumer and his team can get eight Democrats to take the plunge and join Republicans in moving Gorsuch on to a final vote, the new minority leader will have proven himself the practitioner of politics he was repudiated to be.\n\nHowever, if Democrats go for a short-term, symbolic victory in exchange for the possibility of a more valuable future win, then Schumer will have shown himself to be out of his depths and headed for the same fate as Reid: A toxic asset for Democrats.\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: DIVIDED COUNTRY\n\n\u201cTo this reasoning it may perhaps be objected, that if any State should be disaffected to the authority of the Union, it could at any time obstruct the execution of its laws, and bring the matter to the same issue of force, with the necessity of which the opposite scheme is reproached.\u201d \u2013 Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 16\n\n\n\nTIME OUT: LIFE OF THE MIND\n\nThe Paris Review: \u201cFiction is, by definition, a world away from fact\u2014but Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal, often heralded as \u2018the father of modern neuroscience,\u2019 used it to find objective truth. Cajal spent his days at the microscope, gazing down at faint, entangled fibers that appeared to his fellow anatomists as inscrutable labyrinths. Contrary to prevailing theory, the Spaniard discerned that the nervous system, including the brain, comprises distinctly individual cells (neurons), which, he theorized, must communicate across the infinitesimal spaces between them (synapses). It was Cajal who first applied the term plasticity to the brain; he went so far as to recommend \u2018cerebral gymnastics\u2019 for mental enhancement, presaging twenty-first century insights and trends about brain exercise.\u201d\n\n\n\nFlag on the play? - Email us at\n\nHALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with\n\nyour tips, comments or questions.\n\nREPORT: SUSAN RICE UNMASKED IDENTITIES IN TRUMP INTEL\n\nBloomberg\u2019s Eli Lake reports that former National Security Adviser Susan Rice was behind the \u201cunmasking\u201d identities of those mentioned in Intel reports relating to Trump\u2019s transition team. \u201cWhite House lawyers last month discovered that the former national security adviser Susan Rice requested the identities of U.S. persons in raw intelligence reports on dozens of occasions that connect to the Donald Trump transition and campaign, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter.

A majority, 53 percent, said he should resign.\n\nThat is important because PPP also found that 44 percent of Americans already believe that Trump\u2019s campaign did just that.\n\nIt is no fantasy to say the drip-drip-drip of the Trump-Russia investigations is draining this presidency of political capital. The president\u2019s historically high disapproval rating \u2014 51 percent in the latest McClatchy poll \u2014 tells the same story.\n\nIt is no fantasy to say the drip-drip-drip of the Trump-Russia investigations is draining this presidency of political capital.\n\nThat\u2019s why astute Republicans are starting to look out for themselves.\n\nThe first Republican to begin to run for cover was Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who decided to recuse himself from any role in the investigation. Last week Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser, sought immunity in exchange for his testimony to congressional investigators.\n\nA majority of Americans want a special prosecutor \u2014 including 39 percent of Republicans, according to one poll. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has called for Congress to form a bipartisan select committee to probe ties between Russia and the Trump camp.\n\nThe struggle for Republicans in Congress is two-fold.\n\nFirst, they have to avoid being blamed for undermining the legitimacy of the Trump presidency. But, secondly, they are worried about the damage Trump will do to their party\u2019s fortunes in the 2018 midterms.\n\nThe Democrats have a different political challenge.\n\nThey have to figure out how to respond to White House efforts to distract the public by denigrating the intelligence agencies and derailing the Congressional investigations.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking member on the House Intelligence panel, has become a model on that score by avoiding political statements.\n\nHe limits himself to saying there is \u201cmore than circumstantial evidence\u201d that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election.\n\nAs a result, Schiff looks virtuous compared to the committee\u2019s chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.). The Republican has failed by playing along with Trump officials who are busy suggesting that the whole controversy has been ginned up by anti-Trump intelligence agents and left-over Obama administration officials.\n\nMeanwhile in the Senate, Democrats are united behind Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the Intelligence Committee\u2019s vice-chairman, who holds the upper hand over the Republican chairman, Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina.\n\nThe minute Warner says Burr is acting to protect Trump, the committee\u2019s entire credibility will crumble.\n\nBurr has announced plans to interview Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior advisor, Jared Kushner, as part of the investigation. Trump associates Roger Stone, Paul Manafort and Carter Page have also volunteered to testify.\n\nIn the Senate, the Democrats are also unified behind the political strategy of Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.). He is threatening to filibuster Trump\u2019s nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.\n\n\"It is unseemly to be moving forward so fast on confirming a Supreme Court justice with a lifetime appointment while this big gray cloud of an FBI investigation hangs over the presidency,\u201d Schumer said recently.\n\nBut the Trump White House continues to pursue a failing strategy of distraction.\n\nIn conspiratorial terms, these Trump insiders point to a shadowy clique of Washington hands \u2014 the so-called anti-Trump \u201cDeep State\u201d \u2014 trying to bring down the populist president.\n\nTrump tried his hand at the change-the-subject game with his unsupported claim that President Obama was wiretapping him. That is now a claim that all but his most stalwart allies have abandoned.\n\nDemocrats also have to contend with the Trump White House effort to undermine the Congressional investigations. The Washington Post reported last week on White House efforts to stop former Attorney General Sally Yates from giving testimony.\n\nThe good news for Democrats is that the White House is not very good at distracting anyone from the Russia scandal.\n\nWhite House aides got caught leaking documents to Nunes in an attempt to shift media attention to charges of potentially illegal surveillance of Trump campaign officials.\n\nThat backfired when the names of the White House aides ended up in The New York Times. One of the men, Ezra Cohen-Watnick, a 30-year-old at the National Security Council, had recently been targeted for dismissal by his boss H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser. Cohen-Watnick had to appeal to the president to save his job.\n\nIn this chaos, Democrats have the luxury of watching and expressing apolitical regret. After all, most of the Democratic base views still views Trump as a racist, a huckster, a sexual predator and an illegitimate president.\n\nDemocrats have also been emboldened by the health care debacle. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) literally took off her shoes and jumped for joy with protestors outside the Capitol after the vote was pulled.\n\nIt has been said that predictions make fools of us all. The campaign and the election that brought Trump to power certainly proved that, since the majority of the media \u2014 myself included \u2014 predicted he would not win.\n\nBut it is no liberal fantasy to say the odds of a Trump resignation or impeachment before 2020 are looking better by the day.\n\nJuan Williams is a co-host of FNC's \"The Five,\" where he is one of seven rotating Fox personalities.\n\n", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/04/03/juan-williams-trumps-impeachment-risk-keeps-growing.html"}, {"text": "Senate Democrats have enough votes to filibuster the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court, increasing the odds that majority Republicans will deploy the so-called \u201cnuclear option\u201d to get him confirmed.\n\nSeveral senators announced their opposition to Gorsuch on Monday ahead of a Senate Judiciary Committee vote. The new Gorsuch foes bring the number of Democrats willing to block his nomination to over 40 \u2013 the number needed to prevent the Senate from ending debate and advancing to a final vote.\n\nAmong the latest to come out against Gorsuch were Sen.

The study found that a third of what it called \u201cjunk news\u201d shared via Twitter in Michigan in the seven days leading up to the election and three days after came from conservative news sites such as Breitbart, InfoWars, Daily Caller, Liberty Alliance and Truth Feed.\n\nBut the study could identify only 2 percent of the politically related Twitter messages as coming from Russian sites like RT and Sputnik.\n\n\u201cFrom this data alone there is no clear hand of influence from Russia,\u201d study author Philip Howard of the Oxford Internet Institute told Fox News. \u201cThe single most important source of political information was links to unverified WikiLeaks stories. We believe there was automation pushing those links around but that is our next research project.\u201d\n\nWatts said President Trump parroted the Russian propaganda, amplifying its reach.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason active measures worked in the U.S. election is because the commander in chief used Russian active measures at times against his opponents,\u201d said Watts in the hearing. Watts did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nBut experts were dubious of the claims.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a red herring and Senator Warner knows better,\u201d said Morgan Wright, former law enforcement officer and cybersecurity adviser. \u201cIs it possible the Russians were able to target specific counties in key swing states days ahead of the election?

What appears to have happened is vigorous democracy, where some people were surprised by the outcome.\u201d\n\nBrett Healy, of the Wisconsin-based free-market think tank MacIver Institute, was emphatic that the claim of surgically targeted meddling was without foundation.\n\n\u201cThe accusation is so juvenile and ludicrous it cannot be taken seriously,\u201d Healy said. \u201cIf this rumor was even remotely credible, someone here in Wisconsin would have alerted the media and filed a complaint with the Elections Commission. Rural Wisconsin voters, who have a history of voting Democrat in presidential elections, decided that they had enough of the far left policies of President Obama and they took it out on Clinton.\n\n\"For the Democratic Party to attempt to blame their widespread defeat on an imaginary bogeyman is comical and a little sad,\u201d Healey added.\n\nStill other election observers say it\u2019s still possible specific areas of key swing states were targeted by the Russians, even if the information isn\u2019t publicly known.\n\n\u201cSenator Warner has access to confidential and classified information through his post on the Intelligence Committee,\u201d said Barry Burden of the University of Wisconsin Elections Research Center. \u201cHopefully a thorough investigation will make some of this information public.\u201d", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/03/claims-russian-swing-state-meddling-red-herring-say-election-experts.html"}, {"text": "Sitting on the southern edge of the Great Basin Desert and towering almost 800 feet above the arid landscape of scrub brush and rocky buttes, the three massive smokestacks of the Navajo Generating Station can be seen from miles away.\n\nSince the mid-1970s the coal-burning power plant has not only provided electrical power to customers across Arizona, Nevada and California. It also has been one of the main employers for members of the Navajo Nation living in the area as well as a source of government revenue and services such as free coal to heat homes in the winter.\n\nBut the plant\u2019s future looks bleak as electric utility company Salt River Project and the plant\u2019s four other owners recently voted to shut down operations at the end of 2019 \u2013 citing concerns that coal power is not economically viable as many utilities turn toward cheaper and cleaner-burning fuels like natural gas.\n\nWhile there is no doubt that the closure would be a major benefit for the air quality and overall environment, which includes nearby Antelope Canyon, the Colorado River and Lake Powell, the move would devastate the already economically-fragile Navajo and Hopi communities whose land the plant sits on. Now with President Trump\u2019s plan to inject new life into the slagging coal industry, two employees recently wrote a plan to have the federal government subsidize the coal the station buys from the nearby Kayenta Mine.\n\nThe generating station and the mine employee more than 800 people, and closing the plant would also mean the closure of the mine, which supplies millions of dollars\u2019 worth of coal to the Navajo Generating Station a year.\n\n\u201cWe looked back at the auto industry, the banking industry, even some solar companies that were subsidized with millions and millions of dollars,\u201d Jerry Williams, an employee at the power plant for 36 years and the president of Navajo Nation\u2019s Lechee Chapter House, told the Arizona Republic.\n\nWilliams, who co-wrote the plan with fellow plant worker Erwin Marks, said they have so far received the support of dozens of the 110 Navajo political chapter houses.

Any deal would have to be approved with the consent of Peabody.\n\nPeabody said in a statement to Fox News that the company has offered a proposal to keep the plant competitive and that an energy research firm it hired found that the Navajo Generating Station was still an economically viable operation.\n\n\"Peabody has come to the table with a lower, fixed coal price proposal representing a competitive fuel cost versus alternate generation sources and has engaged a globally recognized energy research firm to evaluate the plant\u2019s economic profile,\" spokesperson Beth Sutton said in an email.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t appear to be the thinking of the Salt River Project (SPR), which said that while it supports the effort to keep the plant running it has no interest in continuing as a part owner in the operation.\n\n\u201cSRP appreciates and supports the efforts of the Navajo Nation to explore all options to keep the plant operating beyond 2019 should they choose to do so,\u201d Scott Harelson, a spokesperson for Salt River Project, said in an email to Fox News. \u201cHowever, SRP will not be a participant of any potential new ownership group after our current lease ends on Dec. 22, 2019.\u201d\n\nHarelson added that his company hopes that the plant can get a lease extension by July and, if that succeeds, Salt River Project would be open to purchasing power from the plant in the future.\n\n\u201cIf we are successful in obtaining a lease extension and if the Navajo Nation were to be successful in keeping the plant operating economically beyond 2019, SRP could potentially purchase power from NGS at that time if the price was consistent with our other alternatives,\u201d he said.\n\nIn late February, Navajo Generating Station and Keyenta Mine owners and stakeholders along with Navajo Nation President Russell Begaye meet with members of President Trump\u2019s Interior Department to discuss a plan to delay the decommissioning of the mine.\n\nExpand / Contract View of the Navajo power generating station near Page, Arizona August 12, 2012.

But this may not be enough to save the Navajo Generating Station, or the coal industry overall.\n\nPlant owners are more and more relying on power from cheaper and cleaner products like natural gas, and many owners say they lose money when they burn the fuel and are unable to sell the excess power on the market. Even with Trump\u2019s moves to deregulate the coal industry, environmental liabilities and steep operating costs have forced many facilities to shutter their coal holdings.\n\nSome experts say that even with a federal subsidy \u2013 estimated to be upwards of $100 million \u2013 it would not be an easy thing to make the power plant an economically viable operation as utilities can find cheaper alternatives elsewhere and that the federal government could better help the Navajo Nation by simply giving them more funding directly.\n\n\u201cWe would not ever buy the quantity we are buying from Navajo today,\u201d said Ted Cooke, general manager of the Central Arizona Project, which buys power from the generating station. \u201cIt\u2019s not diversified enough for us.\u201d", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/04/03/navajo-nation-wants-trump-to-subsidize-coal-sales-to-struggling-power-plant.html"}, {"text": "Here are five news stories and events to start your week:\n\nRear Adm.

He\u2019s a mainstream judge who\u2019s earned the universal respect of his colleagues on the bench and in the bar. He applies the law as we in Congress write it.\u201d\n\nDespite such praise from the GOP side, all Democrats on the committee voted against the nominee, in a sign of the clash to come as the nomination advances to the full Senate.\n\nThe chamber\u2019s Democratic leaders appear ready to try to hold up the nomination through what's known as a filibuster. Republicans have 52 senators and would need the support of eight Democrats to reach the 60 votes necessary to overcome a filibuster and head to a final vote.\n\nThat appears out of reach. Prior to the committee vote, more than 40 Democrats said they were willing to block the Gorsuch nomination -- increasing the likelihood that majority Republicans would use the so-called \"nuclear option\" to push the nomination through.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, returned to her party\u2019s repeated argument that Judge Merrick Garland, former-President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee, should have been considered for the Scalia seat, but leaders of the Republican-controlled Senate held off until after the 2016 presidential election.\n\nFeinstein also revisited a ruling Gorsuch made on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, in Colorado, in which he sided with a company that fired a trucker for disobeying orders by unhitching his vehicle from a malfunctioning tractor-trailer and driving off -- after waiting hours for help in sub-zero temperatures.\n\n\u201cSo this is not the usual nominee,\u201d she said. \u201cTherefore, I cannot support the nominee.\u201d\n\nSo far, just three Senate Democrats have announced support for Gorsuch, a graduate of Columbia University, Harvard Law and Oxford University.\n\nThey are Sens. Joe Donnelly, of Indiana; Heidi Heitkamp, of North Dakota; and Joe Manchin of West Virginia -- all representing states Trump won in November and all up for re-election next year.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Sunday that Gorsuch nevertheless will be confirmed by Friday.\n\nHe was noncommittal on whether he was prepared to trigger to so-called \"nuclear option,\" a change in precedent that would allow the Senate to break the filibuster with a simple majority of 51 votes.\n\nBut on Monday, a Republican colleague spoke bluntly and indicated the party would go that route. South Carolina GOP Sen.

After all, it\u2019s about the numbers. So if McConnell doesn\u2019t have the cooperation of eight Democrats alongside all 52 Republicans to garner 60 votes and overcome a filibuster, he\u2019s willing to do something drastic to promote Gorsuch.\n\nSo what exactly is the nuclear option?\n\nThough it is sometimes referred to as a rule change, it\u2019s actually a change in Senate precedent.\n\nThe Senate currently has 44 rules. But altering those rules requires 67 votes. So with only 52 Republican senators, McConnell can\u2019t switch Senate rules. But he could set a new precedent.\n\nSee, the Senate also operates on precedent \u2013 a set of parliamentary criterion based on things that happened before. So, if you can\u2019t change the rules, perhaps establish a new precedent.\n\nDemocrats opened Pandora\u2019s Box on the nuclear option in November 2013 when they held the majority in the Senate. Senate Democrats didn\u2019t have 67 votes to change the Senate rules. But then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., enacted a new precedent of how many votes are necessary to extinguish filibusters on executive branch nominees except Supreme Court picks.\n\nAs we say, it is a numbers game. Reid had the numbers \u2013 a simple majority \u2013 to form a new precedent for those types of nominees.\n\nIt\u2019s a numbers game today, too. McConnell has 52 Republicans on his side. He could conceivably launch the nuclear option to constitute a new precedent to require just a simple majority to end filibusters of Supreme Court nominees \u2013 rather than the old bar of 60 votes. All McConnell needs are 51 Republicans to go along to with his gambit.\n\nMcConnell must be sure he has at least 51 of his 52 members willing to do the deed. Fifty yeas would suffice if Vice President Pence comes round to break the tie. It\u2019s unclear if McConnell has those votes. Some Republican senators are leery of re-opening Pandora\u2019s Box to authorize a new precedent. Senators are generally reluctant to change the Senate\u2019s long-standing traditions for a quick-fix today.\n\nFox News is told by multiple, senior Republican sources that should the Democrats not help Republicans count to 60 on Gorsuch, McConnell has the votes on his side to deploy the nuclear option. It\u2019s likely this will all go down on Thursday with a prospective confirmation vote on Friday evening.\n\nIt likely looks like this:\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee meets Monday to vote the Gorsuch nomination out of committee and dispatch it to the floor. Actual debate on Gorsuch begins in the Senate on Tuesday. Also on Tuesday, McConnell files a \u201ccloture petition\u201d to end debate on Gorsuch. By rule, cloture petitions require an intervening day before they\u2019re \u201cripe\u201d for a vote. So a vote to end debate on Gorsuch likely comes Thursday.\n\nLet\u2019s say Gorsuch fails to get 60 votes to end the filibuster Thursday. That\u2019s where McConnell trips the nuclear wire. From a procedural standpoint, the Senate must be in what\u2019s called a \u201cnon-debatable\u201d posture. In other words, a failed cloture vote is just that. There\u2019s no more debate. This parliamentary cul-de-sac is important because it\u2019s practically the only procedural locus where McConnell could initiate the nuclear option. Any other parliamentary disposition prevents McConnell from going nuclear. But this unique place \u2013 following a failed cloture vote \u2013 is practically throbbing with political isotopes.\n\nMcConnell could switch his vote to halt debate so he winds up on the \u201cprevailing side\u201d of the cloture vote. In other words, the Democrats won. The \u201cnay\u201d side prevailed. By briefly siding with the Democrats since they won that round, grants McConnell the right to demand a revote on that same issue.\n\nThis is where McConnell lights the fuse.\n\nAll McConnell must do is make a point of order that the Senate only needs a simple majority (51 votes) to end debate on a Supreme Court nominee. Naturally, whichever GOP senator is presiding over the chamber would rule against McConnell. After all, that\u2019s not the precedent. But McConnell would then appeal that ruling, forcing another vote. At that stage, the Senate is voting to sustain the ruling of the presiding officer. But if 51 senators vote no, the Senate has rebuked the chair\u2019s ruling and set a new precedent. Only 51 yeas are then necessary to break a filibuster on a Supreme Court nominee.\n\nThat is the nuclear option.\n\nMcConnell could summon Pence to preside over the Senate should he have two defectors on his side. Bizarrely, it\u2019s possible Pence could rule against McConnell\u2019s point of order \u2013 adhering to Senate precedent. But Pence could then vote to break a 50-50 tie to establish a new precedent should it come to that.\n\nThe Senate would then re-take the failed cloture vote on Gorsuch. Presumably Gorsuch secures 51 yeas to end debate. And then Democrats, fuming at the GOP\u2019s political artifice, would require the Senate to burn off 30 hours before a final vote to confirm Gorsuch on Friday night. The Senate usually grants opponents of an issue 30 hours of debate once the body votes to end debate.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/03/what-is-nuclear-option-roadmap-to-how-gorsuch-confirmation-could-play-out.html"}, {"text": "RNC Chair Ronna Romney McDaniel on Monday called on Democrats to denounce DNC Chair Tom Perez, after he said President Trump \u201cdidn\u2019t win the election\u201d and suggested the Republican Party doesn\u2019t care about voters.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s deeply concerning to see the head of the Democrat Party continue to try to delegitimize this election, not only President Trump who did win this election \u2013 by a lot \u2013 but also the voters,\u201d McDaniel said on \u201cFox and Friends.\u201d\n\nPerez made the remarks Friday night at a rally hosted by the New Jersey Working Families Alliance.\n\nDNC'S PEREZ SAYS TRUMP A BULLY, 'DIDN'T WIN ELECTION'\n\n\u201cDonald Trump, you don\u2019t stand for our values, that\u2019s what they said.

There is an I-told-you-so flavor to what they say and write every time he ticks downward in another poll.\n\nObviously, a president new to politics has made mistakes and missteps.

Bush in his final year.\n\nDespite this precedent, Senate Democrats and their special interest groups continued to demand\u2014even after the election\u2014that \u201cwe need nine.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s become abundantly clear that if the Democrats are willing to filibuster somebody with the credentials, judicial temperament and independence of Judge Gorsuch, it\u2019s obvious they would filibuster anybody.\n\nOver the course of the past year I said that if I remained chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 2017, we\u2019d move forward with a hearing for the Supreme Court nominee regardless of who was elected president.\n\nTo the surprise of many Senate Democrats, in November the American people elected Donald Trump. Suddenly we need nine became a hypocritical eight is enough, just like it was in 1992 and 2007.\n\nNow, nearly nine months after candidate Trump publicly released the first of two lists of very capable possible Supreme Court nominees, the full Senate begins consideration of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to be the 113th justice of the United States Supreme Court, starting with Monday\u2019s vote in the Judiciary Committee which I chair.\n\nAnybody watching the nomination hearing for Judge Gorsuch before the Senate Judiciary Committee witnessed a brilliant presentation showcasing his command of the law, his record of independence, his strong sense of humility, and his focus on following the Constitution instead of prejudging cases or promising results.\n\nFrom beginning to end, partisans and non-partisans alike sang his praises. It started the first day of the hearing when President Obama\u2019s former Solicitor General introduced Judge Gorsuch. For anybody questioning this nominee\u2019s credentials, Democrat or Republican, I\u2019d invite them to read General Neal Katyal\u2019s introduction. It showed genuine appreciation for Judge Gorsuch himself and his approach to the law.\n\nJudge Gorsuch\u2019s testimony, and the testimony of witnesses who actually know him, creates a dilemma for anybody desperately searching for a reason to vote oppose his nomination. Because if you\u2019re voting on qualifications and not politics, it\u2019s an easy yes.\n\nDespite the \u201cwe need nine\u201d mantra from last year, we\u2019ve already heard that Senator Schumer will lead a Democratic filibuster apparently based on hollow reasons that Judge Gorsuch has already answered. He\u2019s not mainstream. He\u2019s not independent. He\u2019s not telling us how he\u2019ll vote. And, now, because none of those accusations will stick, the Democrats have resorted to attacking his supporters. These same senators don\u2019t like talking about the groups on the left who are attacking the nominee, misrepresenting his record and threatening to primary any Democrat who makes an independent decision.\n\nIt\u2019s become abundantly clear that if the Democrats are willing to filibuster somebody with the credentials, judicial temperament and independence of Judge Gorsuch, it\u2019s obvious they would filibuster anybody.\n\nIf we\u2019re ever going to get past the well Senator Schumer poisoned when he led the Democrats to \u201cchange the ground rules\u201d in 2001 and systematically filibuster circuit court nominees for the first time in our nation\u2019s history, we\u2019re going to need to dig a new well.

The GOP is using a largely unknown but highly effective legislative tool that allows a simple majority in the House and Senate to overturn regulations that often took years to craft.\n\nIndeed, with an overhaul of health insurance going off the rails, Republicans are left pointing to the repeal of various government regulations as their crowning legislative achievement after some 70 days at work. The GOP casts the effort as overturning eight years of excessive government regulation and boosting business.\n\n\"These things will help get people back to work, and after years of sluggish growth, give a real boost to our economy,\" Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said this past week.\n\nThe president has signed eight resolutions revoking regulations issued during the final months of Democrat Barack Obama's presidency. Six resolutions have cleared Congress and are awaiting the president's signature. A couple dozen more are on deck, with last Thursday the deadline for filing more.\n\nTrump has signed measures eliminating requirements that mining and oil companies report payments made to foreign governments. The rule was designed to shine a light on how much money foreign governments received for their nation's resources, thus reducing the prospect of corruption.\n\nHe also signed another measure reversing an Obama plan to prevent coal mining debris from being dumped into nearby streams.\n\n\"These actions from Congress and the president are giving hope to businesses that they haven't had in a long time,\" said Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.\n\nDemocratic Leader Nancy Pelosi scoffed at the notion that Republicans were accomplishing anything with the regulatory repeals \"because they do not meet the needs of the American people.\"\n\n\"They are about trickle-down. Their life is about giving more money to the high-end and to corporate interests, maybe it will trickle down, that would be good, but if it doesn't, so be it, that's the free market,\" Pelosi said.\n\nRobert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, said the regulatory repeals Congress pushed through will actually damage the economy more than it helps. He said that eliminating the stream protection rule may help coal companies, but it hurts other companies that stand to gain through healthier streams and water supplies.\n\n\"If you look across the terrain of the Congressional Review Act resolutions, they are repeals of public measures that help, consumers, workers and the environment in very substantial ways, but are opposed by powerful corporate interests,\" Weissman said. \"The Republicans driving these measures are paying back their corporate benefactors at the expense of the public.\"\n\nIn some cases, the regulatory repeal efforts have had nothing to do with the economy, but addressed hot-button social issues that so often dominate Washington politics.\n\nRepublicans blocked a Social Security Administration rule that would have prevented tens of thousands of mentally disabled beneficiaries from being able to purchase a firearm. The rule was targeted specifically at those beneficiaries with mental disorders who have a third party manage their financial benefits, and it was opposed by the NRA and several advocacy groups for the disabled.\n\nThe latest repeal effort clearing both chambers required Republicans to bring Vice President Mike Pence to the Capitol so he could cast the tie-breaking vote on the abortion issue. The scrapping of the Health and Human Services rule gave states the go-ahead to deny federal family planning money to Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers.\n\nOne of the more closely contested repeals would kill an online privacy regulation. Fifteen Republicans sided with Democrats in opposing the repeal, which Pelosi said would allow internet providers to sell personal information without a user's consent. \"You should be very, very scared,\" she said.\n\nThe ability of Congress to void regulations with a simple majority was created in 1996 when Congress passed the Congressional Review Act.\n\nIn the 20 years since, Congress was only able to use it once to repeal a regulation. Congress sent five repeal resolutions to Obama, but he vetoed each of them. Trump made clear early on that he would back the efforts of the GOP-led Congress.\n\n\"I will keep working with Congress, with every agency, and most importantly with the American people until we eliminate every unnecessary, harmful and job-killing regulation that we can find,\" Trump said this past week. \"We have a lot more coming.\"\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce has encouraged the regulatory rollbacks, weighing in with lawmakers on efforts affecting internet providers, federal contractors and energy companies. Neil Bradley, a senior vice president at the Chamber, acknowledges that it's hard to say how many jobs are created or saved through the repeal of one particular rule, but he says employers of all sizes tell the chamber government regulations are a top concern that makes it harder for them to flourish.\n\n\"Any time we can roll back these regulations is another step forward to restoring the economic growth that I think is the top priority of the American people,\" Bradley said.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/02/gop-congress-rolls-back-rules-on-hunting-broadband-privacy.html"}, {"text": "Kentucky Sen.

On the first form, filed days before Trump asked Flynn to resign as national security adviser for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about a conversation Flynn had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S., the retired Army lieutenant general omitted payments he received for three speeches to Russian companies.\n\nOne of the companies was RT, a media outlet funded by the Russian government. Documents released by a congressional committee show that Flynn was paid $45,000 for that appearance.\n\nThe other two companies were the Volga-Dnepr Group, a Russian air-cargo company; and Kaspersky Government Security Solutions, a U.S. subsidiary of a leading Russian cybersecurity firm.\n\nFlynn's lawyer Robert Kelner told the Associated Press the first filing included the speaking fees in bulk. He also noted that the initial filing was a draft and was not followed by consultations with federal ethics officials because Flynn left the administration just days after turning it in.\n\nIn addition to the speeches, Flynn earned more than $1.3 million for work for technology firms, political groups and government contractors as well as lobbying for a firm owned by a Turkish businessman.\n\nFlynn's recent financial history, made available Saturday by the White House, comes amid his effort to win immunity from congressional probers in exchange for his cooperation with official inquiries into contacts between Russia and Trump's campaign in 2016.\n\nThe disclosures detail Flynn's business and financial activities dating back to 2014. The filing includes the activities of Flynn Intel Group Inc., a consulting firm that he and partners set up in 2015. The company filed as a foreign agent last month with the Justice Department, acknowledging that its lobbying work last year likely benefited the government of Turkey even as Flynn was advising Trump's campaign.\n\nFlynn's ties to Russia have been scrutinized by the FBI and are under investigation by the House and Senate intelligence committees. Both committees are looking into Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election and any ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin.\n\nKelner said that Flynn's first filing normally would have been revised through a consultation between the White House counsel's office and the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.\n\n\"Because he resigned, that usual consultation process was suspended. When the White House contacted him this week, and asked him to complete the process, he did so,\" Kelner said, noting the second filing is the finalized version.\n\nAn OGE document obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request by The Associated Press showed that there were no written communications between the agency and Flynn's lawyers about his financial disclosure and ethics agreement between the November election and March 17.\n\nThe White House on Friday released scores of disclosures from Trump administration officials.\n\nFlynn declared last month in a filing with the Justice Department that his company's lobbying for a Dutch-based firm owned by a Turkish businessman \"could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.\" Flynn's client, Ekim Alptekin, told the AP that the decision to file as a foreign agent had come under pressure from Justice Department officials.\n\nThe Daily Caller reported Friday that Justice Department officials contacted Flynn on Nov. 30. A document obtained by the media site under the Freedom of Information Act quoted Justice Department concern about a pre-election op-ed that Flynn authored stressing Turkish government aims and \"potential ties between Lt. Gen. Flynn and others who might be acting on behalf of the government of Turkey.\"\n\nFlynn reported that he served as a consultant for the FBI and received more than $5,000 in compensation from the bureau. Kelner said the FBI compensation was for a speaking event in 2015 and training Flynn provided to the bureau.\n\nFlynn reported between $750,000 and $1.5 million in mortgage debt related to his personal home and a rental property. He also had a line of credit between $15,000 and $50,000, the filing shows.\n\nIn a separate filing to the Justice Department last month, Flynn and his business, Flynn Intel Group Inc., detailed $530,000 worth of lobbying work for Inovo BV, the Turkish firm owned by Alptekin. On his new disclosure, Flynn said only that he personally earned compensation in excess of $5,000 from Inovo BV.\n\nAs part of his firm's lobbying, Alptekin invited Flynn last September to meet at a New York hotel with a group that included Turkey's foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and energy minister Berat Albayrak, son-in-law of Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Another participant, former CIA director James Woolsey, said the group discussed a plan for the covert removal of a political foe of Erdogan's, a Muslim cleric based in Pennsylvania. Flynn acknowledged he attended the meeting, but a Flynn spokesman said Woolsey's claim was false and that \"no such discussion occurred.\"\n\nFlynn's new disclosure also details a $10,000 payment for a speech in New York last October paid by Ibrahim Kurtulus, a New York financial adviser who is also listed as an advisory board member for the Turkish American National Steering Committee. The group's website says it aims to \"promote and amplify a unified Turkish American voice on issues that affect the Turkish American community and Unites States.\"\n\nBut Kelner said Saturday that the speech paid by Kurtulus was made to an audience of Korean-Americans. Kurtulus did not immediately reply to phone calls by the AP to several numbers associated with him in New York.\n\nThe new disclosure also details several Flynn speeches for conservative groups and think tanks.

(AP) \u2014 A federal judge has rejected President Donald Trump's free speech defense against a lawsuit accusing him of inciting violence against protesters at a campaign rally.\n\nTrump's lawyers sought to dismiss the lawsuit by three protesters who say they were roughed up by his supporters at a March 2016 rally in Louisville. Trump's lawyers contend that when the candidate said \"Get 'em out of here,\" he didn't intend for his supporters to use force.\n\nTwo women and a man say they were shoved and punched by audience members as Trump directed them from the podium. Much of it was captured on video and widely broadcast during the campaign, showing Trump pointing at the protesters and repeating \"get them out.\"\n\nJudge David J. Hale in Louisville ruled Friday that the suit against Trump, his campaign and three of his supporters can proceed.\n\nHale found ample facts supporting allegations that the protesters' injuries were a \"direct and proximate result\" of Trump's actions.\"It is plausible that Trump's direction to 'get 'em out of here' advocated the use of force,\" Hale wrote.\n\nPlaintiffs Kashiya Nwanguma, Molly Shah, and Henry Brousseau allege that they were physically attacked by several members of the audience, including Matthew Heimbach, Alvin Bamberger, and an unnamed defendant they have yet to be able to identify.\n\nBamberger later apologized to the Korean War Veterans Association, whose uniform he wore at the rally.

Which side possesses the most votes. After all, that\u2019s the essence of democracy.\n\nThe Founders feared direct democracy -- and various other forms of republican democracy. So they tempered the power of the majority.\n\nUnlike the House, the Senate was the deliberative body. There, the minority could often prevail -- entailing a supermajority to shut down filibusters.\n\nNeutralizing a Senate filibuster used to take 67 votes (two-thirds). The Senate dropped that to a three-fifths requirement in 1975. However, a two-thirds vote is still necessary to alter the Senate\u2019s rules.\n\nThis is why the numbers game is so important. It\u2019s clear that a majority of senators want to confirm Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch. But it\u2019s doubtful that a supermajority of 60 senators are willing to shut off debate on President Trump\u2019s nomination.\n\nThis brings us to the so-called \u201cnuclear option,\u201d a fundamental obliteration of the Senate\u2019s structure requiring a supermajority to overcome a threatened Democratic filibuster of Gorsuch.\n\nIt\u2019s unprecedented for the Senate to successfully filibuster a Supreme Court pick. Defeat a nominee on the floor? Yes. Look at what happened to President Reagan\u2019s nomination of Robert Bork for the high court in 1987. Bork scored a scant 42 yeas when 51 ayes were necessary for confirmation. Require a Supreme Court nominee to secure 60 votes to shut off the filibuster before confirmation? Well, that\u2019s a mixed bag.\n\nNeither of President Obama\u2019s selections for the court -- Justices Sonia Sotomayor nor Elena Kagan -- faced a \u201ccloture\u201d vote to end a filibuster. But the Senate confirmed both picks with supermajorities. Sotomayor secured 68 yeas. Kagan marshaled 63 yeas.\n\nHowever, when President George W. Bush tapped Justice Samuel Alito for the Supreme Court in 2006, Senate Democrats (then in the minority) demanded a cloture vote to end a filibuster. Alito scored 72 yeas on the procedural vote. The Senate then confirmed Alito, 58-42.\n\nThis is what riles Senate Republicans. The GOP sports only 52 members right now. Two Democrats have announced their support for Gorsuch: Sens. Joe Manchin, West Virginia, and Heidi Heitkamp (North Dakota.\n\nBoth are moderate Democrats in red states who face potentially brutal re-election campaigns next year. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., insists that if someone is going to sit on the High Court for life, they should command 60 votes on the Senate floor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a real, uphill climb to 60,\u201d Schumer predicted for Gorsuch.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most powerful court in the world,\u201d said Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa. \u201cIf you\u2019re seeking to be an associate justice on the Supreme Court, you ought to be able to rack up 60 votes. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unreasonable.\u201d\n\nRepublicans know they face a deficit to defy the Democrats\u2019 filibuster of Gorsuch. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is unwavering.\n\n\u201cWe are going to get Judge Gorsuch confirmed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will really be up to (Democrats) how the process to confirm goes moving forward.\u201d\n\nEmbedded in McConnell\u2019s remark is a gambit to deploy the \u201cnuclear option\u201d to confirm Gorsuch. After all, it\u2019s about the numbers. So if McConnell doesn\u2019t have the numbers, he\u2019s willing to do something drastic to promote Gorsuch.\n\n\u201cIf the nominee cannot get 60 votes, you don\u2019t change the rules,\u201d Schumer argued. \u201cYou change the nominee.\u201d\n\nThe 60-vote threshold is dubious for Supreme Court justices. All recent justices proved they could command 60 votes at some point in the process. But the ceiling for Gorsuch so far is at 54 votes.\n\nSo what exactly is the nuclear option?\n\nSchumer is wrong about one thing. The nuclear option is not a rules change. It\u2019s a change in Senate precedent. The chamber currently has 44 rules. But as mentioned before, altering those rules requires 67 votes, seven more votes than necessary to invoke cloture and stop debate on Gorsuch\u2019s nomination.\n\nSo with only 52 Republican senators, McConnell can\u2019t switch Senate rules. But he could set a new precedent.\n\nSee, the Senate also operates on precedent -- a set of parliamentary criterion based on things that happened before. So, if you can\u2019t change the rules, perhaps establish a new precedent.\n\nDemocrats opened Pandora\u2019s Box on the nuclear option in November 2013 when they held the majority in the Senate. Senate Democrats didn\u2019t have 67 votes to change the chamber rules. But then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, enacted a new precedent of how many votes are necessary to extinguish filibusters on executive branch nominees except Supreme Court picks.\n\nAs we say, it is a numbers game. Reid had the numbers -- a simple majority -- to form a new precedent for those types of nominees.\n\nIt\u2019s a numbers game today, too. McConnell has 52 Republicans on his side. He could conceivably launch the nuclear option to constitute a new precedent to require but a simple majority to end filibusters of Supreme Court nominees -- rather than the old bar of 60 votes. All McConnell needs are 51 Republicans to go along to with his gambit.\n\nMcConnell must be sure he has at least 51 of his 52 members willing to do the deed. Fifty yeas would suffice if Vice President Pence comes round to break the tie. It\u2019s unclear whether McConnell has those votes. Some Republican senators are leery of re-opening Pandora\u2019s Box to authorize a new precedent. Senators are generally reluctant to change the chamber\u2019s long-standing traditions for a quick-fix today.\n\nOne school of thought is that McConnell could let the issue percolate over the upcoming, two-week Easter and Passover recess. This could gin up support among Republicans or even let the Democrats marinate for a while about the consequences.\n\nBut Fox is told by multiple, senior Republican sources that should the Democrats not help Republicans count to 60 on Gorsuch, McConnell has the votes on his side to deploy the nuclear option. It\u2019s likely this will all go down on Thursday with a prospective confirmation vote on Friday.\n\nIt likely looks like this:\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee meets Monday to vote the Gorsuch nomination out of committee and dispatch it to the floor. Actual debate on Gorsuch begins in the Senate on Tuesday. Also on Tuesday, McConnell files a \u201ccloture petition\u201d to end debate on Gorsuch.\n\nBy rule, cloture petitions require an intervening day before they\u2019re \u201cripe\u201d for a vote. So a vote to end debate on Gorsuch likely comes Thursday.\n\nLet\u2019s say Gorsuch fails to get 60 votes to end the filibuster Thursday. That\u2019s where McConnell trips the nuclear wire. From a procedural standpoint, the Senate must be in what\u2019s called a \u201cnon-debatable\u201d posture.\n\nIn other words, a failed cloture vote is just that. There\u2019s no more debate. This parliamentary cul-de-sac is important because it\u2019s practically the only procedural locus in which McConnell could initiate the nuclear option. Any other parliamentary disposition prevents McConnell from going nuclear. But this unique place -- following a failed cloture vote -- is practically throbbing with political isotopes.\n\nMcConnell could switch his vote to halt debate so he winds up on the \u201cprevailing side\u201d of the cloture vote. In other words, the Democrats won. The \u201cnay\u201d side prevailed. By briefly siding with the Democrats since they won that round, grants McConnell the right to demand a revote on that same issue.\n\nThis is where McConnell lights the fuse.\n\nAll McConnell must do is make a point of order that the Senate needs only a simple majority (51 votes) to end debate on a Supreme Court nominee. Naturally, whichever GOP senator is presiding over the chamber would rule against McConnell. After all, that\u2019s not the precedent.\n\nBut McConnell would then appeal that ruling, forcing another vote. At that stage, the Senate is voting to sustain the ruling of the presiding officer. But if 51 senators vote no (remember, McConnell wants to establish a new precedent), the Senate has rebuked the chairman\u2019s ruling and set a new precedent. Only 51 yeas are then necessary to break a filibuster on a Supreme Court nominee.\n\nThat is the nuclear option.\n\nMcConnell could summon Pence to preside over the Senate should he have two defectors on his side. Bizarrely, it\u2019s possible Pence could rule against McConnell\u2019s point of order -- adhering to Senate precedent. But Pence could then vote to break a 50-50 tie to establish a new precedent should it come to that.\n\nThe Senate would then re-take the failed cloture vote on Gorsuch. Presumably Gorsuch secures 51 yeas to end debate. And then Democrats, fuming at the GOP\u2019s political artifice, would require the Senate to burn off 30 hours before a final vote to confirm Gorsuch on Friday night.\n\nThe Senate usually grants opponents of an issue 30 hours of debate once the chamber votes to end debate.\n\nPrepare for nuclear fallout.\n\nRepublicans will claim that Democrats opened Pandora\u2019s Box with their version of the nuclear option in 2013. Democrats will counter they had to because of Republican filibusters back then. Republicans will declare they had no other choice but the nuclear option because Democrats filibustered Gorsuch.\n\nDemocrats will contend it never should have come to this. The GOP should have granted President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland a hearing.\n\nRegardless, 51 votes will be the new precedent to break filibusters on Supreme Court picks. This is the nuclear option. It may be inevitable.

The report said her business alone is valued at more than $50 million.\n\nKushner, Trump's senior adviser, resigned from more than 260 entities and sold off 58 businesses or investments that lawyers identified as posing potential conflicts of interest, the documents show.\n\nBut his lawyers, in consultation with the Office of Government Ethics, determined that his real estate assets, many of them in New York City, are unlikely to pose the kinds of conflicts that would trigger a need to divest.\n\n\"The remaining conflicts, from a practical perspective, are pretty narrow and very manageable,\" said Jamie Gorelick, an attorney who has been working on the ethics agreements for Kushner and Ivanka Trump.\n\nKushner began selling off the most problematic pieces of his portfolio shortly after Trump won the election, and some of those business deals predate what is required to be captured in the financial disclosure forms.\n\nFor example, Kushner sold his stake in a Manhattan skyscraper to a trust his mother oversees. Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump and their three minor children have no financial interest in that trust, his lawyer said.

Cambridge was the main data provider for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who waged a bitter battle with Trump for the Republican nomination. Bannon's consulting firm pulled in more than $125,000 from Cambridge last year.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer described the business people who have joined the administration as \"very blessed and very successful,\" and said the disclosure forms will show that they have set aside \"a lot\" to go into public service.\n\nThe financial disclosures \u2014 required by law to be made public \u2014 give a snapshot of the employees' finances as they entered the White House.

Like the president himself, however, they retain a financial interest in many of them. Ivanka Trump agreed this week to become a federal employee and will file her own financial disclosure at a later date.\n\nKushner's disclosure shows he took on tens of millions of dollars of bank debt in 2015 and 2016, including liabilities with several international banks whose interests could come before the Trump administration.\n\nKushner has as much as $25 million in liabilities to Deutsche Bank, a prime lender to Kushner family real estate ventures as well as a major creditor for Trump Organization-branded real estate projects.

With that in mind, Reagan accelerated job growth by drastically cutting taxes. During the Contract with America we created jobs by greatly reducing the capital gains tax.\n\nSo, for the Trump administration, Republicans should stop saying we want to reform the tax system. Reforming will not create jobs on its own. We want to cut taxes and reform the system.\n\nWe should stop trying to achieve revenue neutrality and instead focus on deficit neutrality. The difference is enormous and decisive for economic growth and job creation. Revenue neutrality inevitably leads to taxes being raised to pay for taxes being cut. In the short run the tax increases always hurt more than the tax cuts help.\n\nBut there are six more steps lawmakers can take to create space for tax cuts that will drive job creation.\n\nFirst, Congress must score economic growth from Obama\u2019s finish line. The psychology of Trump\u2019s election has created an upsurge in economic activity. Businesses are focused and hopeful about the president\u2019s aggressive stance on deregulation, pro-American trade policy, and relentless focus on investment.\n\nConsider the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index, which jumped to 125.6 points this month \u2013 the highest confidence has been 17 years. The Conference Board CEO Business Conditions Survey increased from 17 points last quarter to 60 points this quarter. The CEO Short Term Forecast hiked from 25 points to 60 points, while General CEO Confidence jumped from 50 points to 65 points.\n\nThe economy clearly has momentum. Projected over the next ten years, the new Trump economy will generate more jobs and more income than the Obama economy. Extra federal revenue from this growth should be set aside to offset a big tax cut bill. The Republicans should insist on using the last Obama projected revenue as the baseline for counting new growth for this offset. Liberal bureaucrats will try to create a new baseline absorbing the higher revenue to minimize the size of the tax cut. They should be stopped.\n\nSecond, unused federal assets should be leased or sold. This will generate non-tax revenue which could offset the cost of some of the tax cuts. Aggressive leasing of oil, gas and mineral rights combined with selling federal housing and office stock currently being mismanaged could generate billions to support tax cuts.\n\nThird, cut spending by cutting through red tape, bureaucracy, waste, and fraud. Establishing work requirements for programs that currently promote dependency will save billions. Substantial fraud exists in our food stamps, disabilities, and welfare programs. There is an estimated $110 billion in fraud in Medicare and Medicaid alone. If we adopted an American Express-Visa-Master Card-like anti-fraud system, we could likely save more than $100 billion a year \u2013 that\u2019s $1 trillion over a decade, plus the savings in interest on money we would no longer have to borrow. We should be able to find another $50 billion in tax cuts a year just from this zone.\n\nFourth, creating pro-American trade policies will clearly have positive impact on growth. This growth might not be huge statistically, but even an increase of two-tenths of 1 percent can yield billions over a decade that could be leveraged for tax cuts.\n\nFifth, cut taxes that have a widely agreed upon positive impact on revenue. Capital gains tax cuts have consistently yielded more federal revenue than people expected. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan once testified that setting the capital gains tax to zero would generate the most revenue due to new economic growth. Repatriation of the money currently locked up overseas and adoption of a territorial tax system would yield revenue from substantial growth. And repealing the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act would dramatically increase the number of Americans selling American goods and services overseas.\n\nSixth, we should have a bias for pro-growth tax reforms that have compounding, revenue generating effects. Speaker Paul Ryan's proposal for a border transfer tax will increase American manufacturing jobs. It will also generate revenue paid for by foreign importers. Because we are still the world's largest economy, the Ryan border transfer tax will incentivize foreign manufacturers to open factories in America. The result will be even more economic growth and future government revenue to pay for tax cuts.\n\nThis is the kind of dynamic, pro-growth, pro-jobs tax cut and reform bill that will attract lawmakers from both sides, be very popular, and create the economic and job growth we so badly need.\n\nNewt Gingrich is a Fox News contributor.

Grassley wants to know why the FBI might seek evidence tying Trump to Russia from a firm whose own hands may not be clean.\n\n\u201cThe issue is of particular concern to the Senate Judiciary Committee given that when Fusion GPS reportedly was acting as an unregistered agent of Russian interests, it appears to have been simultaneously overseeing the creation of the unsubstantiated dossier of allegations of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians,\u201d Grassley said in a letter to the Department of Justice.\n\nThe dossier, containing salacious allegations pointing to collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow, was leaked to the media in January, prompting Trump to deny its contents. It later emerged that the FBI had hired Steele to dig into Trump\u2019s purported Russia links even as Russian operatives hired Fusion GPS for a separate high profile political battle.\n\nAccording to a complaint filed with the Justice Department, Fusion GPS headed the pro-Russia campaign to kill the Global Magnitsky Act, which imposes sanctions on Russians designated as human rights abusers. This was the same time, Grassley said, that the FBI was relying on the anti-Trump dossier and the man who produced it for Fusion to further its investigation into Trump and his Russian ties.\n\nIt is \u201cunclear whether the FBI was aware of the company\u2019s pro-Russia activities\u201d when the FBI reportedly hired its researcher to further the research on Trump and \u201c\u2026when evaluating the credibility of the dossier the company helped create,\u201d Grassley said.\n\nThe Global Magnitsky Act, which is named for an attorney who died while in the custody of the Russian government after he accused the Russian government and organized crime of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from Hermitage Capital Management.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department in 2013 opened a case against the Russian-owned Prevezon Holdings, which had purchased real estate in New York with the stolen funds, according to the Justice Department\u2019s complaint.\n\nPrevezon Holdings, backed by the Kremlin, launched a campaign to undermine the Magnitsky Act, Grassley said, citing a 2016 complaint by Hermitage CEO William Browder.\n\nFusion GPS was hired to generate negative press coverage on the Russians\u2019 behalf, Grassley said. And Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian immigrant who has reportedly acknowledged being a Russian counterintelligence officer, lobbied congressional staffers to repeal the Magnitsky Act itself, Grassley said.\n\n\u201cIt is particularly disturbing that Mr. Akhmetshin and Fusion GPS were working together on this pro-Russia lobbying effort in 2016 in light of Mr. Akhmetshin\u2019s history and reputation,\u201d Grassley said, citing reports Akhmetshin worked for the GRU, Russia's foreign intelligence agency and allegedly specializes in \u201csubversive political influence operations often involving disinformation and propaganda.\u201d\n\nThe relationship between Fusion GPS and Akhmetshin casts further doubt on the dossier used against Trump, Grassley said.\n\n\u201cFusion GPS is the company behind the creation of the unsubstantiated dossier alleging a conspiracy between President Trump and Russia,\u201d Grassley wrote in the letter. \u201cIt is highly troubling that Fusion GPS appears to have been working with someone with ties to Russian intelligence \u2013let alone someone alleged to have conducted political disinformation campaigns\u2013 as part of a pro-Russia lobbying effort while also simultaneously overseeing the creation of the Trump/Russia dossier.\u201d\n\nFusion GPS maintained in a statement to Fox News Friday that it is not required to register as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, because it partnered with a U.S. law firm to ensure compliance with the law. The company did not respond to inquiries about the dossier, its relationship to Russia or any business dealings with the FBI.\n\nThe FBI declined comment on its relationship to Fusion GPS, Christopher Steele or Grassley\u2019s inquiry.\n\nGrassley\u2019s committee has launched a separate probe into allegations the FBI wrongly included political opposition research from Trump\u2019s opponents in its probe, and then paid the author of that controversial report, Steele, to consult on its investigation.\n\nMalia Zimmerman is an award-winning investigative reporter focusing on crime, homeland security, illegal immigration crime, terrorism and political corruption.

In fact, not so long ago, the LGBT community probably would have seen such inquiries as an invasion of privacy.\n\nBut during the Obama era, a number of federal agencies, as well as congressional Democrats, wanted to add such questions. And a preliminary draft for the 2020 Census released earlier this week suggested there might be some.\n\nThe final draft sent to Congress from the Census Bureau did not feature such questions. John Thompson, head of the Census Bureau\u2014which is part of the Department of Commerce--explained in a letter that they\u2019d investigated if there was a \u201clegislative mandate\u201d to collect such data and determined there was \u201cno federal data need to change the planned census.\u201d\n\nThis started a firestorm of protest.\n\nMore than 60 congressional Democrats\u2014led by Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Representatives Ra\u00fal Grijalva of Arizona and Adam Schiff of California\u2014sent a letter to the Trump administration insisting the census look into how many LGBT people are in the United States.\n\nThe Democratic lawmakers claim that there\u2019s little known \u201cabout the social and economic circumstances of the LGBT population\u201d and that they\u2019re \u201cat greater risk of being victimized by violence,\u201d among other things.

The Freedom Caucus blames him for the failure to repeal and replace Obamacare, and for embracing the now mainstream position that the country expects all citizens to have access to healthcare. Like John Boehner before him, House Speaker Ryan has failed the litmus tests of the far right; they want him gone.\n\nPresident Trump may also wonder whether Ryan is the right man to push his agenda through Congress.

Austin Bieren, of Umatilla, Oregon, died March 28, reportedly of natural causes. A member of the 21st Space Wing at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado, he had been deployed to northern Syria.\n\nSpeaking at the Military Reporters and Editors Association conference near Washington, D.C., Air Force Gen. John Hyten said it is far from unusual for space troops to be present in hot combat zones.\n\n\"It's one of the interesting things that's very misunderstood in our country, is that if you're conducting a military operation anywhere in the world -- anywhere in the world, space is fundamental to the execution of that military operation,\" he said. \"I was the director of Space Forces [for Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom] in 2006 in Central Command. And when I was director of Space Forces, at that time, guess where I was -- I was in Iraq, Afghanistan, all through the Middle East.\"\n\nThe little-reported activities of U.S. Space Command and service-specific counterparts focus on satellite communications and activities, and information of tactical value to troops downrange, including satellite-based intelligence, weather and missile-warning systems.\n\nHyten said during the fighting in Fallujah in the early 2000s, there was a joint space support team, commanded by a Marine Corps lieutenant colonel and staffed with airmen and soldiers, who brought space capabilities to bear for Marines in combat.\n\n\"I can't tell you what the airman specifically was doing in Syria, but anywhere we have military operations, you will find space people deployed,\" Hyten said. \"In the Army divisions, in the Army [brigade combat teams], in any ground maneuver unit, you'll find space people.\"\n\nThe perceived significance of space capability to the fight is underscored by the relative paucity of American military personnel in Syria.\n\nThere's a Pentagon-imposed troop cap of just over 500 troops, although the number of personnel in country is actually roughly 900, due to the authority of commanders on the ground to make temporary exceptions. Other personnel on the ground include advise-and-assist forces and special operations troops, among others.\n\n\"It's tragic that we lost that young man in kind of a strange way for a 25-year-old, but nonetheless space is embedded in everything we do,\" Hyten said. \"So anywhere you have American military people, you're going to have space.\"\n\n-- Hope Hodge Seck can be reached at hope.seck@military.com.

It\u2019s a big deal and potentially part of a high-stakes gambit by the new administration to remake the American economy.\n\nAnd in Bizarro World that story, pro and con, is being hotly debated by the public, the press and elected officials.\n\nBack here on Earth, though, you know exactly what we\u2019re talking about today \u2013 and it sure as shootin\u2019 ain\u2019t steel dumping.\n\nJust seven times in the 70 days of the still-young Trump administration has this political note lead with news or analysis about the investigation and counter-investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nNeedless to say, other news sources have taken a somewhat different approach. Nearly every day of the Trump Era thus far has featured some kind of Russia story, and often for days at a time it has been the dominant story.\n\nWe haven\u2019t devoted that much time to the discussion ourselves, however, because it is mostly a waste of time.\n\nEither investigators from Congress and the FBI will reveal inappropriate relations between Trump\u2019s campaign and the Kremlin; or those same investigators will find that members of the intelligence community were essentially framing Team Trump to take the rap.\n\nThere may be some shades of gray in there, but it pretty well has to be closer to one of those things or the other.\n\nUntil we know which it is, the fevered, frothy shouting about the subject is mostly pointless. Washington loves processed stories almost as much as it loves cloak-and-dagger intrigue with secret sources. So, this story has it all.\n\nAdd in the fact that the subject matter delegitimizes a president hated by many in this city, and you have an irresistible storyline.\n\nThe topic being discussed today other than Trump\u2019s popular policies on trade is another outburst from the president\u2019s former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.\n\nFlynn, who had been mostly quiet since Trump fired him for lying about his contacts with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., remerged on Thursday with a request for immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony.\n\nOh, brother\u2026\n\nApparently unable to resist stoking the fires further, Trump announced that Flynn was right to seek immunity to avoid what the president called a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d Now the problem there, is that Trump\u2019s government is the one hunting witches in his telling.\n\nFolks generally frown on the president trying to discredit criminal investigations while they are taking place.\n\nOnly Flynn and a handful of folks know whether he has any substance or interest to say. He may be looking for attention or for a way to get some leverage against either investigators or, perhaps, the president who fired him. It at least got the president to denounce the investigation.\n\nBut again, process not substance dominates the news.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump successfully exploited what we then dubbed \u201ccontroversy kiting.\u201d When the charges for a controversy would come due, Trump would write another draft on the bank of media outrage.\n\nJust at the moment when it looked like the press pack had finally closed in on the Republican frontrunner-cum-nominee, Trump would kick up an even more outrageous and irresistible controversy and the hounds would have to follow their noses.\n\nWhat works in a campaign often fails in governance, and boy howdy is that the case now.\n\nBy almost all accounts, Trump\u2019s White House is a hot mess, riven by palace intrigues and turf wars. And that may help explain why the administration failed to do what it promised and move swiftly on from the TrumpCare bust of a week ago.\n\nBut how is an administration supposed to find its footing if the boss is courting new controversies almost every day?\n\nThe major agonies of this week \u2013 the excruciating explanation of House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes\u2019 sources as well as Flynn\u2019s sudden and somewhat baffling re-emergence \u2013 are both to some degree, Trump\u2019s fault.\n\nNunes, and now we know, White House staffers were at least partly trying to back up Trump\u2019s claims of \u201cwiretapping\u201d by former President Barack Obama. Trump issued his accusations in an apparent fit of pique following Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 recusal from the Russia investigation.\n\nAnd on Flynn, Trump was warned by people around him about the retired general from the very beginning of their relationship. And certainly those within Trump\u2019s inner circle gave stark warnings about Flynn before Trump tapped him to be national security adviser. He was certainly warned.\n\nBut Trump plowed ahead anyway. And at the end of week 10, has nothing but heartache to show for it.\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: A REPUBLIC, NOT A DEMOCRACY\n\n\u201cIn a society under the forms of which the stronger faction can readily unite and oppress the weaker, anarchy may as truly be said to reign as in a state of nature, where the weaker individual is not secured against the violence of the stronger\u2026\u201d \u2013 Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 51\n\nTIME OUT: THESE (TINY) ARMS TO HOLD YOU\n\nThe Guardian: \u201cIt made its name by terrorising Earth at the end of the Late Cretaceous, but Tyrannosaurus rex had a sensitive side too, researchers have found. The fearsome carnivore, which stood 20 feet tall and ripped its prey to shreds with dagger-like teeth, had a snout as sensitive to touch as human fingertips, say scientists. T rex and other tyrannosaurs would have used their tactile noses to explore their surroundings, build nests, and carefully pick up fragile eggs and baby offspring. But the snout is thought to have served another purpose. Experts believe that males and females rubbed their sensitive faces together in a prehistoric form of foreplay.\u201d\n\n\n\nFlag on the play? - Email us at\n\nHALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with\n\nyour tips, comments or questions.\n\nREPORT: SENATE INTEL DECLINES FLYNN IMMUNITY OFFER\n\nThe Hill: \u201cThe Senate Intelligence Committee has turned down former national security adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s request for immunity in exchange for his testimony in the panel\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election \u2014 at least for now. The committee is not receptive to the offer \u201cat this time,\u201d according to NBC's Kasie Hunt. The panel's investigation into Russian interference in the election is ongoing, and the decision does not necessarily rule out such a deal in the future. Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) earlier in the week strongly implied that Flynn would be a potential witness before the committee \u2014 telling reporters that \u2018you would think less of us\u2019 if the committee had not talked with him.

Devin Nunes, R-Calif, misled Lake on where Nunes got his sourcing on Trump Intel case. Bloomberg: \u201cLast week, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Devin Nunes, announced dozens of intelligence reports that inappropriately included details on President Donald Trump's transition. This week, he told me that his source for that information was an intelligence official, not a White House staffer. It turns out, he misled me. The New York Times reported Thursday that Nunes had two sources, and both worked for the White House\u2026The chairman told me Thursday that elements of the Times story were inaccurate. But he acknowledged: \u2018I did use the White House to help to confirm what I already knew from other sources.\u2019 This is a body blow for Nunes, who presented his findings last week as if they were surprising to the White House.\u201d\n\nTWO DOWN, SIX TO GO: MANCHIN, HEITKAMP TO BACK GORSUCH\n\nFox News: \u201cSens.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., top Democrat on the House intelligence panel, on Friday called the idea a \u201cgrave and momentous step,\u201d and one that apparently cannot be considered quite yet.\n\n\"[A]s with any investigation -- and particularly one that grows in severity and magnitude by the day -- there is still much work and many more witnesses and documents to obtain before any immunity request from any witness can be considered,\u201d he said. He added that the committee will discuss it with Senate colleagues and the Justice Department.\n\nThat was after President Trump said on Twitter that Flynn was right to seek immunity, tweeting that he was being targeted by a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d of \u201chistoric proportion.\u201d\n\n\"He should go up there and he should testify,\" White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said at Friday's press briefing.\n\nAttorney Robert Kelner also said Thursday that Flynn is operating in a \u201chighly politicized, witch hunt environment.\u201d He said Flynn \u201ccertainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit.\u201d\n\nCongress generally is skeptical toward granting immunity to committee witnesses and often defers to the Justice Department if there is a potential for criminal prosecution. Committees can grant an immunity order, which normally requires a two-thirds vote after prior approval from the Justice Department.\n\nCongressional committees have obtained some 300 immunity orders since Congress passed an immunity law in 1970, many of which were tied to a probe into the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nDuring the Obama administration, former IRS official Lois Lerner sought immunity for her testimony to Congress, which was investigating how she and other officials scrutinized conservative groups. The committee declined to grant her request. She was still called to testify at a hearing, where she repeatedly invoked her Fifth Amendment right to protect herself against self-incrimination.\n\nFlynn\u2019s connections to Russia are being looked at by the FBI and form part of the Russia probe by the House and Senate intelligence committees.\n\nFlynn resigned in February after media reports showed he misled Vice President Mike Pence about a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador during the transition period.\n\nTrump and allied Republicans, though, say a bigger problem is the leaking of sensitive information and potential surveillance of Trump associates under the prior administration. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes says he\u2019s learned some Trump team communications were incidentally collected during the transition \u2013 information he apparently found out with help from White House aides, a detail that has only fueled Democratic complaints.\n\nFox News\u2019 Chad Pergram and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/31/top-dem-pushes-back-on-flynn-immunity-as-trump-urges-testimony.html"}, {"text": "The U.S. intelligence official who \u201cunmasked,\u201d or exposed, the names of multiple private citizens affiliated with the Trump team is someone \u201cvery well known, very high up, very senior in the intelligence world,\u201d a source told Fox News on Friday.\n\nIntelligence and House sources with direct knowledge of the disclosure of classified names told Fox News that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., now knows who is responsible -- and that person is not in the FBI.\n\nFor a private citizen to be \u201cunmasked,\u201d or named, in an intelligence report is extremely rare. Typically, the American is a suspect in a crime, is in danger or has to be named to explain the context of the report.\n\n\u201cThe main issue in this case, is not only the unmasking of these names of private citizens, but the spreading of these names for political purposes that have nothing to do with national security or an investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the U.S. election,\u201d a congressional source close to the investigation told Fox News.\n\nThe unmasking of Americans whose communications apparently were caught up in surveillance under the Obama administration is a key part of an investigation being led by Nunes, who has come under fire from Democrats for focusing on that aspect.\n\nNunes has known about the unmasking controversy since January, when two sources in the intelligence community approached him. The sources told Nunes who was responsible and at least one of the Trump team names that was unmasked. They also gave him serial numbers of reports that documented the activity.\n\nThis was long before Trump sent out his now-infamous March 4 tweets claiming then-President Barack Obama \u201cwiretapped\u201d Trump Tower during the 2016 election.\n\nNunes had asked intelligence agencies to see the reports in question, but was stonewalled.\n\nHe eventually was able to view them, but there was only one safe place to see the documents without compromising the sources\u2019 identities -- the old executive office building on White House grounds, which has a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) required to view classified or top secret reports. The White House did not tell Nunes about the existence of the intelligence reports, but did help him gain access to the documents at his request, the source said.\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, is urging Nunes and his colleagues to keep pursuing what improper surveillance and leaks may have occurred before Trump took office. They\u2019ve been emboldened in the wake of March 2 comments from former Obama administration official Evelyn Farkas, who on MSNBC suggested her former colleagues tried to gather material on Trump team contacts with Russia.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Friday her comments and other reports raise \u201cserious\u201d concerns about whether there was an \u201corganized and widespread effort by the Obama administration to use and leak highly sensitive intelligence information for political purposes.\u201d\n\n\u201cDr. Farkas\u2019 admissions alone are devastating,\u201d he said.\n\nFarkas parted ways with the White House in 2015 and defended herself on Twitter, saying she didn\u2019t personally \u201cgive anybody anything except advice\u201d on Russia information and wanted Congress to ask for facts.\n\nThe communications collected from Trump team associates apparently were picked up during surveillance of foreign targets. But an intelligence source familiar with those targets said they were spied on long before Trump became the GOP presidential nominee in mid-July.\n\nIn addition, citizens affiliated with Trump\u2019s team who were unmasked were not associated with any intelligence about Russia or other foreign intelligence, sources confirmed. The initial unmasking led to other surveillance, which led to other private citizens being wrongly unmasked, sources said.\n\n\"Unmasking is not unprecedented, but unmasking for political purposes ... specifically of Trump transition team members ... is highly suspect and questionable,\u201d an intelligence source told Fox News. \u201cOpposition by some in the intelligence agencies who were very connected to the Obama and Clinton teams was strong. After Trump was elected, they decided they were going to ruin his presidency by picking them off one by one.\"\n\nNunes first revealed on March 22 in a press conference that the U.S. intelligence community \u201cincidentally collected\u201d information on Trump\u2019s transition team, putting the information and names into various intelligence reports. His committee had been investigating whether Russia interfered in the U.S. election as well as how names of private citizens from these reports were leaked.\n\nHouse Intelligence Ranking Member Adam Schiff, D-Calif., criticized Nunes for his handling of the investigation, claiming he should never have briefed Trump. Nunes apologized the following day, but said he briefed the president because the information he found was not related to Russia.\n\nThe minority members on the House Intelligence Committee were expected to visit a National Security Agency facility on Friday to view the same reports Nunes has seen, an intelligence source told Fox News.\n\nMalia Zimmerman is an award-winning investigative reporter focusing on crime, homeland security, illegal immigration crime, terrorism and political corruption.

Col. R. Arron Lummer, chief of Awards and Decorations Branch, the Adjutant General Directorate, U.S. Army Human Resources Command, said in a March 28 press release.\n\n\"Soldiers were not appropriately recognized with the awards system as it was, so this change across DoD does just that,\" Lummer said.\n\nThe Army was the first to publish guidance and authorization to wear the devices when the MILPER came out this month, but guidance will likely vary slightly between the Joint Staff and the other services, Lummer said.\n\nThere's a subtle but important distinction between the V and C devices, Lummer said.\n\nThe valor V device \"is for combat heroism, limited to a singular achievement where a soldier demonstrated valor in combat against an armed enemy,\" he said.\n\nThe combat C device is earned \"through service or achievement under combat conditions,\" Lummer said. The intent of the C device is to distinguish a particular award as having been earned in combat, since not all military awards are exclusively combat-related.\n\nFor example, the Bronze Star Medal will not merit a C device because the medal itself recognizes service or achievement in a combat theater. The Army Commendation Medal, however, can be awarded in combat or in peacetime, so a C device would distinguish that service or achievement in combat, Lummer said.\n\nBut to qualify for the C device, the soldier must be in an active area of combat where \"the soldier was personally exposed to hostile action or in an area where other soldiers were actively engaged,\" he said.\n\nUnlike the Combat Action Badge -- which is awarded when a soldier is personally engaged or engages the enemy -- the C device can be awarded to a soldier even if he or she was never personally engaged, so long as the \"service or achievement being recognized was in an area where such enemy actions occurred,\" Lummer said.\n\nThe R device is rated when a soldier contributes to a combat operation remotely, such as when an unmanned aerial system operator places ordnance on a high-value target from a location away from the combat area, Lummer said.\n\nThat UAS operator likely would qualify for the new R device if he \"delivered ordnance or identified the target and was then able to talk or walk effects onto that target, whether from a raid on the ground or designating targeted munitions delivered from somewhere else,\" he said.\n\nThe new C and the R devices are the same color, size and font as the existing V device, Lummer said.

He told reporters that by not using the enforcement mechanism properly, Americans lose out on funds that could be used for other purposes.\n\nThe second executive order calls on the Commerce Department and U.S. trade representative to produce a comprehensive report to identify \u201cevery possible cause of the U.S. trade deficit.\u201d\n\nRobert Lighthizer, Trump's nominee for post, has yet to be confirmed.\n\nOnce completed, the findings of the report will serve as the foundation that will guide the Trump administration\u2019s future trade policy.\n\nOfficials will consider the impact on deficits of trade abuses, non-reciprocal trade practices, specific trade obligations, poor or inconsistent enforcement and World Trade Organization rules.\n\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross praised Friday's step.\n\n\"If anyone had any doubt about the president's resolve to fix the trade problems, these two executive orders should end that speculation now and for all time,\" he said standing next to Trump. \"This marks the beginning of the totally new chapter in the American trade relationship with our partners overseas.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday, Ross said the first-of-its-kind report demonstrates that the administration will \u201cnot to do anything abruptly, but to take a very measured and analytical approach, both to analyzing the problem and therefore to developing the solutions for it.\u201d\n\nThe cautious approach is welcome news to some in the business community.\n\n\u201cThey are not just jumping into something. They are going to carefully look at what it is we really want to accomplish and hopefully think about how it will affect us and the other country,\u201d founder of Paul Mitchell and billionaire investor John Paul DeJori told Fox Business Network.\n\nAdministration officials have 90 days to finish a country-by-country and product-by-product analysis.\n\nThe report will also examine whether bilateral deficits are caused by free trade deals, like NAFTA, and actions taken by previous administrations.\n\nWhite House Trade Council President Peter Navarro broke slightly from Trump, saying deficits are not always bad for the economy and that bad behavior is not always the cause.\n\nFor example, one of the reasons for the trade deficit with Canada is the U.S. is not energy independent and imports a lot of oil.\n\nDuring the campaign, then-candidate Trump frequently singled out China as a trade abuser and promised to hold China to account for unfair trade practices, including currency manipulation.\n\nAsked Friday why Trump has not fulfilled his pledge to label China a currency manipulator on \"Day One,\" Spicer said a decision would occur after next Thursday's meeting with Xi Jinping.\n\nNavarro argued the executive orders address far broader concerns than just China.\n\n\"Let's not make this a China story. This is a story about trade abuses, this is a story about an under-collection of duties,\" he said.\n\nTrump, however, recognizes the potential for an uncomfortable meeting next week in Palm Beach, Fla.\n\n\"The meeting next week with China will be a very difficult one in that we can no longer have massive trade deficits,\u201d Trump said in a Thursday tweet.\n\nHe added that \"American companies must be prepared to look at other alternatives.\"\n\nOn March 7, the Commerce Department released figures showing the U.S. had amassed its largest trade deficit since March 2012.\n\nIn January 2017, the trade deficit for goods and services was 11.8 percent higher as compared to January 2016, increasing from $43.4 billion to $48.5 billion.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s data shows there is much work to be done,\u201d said Ross in a statement, adding that the administration would in the coming months \u201crenegotiate bad trade deals and bring renewed energy to trade enforcement in defense of all hard-working Americans.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/31/trump-signs-executive-orders-to-crack-down-on-trade-abuses-increase-enforcement.html"}, {"text": "After the House Republican leadership's plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare stalled in Congress, the mainstream media decided the Trump presidency is dead in the water.\n\nSince taking office, President Trump has been checking off his campaign promises, one by one.

And they should have a unified plan to implement their agenda.\n\nIn my opinion, it's not the Freedom Caucus that's responsible for the GOP failure to repeal and replace ObamaCare. The legislation put forward by the House leadership was flawed from the beginning. It was created behind closed doors, and no Freedom Caucus members saw it until it was rolled out. That made it a disaster.\n\nI don't know who is telling the White House to focus its anger on the Freedom Caucus, but it's misplaced. The members of the Freedom Caucus have told me personally that they want to make a deal and they want the win for the president and the country.\n\nMy advice to Speaker Paul Ryan and the rest of Congress is simple: Get all the differing factions in your caucus together. Get them together with senators like Rand Paul and Mike Lee and Mitch McConnell and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price.\n\nGet everybody in a room, lock the door, order pizza and beer.

Clinton said a rising tide of women's rights lifts all nations and stressed that global progress depends on the progress of women.\n\nClinton, who also served as secretary of state during the Obama administration, insisted that the Trump administration's proposed deep cut of roughly 31 percent for the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development would make the U.S. less secure while undercutting the country's standing worldwide.\n\n\"Turning our backs on diplomacy won't make our country safer,\" Clinton said.\n\nUnder the Trump budget proposal unveiled early this month, the United Nations and dozens of its affiliated agencies would face significant cuts and possibly an end to U.S. contributions.

We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018!\u201d\n\nIs that a declaration of war, as some in the media are playing it? A threat to get these 30-plus lawmakers on the Trump train? Or just a moment of social-media venting?\n\nThe press loves Republican-on-Republican violence, so this is getting a huge ride.\n\nDonald Trump was never going to be a great fit with the Freedom Caucus. He is not a doctrinaire conservative. He ran on protecting Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, which is essentially the Democratic position. And he ran on preserving certain aspects of ObamaCare and making sure no one loses their insurance coverage, which was at odds with the conservative position of essentially gutting the program in favor of a free-market approach.\n\nThe White House gambled that the Freedom Caucus would compromise on the measure because it\u2019s hard to defy a president of your party on his first major vote. But Mark Meadows and company, believing they were standing up for principle, wouldn\u2019t budge, even after the administration made a couple of key concessions.\n\nSo that leaves the president with a stark choice: adjust his agenda to get the most conservative Republicans on board, or marginalize the Freedom Caucus and work with moderate Democrats.\n\nPaul Ryan tried to deflect the remarks, telling reporters that the president was just \u201cexpressing his frustration\u201d on Twitter. One caucus member, Justin Amash, suggested that Trump was being a bully, saying such conduct is \u201cconstructive in fifth grade.\u201d And he tweeted: \u201cNo shame, Mr. President. Almost everyone succumbs to the D.C. Establishment.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know whether Trump would carry out his threat\u2014the 2018 election is a long way off\u2014but I think he has limited leverage against the Freedom Caucus. Its members are mainly in very safe conservative districts and are unlikely to be vulnerable to a primary challenge from the left.\n\nBut I do know that Trump needs to forge a working majority in the House for tax reform and other upcoming issues. So this is not a one-time dilemma.\n\nNational Review Editor Rich Lowry, not a Trump fan, makes some interesting points on what he calls the crisis of Trumpism:\n\n\u201cThe product of the Ryan-Trump partnership on health care was a bill bizarrely at odds with a national election Republicans had just won on the strength of working-class voters. Under the GOP replacement, fewer people would have had coverage, and workers further down the income scale would have been particularly hard hit ...\"\n\n\u201cTrump is more naturally an ally of the moderate Tuesday Group, except with a flame-throwing Twitter feed. A President Trump acting more in keeping with his free-floating reflex to take care of people, as expressed in speeches and interviews, would have pushed the health bill to the left. But Trump so far hasn\u2019t followed the logic of his own politics in dealing with Congress.\u201d\n\nA Republican president doesn\u2019t want to go too far left, since the Dems won\u2019t give him much help, so it\u2019s a balancing act.\n\nThe liberal Huffington Post went with a somewhat incendiary screamer: \u201cTRUMP POURS GAS ON GOP CIVIL WAR.\u201d It may not be an all-out civil war, but right now the guns are drawn.\n\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

Let's not make this a China story. This is a story about trade abuses, this is a story about an under-collection of duties,\" he said, later adding: \"We're not here for tweets.\"\n\nWhile Trump has long argued that trade deficits imperil U.S. workers, Ross cautioned that they aren't necessarily all bad. In some cases, for instance, the U.S. simply can't produce enough of a product to meet domestic demand.\n\nIn others, foreign countries may make products substantially cheaper or better than in the U.S. They can also mean that foreign countries and entities are investing in U.S. assets.\n\nStill, Ross argued, the U.S. has the lowest tariff rates of any developed country. The report, he said, will examine whether deficits are being driven by things like cheating, specific trade agreements, lax enforcement and World Trade Organization rules.\n\nRoss said the report would not focus extensively on currency manipulation, which is under the purview of the U.S. Treasury Department, despite Trump's campaign rhetoric.\n\nThe second order will focus on stepping up the collection of anti-dumping and countervailing duties, which are levied against foreign governments that subsidize products so they can be sold below cost.\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit totaled $502.3 billion last year, a slight increase from 2015, according to the Commerce Department. The trade gap rose to its highest level since 2012 last year, though the imbalance remains below its 2006 high, shortly before the Great Recession struck.\n\nTrump has portrayed trade deficits as strangling economic growth and devastating factory jobs. Research last year by academic economists, including David Autor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found that China's emergence hurt some communities and they have yet to fully recover.\n\nBut foreign trade has also helped reduce prices for clothing, cars and furniture, among other items. This has created savings for U.S. consumers.\n\nWhile economists concede the benefits of trade can be uneven, they argue the job losses that Trump blames on trade pacts can largely be attributed to automation. A study released this week by the National Bureau of Economic Research estimates that robots account for up to 670,000 lost factory jobs between 1990 and 2007.\n\nBoth exports abroad and imports into the United States fell in 2016, but exports declined by a greater sum in part due to a stronger dollar making American-made goods and services more expensive overseas.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/31/trump-to-target-trade-abuses-in-latest-executive-orders.html"}, {"text": "Vice President Biden said Thursday that his advice for President Trump would be to grow up and stop using his Twitter account.\n\nThe Hill reported that Biden made the comment during a talk at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement.\n\n\u201cI would stop tweeting and start focusing,\u201d Biden said.\n\nThis is not the first time Biden has been critical of Trump.

Devin Nunes, R-Calif.\n\nIn a letter to the House and Senate intelligence committee's chairman and ranking member, White House Counsel Don McGhan offered to \"make these documents\" available for Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. to inspect. McGhan added that he believed the documents are \"necessary to determine whether information collected on U.S. persons was mishandled and leaked,\" a reference to alleged surveillance of President Trump's campaign staff and transition team.\n\nIn a response, Schiff told McGhan, \"I look forward to reviewing these materials at the earliest opportunity.\"\n\nSources told Fox News that Senate intelligence committee chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., and ranking member Mark Warner, D-Va., had received the same invitation from McGhan. Late Thursday, a committee spokesman said the White House had been asked to direct the nation's spy agencies to turn the documents over to the panel.\n\nThe exchange of letters took place as Fox News confirmed that two White House staffers \u2014 Ezra Cohen-Watnick, a senior intelligence director at the National Security Council, and Michael Ellis of the White House Counsel\u2019s office \u2014 aided Nunes in reviewing intelligence at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House grounds March 21. The staffers' identities were first reported by The New York Times.\n\nNunes told reporters last week that he had seen troubling information about the improper distribution of Trump associates' intercepted communications, and he briefed the president on the material before informing Schiff.\n\nSpeaking on Capitol Hill Thursday, Schiff said he was \"more than willing\" to accept the White House offer to view new information. But he raised concerns that Trump officials may have used Nunes to \"launder information to our committee to avoid the true source.\"\n\n\n\n\"The White House has a lot of questions to answer,\" he declared.\n\n\n\nInstead, the White House continued to sidestep queries about its role in showing Nunes classified information that appears to have included transcripts of foreign officials discussing Trump's transition to the presidency, according to current and former U.S. officials. Intelligence agencies routinely monitor the communications of foreign officials living in the U.S., though the identities of Americans swept up in that collection is to be protected.\n\n\n\nEarly last week, White House officials privately encouraged reporters to look into whether information about Trump associates had been improperly revealed in the intelligence gathering process. Days later, Nunes announced that he had evidence, via an unnamed source, showing that Trump and his aides' communications had been collected through legal means but then \"widely disseminated\" throughout government agencies. He said the collections were not related to the Russia investigation.\n\n\n\nTrump spokesman Sean Spicer said Thursday the material the White House wants the House and Senate intelligence leaders to view was discovered by the National Security Council through the course of regular business. He would not say whether it was the same material Nunes had already seen.\n\n\n\nA congressional aide said Schiff did not receive the White House letter until after Spicer announced it from the White House briefing room.\n\n\n\nSpicer had previously dismissed the notion that the White House had funneled information to Nunes, saying the idea that the congressman would come and brief Trump on material the president's team already had \"doesn't pass the smell test.\" The White House quickly embraced Nunes' revelations, saying they vindicated Trump's explosive and unverified claim that President Barack Obama wiretapped his New York skyscraper.\n\n\n\nNunes has said the information he received did not support that allegation, which has also been disputed by Obama and top intelligence officials.\n\n\n\nCohen-Watnick is among about a dozen White House officials who would have access to the types of classified information Nunes says he viewed, according to current and former U.S. officials. He's become a controversial figure in intelligence circles, but Trump decided to keep him on over the objections of the CIA and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, according to the officials. They spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly by name.\n\n\n\nCohen-Watnick and Rep. Nunes both served on the Trump transition team.\n\n\n\nNunes has repeatedly sidestepped questions about who provided him the intelligence reports, though he pointedly has not denied that he sources were in the White House. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., in an interview with CBS' \"This Morning\" that aired Thursday, said Nunes told him a \"whistleblower-type person\" provided the information.\n\nNunes has declined to recuse himself from the investigation, despite repeated calls from Democrats to do so. Ryan has also expressed confidence in Nunes' conduct amid calls for Ryan to strip Nunes of his chairmanship.\n\nFox News' John Roberts and Chad Pergram contributed to this report.

A low-key politician by nature, he hasn\u2019t tried to grab the spotlight or positioned himself as a Cheney-like force who is quietly running things behind the scenes. He has cast himself as loyal No. 2 in backing the boss.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, as a former congressman and Indiana governor (as well as radio talk show host), Pence, a Christian conservative, is steeped in government experience, in sharp contrast to the outsider president.\n\nBut there\u2019s this other thing: He\u2019s not Trump.\n\nIn a largely favorable front-page New York Times piece, an unnamed Republican senator said Pence was initially viewed as \u201can alternative-reality president who would prod Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency toward normalcy.\u201d Now, says the piece, Democrats and Republican critics \u201cstill view him as a president-in-waiting, in hopes that Mr. Trump will somehow be brought down by scandal.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the framing: Mike Pence is normal, and maybe he\u2019ll still succeed Trump.\n\nThe VP, says the Times, carries out \u201cmany of the functions that the White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, would normally fulfill if he possessed more policy experience and legislative connections: sounding out lawmakers for inside information, providing the president with tactical counsel, quietly offering policy tweaks during negotiations.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s more of Mike as Normal Guy:\n\n\u201cAt times, Mr. Pence can seem jarringly out of place, a clean-cut 1950s Republican cheerfully navigating the chaotic \u2018Mad Max\u2019 landscape created by the disruptive duo of Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon, trying to stay engaged while remaining discernibly aloof from the less-savory aspects of serving in the Trump White House.\u201d\n\nPence views such comparisons as offensive, according to a person familiar with his thinking, believing that while he and the president have contrasting styles, they are delivering the same message to different audiences and that the veep doesn\u2019t act as some kind of translator. The Pence camp also insists that he and Priebus have worked well together in lobbying the Hill.\n\nThe Times story also mentions that Pence\u2019s wife, Karen, was wary of Trump\u2019s offer to put him on the ticket. Which brings me to a favorable profile of the second lady, also yesterday, in the Washington Post.\n\nIt begins with Pence having a red phone in his statehouse office to connect directly to his wife, \u201ca reminder, both physical and symbolic, of the direct and enduring connection between Mike and Karen Pence.\u201d\n\nKaren Pence, the piece says, \u201cremains an important influence on one of President Trump\u2019s most important political allies. She sat in on at least one interview as the vice president assembled his staff, accompanied her husband on his first foreign trip and joins him for off-the-record briefings with reporters, acting as his gut check and shield.\u201d\n\nAnd they toured the Dachau concentration camp together, \u201coften holding hands, and huddled together on the Air Force Two ride home to debrief on the trip.\u201d\n\nIn a way, the Pences are attracting the kind of coverage that might normally go to the first lady. Think about Michelle Obama and Laura Bush and the portrayal of their pet projects.\n\nBut with Melania still living in Trump Tower, much to the frustration of the press, we get headlines like this one in the Post:\n\n\u201cIn New York, Searching for the Reclusive and Elusive Melania Trump.\u201d\n\nThe story says that \u201cMelania Trump is a virtual shut-in, her refuge 58 stories above Manhattan\u2019s hoi polloi and laden with enough gold to embarrass a Saudi prince.\u201d This, in turn, means \u201can ever-clamorous chorus of gossipmongers, pundits, historians and even body-language experts dissect her every move, fashion choice and facial expression to unearth a true State of Melania.\u201d\n\nBut even here the stark contrast surfaces, with former Trump executive Louise Sunshine quoted as saying Melania is trying to make her way \u201cas the wife of a very impulsive, compulsive, erratic president.\u201d\n\nIf Melania wants to stay in Manhattan raising 10-year-old Barron, in my view, she has every right to do so. But it so happens that she gave a speech yesterday at the State Department, presenting the International Women of Courage awards.\n\nUsually it helps a president when his vice president generates positive headlines. That\u2019s not necessarily the case with Trump, although if the media credit Mike Pence with doing a good job, it does remind us that the president's first major decision was to pick him.\n\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

As he prepares for interviews with the Senate Intelligence Committee and the House Intelligence Committee, Page gave a categorical denial when asked by Fox News Chief Intelligence Correspondent Catherine Herridge whether he worked with the Russians to help the Trump campaign.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cI did nothing that could even possibly be viewed as helping them in any way.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he had worked with the Russians to hurt the Clinton campaign, he replied, \u201cAbsolutely not. In no way, shape or form.\u201d\n\nStill, Page acknowledged for the first time what he insists was a brief meeting with the Russian ambassador at the Republican National Convention \u2013 an admission sure to fuel foes of the Trump administration looking for evidence of Trump-Russia coordination.\n\nPage, who described himself as an oil industry consultant and U.S. Naval Academy midshipman, was a relative unknown when the Trump campaign announced his hiring as a foreign policy adviser in March 2016. He would stay with the Trump team until September 2016, but says he left because \u201cthese stories kept coming out based on the dodgy dossier.\u201d\n\nPage appeared in the infamous \u201cTrump Dossier\u201d created by former British Intelligence operative Christopher Steele, working for a U.S. political research group called Fusion GPS on behalf of both Republicans and Democrats. \u201cAnd so out of respect and out of doing what's best for the campaign, I thought it's best if I step aside and take a leave of absence at that at that point,\u201d Page said.\n\nIn his opening statement before testimony by FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Adm. Mike Rogers last week, House Intelligence Committee ranking member Adam Schiff, D-Calif., put Page at the center of an alleged web of collusion to help Russia interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nSchiff went through a blow-by-blow of Page\u2019s alleged pro-Russian activities, which Page answered in his exclusive interview.\n\n\u201cIn early July,\u201d Schiff said at the hearing, \u201cCarter Page travels to Moscow on a trip approved by the Trump campaign. While in Moscow, he gives a speech critical of the United States and other western countries for what he believes is a hypocritical focus on democratization and efforts to fight corruption.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump campaign \u201cpeople were okay with [the trip],\u201d Page said, \u201cthe word 'approved' \u2026 can be misleading that I was actually authorized to go and represent the campaign. It had nothing to do with the campaign. I was going as a private citizen.\u201d\n\nThe oft-quoted line from the speech that was characterized as anti-American was, \"Washington and other western capitals have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.\u201d\n\nBut Page told Fox News the line was taken out of context to make him look bad. \u201cIt was really about that concept of mutual respect and the way various countries including Russia, China and the United States, can work together for having a more constructive relationship primarily with the states of central Asia, such as Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan,\u201d he said.\n\nSchiff, at the hearing, pointed to another allegation from the dossier, that \u201cPage also had a secret meeting with Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin, reported to be a former KGB agent and close friend of Russian President Putin.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have never met Igor Sechin in my life,\u201d Page countered. \u201cCompletely false. I've never met him in my entire life. I may have seen him at a conference once at a distance, but I've never shaken his hand.\u201d\n\nAfter his Moscow speech, Page attended the Republican National Convention last July in Cleveland. Steele and Schiff described how Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak met with Page \u2013 acting as a go-between on behalf of then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Then, according to Schiff, \u201cJust prior to the convention, the Republican Party platform is changed, removing a section that supports the provision of lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine, an action that would be contrary to Russian interests.\u201d\n\nBut Page told Herridge in the exclusive interview, \u201cI was always very cautious. The only time, and you're the first person in the media that I'm saying this very directly to -- I said, \u2018Hello,\u2019 to him in passing, handed him my business card and never got a business card from him, as I did for many ambassadors in Cleveland during the Republican National Convention.\u201d\n\nPage said the reason he never mentioned the passing encounter before was \u201cout of respect for privacy for Ambassador Kislyak. And there were very direct rules that that was an off-the-record session.\u201d\n\nStill, Page asserted that, \u201cNothing happened between me and Ambassador Kislyak. That I can assure you. I had no direct one-on-one material discussions with him in any way, shape or form.\u201d\n\nPage even denied the dossier allegation that Manafort appointed him as a coordinator with the Russians: \u201cTotally false. Just like everything else about those allegations.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Page argued that the attacks on the Trump administration by its political foes have harmed the U.S. political system more severely than the allegations that Russia meddled in the U.S. election.\n\n\u201cLiars and leakers in Washington and more broadly the political class in the United States actually had a much more negative impact,\u201d Page said. \u201cAll of the discussions about the influence that the Russian government had on the U.S. election would actually pale in comparison to the much heavier influence that the U.S. government actually had in trying to hurt then-candidate Trump.

Ted Cruz.\n\nBeto O'Rourke, a 44-year-old Democrat from the remote West Texas city of El Paso, has advocated for legalizing marijuana and preaches tolerance on the U.S.-Mexico border in defiance of President Donald Trump's \"Build that wall\" mantra.\n\nOn Friday, O'Rourke should formally announce his 2018 Senate candidacy against Cruz, a conservative who finished second to Trump in last year's GOP presidential primary.\n\nThe third-term congressman and fluent Spanish speaker is the kind of rising political star Democrats hope can help begin turning deep red Texas blue, aided by a booming Hispanic population and state politics pushed even farther right by Trump and Cruz. He first made a name for himself playing guitar for Foss, an El Paso punk rock band that included drummer Cedric Bixler-Zavala, who went on to play for the Grammy Award-winning act The Mars Volta.\n\nBut before O'Rourke can challenge Cruz, he'll have to emerge from a Democratic primary field that could include another up-and-comer, fellow Rep. Joaquin Castro from San Antonio.\n\n\"The Trump factor. He's the gift that keeps on giving to Democrats in Texas,\" said the state's Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa. \"It's energizing the base and changing the whole dynamics of electoral politics here, and that's what these two guys see.\"\n\nIt's hard to imagine any Democrat taking Texas by storm, much less toppling Cruz, who added to his national stature running for president while remaining popular in most GOP circles back home. A Democrat hasn't won statewide office in Texas in 23 years, the nation's longest losing streak by a political party.\n\nStill, O'Rourke insists Cruz is beatable and there are some positive signs for Democrats, who in November swept down-ballot races in Harris County, which includes Houston, and made notable gains in other fast-growing areas. Trump still beat Hillary Clinton in Texas by 9 percentage points -- but that was the first time a Republican didn't carry the state by double digits since 1996.\n\nCastro hasn't tamped down speculation he too will run for Senate and would be favored over O'Rourke. Both have crisscrossed the state, engaging top donors and party activists. Hinojosa says he's assuming Castro will run with help from his twin brother, Julian, the former San Antonio mayor who was President Barack Obama's Housing and Urban Development Secretary.\n\nOn resume alone, O'Roruke would seem an unlikely choice, but he has been an underdog before.\n\nO'Rourke was elected to the El Paso City Council at age 32 but remained virtually unknown outside his hometown until the 2012 Democratic primary, when he ousted eight-term Rep. Silvestre Reyes, a former House Intelligence chairman.\n\nHis El Paso district is strongly Democratic, making general elections since then an afterthought. The dynamics will be far different in a Senate race: Even if O'Rourke survives a dogfight primary, beating Cruz would be far tougher.\n\n\"I think his history indicates if he decides to do this, he will spend all his energy, time and resources on getting elected,\" said Jose Rodriguez, a state senator from El Paso who has hosted past O'Rourke congressional fundraisers. \"There are indicators that people are tired of what's going on with the current administration (and) the kind of campaign that Ted Cruz ran.\"\n\nO'Rourke has long been a supporter of legalizing pot to slow the drug war that for years turned Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, into one of the world's deadliest places. He authored the 2011 book, \"Dealing Death and Drugs,\" which argued that America's war on drugs had failed.\n\nO'Rourke was arrested in 1995 for breaking and entering after jumping a fence at the University of Texas at El Paso during what he now says was a prank, but prosecutors declined the case. Three years later, O'Rourke was arrested for drunken driving and received deferred adjudication to avoid conviction, an incident he has called a mistake.\n\nHis father was a former El Paso County judge and a longtime Democrat who switched parties in 1996 to run unsuccessfully for Congress as a Republican. The younger O'Rourke is an outspoken advocate for bipartisanship, saying both parties should work together to foment trade and cultural exchange on the border.\n\nWhen a snowstorm canceled flights into Washington this month, O'Rourke and Republican Rep. Will Hurd, from a sprawling Texas district next to his, spent 36 hours driving a rented Chevy Impala from San Antonio to the nation's capital, livestreaming much of the way. The pair became an internet sensation during hours of listening to Johnny Cash, hitting Whataburger and jointly opposing Trump's border wall.\n\nThere was widespread speculation Cruz could face a GOP primary challenge for being slow to endorse Trump last fall -- but much of that has faded since Cruz has become a vocal supporter of Trump after November. Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier declined to comment on O'Rourke's entering the 2018 Senate race.\n\nPerhaps tellingly, Cruz has sometimes singled out the Castro brothers for past criticism. He hasn't targeted O'Rourke, at least not yet.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/30/ex-punk-rocker-orourke-launches-longshot-bid-against-cruz.html"}, {"text": "**Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day?

It comes in the form of a $1.3 million ad blitz targeted at swing states as well as states represented by vulnerable Democratic senators.\n\nTrump is doing his part by renewing his war with his fellow Republicans, blasting House conservatives for defeating his health-insurance overhaul last week.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Trump whose first months in office have been marked by near-constant controversy, policy setbacks and historically low approval ratings, could use a boost.\n\nGoing back to his successful campaign model of Mercer money and dramatic confrontations with other politicians could be a help. His core voters need reassurance and beating up on Cruz-style conservatives has worked before. Just ask Ted Cruz\u2026\n\nBut Trump will need more than slick ads and scapegoats to win his long, long re-election campaign. He will need policies that work.\n\nTo that end, Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan are playing good cop and bad cop with House Republicans in a bid to get lawmakers to fall in line.\n\nTrump keeps talking about wanting to work with Democrats to enact the more liberal parts of his agenda and blaming conservatives for being ideologically hidebound. Ryan, meanwhile, is telling his troops that they better hurry up and take the first deal before the President follows through on his threat.\n\nSome conservatives seem anxious enough that they might go along, but for Trump and Ryan\u2019s routine to be successful it will have to be credible.\n\nSo the question that confronts Washington is whether Trump is serious about dropping the effort to replace ObamaCare and instead work with moderate Republicans and Democrats to repair the legislation. And if he is, are Democrats actually interested?\n\nThis may just be a game of chicken with conservative lawmakers to force them to accept the original version of TrumpCare. That depends, however, on the idea that Ryan and his counterpart in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, would go along. That seems unlikely.\n\nAt present, Ryan is maintaining the House lawsuit against the executive branch undertaken during the Obama administration to block subsidies paid to insurance companies under the existing law. And it\u2019s an open question whether the budget bosses in the upper chamber do not even intend to fund the subsidies in the first place.\n\nNot a lot of repair going on there\u2026\n\nWhat else is not going on is the promised pivot to Trump\u2019s cherished tax overhaul and stimulus spending package. The Republican leadership seems dug in on the issue of addressing health insurance first. Trump\u2019s focus on badgering and blaming conservatives suggests that he agrees and has gone back to Plan A: jam through some manner of replacement for ObamaCare and then turn to more popular policy provisions.\n\nThe president finds himself in something of a snare. He can\u2019t get re-elected if he doesn\u2019t have policy victories. But if the policies he is able to enact are unpopular, he loses anyway.\n\nAt some point we may see Trump shift his anger away from right wingers and put it on the congressional leaders who are being sticks in the mud. But for now, Trump is sticking it out with the GOP establishment. That may be because opposition to Trump among Democrats is so uniformly intense other than Trump enthusiast Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., the president has not found many friends on the other side of the aisle.\n\nThe astonishing brinksmanship over Trump\u2019s well-regarded nominee to the Supreme Court tells us that even when it is against their long-term interests, Democrats are determined to be seen as absolutists in opposing Trump.\n\nIf the president wants to get out of his jam between the Republican establishment and conservatives, he is going to need some Democrats to help him make good on his threats. Unfortunately for Trump, many on the left are content to watch and wait.\n\nFirst, they want to see when and if the GOP will actually cannibalize itself. Second with at least two ongoing investigations into potential ties between Trump\u2019s campaign and the Kremlin, there\u2019s lots of incentive for Democrats to just wait and see.\n\nTrump needs them way more than they need him. And without successes of his own, Trump won\u2019t be able to entice any significant number of aisle crossers. And what that means is that before ads or rallies or Twitter fights can keep him in office, Trump will have to successfully sell legislation that he believes in.\n\nWhether it\u2019s on health insurance or taxes or anything else, the president needs to become an evangelist for some specific policy idea around which he can form a new coalition.\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: GOLDILOCKS\n\n\u201cFor the absurdity must continually stare us in the face of confiding to a government the direction of the most essential national interests, without daring to trust it to the authorities which are indispensible to their proper and efficient management.\u201d \u2013 Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 23\n\nTIME OUT: WOMEN IN COMBAT\n\nThe New Yorker: \u201c\u2026 The skill that Ms. Pac-Man demands of its players\u2014making multi-objective, dynamic decisions quickly\u2014turns out to be the same ability that artificial-intelligence researchers wish to program into many of their bots.

The draft letter does acknowledge, however, Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership just three days into his presidency.\n\n\u201cWe expect to obtain results that improve on previously negotiated outcomes,\u201d the draft letter reads. \u201cThe administration is committed to negotiating and implementing trade agreements which open markets to benefit our businesses, farmers, workers, and families.\u201d\n\nBrooke Singman is a Reporter for Fox News.

A compromise plan announced Wednesday night by the state's Democratic governor and leaders of the Republican-controlled legislature was worked out amid pressure from the NCAA, which threatened to take away more sporting events.\n\nThe deal, which Gov. Roy Cooper urged lawmakers to support, repeals the portion of the year-old law that ties public bathroom use to the gender listed on one's birth certificate. The new measure leaves policy on public restrooms to state legislators -- not local government or school officials.\n\nThe compromise deal drew criticism from transgender rights activists who say it still denies them protection from discrimination. It remains to be seen if the deal will satisfy the NCAA and other groups that have steered clear of the Tar Heel state in protest.\n\nRepublican Sen. Dan Bishop, a primary sponsor of the original law, denounced the new deal on the Senate floor, where it was approved 32-16, with nine of 15 Democrats among the yes votes.\n\n\"This bill is at best a punt.

We\u2019re dealing with rogue behavior on the part of a major nuclear power.\u201d\n\nAnd while such concerns on the part of the European Union and the Baltic States, among others, certainly is valid, Ilves said, the most immediate menace by Russia is its increasingly bold efforts to hack systems and interfere with elections.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more concerned about their intentions to influence elections,\u201d Ilves said, \u201cit\u2019s much cheaper to influence elections than it is to go to war.\u201d\n\n\u201cRussia is engaging in asymmetrical warfare,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s asymmetrical because they can do things to democracies that democracies can\u2019t do back to an authoritarian government.\u201d\n\nIlves says elections in France and Germany this year are of particular concern because of the possibility that Russia will attempt to influence the outcome.\n\nAides to French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron, an independent centrist, accused Russian groups of trying to hurt his campaign with social media posts accusing the married contender of being gay.\n\nPutin, who supports candidate Marine Le Pen for her anti-European Union stance, has denied that Russia is attempting to meddle in the French elections.\n\n\u201cThey hack email and publish embarrassing articles,\u201d Ilves said. \u201cRussians don\u2019t like Macron, they don\u2019t want him being president. Macron is seen as a unifying figure in the European Union holding sanctions [against Russia].\u201d\n\nIn Germany, President Angela Merkel is expected to win re-election. But others running for legislative seats could slow or hurt her efforts to advance policies or proposals, and that would be an area where Russian interference in the elections would affect German government actions, experts say.\n\n\u201cIn Germany, concerns are great\u201d about Russia\u2019s intentions, Ilves said.\n\nThe presidential elections in both nations, he noted, could produce a \u201cvery big change in Europe.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust yesterday, yet another report from the European intelligence agency said that once again the Russians have hacked into the Parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the day before yesterday, the Swedish intelligence agency published a report on Russia attempts to influence the political scene in Sweden.\u201d\n\nJust one year after Ilves became president in 2006, Estonia experienced a Russian cyberattack, making the former Estonian leader an unwitting expert on the issue.\n\n\u201cThe lesson for everyone is not to be na\u00efve\u201d when it comes to Russia and Putin, he said.\n\n\u201cThe watershed moment was Russia\u2019s invasion of Georgia in 2008,\u201d Ilves said, saying it led to the pattern of Russia\u2019s brazen \u201coverturning of fundamental principles we\u2019ve all been living with.\u201d\n\nWith Putin, Ilves said, \u201cYou can\u2019t say \u2018He would never do that,\u2019 because he has done what we have said he would never do.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Llorente is Senior Reporter for FoxNews.com, and can be reached at Elizabeth.Llorente@Foxnews.com.

Farkas served in the Obama administration from 2012 through 2015 as the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia.\n\n\u201cI was urging my former colleagues, and frankly speaking, the people on the Hill -- it was more actually aimed at telling the Hill people,\u201d Farkas said. \"\u2019Get as much information as you can, get as much intelligence as you can before President Obama leaves the administration,\u2019 because I had a fear that, somehow, that information would disappear with the senior people who left.\u201d\n\nIn an admission that went unnoticed, partly because it came prior to Trump\u2019s tweet and largely because it was made on MSNBC, Farkas continued.\n\n\u201cSo it would be hidden away in the bureaucracy that the Trump folks, if they found out how we knew what we knew about their -- the staff, the Trump staff's dealing with Russians, that they would try to compromise those sources and methods, meaning we would no longer have access to that intelligence,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I became very worried because not enough was coming out into the open, and I knew that there was more. We have very good intelligence on Russia. So then I had talked to some of my former colleagues, and I knew that they were trying to also help get information to the Hill.\n\nThis is very, very important. Farkas is admitting surveillance of Trump and his associates took place. She is admitting intelligence leaking took place.\n\nSurveillance, unmasking of Americans swept up in foreign spying and intelligence leaking are all acknowledged on the video. For weeks, I have been asking who from the Obama administration knew what and when did they know it? Now we learn that Evelyn Farkas, a relatively low-ranking Obama administration official, knew about all this surveillance. She couldn\u2019t have been alone.\n\nOn my television and radio programs, I have highlighted the fine reporting on this story by Sara Carter and John Solomon of Circa News. They uncovered the existence of an FBI investigation into a server that was being utilized by Trump Tower, which is where Trump\u2019s campaign headquarters was located. They also discovered a warrant issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court that allowed federal officials to capture Trump team communications. This took place before the president took office.\n\nNow, a newly unearthed video shows officials with direct access to President Obama had access to unmasked federal surveillance of the Trump transition team, and may have briefed President Obama himself about the information they were collecting on then President-elect Trump.\n\nThis Farkas interview will not be the last shoe to drop as the story continues to unravel. Little by little, it will come out and the American people will get answers to some very important \u2013 and troubling \u2013 questions.\n\nAdapted from Sean Hannity's monologue on \"Hannity,\" March 29, 2017\n\nSean Hannity currently serves as host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) Hannity (weekdays 10-11PM/ET).

And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d boasted House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\n\n\u201cThe resolve of our conference to repeal ObamaCare and replace it has never been stronger,\u201d bragged House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La.\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to a better health care future to every person in this country,\u201d said House Republican Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash.\n\nWell, because this time, they really mean it.\n\nNow Republicans are just days from a two-week congressional recess for Easter and Passover. Many rank-and-file GOPers are trying to goad Ryan into calling a vote on the health care legislation the brass euthanized last Friday because it lacked the votes to pass. Lawmakers worry about raucous town halls. The dereliction of an eight-year campaign promise that they would repeal and replace ObamaCare.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t tell you the timeline because we want to get it right,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cWe have an aggressive agenda and we\u2019ve been moving quickly on this aggressive agenda. But we want to make sure that we get it right.\u201d\n\nOf course, it was Ryan who engineered the timeline to vote last week on the health care plan. The strategy would enable the Senate to vote on the health care plan this week and clear the decks to confirm Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch next week.\n\nTimelines mattered before. But they might not now.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen the end of health care,\u201d opined White House spokesman Sean Spicer. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a way forward. A lot of members have reached out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re approaching the Easter season,\u201d proffered House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden, R-Ore., who co-authored the health care legislation. \u201cSome things rise from the dead.\u201d\n\nYeah. But \u2026\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like there\u2019s some invisible wall out there,\u201d said one House Republican lawmaker who asked not to be identified. \u201cIf we vote on this bill\u2026.\u201d\n\nCould the House truly pass the bill?\n\n\u201cMy fear is that people lock in and kind of double down on their position,\u201d said Walden on resuscitating the health care bill.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the positions of some lawmakers would harden \u2013 especially if they were nays before. If they didn\u2019t like it the first time, resurrecting the old bill could infuriate the no votes even more. There\u2019s also the distinct possibility of losing tepid yea votes. There\u2019s a reason why these lawmakers halfheartedly supported the bill. The decision last week to yank it off the floor only solidifies their original gut instinct to oppose the package.\n\nBy the same token, some Republicans think a snap roll call vote could force a moment of truth. Either you\u2019re for it or against it. Ryan\u2019s so-called \u201cbinary choice.\u201d Calling a vote with little fanfare could compel intransigent lawmakers to vote for it.\n\nBut that\u2019s risky. It\u2019s one thing if House vote counters were just a handful shy of votes for passage. It\u2019s another matter when the number of noes are in the thirties and perhaps higher.\n\nAnd there\u2019s another problem.\n\nHouse Republicans consolidated their health care measure into what\u2019s called a budget reconciliation plan. Reconciliation is a special type of legislative process which inoculates bills from Senate filibusters. Senate Democrats would inevitably filibuster a garden variety bill to repeal and replace ObamaCare. However, this particular legislative route is filibuster-proof.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s generally believed the House and Senate only get one crack at a reconciliation package. Defeat on the floor burns that particular reconciliation measure. Moreover, the House and Senate can\u2019t have two \u201clive\u201d reconciliation plans in the parliamentary mix simultaneously. The House hopes to adopt a budget in the coming weeks. That could create a new reconciliation package. If the House doesn\u2019t exhaust the current reconciliation package on health care, it could postpone work on a budget for the next spending cycle.\n\nUnless the House can\u2019t approve a budget.\n\nRemember, the House failed to adopt a budget last year -- despite the GOP\u2019s piety when it comes to budget resolutions.\n\nIf the bill fails, the House Republican leadership will blame its favorite bogeyman: the House Freedom Caucus. The Freedom Caucus deserves blame. But the House leadership struggled just as mightily to convince moderate Republicans to vote yes, too.\n\nFreedom Caucus leader Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., says it\u2019s \u201cpossible\u201d the House could vote. But Meadows believes the leadership team is still dealing with \u201cartificial deadlines.\u201d He says there\u2019s been no talk of \u201cspecifics\u201d and changes to court the necessary votes to pass a bill.\n\nIt\u2019s also virtually impossible to engineer a new bill in a few days or a week. Even if they did, many lawmakers would gripe they didn\u2019t have sufficient time to digest the retrenched legislation.\n\nPresident Trump hosted a bipartisan reception at the White House for senators Tuesday night. The president declared that \u201cwe are all going to make a deal on health care. That is such an easy one. I have no doubt that that\u2019s going to happen very quickly.\u201d\n\nCutting a bipartisan pact may be the only way Trump can achieve anything on health care.\n\nUnless Republicans get their act together.\n\nThe GOP leadership claims the party is united. Optimism abounds. Surely this time they\u2019ll repeal and replace ObamaCare.\n\n\u201cTomorrow is a good day,\u201d said Kevin McCarthy about the health care bill. \u201cI think we'll get it tomorrow.\u201d\n\nOnly that\u2019s what McCarthy said last Thursday.\n\nCapitol Attitude is a weekly column written by members of the Fox News Capitol Hill team.

He directed his junior Marines to go to a nearby park, round up the children there, and lead them to shelter, according to documents obtained by Marine Corps Times in 2015. Wyatt and three other Marines would be shot in a fenced motor pool area at the back of the complex, shortly before police shot and killed the murderer.\n\nSullivan, 40, was a two-time Purple Heart recipient and Iraq veteran also assigned to Mike Battery. He was running to save wounded colleagues in the Reserve center motor pool when he was felled by the shooter, according to an account from a fellow Marine, Sgt. Amanda Vincent, published in Masslive.com.\n\nIn messages shared with the Sullivan family and later published, Vincent said Sullivan had a chance to jump the fence and run to safety, but opted to stay back and wait until the other Marines had gotten away. He and another Marine had been about to enter the center, but got word that the gunman was coming out and changed course.\n\n\"They ran back to the Marines outside and [Sullivan] made sure they all jumped over the fence and got away,\" Vincent said, according to the report.\n\nThis will be the second posthumous honor for Wyatt and Sullivan.

They point to Rule 19, or the \"two-speech rule,\" which limits filibustering senators to two speeches each during the same legislative day.\n\nRachel Bovard, director of policy services at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the approach would force Senate Democrats into the demoralizing position of staging a talkathon they know they cannot win.\n\n\"We're going to make you exhaust yourselves in the face of inevitable defeat,\" she said, putting herself in the shoes of the Republican majority. After a few days, she added, Democratic senators may ask, \"is this really worth it? We're going to lose, anyway.\"\n\nBovard, who previously served as policy director for a caucus of conservative senators, explained that a legislative day can stretch days or weeks beyond a calendar day -- the time between when debate begins and the Senate adjourns. A Democratic senator could talk for as long as stamina allows before passing to a colleague. But once the microphone came back to the senator, he would speak only one more time.\n\nEventually, Democrats would run out of speakers, and Republicans could move to a vote.\n\nThere is some historical precedent for the tactic. Mike Mansfield, who was the majority leader during debate over the 1964 Civil Rights Act, used the rule to help break a filibuster by Southern Democrats.\n\n\"Senate Rule 19 was pushed because it limited to two the number of speeches a senator can make on a subject in the same legislative day,\" historian Nina Moore wrote in her 2000 book, \"Governing Race: Policy, Process, and the Politics of Race.\"\n\nMansfield kept the Senate in session for 81 calendar days. In the end, the debate ended when 71 senators voted to cut off debate.\n\nThat exceeded the two-thirds threshold that existed at the time.\n\nSo far, Republican leaders in the Senate have shown little interest in using the parliamentary end-run around the filibuster. A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) did not return a phone call and email seeking comment.\n\nMcConnell has been reticent to pledge to invoke the nuclear option but suggested Wednesday that he would do it if he had to.\n\n\"It will be really up to them [Democrats] how the process to confirm Judge Gorsuch goes,\" he told Fox News.\n\nSen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) told CNN on Tuesday that, \"We will get him confirmed one way or the other.\"\n\nLee said the former Democratic Senate leader, Harry Reid, cast the die when he eliminated the filibuster for all appointments except for the Supreme Court. That is an exception that existed on paper only, Lee said.\n\n\"There is no next step,\" he said. \"This is the step they took in November 2013.\"\n\nThere are drawbacks to enforcing the two-speech rule rather than simply changing the filibuster. It would require Republicans to remain near the chamber throughout the debate so the party could muster a quorum any time Democrats called for adjournment or tried to switch topics, which would reset the clock.\n\nAnd if all 48 Democrats (including two independents who caucus with the party) held firm, with each speaking twice for many hours a time, such a spectacle could shut the Senate down for weeks and prevent any other business from taking place.\n\n\"The two-speech rule is unworkable,\" said Carrie Severino, chief counsel and policy director of the Judicial Crisis Network.\"It requires a tremendous amount of time and resources.\"\n\nSeverino, whose organization supports Gorsuch, said Democrats made clear before the 2016 election that they were prepared to change the rule if Hillary Clinton had won and their party had taken control of the upper chamber.\n\n\"There's no reason to have a 60-vote standard for Republicans and a 51-vote standard for Democrats,\" she said. \"We know the Democrats would eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court justices if the shoe were on the other foot.\"\n\nBovard, of the Heritage Foundation, questioned how long Democrats would remain committed to a filibuster if they knew it was futile. She predicted it would fall apart in a couple of days. She said the strategy also would prevent Republicans from repeating the mistake Reid did. She pointed out the filibuster rule technically cannot be changed without 67 votes. Reid simply appealed the objection to the Democratic chair and forced the change.\n\n\"Reid broke the rules to change the rule,\" she said.\n\nBovard said if the Republicans go nuclear, it will lay the groundwork for one day eliminating it altogether. Then the Senate will become more like a smaller version of the House of Representatives.\n\n\"What's the point of having a Senate?\" she asked.\n\nBovard acknowledged that enforcing the two-speech rule would take more work for the majority, which is why she said it probably will not happen.\n\n\"McConnell hates inconveniencing his members,\" she said.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/30/how-gop-can-confirm-gorsuch-without-going-nuclear.html"}, {"text": "Seattle filed a lawsuit Wednesday over President Trump\u2019s executive order threatening to cut off federal funding for cities offering to protect illegal immigrants.\n\nMayor Ed Murray said the order issued in January punishing sanctuary cities is unconstitutional and creates uncertainty around the city\u2019s budget.\n\nThe city said it anticipates at least $55 million in federal funds to support operating expenses, nearly $100 million in capital project support and about $2.6 million from Justice Department grants this year, Q13 Fox reported.\n\n\u201cThe federal government cannot compel our police department to enforce federal immigration law and cannot use our federal dollars to coerce Seattle into turning our backs on our immigrant and refugee communities.

An Associated Press analysis this week found that HB2 already will cost the state more than $3.76 billion in lost business over a dozen years.\n\nThe new proposal would repeal HB2 but would leave state legislators in charge of policy on public multi-stall restrooms. Local governments also couldn't pass ordinances extending nondiscrimination covering things like sexual orientation and gender identity until December 2020. That temporary moratorium, according to House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger, would allow time for pending federal litigation over transgender issues to play out.\n\n\"Compromise requires give and take from all sides, and we are pleased this proposal fully protects bathroom safety and privacy,\" Berger and Moore said in a prepared statement.\n\nMoore and Berger made the announcement after several hours of private meetings among lawmakers, with the two shuttling between their corner offices at the Legislative Building. GOP lawmakers and Cooper have been grappling for months over what to do about HB2, which the Republican-controlled legislature passed in response to a Charlotte ordinance that allowed transgender people to use restroom aligned with their gender identity.\n\nCooper narrowly defeated GOP Gov.

NRDC has been cited by lower courts more than 15,000 times.\n\nSupporters contend that judges do not have the expertise of staffers at the federal agencies and that it allows the government to be nimble and respond to new threats.\n\nGorsuch has gone out of his way to raise questions about the Chevron doctrine, including writing a separate concurring opinion a case last year before the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals called Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch in which he also wrote the majority opinion.\n\nAt his hearing, witnesses and Democratic senators hammered him over the issue.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) argued in her opening statement that \"modern agency decisions include things like rules protecting public safety, requirements against lead-based paint, and clean water protections for our Great Lakes.\"\n\nPrior to the hearing, more than 100 civil rights organizations that oppose Gorsuch argued in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee that the judge \"would relegate this vital precedent to the dustbin of history because it disfavors the corporate interests he championed as a lawyer and as a judge.\"\n\nBut Malcolm, of the Heritage Foundation, said federal bureaucrats naturally see fewer limits on their ability to act.\n\n\"Agencies, if it were up them, would broadly interpret their authority,\" he said. \"Agencies pushing the envelope are not unique to Democratic administrations.\"\n\nPat Parenteau, a professor at Vermont School of Law, agreed.\n\n\"It's been important to every administration,\" he said. \"It will also be important to the Trump administration.\"\n\nParenteau said there are many instances in which judges could interpret the law as requiring more regulation than what federal agencies have interpreted.\n\n\"Gorsuch may surprise Trump in the way that [former Supreme Court Justice David] Souter surprised George H.W.

The president and his allies have argued that their bill would invalidate enough of ObamaCare to return free choices to health care and to fulfill their campaign promises. Neither side has prevailed.\n\nHere is the back story.\n\nWhen Congress passed ObamaCare in 2010, it did so without a single Republican vote. The premise underlying the highly partisan 2,700-page legislation is that health care is a right belonging to everyone in America and the federal government has a constitutional duty to provide it.\n\nThe political structure of ObamaCare mandates that every person in America obtain health insurance, that every employer of more than 50 people in America pay for the health insurance of all employees who work more than 30 hours per week, that every policy of health insurance cover a large dimension of potential medical needs and that those earning under a certain annual income level receive health care at the expense of the rest of us. The failure to obtain and maintain health insurance triggers a tax burden -- equivalent to the annual premium on a health insurance policy -- for every year one goes without coverage.\n\nThe economic structure of ObamaCare requires 100 percent participation of everyone in America so as to ensure a large pool of insurance premiums -- whether paid by individuals, employers or taxpayers -- from which to pay health care providers. Still, premiums don\u2019t cover costs, which is why President Trump says ObamaCare is collapsing.\n\nThe regulatory structure of ObamaCare orders every primary care physician to keep all medical records on personal computers, to which the Department of Health and Human Services has access. Thus, the long-revered and uniquely American value of the patient-physician privilege -- the certain knowledge that your doctor will not reveal what you tell her or him -- has been obliterated. The statute also has given the secretary of HHS unreviewable powers to regulate intricacies of the delivery of health care in America.\n\nAlong with this expensive and bitter medicine -- which has caused hundreds of thousands of folks to downgrade to part-time work, reduced the wages of millions more and driven thousands of health care providers into retirement or new occupations -- ObamaCare also has provided some sugar. The statute orders insurance carriers to cover pre-existing conditions, children on their parents\u2019 policies up to the age of 26 and expensive elective procedures, such as abortions and sex reassignment.\n\nAfter the Republicans acquired full control of Congress in 2015, they delivered numerous repeals of ObamCare to President Barack Obama, knowing that he\u2019d veto them, which he did. These were complete repeals -- essentially removing the federal government from the regulation of health insurance and the delivery of health care.\n\nNow that Republicans control Congress and the White House, you\u2019d expect that they would do the same, as they have promised. No such thing has happened. The legislation that Republican House leaders offered last week retained the basic premise of ObamaCare -- that health care is a right and the federal government has a duty to provide it -- and just nibbled a bit at the edges.\n\nUnder the House proposal, the obligation to have health insurance would remain, but you couldn't expect it from your employer; you might have to pay for it yourself. And the penalty for the failure to have coverage would not be a tax from the IRS; it would be a $3,000 annual surcharge from your insurance carrier when you sign up. You could buy insurance tailored to your needs, but nearly all remaining federal regulations would stay in place -- including a new Orwellian one that would permit your employer to require you to undergo genetic screening.\n\nThis ObamaCare lite has been resisted by about 30 House Republicans who reject the premise that health care is a right. Without their votes, it would not have passed last week, so the House leadership declined to hold a vote.\n\nIs health care a right in America?\n\nIn a word, no. Rights are either natural immunities -- existing in areas of human behavior that, because of our nature, must be free from government regulation, such as life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, as well as speech, the press, religion, travel, self-defense and what remains of privacy -- or legal claims that we qualify or bargain for, such as the right to vote, which the Constitution presumes, and the right to use your property to the exclusion of all others and the right to purchase a good that you can afford.\n\nBut the federal government cannot create a right that the Constitution does not authorize. It can\u2019t constitutionally transfer wealth from taxpayers or employers to others and then claim that the others have a right to the continued receipt of the transfers. The Supreme Court has ruled that even Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are government largesse that Congress could terminate because no one has a right to them.\n\nOf course, the federal government has been creating expectations that it calls rights for centuries. To stay in office, members of Congress bribe the rich with bailouts, the middle class with tax cuts and the poor with made-up rights to all sorts of things.\n\nYet under the Constitution, health care is not a right; it is a good -- like an education or a gym membership. You work hard, you decide what goods to purchase. If government gives you the good, that does not magically transform it into a right. Bravo to the courageous House Republicans who recognize this.\n\nAndrew P.

Gen. Mark Brilakis, deputy commandant for Marine Corps Manpower and Reserve Affairs, said that while retention has not been an overall problem for Marine Corps aviation, the multi-year drawdown from 202,000 troops to the current end strength of 182,000 left the aviation community somewhat imbalanced and short on experienced company-grade officers.\n\n\"The F-35 and V-22 [Osprey] are currently growing communities, and we don't want to be caught short in those aviation communities,\" Brilakis said. \"We have fewer company-grade officers than we really need to be flying in our tactical squadrons. So we want to be sure that we have the opportunity and leverage to maintain those young officers as they come out of their required commitment to us and capture them for that extra bit of time.\"\n\nCommandant Gen. Robert Neller is submitting a request to the secretary of defense and the secretary of the Navy to offer retention bonuses in three communities: F/A-18 Hornet pilots as well as F-35s and V-22s, Brilakis said.\n\nWhile F-35s are new and the V-22 program continues to grow, the legacy Hornet platform has been most challenged in recent years, with pilots struggling to reach monthly flight-hour goals as aging aircraft are increasingly unavailable due to needed maintenance and spare parts.\n\nThe bonuses, requested to begin in fiscal 2018, which begins Oct. 1, are likely to be a temporary offer. Brilakis said the Marine Corps has made up for a dip in pilot retention amid the drawdown with a robust recruitment program that promises to flood the junior aviator ranks in coming years.\n\n\"I've got just over 500 officers still in the training pipeline, more than I need,\" he said.\n\nOn the enlisted side, the Marine Corps is offering new monetary enticements for those with experience and talent.\n\nIn addition to retention bonuses already paid to enlisted maintainers, the service plans to add a \"kicker\" additional payment for Marines willing to re-enlist and commit to stay in their squadron for another 24 months maintaining their current capabilities, Brilakis said. He did not say how much the kicker payment would total, but said it would begin in the next fiscal year.\n\n\"More often than not, a Marine who re-enlists has a location option. He may want to go to recruiting duty or to the drill field because our Marines serve across the Marine Corps,\" Brilakis said.\n\n\"This bonus is going to take that hard-won experience at the senior sergeant, staff NCO level, and retain it in the squadron in certain numbers so they can train the next generation in those certification requirements,\" he said. \"That's new for us.\"\n\nWhile the Marine Corps is paying attention to financial incentives, Brilakis said a survey the Corps conducted about 18 months ago found competitive commercial pay did not feature in the top three reasons that persuaded Marines in the aviation community to leave. The first, he said, was the struggle to complete flight hours; after that came scarcity of parts; then the high operational tempo and tight deployment cycle for squadrons.\n\nBrilakis said the Corps is open to using more tools, such as the service's career intermission program or partnerships with industry, to develop more ways to retain experienced pilots.\n\n-- Hope Hodge Seck can be reached at hope.seck@military.com.

She has served on the Council on Foreign Relations and the Senate Armed Services Committee, among others, and was executive director of the Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism in 2008-2009.\n\nExpand / Contract Farkas was one of the Obama administration's go-to people on Russia.\n\nIn an appearance on MSNBC earlier this month, Farkas told Mika Brezinski about her role in the efforts to collect intelligence on Trump\u2019s team, and their alleged ties with Russia, in the Obama adminstration\u2019s final days.\n\n\u201cI was urging my former colleagues and, frankly speaking, the people on the Hill... get as much information as you can,\" Farkas said, adding that her big fear was \"if [Trump staffers] found out how we knew what we knew about their ... the Trump staff dealing with Russians \u2013 that they would try to compromise those sources and methods, meaning we no longer have access to that intelligence.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the interview, Farkas said, \"we have good intelligence on Russia... that's why you have the leaking. People are worried.\"\n\nFarkas was responding to a report in The New York Times suggesting the \"Obama Administration Rushed to Preserve Intelligence of Russian Election Hacking.\"\n\nFarkas notably served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia/Ukraine/Eurasia under President Obama, and parted ways with the White House in 2015 after some five years amid the ongoing debate over how to respond to Russia's role in the unfolding conflict in Ukraine. Farkas reportedly supported Ukraine's request for weapons in the fight against Russian-backed rebels. The White House opted to send millions in \"nonlethal\" aid.\n\nOn May 6, 2014, Farkas told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Russia's actions threatened to upend the international peace \"that we and our allies have worked to build since the end of the Cold War.\"\n\nNews of her resignation broke just over a year later, at the end of September 2015. It was on Sept. 28, 2015, that President Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin met on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.\n\nAt the time, a senior U.S. defense official said Farkas\u2019 departure was not related to a policy dispute and that she was leaving the job after five years for an opportunity outside of government. Her resignation also came just days after Gen. John Allen announced his departure as the point person for ISIS policy at the State Department.\n\nFarkas would go on to serve as a foreign policy advisor for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, telling the New Yorker earlier this month that she thought Clinton \"got it\" when it came to issues regarding Russia.\n\nRetired Army Major General William L. Nash, a former commander of U.S. forces in Bosnia who was reportedly known for his \"bluntness and political acumen,\" worked with Farkas on the Council on Foreign Relations and speaks highly of his former colleague.\n\n\n\nIn a statement to Fox News, Nash suggested that he found Farkas \"to be of very sound judgment [sic] and high intelligence,\" and that he believed her opinions to be \"quite insightful.\" Nash added that he hopes lawmakers will take advantage of Farkas' \u201cexpertise,\u201d and get to the bottom of what he calls \"the Russian espionage and disinformation campaign in the United States.\"\n\nFarkas has been calling for an independent investigation into the alleged ties between Russia and the President's team for some time.

We just need to sell ourselves better.\"\n\nThe inclination is easy to understand -- PR problems are easier to solve than \"real\" ones. Yet that approach almost always makes matters worse. Take how Ferguson, Missouri hired a PR firm after the shooting of Michael Brown to talk about how the city was a great place to raise a family. It backfired, to say the least.\n\nFacing the Marines United scandal, the Marine Corps is at the same crossroads. It must resist the temptation to treat this is as just a PR crisis. If it doesn't address the root issues, it won't just harm its operational and recruiting capabilities; it will, ironically, also lose the PR war.\n\nThus far, both the commandant and the sergeant major of the Marine Corps appear to be taking this incredibly seriously, but when the current news cycle passes, there will be pressure to return to the status quo.\n\nAs Leona Lansing said to Lucas Pruitt in HBO's \"The Newsroom,\" \"You have a PR problem because you have an actual problem.\"\n\nThat the Marine Corps has an \"actual\" problem should not be up for debate. This \"scandal\" is indicative of broader problems \u2013 and it's nothing new. According to the most recent RAND study on sexual harassment and sexual assault in the military, women in the Marine Corps are the most likely military demographic to experience any type of sexual assault.\n\nBoth Military Times and Task & Purpose reported as early as 2012 on the use of social media by Marines to harass and degrade women, both inside and outside the Corps. Each time, the Marine Corps salutes smartly and promises change, citing the Department of Defense's zero-tolerance policy, yet these order and discipline issues re-emerge.\n\nAs Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) asked Gen. Robert Neller, \"Why should we believe that it's going to be different this time?\"\n\nThe difference must be that the Marine Corps takes this seriously as a problem within the Corps, and not a PR nightmare to be papered over.\n\nFurther, this is a strategic issue in addition to a moral issue, though the immorality of sharing nude photos of your \"sisters in arms,\" shouldn't be lost on anyone. This could cause tremendous long-term damage to the Marine Corps' efforts to recruit women.\n\nNeller has testified as to the increased strength women bring to the Marine Corps, setting recruitment goals to hit 10 percent female accessions -- a feat that will likely be unachievable in the wake of this scandal.\n\nIn recent Senate Armed Services Committee hearings, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called this \"devastatingly bad\" for the Corps' ability to recruit women, pressing both the commandant and sergeant major of the Marine Corps on whether they could in good faith tell a daughter to join the service right now.\n\nIf the Corps doesn't handle the underlying issues, it will get hammered when a similar scandal inevitably breaks, losing the PR war and yet again breaking faith with the women Neller is asking to trust him.\n\nIt will not be able to rely on the crisis communications playbook, which is to point to all of your efforts to combat the problem and show the world that you take the issue even more seriously than they do. Rather, it will face damning questions such as, \"Why have you still not addressed this issue?\" and \"Why did something as awful as Marines sharing naked pictures of their brethren not spur you to action?\"\n\nSuch questions, of course, would put the Corps in a no-win situation.\n\nThis isn't to say that the Marine Corps shouldn't pursue a PR reclamation project in addition to its efforts to address underlying issues. It should absolutely let Congress, the media and the public know about its efforts to fix the problem by taking proactive steps to counteract the command climate and culture in which these issues arose.\n\nThis must begin with real change -- strongly considering the integration of basic recruit training, retraining current members of the Corps on acceptable language and behavior toward women, and aggressively punishing Marines who continue to perpetuate these attitudes.\n\nThe cornerstone of any efforts will be punishing the guilty and holding commanding officers accountable in the wake of this and similar scandals. That is the only way the Corps can reassure the women it wants to recruit that it will be a place where talent and service is valued more than gender.\n\nIf Marine Corps leadership, however, wraps itself in the comfortable belief that all it needs to do is communicate better, it will make the problem far worse. It will fail in its mission.\n\n-- If you would like to submit your own commentary, please send your article to opinions@military.com for consideration.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/03/29/memo-to-marine-corps-dont-pretend-its-just-pr-problem.html"}, {"text": "The Trump administration\u2019s pivot from health care to taxes should find a receptive audience.

Chris Christie to lead the fight.\n\nTrump convened an emotional roundtable Wednesday with Christie, members of his Cabinet, law enforcement chiefs, recovering addicts and advocates. It was the first public event tied to the launch of a new addiction commission that Christie, a longtime Trump friend and formal rival, will chair.\n\nTrump listened intently as Vanessa Vitolo and AJ Solomon, two recovering addicts from New Jersey, described their harrowing battles with substance abuse. Both became hooked on prescription pain killers, and quickly transitioned to heroin.\n\nTrump also heard from a mother whose son died from an overdose after a long battle with addition. Her son, Trump told the mother, hadn't died in vain.\n\nWOULD LEGALIZING POT CURB THE OPIOD EPIDEMIC?\n\n\"We want to help those who have become so badly addicted. Drug abuse has become a crippling problem throughout the United States,\" said Trump, citing statistics that show drug overdose is now the leading cause of accidental death in the country. \"This is a total epidemic and I think it's probably, almost un-talked about compared to the severity that we're witnessing.\"\n\nChristie, a longtime friend of the president, headed Trump's presidential transition before he was unceremoniously replaced by incoming Vice President Mike Pence in the days after the election due to disagreements over its direction.\n\nWhile the governor has long maintained that he plans to complete his last year in office before moving to the private sector, speculation remains that he is eyeing a top job in the administration, and people close to him have said he is open to potentially joining it one day.\n\nDR. MANNY: WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT THE OPIOD EPIDEMIC?\n\nChristie told The Associated Press earlier Wednesday that he has \"no interest in having a permanent role\" in the Trump administration at this time, but that he was happy to spearhead the anti-drug effort.\n\nChristie has made the issue of addiction a centerpiece of his administration and spoke extensively about it during his own presidential bid. He has dedicated his final year in office to addressing the drug crisis. Last month, he signed legislation that limits first-time opioid prescriptions to five days' worth of drugs and requires state-regulated health insurers to cover at least six months of substance abuse treatment.\n\n\"This issue causes enormous pain and destruction to everyday families in every state in this country,\" said Christie, who has been working behind the scenes with White House officials since shortly after Trump's inauguration.\n\nTrump promised during his campaign to stop drugs from \"pouring\" into the country, and said the new group would work with local officials, law enforcement, medical professionals and addicts to improve treatment options, prevent people from getting hooked in the first place and stop the flow of drugs across the border.\n\nOPIOD RX ABUSE PROBE SEES 31 DOCTORS HIT WITH SANCTIONS IN NEW JERSEY\n\n\"Drug cartels have spread their deadly industry across our nation, and the availability of cheap narcotics \u2014 ...some of it comes in cheaper than candy \u2014 has devastated our communities,\" he said.\n\nBut critics say that Trump's actions as president so far undermine his rhetoric. The failed GOP \"Obamacare\" replacement bill that Trump pushed to pass sought to end the Medicaid expansion, which provides substance abuse and mental health treatment.

The issue became personal more than a decade later, when one of Christie's best friends from law school developed an addiction to prescription drugs and died of an overdose in a New Jersey motel.\n\nThe focus also gives Christie a chance to try to move past negative headlines that have helped fuel his unpopularity in New Jersey.\n\nAs Christie was appearing at the White House, two former aides were sentenced for their roles in the 2013 George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal. Bill Baroni was sentenced to two years in prison, while co-defendant Bridget Kelly was sentenced to 18 months after they were convicted last November on counts including wire fraud, conspiracy and misusing the bridge for improper purposes.\n\nThe scandal derailed Christie's presidential aspirations and may have cost him a chance to be then-GOP nominee Trump's running mate \u2014 a role Christie openly courted.\n\nSeveral of Christie's former aides now work in the Trump administration.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/29/trump-christie-pledge-to-combat-nations-opioid-addiction.html"}, {"text": "Ivanka Trump is joining her father's administration as an official employee.\n\nThe first daughter announced Wednesday that she will serve as an unpaid employee in the White House.\n\n\"I have heard the concerns some have with my advising the President in my personal capacity while voluntarily complying with all ethics rules and I will instead serve as an unpaid employee in the White House Office, subject to all of the same rules as other federal employees,\" she said in a statement. \"Throughout this process I have been working closely and in good faith with the White House Counsel and my personal counsel to address the unprecedented nature of my role.\"\n\nTrump previously announced she was getting a West Wing office and a security clearance, but would not officially join the administration.

What we don\u2019t know is whether Democrats will be in any condition to take advantage to take such an opportunity.\n\nWe saw Tuesday that the purge of the Democratic National Committee is underway as its two-headed leadership team of Chairman Tom Perez and his deputy, Keith Ellison, tried to get a grip on what can only be described as a failed institution.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that the DNC, which was essentially moribund in the Obama era needs an overhaul. But to what purpose?\n\nThe Republican autopsy conducted after the party\u2019s 2012 embarrassment looks hilarious in hindsight. Republicans vowed to focus on outreach to minorities and women with an attitude of inclusiveness and readiness to lead. Let\u2019s just say they went another way on that one\u2026\n\nRepublicans won not by embracing America\u2019s demographic shift or courting younger voters but rather by an overt appeal to what President Trump calls \u201cforgotten men and women,\u201d a reference to his surprising support among traditionally Democratic blue-collar white voters of the upper Midwest.\n\nRepublicans reached the wrong conclusion on the way forward because they made the wrong assumption on why they lost in 2012, or at least over emphasized one of the reasons for their defeat.\n\nYes, Mitt Romney was the pits with younger voters and non-white voters but he also failed to generate anything like the support that George W. Bush had in the Rust Belt.\n\nRepublicans created for themselves a false choice between diversification and building up their core. Now it would seem to be Democrats\u2019 turn to do the same thing.\n\nData whiz Nate Cohn at the NYT and his team just finished a long look at the 2016 results. They finally had the voter files to tell them how expectations matched up with reality on the ground in swing states.\n\nTheir findings should be sobering for the Democrats urging their party to take a leftward lunge in a bid to recreate Barack Obama\u2019s successful coalition.\n\nConventional wisdom holds that Hillary Clinton lost because Democrats didn\u2019t turn out to vote while Trump\u2019s army stormed the polls. Cohn found plenty of evidence that support for Clinton, especially in African-American precincts, was relatively meager compared to Obama\u2019s. And, they also found higher than expected turn out among white voters across most states.\n\nBut that\u2019s hardly the whole story.\n\nCohn & Co. found that the surge in white voters didn\u2019t just come among Trump\u2019s forgotten. The greatest increases among white voters were found among those who were younger and unaffiliated. Long story short: White voters surged for Clinton to almost as great a degree as they did for Trump.\n\nAnd as far as the supposedly weak performance among minority voters, a slight surge in Hispanic voters should have compensated for the modest falling away among black constituents.\n\nThe answer, according to the study\u2019s findings, is that the big driver in 2016 was persuasion. Obama voters switched to Trump.\n\nHere\u2019s Cohn:\n\n\u201cTake Schuylkill County, Pa., the county where Mr. Trump made his biggest gains in Pennsylvania. He won, 69 percent to 26 percent, compared with Mitt Romney\u2019s 56-42 victory. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s vote tally fell by 7,776 compared with Mr. Obama\u2019s 2012 result, even though the overall turnout was up.\n\nDid 8,000 of Mr. Obama\u2019s supporters stay home? No. There were 5,995 registered voters who voted in 2012, remain registered in Schuylkill County, and stayed home in 2016.\n\nThere were 2,680 registered Democrats, 2,629 registered Republicans and 686 who were unaffiliated or registered with a different party. This is a place where registered Democrats often vote Republican in presidential elections, so Mr. Obama\u2019s standing among these voters was most likely even lower.\u201d\n\nThe evidence is overwhelming the huge numbers of Obama voters across America shifted to Trump. This is hard for partisans and ideologues to believe since they flatter themselves with the thought that voters are primarily responding to policies and not personalities.\n\nWe know the truth: every election is a character election. Voters will support very liberal people and very conservative people, but it\u2019s always about the people.\n\nTrump\u2019s over-the-top antics may not have appealed to urban and suburban Democrats. But for those who felt left behind by their party and utterly neglected by Clinton, a candidate they did not like or trust, the Republican\u2019s bluster might have sounded like hurricane-force winds that would blow over Washington.\n\nThis is apparently lost on many in the Democratic leadership who believe maximal opposition to Trump, even on something like his well-regarded Supreme Court nominee, is the path back to majority. That\u2019s not to say that they have to indulge Trump in his every whim, but it is to say that will not nearly be enough.\n\nJust as Republicans should have taken a two-pronged approach after 2012 and found a way to strengthen their core while expanding their capabilities, Democrats now seem to be leaning towards similarly simplistic thinking.\n\nObama\u2019s coalition did include younger voters and minorities. But guess who else it included? White people in places like Schuylkill County, Pa.\n\nA party that cannot craft a message that appeals to both groups might win an occasional narrow victory but will never produce a governing majority.\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: HELLOOOO, OMAHA!\n\n\u201cAs the natural limit of a democracy is that distance from the central point which will just permit the most remote citizens to assemble as often as their public functions demand\u2026 so the natural limit of a republic is that distance from the centre which will barely allow the representatives to meet as often as may be necessary for the administration of public affairs.\u201d \u2013 Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 14\n\nTIME OUT: THAT\u2019S A LOT OF CRICKETS\n\nWaPo: \u201cSpiders mostly eat insects, although some of the larger species have been known to snack on lizards, birds and even small mammals.

Martin Nyffeler and Klaus Birkhofer published their estimate in the journal the Science of Nature earlier this month, and the number they arrived at is frankly shocking: The world's spiders consume somewhere between 400 million and 800 million tons of prey in any given year. That means that spiders eat at least as much meat as all 7 billion humans on the planet combined, who the authors note consume about 400 million tons of meat and fish each year.\u201d\n\nFlag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with\n\nyour tips, comments or questions.\n\nFORMER OBAMA OFFICIAL DETAILS BID TO BLOW OUT RUSSIA INTEL\n\nFox News: \u201cA former top Obama administration official has acknowledged efforts by her colleagues to gather intelligence on Trump team ties to Russia before Donald Trump took office and to conceal the sources of that intelligence from the incoming administration.

New Yorker: \u201cSince last Monday\u2019s hearing, Nunes, who was a member of the Trump transition team, has spoken repeatedly about the issue of incidental collection, the intelligence community\u2019s term for the communications of innocent Americans that can be swept up when the N.S.A. or other agencies legally spy on a foreign target. The Russian Ambassador, a legal target of surveillance, was recorded talking to Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national-security adviser, who was a victim of incidental collection.

Tom Cole told Fox News. \u2018The last thing we need is a self-inflicted crisis. \u2026 There frankly isn\u2019t much time.\u2019 Voters largely blamed congressional Republicans for the last shutdown, in 2013, when they engaged in a budget standoff with Senate Democrats and President Obama over ObamaCare funding.\u201d\n\nWhy the White House is in for a tough battle with tax reform - Atlantic: \u201cTax reform has never been simple. The last time Washington passed a comprehensive tax overhaul, in 1986, the plan took almost two years to go from first draft to presidential signature. Ronald Reagan saw the first copy just three weeks after his reelection win, on November 26, 1984. The plan faced stiff opposition on K Street and almost fell apart immediately. Within weeks, one of its chief architects, Treasury Secretary Donald Regan, was the subject of so much bureaucratic sniping and vicious media leaks that he begged the president to allow him to resign.\u201d\n\nHurt\u2019s So Good: What\u2019s in the \u2018hot blather\u2019 - The sage of Pittsylvania County, Charles Hurt, explains what the failure of TrumpCare really means: \u201cAll the failure of this bill means \u2013 once you mute all the hot blather and red-faced hyperventilating around here \u2013 is that this specific repeal-and-replace bill was not appealing enough to get the necessary votes to pass the U.S. House\u2026So why is everybody around here going absolutely berserk over the demise of the GOP\u2019s repeal-and-replace plan? \u2026The only reason all these people are freaking out right now is because they are desperate to blame Mr. Trump and Republicans for everything that goes wrong.\u201d\n\nMCCONNELL VOWS: GORSUCH WILL BE CONFIRMED NEXT WEEK\n\nFox News: \u201cJust weeks after House Speaker Paul Ryan guaranteed the Republican ObamaCare replacement bill would pass the House, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell guaranteed President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court pick will be confirmed. \u2018He\u2019ll be on the floor of the Senate next week and confirmed on Friday,\u2019 McConnell said, according to Politico. \u2018We are optimistic that [Dems] will not be successful in keeping this good man from joining the Supreme Court real soon.\u2019 McConnell refused to say whether or not he would employ the \u2018nuclear\u2019 option to confirm Hon.

Republicans hold 52 seats.\u201d\n\nBut can he deliver? - Fox News: \u201cWith 52 Republicans and 48 Democrats in the chamber, the majority party needs eight Democrats to join them to break a filibuster (which takes 60 votes). All Republicans are expected to back the nominee. But if they can't get to 60, they could deploy the so-called \u2018nuclear option\u2019 to lower the threshold and push through to confirmation on a simple majority -- a major change in Senate precedent.\u201d\n\n\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\n\nHouse Republicans block Dem resolution to get Trump tax returns - The Hill\n\n\n\nRep.

Twenty years ago, when I started as a full-time reporter, the internet was a little curiosity. After it ate the newspaper industry alive, though, people began to take the little bugger more seriously. The solution for about a decade was thought to be a \u201cmulti-platform\u201d approach in which news organizations sought to have presences in multiple media: print, broadcast, online and puppet theater, or whatever else a consultant could think of to rake a few more dollars off the table. But as consumers have become more sophisticated and news organizations have become more nimble, we\u2019ve come to the realization that people care less about what kind of device they are watching or reading when they consume news then anyone ever imagined. Old blurry lines are being swept away entirely as, thankfully, forward-looking organizations come to the understanding that we will be judged by our product, not our platforms.]\n\nShare your color commentary: Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM and please make sure to include your name and hometown.\n\n\n\nIT\u2019S ALWAYS THE LAST PLACE YOU LOOK\n\nNY Post: \u201cA 25-year-old Indonesian man was swallowed whole by a python on the island of Sulawesi, villagers and news reports said.

Christopher Millis voiced his concerns in an interview with Fox News over details found within documents provided by North Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall\u2019s office. Marshall told Fox News the Dept. of Homeland Security approved the notary authorizations.\n\nVIDEO: DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKER TIPS OFF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO ICE RAIDS\n\n\u201cWe found over 320 nonpermanent residents that her office commissioned as notaries. Including one that was slated for final deportation,\u201d Millis said. \u201cIt\u2019s very concerning not just the fact that these individuals will have the ability to affirm items like oath, but also the ability in our state for them to certify absentee ballots.\u201d\n\nMillis says these same documents show Marshall\u2019s office regularly accepted Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) cards as forms of identification which he claims on his website are not valid to prove residency. \u201cA DACA card is a temporary employment authorization to facilitate safe and legitimate employment and income for otherwise undocumented aliens but does not confer legal immigration status.\u201d\n\nDACA RECIPIENT WITH ALLEGED GANG TIES FACES RELEASE FROM DETENTION CENTER\n\nMillis stressed these same concerns in a nine-page letter written to Secretary Elaine Marshall on March 27th. He ended the letter by asking for her resignation.\n\n\u201cI make all of these implications very seriously and I\u2019m not making any of this lightly,\u201d Millis said. \u201cWhenever I ask the Secretary to resign immediately or I made it clear to her that I will move through with a resolution for impeachment if she so chooses not to resign.\u201d\n\nIn an email statement to Fox News, Marshall says Millis\u2019 request for her resignation is a political attack by \u201can opponent in a recent election.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security has authorized the specifically mentioned notaries to work here lawfully,\u201d Marshall wrote. \u201cThat federally authorized status continues to be unchanged by the new Presidential administration.\u201d\n\nMillis also said a similar statement was made when this issue became public late last year.\n\n\u201cThis being masked from the public and including a number of misleading and false statements made by the Secretary and her office since the article went out in September and all up until this point, its definitely clear it meets the allegations of her impeachment on malfeasance,\u201d Millis said.\n\nFox News asked Millis what would happen to the notaries in question. His response: \u201cWe will see what happens with these notaries moving forward, but it\u2019s definitely outside the letter of the law.\u201d\n\nTerace Garnier is a Fox News multimedia reporter based in Columbia, South Carolina.

It led the nation in mining jobs, had a vibrant economy and was giving back to its people.\n\nThen a wave of environmental regulations hit, along with an overall shift toward other forms of energy. Aimed at cutting out coal in favor of wind and solar, the changes had devastating effects on towns built around the industry.\n\nSLIDESHOW: WEST VIRGINIA TOWNS SEEK COMEBACK\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been heartbreaking,\u201d Kris Mitchell, director at Boone County Community and Economic Development Corp., told Fox News. \u201cIt impacted every level.\u201d\n\nBut communities like Boone are seeing new hope amid a renewed effort in Washington to peel back red tape and invest once again in coal.\n\n\"My administration is putting an end to the war on coal,\" President Trump said Tuesday as he signed an executive order aimed at rolling back Obama-era regulations.\n\nMINE SAFETY BILLS FIRE UP TENSIONS IN COAL COUNTRY\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re optimistic and hopeful,\u201d Chris Hamilton, senior vice president of the West Virginia Coal Association, told Fox News ahead of the announcement.\n\nHamilton, who started in the industry as a coal miner straight out of high school, said he\u2019s seen renewed confidence and interest in West Virginia coal from the investment community. Since November, there\u2019s been an uptick in pricing levels and growth in certain coal operations that he largely attributes to Trump.\n\nAfter eight years of regulations, \u201cwe have to hang our hope on President Trump,\u201d Hamilton said.\n\nThe future of the industry remains unclear. Democrats ripped Trump's executive order as bad for the environment and claimed it would not actually bring coal jobs back.\n\nIndeed, while regulations have hurt the coal sector, experts say the industry's biggest hurdle is the abundance of cheap natural gas.\n\nGas prices have fallen, making it much more attractive than coal. Another problem is technology. As coal companies have gotten more efficient at extracting coal, fewer workers are needed. Coal\u2019s presence in America\u2019s power market has fallen to 32 percent from about 50 percent a decade ago.\n\nThe bottom line, experts say, is that even though the Obama administration did all it could to kill coal, it wasn\u2019t those policies alone that choked the life from a once-vibrant industry.\n\nStill, Trump's bid to ease regulations is boosting morale, giving coal-mining communities across Appalachia a shot at rebuilding.\n\n\u201cEveryone here is tied to coal,\u201d Mitchell told Fox News. \u201cIt\u2019s in your family. It\u2019s in your blood.\u201d\n\nMitchell grew up in Boone. Her father, now retired, was a coal miner. Her brother was in the industry. One grandfather worked on the railroad while the other worked in a deep mine.\n\nOnce the coal jobs started to dry up, employment plummeted and struggling workers were forced to flee the only place they had called home.\n\nToday, there are boarded-up houses, burned-down lots and displays of deep decay.\n\nBut there are signs of hope.\n\nThe day after Trump\u2019s White House win, coal stock prices soared and many coal communities celebrated what they saw as a comeback.\n\nHamilton says the Trump administration, coupled with a state legislature that has \u201cdemonstrated its interest in seeing coal remain a centerpiece of our state\u2019s economy,\u201d has set the stage for an \u201call-out attempt\u201d to take advantage of this \u201conce-in-a-lifetime opportunity to transform West Virginia into the nation\u2019s capital for coal and energy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good first step,\u201d West Virginia Del. Rupie Phillips told Fox News. He added that the success of coal is dependent on Trump\u2019s promise to bring back manufacturing jobs. That, in turn, he says will work toward driving a real coal revival.\n\nU.S. coal production in 2016 hit its lowest level since 1978. The industry has been pummeled over the past eight years, and between 2011 and 2016, it lost about 60,000 jobs.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in Boone is down a staggering 81 percent over the past five years.\n\nSo can coal come back? In an age of not just surging natural gas production but developments in renewables like wind and solar, the big challenge is to find a way to become the cheapest and best product for the job.\n\nRobert Murray, owner of the world\u2019s largest private coal company, recently told The Columbus Dispatch that Trump\u2019s victory lap might be a bit premature.\n\n\u201cCan the coal industry be brought back?\u201d Murray asked. \u201cThe answer is, I\u2019ve suggested to President Trump that he temper his expectations.\u201d\n\nLearning from painful lessons of the past, the plan forward for Boone \u2013 like for most of West Virginia \u2013 is to diversify.\n\nThere are big pushes for infrastructure reform and a strong coalition working to rebrand the region as a tourist destination.\n\n\u201cTourism is a supplement,\u201d Mitchell said.\n\nCoal, though, will always have a home in Boone County.\n\nMitchell added, \u201cWe will always back coal here because it will always be a part of us. No one will ever give up on coal.\u201d", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/29/coal-towns-see-hope-for-comeback-as-trump-ends-war.html"}, {"text": "Climate change is happening; the question is what to do about it. President Obama had one answer: reduce greenhouse-gas emissions aggressively.\n\nUnfortunately, his approach was heavy on cost and light on benefit, and with yesterday\u2019s executive order rolling back those efforts, President Trump has rightly begun the process of reversing it.\n\nBut President Trump's own response to climate change appears to be: nothing. That\u2019s not the right answer either.\n\nMost climate policy falls into one of two categories: There is \u201cmitigation,\u201d which means trying to prevent climate change by reducing greenhouse-gas emissions -- think wind farms. And then there is \u201cadaptation,\u201d which means dealing well with whatever change occurs -- think sea walls.\n\nThe basic problem with Obama\u2019s mitigation-focused approach is that the overwhelming majority of future emissions will come from the developing world as it grows rapidly. U.S. policy has shown little ability to influence that trend, even when we make brave commitments to incur large costs ourselves.\n\nWe can -- and should -- invest in developing new technologies that might reduce emissions more cheaply, but that takes time, and success is not guaranteed.\n\nWithout major mitigation, though, adaptation becomes all the more important. And that is a place where good American policy can make a major difference.\n\nFor instance, continued research into the likely effects of climate change can inform policymakers and private actors about what to expect, so that they can make better investments.\n\nIf certain areas of the country are likely to get wetter or drier, hotter or colder, we should want to know that. Yet the Trump Administration seems inclined -- at least so far -- to dismiss such research and cut its funding as aggressively as possible.\n\nThe instinct is understandable, given the research sloppily conducted or misappropriated for activist ends under the previous Administration.\n\nThe Obama-era EPA's \u201cClimate Change Impacts and Risk Analysis\u201d project, for example, managed to conclude that the rate of heat-related deaths for New York in the year 2100 would be 50 times higher than it was for Phoenix in 2000 -- even though New York would be nowhere near as hot in 2100 as Phoenix is already.\n\nBut that egregious effort does not make good research less valuable. It just underscores the need for research to be well focused and insulated from politics.\n\nSimilarly, we should want government planners at every level to take the best existing research into account as they make public investments and set policy that will influence others.\n\nIf farmers and resort owners and mayors and naval planners all build with an eye toward how the future might change, then those changes as they arrive won\u2019t be so harmful or expensive.\n\nYet, in addition to starting the repeal of costly mitigation efforts like Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan, Trump\u2019s executive order entirely erases an Obama order aimed at \u201cpreparing the United States for the impacts of Climate Change.\u201d Many of the points in that program still make sense.\n\nPerhaps the greatest mistake made by those who overinflate the risk of climate change is to forget that our society has a tremendous capacity to adapt and innovate. But it would also be a major mistake to forget that public policy can either foster or hinder that process.\n\nIf President Trump dislikes his predecessor\u2019s approach to adaptation he should put forward an alternative. Ignoring the problem entirely is one of the few things he can do that really would make it worse.\n\nOren Cass is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/03/29/trump-is-wrong-on-climate-change.html"}, {"text": "Say the word \u201cbipartisan\u201d and hopeful hearts go aflutter.

Chris Christie was back at the White House Wednesday as he took the lead in President Trump\u2019s fight against the opioid addiction crisis.\n\nChristie is being named to lead a presidential task force on the issue, and joined Trump Wednesday for a listening session on opioid and drug abuse.\n\n\"[Drug addiction] is really one of the biggest problems our country has and no one wants to talk about it,\" Trump said.\n\nChristie, who frequently shared his personal connection to the opioid epidemic during his unsuccessful presidential bid, is now the face of this new effort. He made the rounds on the morning news shows, calling for a new approach to treatment and other areas.\n\n\u201cThis is an epidemic in our country and what this task force hopes to do is look at the issue of prevention, obviously the interdiction of drugs before they come to our country, but also and very importantly the issue of treatment,\u201d Christie told \"Fox & Friends.\" \u201cAddiction is a disease and we need to treat it that way and we need to give people help they need, to renew their lives and be productive members to society.\u201d\n\nChristie is taking on the portfolio just months before his term is set to end next January. His future has remained unclear ever since he was passed over for a Cabinet position in the Trump administration.\n\nBut while the governor's job heading up the commission is a volunteer post, it could signal an opening into a more formal role -- perhaps in the Office of National Drug Control Policy, whose top 'drug czar' post has yet to be filled.\n\nAsked Wednesday by Fox News about the post, a White House official said an announcement is expected \"very soon.\" The position currently is held on an interim basis by Obama appointee Michael Botticelli.\n\nOverall, it's been a tumultuous few years for Christie. The 2013 George Washington Bridge lane-closure scandal has continued to dog his administration, with a judge announcing sentences for key figures as Christie was in Washington Wednesday. While Christie served as head of the Trump transition team, he was abruptly replaced by then Vice President-elect Mike Pence, amid rumblings of a feud between Christie and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose father Christie once prosecuted.\n\nBut the new post puts Christie in charge of an issue with which he has deep familiarity.\n\nChristie made fighting heroin and prescription drug addiction a central part of his governorship in New Jersey, particularly in the last year. Christie has a personal stake in the issue after a close friend of his died of an overdose in 2014, a story he recalled often during the presidential campaign. In February, he signed legislation that imposes a five-day limit for first-time opioid prescriptions and requires insurance companies cover six months of substance abuse treatment.\n\nDrug addiction among working-class communities also was an ever-present topic during Trump\u2019s campaign. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Wednesday that it is a top priority for the administration.\n\n\u201cStopping this epidemic is an issue that every American regardless of political background can and must get behind,\u201d he said.\n\nChristie's assignment may also be a sign a thawing of relations between Christie and Kushner. The drug commission is being rolled out in part by Kushner, and the Associated Press reported the two had lunch Tuesday where they discussed policy.\n\nChristie and his wife also had dinner with Trump last month at the White House, at which they discussed drug policy.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nAdam Shaw is a Politics Reporter and occasional Opinion writer for FoxNews.com.

Chris Christie were sentenced to prison Wednesday for their role in a political revenge plot involving traffic jams at the country's busiest bridge, a scandal that sank the Republican's presidential aspirations.\n\nBridget Kelly, 44, was sentenced to 18 months and Bill Baroni, 45, was sentenced to two years after they were convicted for their roles in the 2013 George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal.\n\nBoth must also serve 500 hours of community service.\n\nThey had been convicted in November of all the counts against them, including wire fraud, conspiracy and misusing the bridge for improper purposes. They had sought probation.\n\nU.S. Judge Susan Wigenton told Baroni he misled a legislative committee when he tried to pass the gridlock off as a legitimate traffic study and later misled the jury with the same contention.\n\n\"It was completely intended to wreak havoc,\" she said. \"It only served a punitive purpose. You clearly knew, and know today, that it was not\" legitimate.\n\nKelly, who sent the infamous \"time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee\" email, wiped her eyes with a tissue when she was sentenced after Baroni and apologized, saying she never intended to cause harm.\n\n\"I accept responsibility for the tone of my emails and texts,\" she said. \"My emails and texts were disrespectful and I am absolutely embarrassed by them. They don't reflect who I am.\"\n\nThe government's star witness, David Wildstein, testified that he and the co-defendants had sought to retaliate against the Democratic mayor of nearby Fort Lee for not endorsing Christie's re-election. Fort Lee was plunged into gridlock for four days in September 2013. Text messages and emails produced at trial showed Mayor Mark Sokolich's increasingly desperate pleas for help being ignored by Kelly and Baroni.\n\n\"I let a lot of people down who believed in me and relied on me. Most of all I let Mark Sokolich down. That was my choice and my responsibility. And I made the wrong choice,\" Baroni told the judge.\n\n\"I was wrong and I am truly sorry, and I've waited three years to say that,\" he said.\n\nSokolich said that the sentence was fair and that he hopes Baroni \"gets through things and resumes his life\" after he serves his term.\n\n\"I'm not a grudge kind of guy. It's not really in my DNA,\" he said. \"I will tell you I've moved on with this. My responsibility is to the taxpayers of Fort Lee. To devote my energies to venom and dislike, it's not my style.\"\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Lee Cortes said that Baroni's time as a state lawmaker, lawyer and school teacher gave him the experience and judgment to conduct himself ethically.\n\n\"But when Bill Baroni was put to the test and made a choice, he chose to abuse his official power. And then he chose to lie about it,\" Cortes said, calling Baroni's conduct \"brazen, calculated, and a mean-spirited abuse of power\" that had \"real-life consequences on the people he was supposed to serve.\"\n\nThe scandal derailed Christie's presidential aspirations and likely cost him a chance to be President Donald Trump's running mate. While the sentencing was happening Wednesday, Christie was at the White House to launch a drug addiction task force.\n\nQuestions remain over when, and how much, Christie knew about the plan to realign access lanes from Fort Lee to the bridge's upper level. The bi-level bridge is considered the busiest in the country.\n\nAt the time of the traffic jams, Kelly was Christie's deputy chief of staff and Baroni was his appointee to the Port Authority, overseeing Wildstein as deputy executive director. Baroni testified that Wildstein was viewed as Christie's enforcer, and several Port Authority officials testified that he was almost universally disliked at the agency.\n\nWildstein, a former political blogger and classmate of Christie's, was hired as the director of interstate capital projects at the powerful Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the bridge.

But that doesn't mean the force is eating right and making healthy choices, said Col. Michael Watkins, director of the new Force Fitness Division.\n\n\"There's all kinds of great nutrition education out there in terms of nutrition. But there's been a lot of cases where we don't really enforce it,\" he told reporters at Quantico on Tuesday. \"We don't have a consistent theme or haven't had a consistent theme in how we educate Marines in nutrition. It's not that there isn't good information out there, but we haven't had a consistent message and consistent approach to what we teach, and oh by the way, how we enforce it.\"\n\nThe division, he said, is conducting an extensive review of chow hall contracts across the Marine Corps to assess what options are served and how the choices are presented, with attention to color-coding systems and other methods to signal healthy choices on the serving line.\n\nOfficials are considering eliminating or limiting chow hall snack lines at entry-level training courses prior to arrival at the fleet.\n\nOnce troops arrive at their units, he said, it's much more difficult to control what options Marines have. But nutritional experts are examining ways to reinforce good eating habits. Marine Corps senior dietitian Sharlene Holladay and a team that works with her are reviewing not only what's on offer at chow halls but how Marines eat and what factors may influence their choices.\n\n\"[They're] not just looking at the food that's being served, but what are the practices that may impact how long a Marine has to eat -- if it's a heavy training schedule that rushes people through so they can't sit down and consume the meal, or forces them into a bad choice like going through the snack line instead of going through the main line. We're looking at ways we can improve that, almost a Lean Six Sigma kind of approach,\" Watkins said. \"Where can we make improvements so ultimately that Marine gets the nutritional benefit that he should have.\"\n\nLean Six Sigma is a corporate performance improvement process that has been used by the Marine Corps in a variety of applications since 2006.\n\nMarine Corps nutrition professionals have also been working to develop a standardized education package to teach Marines about nutrition and the effects of different kinds of food on performance. These training tools will be made available to force fitness instructors in one effort to unify what has previously been a \"fragmented, disjointed\" approach to fitness training, Watkins said.\n\nUltimately, officials want to have more than 900 noncommissioned officers serving as fitness instructors, one for every 200 Marines. So far, said Joe Shusko, director of the Corps' new Force Fitness Instructor School, the nutrition package has been very popular with instructors-in-training.\n\n\"If there's an hour scheduled just talking about fats, they say, 'No, we want to talk more about it,' because they're not getting it in their schools, they're not getting it in their life,\" Shusko said. \"And we're introducing them to the very basics, and they're like, 'Tell me more, tell me how I can perform better by eating this food versus that.' \"\n\nOf course, there's no guarantee that young Marines, many of whom favor a pizza-and-Red-Bull diet, will react as positively to the Corps' reinforced interest in what they're eating. But Watkins said he wants to emphasize moderation, and help Marines learn how to fuel their bodies with performance goals in mind.\n\n\"It's not that we're taking all the bad stuff out of the chow hall, but again, it's about encouraging Marines to make good choices and limit the bad stuff,\" he said.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/03/29/marine-corps-reviews-chow-hall-options-as-fitness-division-activates.html"}, {"text": "A former top Obama administration official has acknowledged efforts by her colleagues to gather intelligence on Trump team ties to Russia before Donald Trump took office and to conceal the sources of that intelligence from the incoming administration.\n\nEvelyn Farkas, deputy assistant secretary of defense under Obama, made the disclosure March 2 while on the air with MSNBC\u2019s Mika Brzezinski.\n\n\u201cI was urging my former colleagues and, frankly speaking, the people on the Hill, it was more actually aimed at telling the Hill people, get as much information as you can, get as much intelligence as you can, before President Obama leaves the administration,\u201d Farkas, who is now a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said.\n\n\u201cBecause I had a fear that somehow that information would disappear with the senior [Obama] people who left, so it would be hidden away in the bureaucracy ... that the Trump folks \u2013 if they found out how we knew what we knew about their ... the Trump staff dealing with Russians \u2013 that they would try to compromise those sources and methods, meaning we no longer have access to that intelligence.\u201d\n\nThe comments come as lawmakers on Capitol Hill clash over House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes' claim last week that surveillance operations incidentally collected Trump team communications during the transition.

Nunes says there\u2019s no way he is stepping aside.\n\nA brief caveat: This whole mess is awash in partisan politics on both sides.\n\nAt the moment, the House probe seems paralyzed. A hearing that was to be held with former top Obama administration officials, and the panel has scrapped its meetings for the week.\n\nThe recusal uproar follows the revelation that Nunes secretly paid a visit to White House grounds to meet a source who he says showed him evidence indicating that some Trump transition aides were \u201cincidentally\u201d picked up in foreign surveillance, and possibly \u201cunmasked,\u201d to use the intel lingo.\n\nThe optics were, to put it mildly, awful.

If he got the stuff at the White House and then went back to the White House to discuss the material, it all looks rather orchestrated.\n\nThe congressman insists his secret-source visit was on White House grounds because he needed a secure place to view the material. Sean Spicer says the White House didn\u2019t know he was coming.\n\n\u201cI needed a place I could go and find this information and review it\u2026There was no sneaking around,\u201d Nunes told Bill O\u2019Reilly.\n\nBut the Dems and some liberals in the media say the chairman has compromised himself. The committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, Adam Schiff, has called on Nunes to disqualify himself from the probe, as has Nancy Pelosi.\n\nEven John McCain, a fierce critic of Russia, said in a television interview: \u201cIt\u2019s dominating the news.

Spicer called that a \u201cfalse report\u201d and said \u201cthe Washington Post should be ashamed of how they handled the story.\u201d\n\nThe Post (which included the White House denial) said that \u201cthe Justice Department notified Yates earlier this month that the administration considers a great deal of her possible testimony to be barred from discussion in a congressional hearing because the topics are covered by the presidential communication privilege.\u201d But Spicer said that DOJ made no effort to prevent Yates from appearing at the hearing that Nunes has now canceled. The Post has published the letters.\n\nTrump, for his part, tried to give the panel a new assignment, tweeting: \u201cWhy isn't the House Intelligence Committee looking into the Bill & Hillary deal that allowed big Uranium to go to Russia, Russian speech money to Bill, the Hillary Russian \u2018reset,\u2019 praise of Russia by Hillary, or Podesta Russian Company.

They failed.\n\nTrump then tweeted, \"ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great health care plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry!\"\n\nBut I do worry.\n\nTrump is right when he says that ObamaCare will explode.\n\nThe law mandates benefits and offers subsidies to more people. Insurers must cover things like:\n\n--Birth control.\n\n--Alcohol counseling.\n\n--Depression screening.\n\n--Diet counseling.\n\n--Tobacco use screening.\n\n--Breastfeeding counseling.\n\nSome people want those things, but mandating them for everyone drives up costs. It was folly to pretend it wouldn't.\n\nInsisting that lots of things be paid for by someone else is a recipe for financial explosion.\n\nMedicare works that way, too.\n\nWhen I first qualified for it, I was amazed to find that no one even mentioned cost. It was just, \"Have this test!\" \"See this doctor!\"\n\nI liked it. It's great not to think about costs. But that's why Medicare will explode, too. There's no way that, in its current form, it will be around to fund younger people's care.\n\nSomeone else paying changes our behavior. We don't shop around. We don't ask, \"Do I really need that test?\" \"Is there a place where it's cheaper?\"\n\nHospitals and doctors don't try very hard to do things cheaply.\n\nImagine if you had \"grocery insurance.\" You'd buy expensive foods; supermarkets would never have sales. Everyone would spend more.\n\nInsurance coverage -- third-party payment -- is revered by the media and socialists (redundant?) but is a terrible way to pay for things.\n\nToday, 7 in 8 health care dollars are paid by Medicare, Medicaid or private insurance companies. Because there's no real health care market, costs rose 467 percent over the last three decades.\n\nBy contrast, prices fell in the few medical areas not covered by insurance, like plastic surgery and LASIK eye care. Patients shop around, forcing health providers to compete.\n\nThe National Center for Policy Analysis found that from 1999 to 2011 the price of traditional LASIK eye surgery dropped from more than $2,100 to about $1,700.\n\nObamaCare pretended government controls could accomplish the same thing, but they couldn't.\n\nThe sickest people were quickest to sign up. Insurance companies then raised rates to cover their costs. When regulators objected, many insurers just quit Obamacare.\n\nThis month Humana announced it'll leave 11 states.\n\nVoters will probably blame Republicans.\n\nInsurance is meant for catastrophic health events, surprises that cost more than most people can afford. That does not include birth control and diet counseling.\n\nThe solution is to reduce, not increase, government's control. We should buy medical care the way we buy cars and computers -- with our own money.\n\nOur employers don't pay for our food, clothing and shelter; they shouldn't pay for our health care. They certainly shouldn't get a tax break for buying insurance while individuals don't.\n\nGive tax deductions to people who buy their own high-deductible insurance.\n\nGive tax benefits to medical savings accounts. (ObamaCare penalizes them.)\n\nAllow insurers to sell across state lines. Current law forbids that, driving up costs and leaving people with fewer choices.\n\nWhat about the other \"solution\" -- Bernie Sanders' proposal of single-payer health care for all? Sanders claims other countries \"provide universal health care ... while saving money.\"\n\nBut that's not true.\n\nWell, other countries do spend less. But they get less.\n\nWhat modern health care they do get, they get because they freeload off our innovation. Our free market provides most of the world's new medical devices and medicines.\n\nAlso, \"single-payer\" care leads to rationing.\n\nHere's a headline from Britain's Daily Mail: \"Another NHS horror story from Wales: Dying elderly cancer patient left 'screaming in pain' ... for nine hours.\"\n\nBritain's official goal is to treat people four months after diagnosis. Four months! That's only the \"goal.\" They don't even meet that standard.\n\nBernie Sanders' plan has been tried, and it's no cure.\n\nIf it were done to meet American expectations, it would be ludicrously expensive. In 2011, clueless progressives in Bernie's home state of Vermont voted in \"universal care.\" But they quickly dumped it when they figured out what it would cost. Didn't Bernie notice?\n\nIt's time to have government do less.\n\nJohn Stossel is the author of \"No They Can't!

Aaron Schock secretly provided the government with a trove of emails, credit card receipts and other documents that violated the now-indicted congressman's constitutional right against unreasonable search and seizure, his lawyers argue in new court filings.\n\nIt's unclear exactly how information from the staffer-turned-informant shaped prosecutors' corruption allegations against Schock, whose high-flying travel and curious office expenses made news two years ago and drew the attention of the Justice Department. Schock was indicted in 2016 after resigning from Congress the year before.\n\nBut in court documents filed late Tuesday, Schock's attorneys say the government went too far when it transformed the staffer into an informant and required him to wear a wire to secretly record conversations \u2014 in addition to providing more than 10,000 pages of legislative emails, staff rosters, employee records and confidential documents from Schock's district office the defense considers to be stolen property. The informant rummaged through the desk of Schock's chief of staff and taped conversations with other staffers, the attorneys said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office for the Central District of Illinois declined to comment.\n\nThe allegations come in the latest effort by federal prosecutors to convict a U.S. political figure, whom they said used his position to spend lavishly on travel and sports events. If the judge sides with Schock's arguments, it could spell trouble for a Justice Department that has had a mixed record on securing lasting convictions in public corruption cases.\n\nThere's no evidence the informant's use \"produced the 'smoking gun' it no doubt sought by using him,\" Schock's lawyer, George Terwilliger, wrote in a motion asking a judge to force prosecutors to provide more information about the informant's role in the case. \"The government, however, cannot run away from what was produced: a trail of improper \u2014 if not outright illegal \u2014 acts by the (informant) that remain not fully known to the defense in this case.\"\n\nSchock's attorneys say the FBI used the informant to get around restrictions on what a federal agent would not have a right to search and seize. The documents suggest Schock's attorneys will move to have the case dismissed by citing, among other things, alleged illegal searches and prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nUsing an informant is not uncommon in public corruption cases, but they tread a fine constitutional line, said Jeff Cramer, a former federal prosecutor who is not involved in the Schock case.\n\n\"The problems may occur when or if this informant crosses the line starts gathering information at the request of law enforcement that he or she should not be looking for,\" he said. \"When you add a sitting congressman to the calculus it becomes even more fraught with peril.\"\n\nSchock's downfall was as swift as his rise in Congress, having been a young, fresh face of the Republican Party and sought-after fundraiser for fellow GOP candidates. He was an active social media user who chronicled his world travels for business and pleasure.\n\nYet those very Instagram posts, in addition to questions over his office decor and travel expenses, led to a growing list of Schock's troubles. In 2015, The Associated Press relied on location data from his Instagram pictures when it reported he spent taxpayer and campaign funds on flights aboard private planes owned by some of his top donors.\n\nThe indictment charged Schock with wire fraud, falsification of election commission filings, filing false federal income tax returns, making false statements, mail fraud and theft of government funds. It also alleges he spent $40,000 in government funds to redecorate his Washington office in the style of the television series \"Downton Abbey,\" and had asked the House to reimburse him for nearly $30,000 worth of camera equipment.\n\nIt also accused him of running up a $140,000 mileage tab over six years, reimbursements for 150,000 more miles than his vehicles actually traveled. Schock has maintained his innocence and his attorneys have described the case as an attempt to embarrass and humiliate him.

Al Franken, D-Minn.\n\nFranken asked Gorsuch how he could rule in favor of a company that fired a truck driver who abandoned his trailer on the side of an interstate on a -14 degree night. Alphonse Maddin, the driver, noticed that his trailer\u2019s brakes were frozen and his heater did not work.\n\nMaddin unhitched his trailer and drove off to wait somewhere warm.

Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House\u2019s Intelligence committee.\n\n\"I believe the public cannot have the necessary confidence that matters involving the president's campaign or transition team can be objectively investigated or overseen by the chairman,\" he said.\n\nNunes, a California Republican, has thus far declined to step aside, asking, \u201cWhy would I?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is politics,\u201d he said Tuesday, before Jones\u2019 remarks. \u201cI understand that people have to play different sides.\u201d\n\nOn Monday night, Nunes told Fox News' \"The O'Reilly Factor\" that \"there was no sneaking around\" when he met with the secret source behind his claim that Trump's associates were caught up in \"incidental\" surveillance.\n\n\"We go to the executive branch at least once or twice a week,\" he told host Bill O'Reilly. \"This is not unusual, because there are intelligence products that we don\u2019t have access to in the House of Representatives, although we do have the clearances to see them.\"\n\nNunes also has the backing of Rep.

TRUMP\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\nMarch 28, 2017.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/28/executive-order-promoting-energy-independence-economic-growth.html"}, {"text": "The White House fired back Tuesday at a report claiming former acting Attorney General Sally Yates was blocked by Trump administration officials from testifying before the House Intelligence Committee on Russian interference in the 2016 campaign.\n\nYates, an Obama administration appointee who previously served as deputy AG, was fired by President Trump in January after she refused to defend the president's travel ban. The Washington Post reported she was blocked from testifying at a hearing originally expected for Tuesday because the topics she intended to discuss were covered by what's known as executive privilege.\n\nDuring the White House briefing Tuesday, Press Secretary Sean Spicer flat-out denied there was any truth to the report.\n\n\"I hope she testifies. I look forward to it,\" Spicer shot back, when asked about the article.\n\n\"The report in the Washington Post is 100 percent false,\" Spicer told reporters.\n\nA senior administration official also told Fox News in an email earlier Tuesday, \"The White House has taken no action to prevent Sally Yates from testifying and the Department of Justice specifically told her that it would not stop her and to suggest otherwise is completely irresponsible.\"\n\nThe conflicting claims over Yates are the latest turn in the developing controversy involving the House Intelligence Committee's work on the Russia investigation. FBI Director James Comey testified last week to the committee that his bureau was investigating possible ties between Russia and Trump campaign associates, while rejecting Trump assertions that his team may have been subject to surveillance by the Obama administration.\n\nCommittee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., later claimed he's learned that Trump transition team communications may have been incidentally picked up during surveillance operations. After reports he reviewed secret documents on White House grounds, top Democrats called on him to recuse himself from Russia matters -- a call he has rejected, with support from House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nThe Washington Post, citing anonymous sources, on Tuesday claimed Yates was planning to provide information to Nunes' committee that likely would contradict White House statements. At the same committee session, the panel also was planning to hear from former CIA Director John Brennan.\n\nBut sources said the committee abruptly canceled the hearing, after Yates' lawyer sent a letter to the White House.\n\nThe Friday letter from lawyer David A. O'Neil to White House Counsel Don McGahn said: \"If I do not receive a response by Monday, March 27, at 10 am EDT, I will conclude that the White House does not assert executive privilege over these matters with respect to the hearing or other settings.\"\n\nO'Neil had written that committee staff had informed Yates she would be questioned on the \"January 2017 communications regarding concerns about the conduct of a senior White House official.\" In the letter obtained by Fox News, O'Neil also argued that \"any claim of privilege has been waived as a result of the multiple public comments of current senior White House officials describing the January 2017 communications.\"\n\nThe White House did not provide a response, and Yates and her lawyer then believed they tacitly had approval to speak to the committee. While the hearing was canceled, Spicer said Tuesday the White House was not opposed to her testimony.\n\nSerafin Gomez is a White House Producer for FOX News Channel, who also covered the 2016 election as a Special Events & Politics producer and former special campaign correspondent for Fox News Latino.

Sign up here . **\n\nOn the roster: Trump gets the business - Former A.G. says Trump trying to keep her quiet - Obama carbon regs unraveling - Dems join bid to block Gorsuch raising nuclear threat - The Harambe clause\n\n\n\nTRUMP GETS THE BUSINESS\n\nThe difference between business and politics is a lot, but perhaps in no way more so than this: the deal never ends.\n\nHaving placed the blame for the defeat of his health insurance law at the feet of conservatives, President Trump now suggests that he will be advancing his still-agenda with the help of Democrats instead.\n\nThis may be a bargaining tactic for Trump, who wants to instill some fear into Republican lawmakers who just scored a victory in defeating Trump\u2019s health insurance bill, which they thought too liberal.\n\nBut if the president really believes that the time is right for a bipartisan coalition on issues as large and complicated as tax reform and a trillion dollar infrastructure spending package, his education is only just beginning.\n\nWhen Trump was negotiating financing for casinos or licensing for golf courses, walking away from the table was easier because there was always another bank, always another bidder and always another deal.\n\nIn government, though, the negotiation never ends. The room you walk out of today is the one you will have to reenter tomorrow.\n\nTrump may be able to fashion a new centrist coalition, but it will be with this same group of human beings. With incumbent retention rates in the high 90s even in wave election years, almost all of the people Trump is dealing with now will be there for the duration of his term.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s also the part about the perverse incentives in a duopoly. We\u2019ve talked before about how Republicans and Democrats alike have electoral incentives for failure. It\u2019s not just that it is easier to be in the minority, raising money and complaining. But also there is an incentive for seeing your own policy provisions die.\n\nRepublicans agreed with much of what former President Barack Obama wanted to do on corporate taxes: lower, fairer and flatter. Similarly, Democrats agreed with much of what some Republicans were once pushing on immigration reform.\n\nBut in both cases, it was to the short-term advantage of one party or the other to see their preferred policy outcomes fail rather than hand their opponents a success. There\u2019s an additional incentive for failure, too: wanting to preserve the issue for the next election.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of silly talk going on in Washington right now about what comes next for Congress and the administration.\n\nHouse Republicans claim health care is back on the table after Friday\u2019s ignominy. Ha! It will be a long time before anyone is ready to pick up that rock.\n\nRepublicans know that they can\u2019t pass a plan that truly removes ObamaCare given the opposition from the White House and Hill moderates. And Trump, for his part, argues that as ObamaCare fails, Democrats will be forced to the table to negotiate.\n\nWe are told even that the administration will accelerate through regulatory means the demise of key components of the law in order to pump up the pressure on Democrats.\n\nAgain, remember the part about perverse incentives for failure. The Midterm Elections are already underway and Democrats are more than happy to run as the party that tried to save your health insurance when Trump and the GOP wanted to take it away.\n\nMore likely, Republicans will end up patching fiscal holes in ObamaCare this fall to keep enough insurers on board to prevent a catastrophe for Americans in the individual market. You can hear the bailout train coming\u2026\n\nSo, health care is out. What about taxes?\n\nThere\u2019s little chance in this political environment for what could credibly be called \u201ctax reform.\u201d The last real dose of that took Ronald Reagan, Jack Kemp, Dick Gephardt and a cast of thousands five years to produce and consumed an entire legislative year before final passage.\n\nNow, there is the chance of a tax cut. Republicans love a tax cut and Democrats can often be induced to join if it also includes welfare payments through the tax code for poorer workers.\n\nAs long as you don\u2019t care about the deficit, taxes are easy. So it is possible that Trump could convince nervous Republicans to lower taxes, even over the objections of fiscal hawks. It\u2019s a natural.\n\nBut now we hear that the administration wants to roll out tax reform of a fundamental nature concurrently with the president\u2019s trillion-dollar stimulus package. Rather than narrowing their focus after the TrumpCare flub, the White House seems to be broadening its horizons.\n\nThe thinking is that by bundling the two, Trump can entice Democrats into the tax deal with the sweetener of massive public works spending. But ask yourself this, which Democrats are likely to fear Trump at this moment?\n\nA guy whose party is in revolt and who is rocking a 36-percent job approval rating doesn\u2019t make a very credible threat. The fact that Trump\u2019s health proposal was so unpopular so quickly is a reflection of the fact that the political capital he does have is not easily transferable to policy provisions.\n\nUntil Trump has a win, his threats don\u2019t wash. He said as much as he was trying to batter down resistance to the health plan.\n\nAnd also don\u2019t forget that it is none other than Speaker Paul Ryan who gets to decide what comes up in the House. If he decides that now is not the time for borrowing and spending $1 trillion, it would be pretty hard to get it on the floor.\n\nSure, Trump could then try to oust Ryan, but with whom would he replace him? And what if Congress gets its back up over the chief executive trying to control the legislative branch. Sounds like treacherous territory.\n\nThe truth is that the agenda is already set for at least the 33 days of Trump\u2019s first 100.\n\nThere is a Supreme Court nomination hanging in the balance with the possibility that Republicans will have to blow up Senate rules to get it done.\n\nMore ominously, the clock is ticking on a potential government shutdown next month and no apparent consensus among lawmakers over how much to spend and how long it should go.\n\nYou might ordinarily think that one-party control of Washington precludes the possibility of a government shutdown, but these days you can\u2019t be so sure.\n\nTwo-thirds of the way through his opening act, Trump has had a couple of serious stumbles with the botched refugee ban and his health bill. If he blows either the Gorsuch or the spending challenges, we will know for sure that this is a presidency in trouble.\n\nConversely, if Trump and his team can deliver success on both of those compulsory tasks, the narrative will start to turn around. Remember always that for all of the bias in the press, the greatest affinity is for lazy conventional wisdom.\n\nTwo wins for Trump and you will see \u201ccomeback kid\u201d articles left and right. The question for Trump is whether he understands that.\n\n\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: PRESENT ARMS\n\n\u201cThe perpetual menacings of danger oblige the government to be always prepared to repel it; its armies must be numerous enough for instant defense.\u201d \u2013 Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 8\n\nTIME OUT: DEEP DIVE\n\nAtlantic: \u201cGround-based sensors help warn of quakes, but they have their limits.

If they succeed, they could help reduce the damage caused by these natural disasters and save many lives\u2026Underwater sensors could more accurately locate underwater earthquakes than ground-based networks, says Spahr Webb, the Lamont-Doherty researcher leading the project, because \u2018the system is designed to be deployed over the top of a large earthquake and faithfully record the size and location of both the earthquake and the tsunami. \u2026 By installing pressure and seismic sensors offshore you get a much more accurate determination of location and depth of a nearby earthquake.\u2019\u201d\n\nFlag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with\n\nyour tips, comments or questions.\n\nFORMER A.G. SAYS TRUMP TRYING TO KEEP HER QUIET\n\nUSA Today: \u201cThe turmoil surrounding the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s interference with the 2016 election deepened Tuesday, with the disclosure that former acting Attorney General Sally Yates was warned last week that her testimony could contain privileged communications involving the White House that might be barred, an official familiar with matter said. Ultimately, Yates\u2019 scheduled Tuesday appearance was canceled by House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., But before that hearing was called off, the caution was delivered to Yates in a flurry of letters involving her attorney, the Justice Department and the White House Counsel\u2019s Office\u2026Letters from the Justice Department indicated that much of Yates\u2019 possible testimony could be covered by presidential privilege, said a government official speaking on condition of anonymity because officials were not authorized to speak publicly. Yates\u2019 attorney was then referred to White House counsel Donald McGahn. On the day that McGahn was notified of Yates\u2019 intention to testify, Nunes canceled the hearing.\u201d\n\nHouse Intel Committee in meltdown - The Hill: \u201cThe House Intelligence Committee has canceled its meetings for the week as Democrats push Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) to recuse himself from the panel\u2019s probe into Russian meddling in the election, CNN is reporting. Nunes reportedly canceled a public hearing about Russia that was set to take place on Tuesday. Lawmakers, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), called on Nunes to step aside from the investigation after the chairman said he visited White House grounds to view classified intelligence one day before briefing President Trump last week.\u201d\n\nRussian bank discloses Kushner meeting - Reuters: \u201cA Russian bank under Western economic sanctions over Russia\u2019s incursion into Ukraine disclosed on Monday that its executives had met Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law and a top White House adviser, in December\u2026Kushner previously acknowledged meeting the Russian ambassador to Washington last December and only on Monday did it emerge that executives of Russian state development bank Vnesheconombank (VEB) had talks with Kushner during a bank roadshow last year.\u201d\n\nOBAMA CARBON REGS UNRAVELING\n\nFox News: \u201cMoving forward with a campaign pledge to unravel former President Obama\u2019s sweeping plan to curb global warming, President Trump on Tuesday is set to sign an executive order that will suspend, rescind or flag for review more than a half-dozen measures in an effort to boost domestic energy production in the form of fossil fuels\u2026As part of the new roll-back, Trump will initiate a review of the Clean Power Plan, which restricts greenhouse gas emissions at coal-fired power plants.\n\nDEMS JOIN BID TO BLOCK GORSUCH RAISING NUCLEAR THREAT\n\nPolitico: \u201cSupreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch\u2019s path to 60 votes is rapidly closing \u2014 setting the stage for a nuclear showdown in the Senate as soon as next week. Senior Democratic sources are now increasingly confident that Gorsuch can\u2019t clear a filibuster, saying his ceiling is likely mid- to upper-50s on the key procedural vote. That would mark the first successful filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee since Abe Fortas for chief justice in the 1960s. In the latest ominous sign for the federal judge from Colorado, Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) said Monday he\u2019ll oppose Gorsuch on the cloture vote, which is expected late next week\u2026If Democrats successfully filibuster Gorsuch, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has heavily telegraphed that he will invoke the so-called nuclear option to unilaterally change Senate rules with a simple majority vote.\u201d\n\nBut Heitkamp will vote for cloture - The Hill: \u201cSen. Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), a centrist Democrat up for reelection in a state that strongly supported President Trump, said Tuesday that Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch should get an up-or-down vote. \u2018As I said last year when Judge Garland was nominated \u2014 and reiterated again when Judge Gorsuch was nominated \u2014 the U.S. Senate should have an up or down vote on any Supreme Court nominee as part of fulfilling our constitutional duty of providing advice and consent on nominees to the Supreme Court,\u2019 Heitkamp said in a statement\u201d\n\n[Fox News\u2019 Chad Pergram explains how a nuclear strike would work in the Gorsuch confirmation.]\n\n\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\n\nTrump\u2019s approval rating hits another new low at 36 percent - Gallup\n\nSessions threatens funding for \u2018sanctuary cities\u2019 - Fox News\n\nPrice now faces task of administering ObamaCare - The Hill\n\nTrump Organization holds trademark for casino in Jordan, will need to reapply during Trump presidency - AP\n\nAUDIBLE: START BRAINSTORMING NAMES\u2026\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a storm that\u2019s going to hit Republicans in 2018.

ObamaCare created the first set of broad federal insurance regulations, but state rules still exist. A policy that meets the requirements of a restrictive state like Connecticut might still run afoul of the rules in California. Policies from permissive states, conversely, can find no purchase in highlight regulated ones. Rather like car emission standards, there are federal rules and then state rules, like the famous \u201cCalifornia emissions\u201d they always talked about on the \u201cPrice is Right\u201d when they gave away a car.

Surrounded by coal miners, the president described that plan as a \u201ccrushing attack\u201d on workers and vowed to nix \u201cjob-killing regulations.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have safety, we\u2019re going to have clean water, we\u2019re going to have clean air, but so many [regulations] are unnecessary, so many are job-killing,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump added, \u201cTogether we are going to start a new energy revolution.\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier with \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said the president is setting a \u201cnew course\u201d that is both \u201cpro-jobs\u201d and \u201cpro-environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to create jobs in the oil and gas sector,\u201d he said. \u201cFor too long, over the last several years, you\u2019ve had certain industries, certain sectors of our economy that were within the crosshairs of the EPA.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThat is not going to happen anymore.\u201d\n\nPushback from Democrats was swift, with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi blasting the administration\u2019s \u201cspiteful assault\u201d on the Clean Power Plan and declaring it would not bring coal jobs back.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump and Congressional Republicans\u2019 contempt for clean air, clean water, and our clean energy future endangers the health of our children and the strength of our economy,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nThe Clean Power Plan has been the subject of long-running legal challenges by Republican-led states and allies of the oil, coal and gas industries.\n\nTrump\u2019s overall executive order goes beyond that program and will suspend, rescind or flag for review more than a half-dozen measures in an effort to boost domestic energy production in the form of fossil fuels.\n\nIn addition to pulling back from the Clean Power Plan, the administration is lifting a 14-month-old moratorium on new coal leases on federal lands.\n\nThe Obama administration had imposed a three-year moratorium on new federal coal leases in January 2016, arguing that the $1 billion-a-year program must be modernized to ensure a fair financial return to taxpayers and address climate change.\n\nThe order also chips away at other regulations, including scrapping language on the \"social cost\" of greenhouse gases. It initiates a review of efforts to reduce the emission of methane in oil and natural gas production as well as a Bureau of Land Management hydraulic fracturing rule, to determine whether those reflect the president's policy priorities. It also rescinds Obama-era executive orders and memoranda, including one that addressed climate change and national security and one that sought to prepare the country for the impacts of climate change.\n\nThe administration is still in discussion about whether it intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change. But the moves announced Tuesday will undoubtedly make it more difficult for the U.S. to achieve its goals.\n\nThe power-plant rule at the heart of Trump\u2019s order has been on hold since last year as a federal appeals court considers a challenge by coal-friendly states and more than 100 companies who call the plan an unconstitutional power grab.\n\nOpponents say the plan will kill coal-mining jobs and drive up electricity costs. The Obama administration, some Democratic-led states and environmental groups countered that it would spur thousands of clean-energy jobs and help the U.S. meet ambitious goals to reduce carbon pollution set by the international agreement signed in Paris.\n\nWhile Republicans have blamed Obama-era environmental regulations for the loss of coal jobs, federal data shows that U.S. mines have been shedding jobs for decades under presidents from both parties as a result of increasing automation and competition from cheaper natural gas. Another factor is the plummeting cost of solar panels and wind turbines, which now can produce emissions-free electricity cheaper than burning coal.\n\nThe Trump administration's plans drew praise from business groups and condemnation from environmental groups.\n\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas J. Donohue praised the president for taking \"bold steps to make regulatory relief and energy security a top priority.\"\n\nFormer EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy accused the Trump administration of wanting \"us to travel back to when smokestacks damaged our health and polluted our air, instead of taking every opportunity to support clean jobs of the future.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/28/trump-signs-executive-order-rolling-back-obama-era-energy-regs.html"}, {"text": "A government watchdog will investigate the taxpayer-funded travel costs when President Donald Trump travels to the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and the security procedures surrounding those trips.\n\nThat's the word from several congressional Democrats who raised concerns and sought an inquiry by the Government Accountability Office.

Amid the goals of the plan, which stems from a law passed last year, is a call for the construction of civic facilities, the purchasing of land, the improvement of ports and stopping foreign vessels from illegally visiting the islands.\n\nAlong with the Senkaku Islands, Japan will also designate another 143 remote islands \u2013 with 71 receiving special attention for their isolation and population decline \u2013 as part of a plan to secure the country\u2019s sprawling archipelago of around 6,800 islands from the dual threat of territory-hungry neighbors and a long-term decrease in population.\n\n\u201cPrime Minister Abe is very conservative and a nationalist,\u201d Zhiqun Zhu, a political science professor and director of the China Institute at Bucknell University, told Fox News. \u201cSo this move is not very surprising, but it\u2019s going to be counterproductive in terms of relations with China.\u201d\n\nThe Senkaku Islands \u2013 a chain of five uninhabited islets and three barren rocks in the East China Sea \u2013 were uninhabited until 1895 when Japan laid claim to them. In the ensuing decades, the Japanese populated the chain and even set up a fish-processing plant on one of the islands.\n\n\u201cThe Government of Japan made a Cabinet Decision on January 14, 1895, to erect markers on the islands to formally incorporate the Senkaku Islands into the territory of Japan,\u201d Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated. \u201cThese measures were carried out in accordance with the internationally accepted means of duly acquiring territorial sovereignty under international law.\u201d\n\nThe United States took control of the islands during the occupation of Japan following World War II, and handed them back in 1972. It was around this time that China \u2013 citing ancient texts and maps \u2013 claimed that Japan seized the islands in violation of international law.\n\nThe Chinese went further by claiming that Japan took possession of the islands as part of the treaty that ended the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895, which also handed over Taiwan to Japan. China argues that when Japan handed back Taiwan following the end of World War II, the islands should have gone back too as in China\u2019s view the islands are part of Taiwan.\n\nFurthering mudding the situation is the fact that at the time of the Taiwan handover, the U.S. technically controlled the islands (although it did not claim sovereignty) before handing them back in the early 1970s.\n\nDespite international law that governs over these territorial disputes favoring Japan, things are not so clear cut when the shifting power dynamics of the region are taken into account.\n\nThese two powers are still trying to figure out their roles in the region. There is a saying in Chinese that two tigers cannot share the same mountain. - Zhiqun Zhu, director of the China Institute at Bucknell University\n\nExperts say the dispute over the islands is more about two regional players asserting their respective power than about the actual land at stake. When Japan first seized control of the islands in 1895, it was on the verge of becoming a great power while China was beset by internal turmoil. More than 120 years later, the tables have turned and China now has the upper hand in the region.\n\n\u201cThis is a very emotional issue for both sides,\u201d Frances Rosenbluth, a political science professor at Yale University, told Fox News. \u201cJapan right now is trying to send strong signals to ward off any other advances by Chinese in regards to their territory.\u201d\n\nIn early February, three Chinese warships sailed into the water near the Senkaku Islands -- only two days before Japan\u2019s Abe was set to meet with U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis.\n\nIt was the latest move by Beijing that has provoked the ire of Tokyo and heightened tensions throughout East Asia.\n\nLast November, China flew a pair of nuclear-capable bombers around Taiwan for the first time, as the Japanese scrambled eight F-15 fighter jets to intercept the Chinese flight while it was circling the island.\n\nChina in December also placed hundreds of surface-to-air missiles on Hainan Island off mainland China, which intelligence officials say could one day be moved to China\u2019s man-made islands in the South China Sea to better defend them.\n\n\u201cThese two powers are still trying to figure out their roles in the region,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cThere is a saying in Chinese that two tigers cannot share the same mountain.\u201d\n\nWhile experts agree that neither Japan nor China want an armed conflict over the disputed territory \u2013 something that some have speculated would start World War III \u2013 it may be up to the U.S. to help resolve this issue.\n\nExpand / Contract In this March 5, 2013, file photo, then-Marine Gen. James Mattis, commander, U.S. Central Command, testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)\n\nDuring his trip to Japan last month, Mattis reaffirmed -- under Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty -- the U.S.\u2019s commitment to defend Japan and its territories if attacked.\n\n\u201cI made clear that our long-standing policy on the Senkaku Islands stands. The U.S. will continue to recognize Japanese administration of the islands,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cAs such, Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty applies.\u201d\n\nMattis\u2019 words not only mirror longstanding U.S. policy toward its closest ally in Asia, but also the administration of Donald Trump\u2019s tough talk toward China. During his time on the stump, Trump railed against Chinese economic and political polices, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, told lawmakers during his confirmation hearing in January that China\u2019s buildup in the South China Sea was \"akin to Russia\u2019s taking Crimea\u201d from Ukraine.\n\n\"We\u2019re going to have to send China a clear signal that, first, the island-building stops and, second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed,\u201d Tillerson said.\n\nChina\u2019s Foreign Minister Lu Kang said after Mattis\u2019 trip that the U.S. needs to take a \u201cresponsible attitude\u201d to \u201cavoid making the issue more complicated and bringing instability to the regional situation.\u201d\n\nBesides the U.S., Russia has involved itself in the dispute between Japan and Russia over the islands. While relations between Tokyo and Moscow chilled following the formers invasion on the Crimea in 2014, Abe has maintained a strong relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and has promised economic cooperation in a bid to move forward the territorial dispute over the Senkaku islands.\n\nHow the two countries settle a long-running dispute over the ownership of the Southern Kurils \u2013 called the Northern Territories in Japan and seized by the Soviet Union in 1945 at the end of World War II -- could foreshadow future negotiations over the Senkaku Islands. Putin visited with Abe in December 2016 to discuss the situation.\n\nAnd while China\u2019s expansionist polices have come under widespread scrutiny on the world stage, observers say it\u2019s also up to the U.S. to keep Japan from making any more moves that could lead to a clash in East Asia.\n\n\u201cJapan is not a major actor in the future of East Asian political economy, but Abe and many in Japan don\u2019t see it that way,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why Japan is doing these things on these islands, but if they continue China will respond and this will escalate into a conflict.\u201d\n\nZhu added: \u201cIt\u2019s the U.S. that has the ability to rein in Japan\u2019s aggressive moves.\u201d", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/03/28/china-japan-island-fight-reignites-with-population-push.html"}, {"text": "The House passed a resolution on Tuesday that would eliminate the Federal Communication Commission's Internet privacy rules that were passed under the Obama administration.\n\nThe privacy rules required Internet service providers like Comcast and Verizon to get permission from consumers before sharing browser history and other user information.\n\nThe resolution to kill that rule was introduced by Rep.

Obama took eight months to pass ObamaCare \u2013 even while he promised it would cure all our health care ills.\n\nThe current congressional leadership tried to pass a complicated, critical bill to repeal and replace ObamaCare in fewer than three months.\n\nWhile Republicans focused on process, and a complex, wonky, Washington-insider argument (just read the transcripts), their opponents in the media and the left hammered away at the human cost of their bill. The result: By the time the bill was pulled, only 17 percent of Americans \u2013 or less than 1 in 5 \u2013 wanted it.\n\nIn an era when total outsider candidate Donald J. Trump was elected president, congressional leaders adopted a \u201ctrust us, we\u2019re in Washington\u201d strategy. They promised all the rough edges would be smoothed over during Stages 2 and 3 \u2013 which were obscure and undefined. Americans didn\u2019t believe them.\n\nFrankly, they were fortunate to avoid the vote. Insider health reform was a major factor in killing the Democratic House majority in 1994 \u2013 after a 40-year reign. Insider health reform killed the House Democratic majority in 2010, too. Voting for a bill with 17 percent approval might have broken the current House majority.\n\nHistory has taught us: America doesn\u2019t like political health care. There is a deep imperative for Congress to think through bipartisan health care reform.\n\nThe House and Senate GOP leadership can learn a lot of lessons from this failed experiment \u2013 if they are willing to.\n\nTHE ROAD AHEAD\n\nThere are a set of principles for successful conservative reforms. President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher used them in the 1980s. We followed them in creating the \"Contract with America\" in 1994, reforming welfare in 1996 and passing the balanced budget in 1997.\n\nAs Thatcher said: \"First you win the argument, then you win the vote.\" The best short book on her fight to reform Britain, Claire Berlinski's \"There is no Alternative: Why Margaret Thatcher Matters,\" makes clear the moral, human arguments Thatcher used to dismantle socialism in Britain.\n\nThe No. 1 goal of any health reform must be to communicate with the American people and convince them this will provide a much better future than the current system. Tom Evans' \"The Education of Ronald Reagan\" outlines Reagan\u2019s years at General Electric and the lessons he learned in focusing on educating the public, so they would educate the Congress.\n\nIn Reagan's farewell address, he explained his legislative successes this way: \"I've had my share of victories in the Congress, but what few people noticed is that I never won anything you didn't win for me. They never saw my troops, they never saw Reagan's regiments, the American people. You won every battle with every call you made and letter you wrote demanding action.\"\n\nA new health reform effort must start by focusing on the American people and winning their support. It will be President Trump's health rallies in the states which win the day not clever insider negotiating in Washington.\n\n2. The key is to focus on health and health care, not on financing.\n\nWhen asked about his success, Eisenhower said, \u201cWhenever I run into a problem I can\u2019t solve, I always make it bigger. I can never solve it by trying to make it smaller, but if I make it big enough, I can begin to see the outlines of a solution.\u201d\n\nThat principle applies to reforming the health system. To solve health financing, you have to expand the discussion to the entire health system.\n\nFor decades, government has tried to focus on financing. Costs continue to rise. Systems get more and more complex. A bigger and bigger percentage of money is spent on bureaucracy (public and private) rather than health. People get lost in the arguments about insurance and programs, because they are highly technical and don't relate directly to their lives.\n\nThe first goal must be to describe the values (and the systems which will achieve those values) that matter to people.\n\nPeople want to live longer and healthier, at lower cost, and with greater convenience. For example, people want solutions other than nursing homes. They want systems other than maintenance for diseases. They want health and independent living. There are many.\n\nHealth policies have to be described in both micro and macro terms.\n\nMicro policies are quite simply \"what does it mean to me and my family?\" People at the personal level want to know about their own health, their access to health care, their premiums, their deductibles and whether they have access to the doctors they want.\n\nMacro policies are how the society, the private sector, nonprofits and government are going to organize and incentivize activities to achieve the micro policies.\n\n3. Health is the largest sector of the American economy and the most complex. Health care is at least 10 times more complicated than national security. It is one-fifth of our economy.\n\nReally understanding and solving health and health care takes more time than politicians and bureaucrats have been willing to invest.\n\nHearings must be held geographically, by topic, and by specific specialties to gather enough information to develop a series of steps that will improve health and health care.\n\nListen-Learn-Help-Lead is the key system for involving the entire country and developing a comprehensive understanding of what the American people want and how to achieve it.\n\nHealth is broader than payments. The National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Food and Drug Administration, federal community health centers, the Indian Health Service, the Veterans Administration, Tricare, etc. are all part of the fabric of meeting our health potential.\n\n4. As the health reform plan evolves, it has to be described in very detailed question-and-answer systems online, so people can understand how it affects them, health professionals can understand how they will be impacted, the news media can understand it, and the elected officials can explain and defend it.\n\nThe plan should meet the goals defined by President Trump during the campaign. They were the goals the American people voted for and, unlike Obama, we should keep our word.\n\nThe plan should be implemented in a series of bills. It is impossible to write a comprehensive health care bill. No one can understand the complexity. No one can understand all the second- and third-order effects. The 21st Century Cures bill, as a bipartisan achievement, is a better model than the HillaryCare and ObamaCare comprehensive bills.\n\n5. It should be possible to outline the entire new system in a series of very clear charts, so everyone can understand the goals and the directions before being asked to support the transition process. People both have to understand the long-term values-based goals and the policy changes, which will be bridges to achieve these goals.\n\n6. Properly developed, a dynamic, innovative, science-based American health system will be the largest job creator, the largest sector of high-paying jobs, and the biggest earner of foreign exchange in the country. If we liberate the American health system so it can once again be the most innovative and effective in the world, people all over the planet will buy American health products, seek American health technology, and ask to see American medical specialists. Health is not a problem, it is a great opportunity and should be approached as such.\n\n7. Following a disciplined road map like this is hard work and requires more patience and more discipline than the inside Washington game. As Reagan, Thatcher, and the \u201cContract with America\u201d Congress proved, it can also yield dramatically bigger and better results.\n\nNewt Gingrich is a Fox News contributor.

Small Town USA is struggling and cannot endure Trump\u2019s cuts.\n\nWhile many rural Americans agree, it\u2019s equally clear that these government programs are but a tourniquet to a long-festering economic wound. Simply put, rural counties like mine have lost our competitive advantage to our urban cousins.\n\nUnless and until we fix that challenge, taxpayers will continue to subsidize what is effectively the palliative care of our anemic communities.\n\nSo how do you fix a problem that started nearly 200 years ago with the advent of the Industrial Revolution? Is it even possible?\n\nYou bet. Just ask South Dakota.\n\nFaced with a dwindling rural population, political leaders in Pierre created a savvy recruiting tool \u2013 DakotaRoots.com \u2013 and related marketing campaign to peak the interest of young workers.\n\nThe pitch was personal. Business leaders, state government officials, and average citizens all reached out to those applicants who expressed a desire to be a Dakotan. These civic leaders worked hard to ensure that interested professionals found the right city and the right job. Sometimes that even included personal phone calls.\n\nTheir efforts paid off. More than 4,000 people now call South Dakota home because of the Dakota Roots program.\n\nSuccess like this rarely goes unnoticed. Other states \u2013 such as Idaho and Wyoming \u2013 have adopted similar programs too.\n\nWhile these initiatives are laudable, critics rightfully point out that these outcomes are relatively modest. Rural America doesn\u2019t just need a few thousand people to rebuild its economy. It needs millions.\n\nIn the language of entrepreneurs, these matchmaking efforts are an important beta test but, unless they are scaled, will have limited impact.\n\nAnd that is the key to repopulating rural America. There are millions of people who are looking for a new or better life. And there are thousands of unique communities that want to give them just that.\n\nThe challenge is connecting them.\n\nThankfully, America\u2019s tech firms have considerable experience in this field. Just take a closer look at dating websites.\n\nBehind the success of Match and OK Cupid are algorithms designed to find and rank connections between people. To do so, computers consider user preferences about the qualities they\u2019re most keen to find in a mate \u2013 blond or brunette, short or tall, humorous or serious. Algorithms then make informed guesses on which profiles best fit.\n\nNot every connection works, of course. (Trust me, I have the bad coffee dates to prove it) But the results are clear: a growing number of us find love and marriage through technology.\n\nSo could this matchmaking concept work for rural America?\n\nImagine if private industry selected 25 communities in each state, focusing on those cities that offered the most promise. Characteristics of chosen towns might include things like affordable housing, healthcare, schools, transportation, proximity to recreation, and low taxes.\n\nMeanwhile, Americans in search of new beginnings would answer a series of questions that would ask which of these characteristics held the most importance. For example, does a user need an airport nearby? If so, must it be five miles away or no more than 50?\n\nA well-designed algorithm would then sort the cities, giving users a \u201ctop 10\u201d list of locations best suited to their individual needs. The cities and states hungriest for new talent \u2013 like South Dakota, Wyoming, and Idaho \u2013 would dedicate people and resources towards recruiting these prospective citizens.\n\nNaysayers might scoff at this effort but they\u2019re ignoring a profound change in the labor market. Data show that young professionals and middle class families are fleeing expensive locations (New York, D.C., Miami, Los Angeles, and San Francisco) in favor of regional hubs in the Pacific Northwest, the Carolinas, Vermont and South Dakota.\n\nThe trend is clear: America\u2019s workers are looking for better options, especially in the face of stagnate wages, student debt, and unfulfilled dreams of buying a home. They\u2019re looking for tools to help them find these hidden communities.\n\nTurns out, rural America has them.\n\nAll of this leaves small towns with a choice. Communities like mine can certainly wait for more welfare programs to trickle down from Washington D.C. Alternatively, we can join hands with private industry and try to recapture the restless spirit of American workers on the move.\n\nI\u2019d rather take the path with fewer bureaucrats. To me, that is how we will make rural America truly great again.\n\nBryan Dean Wright is a former CIA ops officer and member of the Democratic Party.

Its editorial page \u2014 never a friend to Obama \u2014 wrote this last week about Trump:\n\n\u201c[He] clings to his assertion like a drunk to an empty gin bottle, rolling out his press spokesman to make more dubious claims.\u201d\n\nWow. The Journal was sharply critical of Obama but never said he had the credibility of a drunkard.\n\nThey are not yet saying \u201cThanks, Obama,\u201d but their words do stir new appreciation for the good old days under the previous president.\n\nWill right-wing talk radio follow the Journal\u2019s example?\n\nImagine the reaction from far-right talk radio \u2014 the people who raised hell and their ratings by attacking Obama daily with accusations about fake scandals \u2014 if the 44thpresident had lied about his predecessor or if people in his circle had been taking money from Russia.\n\nImagine the outburst from Rush Limbaugh \u2014 the king of conservative talk radio \u2014 if the Justice Department told Obama that his National Security Advisor had lied about discussing sanctions with Russian government officials and Obama had waited three weeks to demand that person\u2019s resignation.\n\nAnd what would Hugh Hewitt say on radio if it was later revealed that the advisor took over $65,000 from companies linked to Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, in addition to pocketing more than $500,000 from moonlighting as a lobbyist tied to the Turkish government?\n\nWhat might my friend, conservative radio host Lars Larson, have said if Obama\u2019s former campaign manager had taken $10 million from Russian oligarchs to \u2014 in his words \u2014 \u201cgreatly benefit\u201d the interests of Putin\u2019s Russia inside the U.S.?\n\nOf course, the reality is Obama\u2019s team never engaged in such damaging acts. It is Trump\u2019s team that is under investigation for all of these charges of scandalous behavior.\n\nRadio talk show hosts on the right have great ratings but they are not elected to defend the democratic basis of our government. That job belongs to Congress.\n\nBut House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), has become an apologist for Trump. Last week, he rushed over to the White House to say he had seen transcripts of apparently legal intercepts that may have swept up some Trump campaign officials.\n\nWas this evidence that Obama wiretapped Trump as he was running for president? No. Even Nunes admits that. But by briefing the White House before sharing the information with his own committee, Nunes revealed himself as an advocate for the Trump White House.\n\nNunes, who served on the Trump transition team, compromised any claim to independence and threw away the credibility he needs.\n\nBefore Nunes\u2019 rash action it was left to the top Democrat on the House Intelligence panel, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), to explain to the nation what the House panel had already found:\n\n\u201cLast summer, at the height of a bitterly contested and hugely consequential presidential campaign, [Russia]\u2026intervened in an effort to weaken our democracy, and to influence the outcome for one candidate and against the other,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nSchiff made more news later in the week when he told Chuck Todd of NBC News, \u201cthere is more than circumstantial evidence\u201d that there was collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, House Republicans continue injuring the party\u2019s brand as they busily sweep dirt from the Russia scandal under the White House carpet.\n\nBut even the attempted congressional cover-up can\u2019t fool the public \u2014 not even in concert with the silence from right-wing talk radio hosts. Look at the polling: Trump\u2019s approval ratings are at historic lows for any president in the modern age at this point in his presidency.\n\nA Quinnipiac poll last week found his approval rating had fallen to 37 percent while his disapproval rating had risen to 56 percent. According to the same poll, 60 percent of voters say he is \u201cnot honest,\u201d 55 percent say he \u201cdoes not have good leadership skills\u201d and 57 percent say he \u201cdoes not care about average Americans.\u201d\n\nWhat could be driving the president\u2019s collapsing poll numbers?\n\nThe Quinnipiac results suggest an answer.\n\nA whopping 70 percent of voters do not believe Trump\u2019s claim that Obama wiretapped him last year. Just 19 percent believe \u2014 in the face of the evidence \u2014 that Obama did so.\n\nIn perhaps the most damning result in the Quinnipiac survey, 73 percent of voters say Trump\u2019s administration makes \u201cstatements without evidence to support them \u2018very often\u2019 or \u2018somewhat often.\u2019\u201d\n\nAgain, it was left to the Wall Street Journal editorial page to admit that the Trump White House is drowning in a vast credibility crisis.\n\n\u201cIf President Trump announces that North Korea launched a missile that landed within 100 miles of Hawaii, would most Americans believe him?\u201d The Journal wrote. \u201cWould the rest of the world?

I love Big Bird \u2026 But I\u2019m not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for it.\u201d\n\nThe argument now, however, is tougher for Democrats to make as Big Bird, Bert and Ernie are housed on HBO, and not directly threatened by the cuts.\n\nRep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., pushed back on the claim Sesame Street was at risk, noting its HBO base now.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing some innovative things with HBO and others, earlier it was mentioned Bert and Ernie getting pink slip but it seems they\u2019ve become private contractors in some ways,\u201d he said.\n\nThe subscription-based HBO does have a deal with PBS to rebroadcast episodes on a delayed basis -- so access could be restricted.\n\nDemocrats added that other popular children\u2019s shows, such as \u201cCurious George\u201d and \u201cThomas and Friends\u201d could be under threat.\n\n\u201cWe need to consider the profound impact this organization has had in our communities,\u201d said Rep.

That case has joined a grim roster of incidents in recent years:\n\n- In July of 2015, Kate Steinle was gunned down near San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf as she took in the sights with her family. The 32-year-old's killer, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, previously had been deported five times.\n\n- Just days after Steinle was killed, Mirta Rivera, 41, a nurse and grandmother from Lawrence, Mass., was shot as she slept from an upstairs apartment where two illegal immigrants lived despite being under federal deportation orders, according to the Boston Herald.\n\n- The same month, Marilyn Pharis, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, was raped and bludgeoned to death with a claw hammer on July 24, 2015, in her own home. Victor Aureliano Martinez Ramirez, 29, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who was arrested six times in the previous 15 months, was one of two men charged in the case.\n\n- In early 2015, 21-year-old Grant Ronnebeck was working the graveyard shift at a convenience store in Mesa, Ariz., when illegal immigrant Apolinar Altamirano, an admitted member of the Sinola drug cartel, killed him as he counted change for a pack of cigarettes.\n\n- And in one of the earliest cases to draw widespread publicity to sanctuary cities, in 2008, 17-year-old Jamiel Shaw was killed near his home in Los Angeles. A gang member and illegal immigrant, Pedro Espinoza, was later convicted of murdering the college football prospect.\n\nExperts say for every case that makes national news, there are hundreds more crimes committed by illegal immigrants whose deportation was blocked by local authorities' unwillingness to cooperate.\n\nThere are currently approximately 2.1 million legal or illegal immigrants with criminal convictions living free or behind bars in the U.S., according to ICE's Secure Communities office. Each year, about 900,000 legal and illegal immigrants are arrested, and 700,000 are released from jail, prison, or probation. ICE estimates that there are more than 1.2 million criminal aliens at large in the U.S.\n\nIn the most recent figures available, a Government Accountability Office report titled, \"Criminal Alien Statistics,\" found there were 55,000 illegal immigrants in federal prison and 296,000 in state and local lockups in 2011. Experts agree those figures have almost certainly risen, although executive orders from the Obama administration may have changed the status of thousands who previously would have been counted as illegal immigrants.\n\nShining a light on the statistics could further bolster public opinion behind the administration, said David Ray, spokesman for Federation for American Immigration Reform.\n\n\u201cThe American public was already convinced that hundreds of thousands of criminal aliens wandering the streets of America was a serious issue that needed to be dealt with, which is why they put President Trump in the White House in the first place,\" Ray said. \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s move to publish the weekly data highlighting denied detainer requests was not intended to show an already convinced American public that a problem exists, but simply to demonstrate the size and scope of the problem while highlighting the bad players.\u201d", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/28/team-trump-cites-stats-anecdotes-to-show-dangers-sanctuary-cities.html"}, {"text": "With complications mounting for Republican efforts to rally 60 votes to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, you\u2019re going to hear a lot in the next few weeks about the so-called \u201cnuclear option.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what it all means:\n\nLet\u2019s start with the mathematics.\n\nThere are 52 Republicans in the Senate and 48 senators who caucus with the Democrats.\n\nIt only takes a simple majority to confirm a Supreme Court nominee. But it takes 60 votes to break a filibuster on a Supreme Court nominee. Never before has there been a successful filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee.\n\nThe Senate filibustered the nomination of Associate Justice Abe Fortas to become chief justice of the United States in 1968. But Fortas was already on the Supreme Court. Nominees have withdrawn. President George W. Bush nominated Harriet Miers in 2005 before she pulled out, anticipating a rocky confirmation process. President Ronald Reagan tapped Douglas Ginsburg for the Court in 1987. But Ginsburg withdrew over his marijuana use. Twelve Supreme Court nominees went down to defeat outright on the Senate floor. The most recent Supreme Court nominee to stumble at confirmation came in 1987 when Reagan selected Robert Bork. Bork only garnered 42 ayes for confirmation and the nomination failed.\n\nSenate Democrats have made it clear that they intend to filibuster Gorsuch and make Senate Republicans cough up 60 yeas to break their filibuster.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., insists that the Senate will fact confirm Gorsuch.\n\nBut how do they get there?\n\nRepublicans think they can persuade some Democratic senators who represent swing states who face re-election in 2018 to at least vote to break the filibuster (known as voting for cloture) if not voting to confirm Gorsuch. Those senators include Sens. Bill Nelson, D-Fla.; Joe Donnelly, D-Ind.; Angus King, I-Maine; Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich.; Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.; Jon Tester, D-Mont.; Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D.; Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio; Bob Casey, D-Pa.; Tim Kaine, D-Va.; Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.; and Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis.\n\nBut if not, Republicans are stuck. They can\u2019t get Gorsuch to a final vote.\n\nThey say paybacks are hell. And both sides have a lot to say about paybacks right now.\n\nFor Democrats, this is about Republicans failing to ever hold a confirmation hearing for President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. For Republicans, this is about Democrats taking the extraordinary step in 2013 to lower the bar to from 60 to 51 to break filibusters for all Executive Branch nominees except Supreme Court nominees.\n\nThis was known as the \u201cnuclear option\u201d and cast the Senate into \u201cnuclear winter\u201d for more than a year.\n\nBoth sides feel the other side wronged them. Now, this is about revenge.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to the fall of 2013 when Democrats teed up the nuclear option.\n\nDemocrats intensified their criticisms of Republicans when the GOP stalled the nomination of Patricia Millett to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The Senate didn\u2019t clear a procedural hurdle which required 60 votes to break a GOP filibuster of the Millett nomination.\n\nThe filibuster is the quintessence of the Senate. The right of the minority to stall and delay \u2013 even upend the agenda the majority party intends to advance. Stripping the Senate of at least part of that opportunity for dissent fundamentally changes the place. But these filibusters stymied general Senate business and drove Democrats up a wall.\n\nSo, they hit the nuclear button.\n\nIt should be noted that the \u201cnuclear option\u201d is not a rules change, but a change in precedent. But much of what the Senate does is based on precedent.\n\nThe Senate must be in a very unique parliamentary posture in order to detonate a \u201cnuclear option.\u201d It has to get onto a parliamentary item which is \u201cnon-debatable.\u201d In other words, senators can\u2019t demand more time to speak on a given topic, and a senator cannot appeal how the chair rules on a parliamentary question. That is the key. If a senator can challenge how the chair has ruled, they can gum up the works. But if the chair establishes a new precedent by ruling something to be in or out of order, no one can contest that ruling.\n\nAnd therefore, the Senate establishes a new precedent.\n\nThis is how it worked in 2013: That year, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., tried to proceed to consider again a failed vote to end debate on the Millett nomination for the D.C. Circuit. That motion was non-debatable \u2026 so the GOP couldn\u2019t stop him. So, the Senate voted to make the failed vote the business at hand before the Senate.\n\nAt that point, Reid made a point of order that the votes required to break a filibuster on \u201call nominations other than for the Supreme Court of the United State States is by majority vote.\u201d The presiding officer (a Democrat) ruled against Reid (this was pre-baked). After all, that was the old precedent. So Reid then appealed the chair\u2019s ruling. That forced the Senate to vote on what the chair ruled: a simple majority wasn\u2019t valid to end filibusters on Executive Branch nominees. Just a supermajority (60). But on the appeal, the Senate voted against the chair. That affirmed Reid\u2019s position. The Senate overrode the chair\u2019s ruling, establishing a new precedent to break filibusters on all nominations except the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Senate then voted to end the filibuster on the Millett nomination with just 55 yeas (not 60, as per the old way). The Senate then confirmed Millett, 56-38.\n\nAnd thus, the Senate established a new precedent.\n\nFor a new nuclear option, McConnell would have to pitch the Senate into a special parliamentary posture in order to mimic Reid\u2019s 2013 gambit and lower the bar to break a possible filibuster against Gorsuch.\n\nThe question is whether he has 51 senators (or 50 senators and Vice President Pence) willing to go along with the tactic. Keep in mind that Republicans were very sad that Reid hit the nuclear switch in 2013. They felt it diminished the Senate and its history of \u201cunlimited debate.\u201d Republicans and some Democrats didn\u2019t like that the Senate was changing the bar for filibusters, because, well, they may like to filibuster a given issue sometime.\n\nIt is unclear if McConnell, an institutionalist, wishes to go that route. It is risky. And he may not even have the votes to get Republican senators to vote against the ruling of the chair to establish a new precedent to end filibusters on Supreme Court nominees.\n\nThere are also questions as to whether Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., may want to truly go to the mat on this nominee or put vulnerable Democratic senators up for re-election next year in challenging states on the hook. Confirming a conservative to take the place of a conservative like Antonin Scalia on the court may be okay for some Democrats. It doesn\u2019t disrupt the balance of the court. But confirming another conservative to take the place of say, a liberal, like Ruth Bader Ginsburg, is entirely different.\n\nThere is another way for Gorsuch to wind up on the Supreme Court if he can\u2019t overcome a filibuster: a recess appointment.\n\nArticle I, Section 5 of the Constitution says that \u201cNeither House, during the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other Place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting.\u201d In other words, the House and Senate must earn the blessing of the other before taking off for more than three days. If they don\u2019t, the House and Senate sometimes meet for just a few seconds at a time at three-day intervals with skeleton staff. These are called \u201cpro-forma\u201d sessions and constitute a \u201cmeeting\u201d of the House or Senate.\n\nThe founders anticipated periodic congressional recesses. So to maintain the operation of government, the founders grafted a clause onto Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution. It states that \u201cThe President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, President Obama made four recess appointments during a three-day respite between two pro-forma sessions. Opponents of the effort challenged the president\u2019s appointments to the Supreme Court. Justices ruled Obama\u2019s ploy to be unconstitutional. In National Labor Relations Board v. Canning, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer wrote that it was out of bounds for the Executive Branch to tell the Legislative Branch what constitutes a recess.\n\n\u201cThe Senate is in session when it says it is,\u201d wrote Breyer in the majority opinion.\n\nMoreover, the court also determined that a recess between three and 10 days is too abbreviated for a recess appointment. In other words, the Senate has to be gone for more than 10 days to make the recess appointment valid.\n\nSo, the Republican House and Senate would have to work together in order to engineer a recess, thus opening the door to a recess and giving Trump the window he needs for a possible recess appointment.\n\nRecess appointments to the Supreme Court aren\u2019t unprecedented. President Dwight Eisenhower advanced two individuals to the high court via recess appointments: William Brennan in 1956 and Potter Stewart in 1958. However, all recess appointments are temporary. The Senate later confirmed both Brennan and Stewart.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/28/road-map-to-senates-nuclear-option-for-confirming-gorsuch.html"}, {"text": "Texas Republican Sen.

Later on Monday afternoon, the Democrats' former Senate Judiciary Committee chairman appeared to walk back his remarks and said a filibuster may still come.\n\nCornyn, a Republican member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if Senate Democratic leadership follows through on the threat of a filibuster it would be \"unprecedented.\" Cornyn did not try to persuade Democrats to support the Supreme Court nominee in remarks on the floor Tuesday, but he pushed for an up-or-down vote on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals'judge's high court nomination.\n\n\"We're going to give our Democratic colleagues a chance to do the right thing and to vote, at some point, to cut off debate and then have an up-or-down vote to confirm the nominee,\" Cornyn said Tuesday. \"I can only hope that cooler heads will prevail and others in the Democratic caucus will listen to Senator Leahy and others who say they're not inclined to filibuster. Whether they decide to vote against the nominee is entirely up to them, but denying the majority in the Senate a chance to vote to confirm the nominee is just simply unacceptable, and it will not stand.\"", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/28/cornyn-democrats-should-listen-to-leahy-who-does-not-plan-to-filibuster-gorsuch.html"}, {"text": "Government employees spent nearly 3.5 million hours conducting union business, costing taxpayers $162.5 million in 2014, according to a new report.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) revealed that official time increased by more than 10 percent between 2008 and 2014\u2014the most recent data available.

The Republicans, led by Ted Cruz, shut down the government in 2013 rather than fund ObamaCare, but they wound up taking a political hit while the health program emerged unscathed.\n\nThe intransigence by his right wing ultimately led John Boehner to resign. The former speaker tried to cut a tax-and-spending \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with Barack Obama but couldn\u2019t deliver the votes. Boehner was facing another potential government shutdown in the fall of 2015 when he quit his job. Ryan didn\u2019t particularly want the speaker's gavel and had to be drafted.\n\nIt\u2019s noteworthy that the president hasn\u2019t blamed Ryan, but tweeted the following: \u201cDemocrats are smiling in D.C. that the Freedom Caucus, with the help of Club For Growth and Heritage, have saved Planned Parenthood & Ocare!\u201d\n\nIn fairness, members of the Freedom Caucus were acting on principle, believing that the rushed health bill was an abomination that not only failed to repeal the Obama program but would have made things worse.\n\nTrump campaigned on a much more moderate position on health care. In fact, it\u2019s helpful to think of him as an independent president, since he ran against the Republican establishment and rejected key conservative platforms on taxes and spending.\n\nSo where does the president go from here as he turns to tax reform and infrastructure?\n\nIf the Freedom Caucus keeps depriving him of a Republican majority, Trump could try to win over some moderate Democrats, as Ronald Reagan did.\n\nBut Politico says Nancy Pelosi is now \u201cempowered,\u201d and the New York Times says \u201cDemocrats will not be lending a hand anytime soon.\n\n\"Invigorated by the Republican dysfunction that led to a stunningly swift collapse of the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and relieved that President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic accomplishment remains intact, Democrats are in their best position since their embarrassing loss in the November election.\u201d\n\nThe Weekly Standard reports \u201cthere's not much appetite in the White House for dealing with the Freedom Caucus,\u201d citing an unnamed White House aide as arguing \"there's practically no reason to consider the demands of the Freedom Caucus or its chairman, North Carolina's Mark Meadows, on anything important again.\u201d\n\nBut, says the piece by Michael Warren, \u201cWhat incentive do Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leadership, who have control over committee assignments and campaign contributions, have in releasing its members to support the Trump administration on almost anything difficult?\u201d\n\nTwo possible answers: If the Democrats don\u2019t cooperate with Trump on a couple of issues, they will take heat for being obstructionist (a label they threw at Mitch McConnell when they ran Congress). Also, they might be able to get half a loaf on their priorities rather than being totally sidelined.\n\nNone of this is going to be easy. On tax reform, the Democrats always want higher taxes on the wealthy, which is anathema to the GOP.

The Obama administration, some Democratic-led states and environmental groups countered that it will spur thousands of clean-energy jobs and help the U.S. meet ambitious goals to reduce carbon pollution set by the international agreement signed in Paris.\n\nTrump's order on coal-fired power plants follows an executive order he signed last month mandating a review of an Obama-era rule aimed at protecting small streams and wetlands from development and pollution. The order instructs the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers to review a rule that redefined \"waters of the United States\" protected under the Clean Water Act to include smaller creeks and wetlands.\n\nWhile Republicans have blamed Obama-era environmental regulations for the loss of coal jobs, federal data shows that U.S. mines have been shedding jobs for decades under presidents from both parties as a result of increasing automation and competition from cheaper natural gas.

By contrast, renewable energy \u2014 including wind, solar and biofuels \u2014 now accounts for more than 650,000 U.S. jobs.\n\nThe Trump administration's plans drew praise from business groups and condemnation from environmental groups.\n\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas J.

It is highly unusual for a committee chairman and ranking member not to coordinate meetings related to an investigation.\n\n\"'I think the chairman has to make a decision whether to act as a surrogate of the White House \u2014 as he did during the campaign and the transition \u2014 or to lead an independent and credible investigation,\" Schiff said Sunday on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nThe disclosure renewed calls for an independent committee to investigate the Russia ties.\n\nIndeed, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called on House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to replace Nunes as chairman of the intelligence committee.\n\n\"He has not been operating like someone who is interested in getting to the unvarnished truth. His actions look like those of someone who is interested in protecting the president and his party,\" Schumer said.\n\nAshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan, said Monday the speaker has \"full confidence that Chairman Nunes is conducting a thorough, fair and credible investigation.\"\n\nNunes and Schiff have asked the FBI, CIA and National Security Agency for the names of officials who were cited in intelligence reports.

By federal law, they are required to inform the feds when they have an illegal immigrant in custody, even if he or she has not been convicted of a crime.\n\nSeveral big cities, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, as well as dozens and possibly hundreds of smaller counties, cities and towns, also refuse to notify ICE, which can then come and take custody of the illegal immigrant, possibly for deportation.\n\nExpand / Contract LA Mayor Eric Garcetti is defiant about his city's sanctuary status. (Associated Press)\n\n\u201cLAPD has never participated in programs that deputize local law enforcement to act as immigration agents, and on my watch they never will,\u201d Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said last week.\n\nA spokesman for Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said the administration's plan to hold back federal funds was \"no different than what was in the Executive Order [travel ban] the president signed weeks ago.\"\n\n\"The administration's plan to deny federal funds to cities that are standing up for their values is unconstitutional,\" said Matt McGrath, a spokesman for Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel. \"Chicago is proud to stand with 34 cities and counties across the country in asking a federal court to prevent the federal government from illegally withholding federal funds.\"\n\nImmediately after Sessions spoke, New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a staunch critic of Trump, said he will fight any efforts to defund sanctuary communities in the Empire State.\n\n\u201cMy office will continue to ensure local governments have the tools they need to legally protect their immigrant communities \u2013 and we won\u2019t stop fighting to beat back President Trump\u2019s un-American immigration policies,\u201d Schneiderman said in a statement.\n\nBut Sessions said such policies put citizens' safety in jeopardy.\n\n\"The American people know that when cities and states refuse to help enforce immigration laws, our nation is less safe,\" Sessions said.\n\nPerhaps telegraphing action President Trump warned of during his campaign, Sessions said the administration will pull billions in federal funding to sanctuary communities if they remain in noncompliance.\n\nSessions said communities applying for Department of Justice grants will be required to show they are following immigration law.\n\nThe DOJ will withhold, and could potentially \"claw back\" grants to localities out of compliance with federal immigration law, Sessions said. He noted one Justice Department office alone was expecting to award more than $4.1 billion in grants this fiscal year.\n\n\"Failure to deport aliens who are convicted of criminal offenses puts whole communities at risk, especially immigrant communities in the very sanctuary jurisdictions that seek to protect the perpetrators,\" Sessions said.\n\nSessions, an early supporter of Trump's candidacy, is a longtime illegal immigration hawk who helped drive Trump's winning platform plank on the subject.\n\nEarly in Trump's candidacy, in July 2015, a woman named Kate Steinle was killed in San Francisco by an illegal immigrant who had been deported previously and had recently been freed by local authorities. The murder became a rallying point for the campaign.\n\nMore recently, a 14-year-old Maryland high school girl was raped in a school bathroom allegedly by two men, at least one of whom is an illegal immigrant. That case has reignited the debate about illegal immigration and sanctuary policies.\n\nJust days after his inauguration, Trump ordered the Department of Homeland Security to publish a weekly list of all detainer requests turned down by local jails.

Five years later, Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and determined Yucca Mountain as the lone repository for high-level nuclear waste.\n\nAccording to a 2011 Government Accountability Office estimate, since 1987 the federal government has dumped $15 billion into developing the Nevada waste site.\n\nIn 2010, after major opposition from Reid, the Obama administration cut funding for the project early in the president\u2019s first term and, in 2011, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission allowed the shutdown of the project citing \u201cbudgetary limitations\u201d from Congress.\n\nNow the Trump administration plans to resuscitate the project.\n\nAccording to the president\u2019s budget proposal, the investments are said to accelerate progress on fulfilling the federal government\u2019s obligations to \u201caddress nuclear waste, enhance national security and reduce future taxpayer burden.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re approaching a third decade of federal abdication when it comes to the appropriate disposition of used nuclear fuel -- there are signs that the new administration wants to end the stalemate, but we need resolve from both branches of government,\u201d Nuclear Energy Institute spokesman John Keeley told Fox News. \u201cThe nuclear industry is committed to working with Congress and the administration to put the used fuel management program back on its feet.\n\nBut Fox News contributor and former Rep.

And Kucinich told Fox News that President Trump\u2019s proposed $120 million wouldn\u2019t even cover the cost of the paperwork in arranging Yucca Mountain.\n\n\u201cThe president, being a very famous developer, should know that a nuclear waste depository is the opposite of development -- no one wants to be anywhere near it,\u201d Kucinich told Fox News.\n\nThe White House did not have any further comment, other than the initial proposal for Yucca Mountain.\n\n\u201cThis is just a token of affection from the president to the nuclear industry, which will have very little impact on whether or not a nuclear dump is cited in Nevada,\u201d Kucinich said.\n\nNevada residents have strongly resisted the project.\n\nSen.

How about don\u2019t care - Nunes was at White House before shock presser - Trump blames Freedom Caucus for health bill failure - Trump creates job for son-in-law - And they probably don\u2019t even care\n\nTRUMPCARE? RYANCARE? HOW ABOUT DON\u2019T CARE\n\nThere is a difference between wanting and wishing, and it\u2019s all about effort.\n\nLooking admiringly at a beautiful baby grand piano, a party guest once remarked, \u201cI always wanted to play the piano\u2026\u201d She was rather taken aback when her host told her, \u201cNo you don\u2019t. Or you would\u2019ve taken lessons.\u201d\n\nWhat the woman meant was that she wished she knew how to play piano \u2013 that Jiminy Cricket would appear with his magic bumbershoot and make it so.\n\nNow we know that Republicans only wished that they could replace ObamaCare, but they didn\u2019t really want to do it.\n\nWe have talked before about the value of hypocrisy in politics and life. As La Rochefoucauld said \u201chypocrisy is the tribute vice pays to virtue.\u201d A helpful hypocrisy of politics past was that politicians claimed they were not interested in what was popular, but what was right immediately before abandoning all principal in favor of trying to win the next election.\n\nIt was maddening for Americans to see big talk about toughness and leadership give way to naked pandering, but at least the embarrassment of climbing down from the blustery heights of phony courage provided a disincentive for the next time.\n\nAs they would say in Triadelphia: Don\u2019t let your mouth write a check your behind can\u2019t cash. (But they don\u2019t really say \u201cbehind.\u201d)\n\nEven the most cynical observers were surprised at the craven political positioning in the hilariously brief struggle to enact a law that would\u2019ve touched every American and re-regulated at least a fifth of the entire economy.\n\nWhen President Trump -- who began his re-election campaign even before he took the oath of office for his first term -- was selling his health bill, he didn\u2019t bother talking about the legislation. He talked about what would happen to Republicans in 2018 if they didn\u2019t pass it. He talked about the need to win, but not why winning would have been a good thing.\n\nIf the goal of the endeavor was to win in Midterms and return Trump for a second term, then it was doomed from the beginning.\n\nThere are lots of big and maybe even good ideas on the left and right for how to fix what ails America\u2019s health care system. And guess what? They would all be unpopular, at least at first. That illustrates exactly why our founders chose a republic rather than a democracy. If the federal government could only do what was popular, this experiment wouldn\u2019t have lasted long at all.\n\nWe had reached a pretty low ebb on political courage in the Obama era as the former president and Democrats in Congress ended up muddling not just their health insurance law but policies ranging from bank regulations to the Syrian civil war based on a low threshold for political pain.\n\nWho knew that they would end up looking positively Jacksonian in their boldness?\n\nIt was, in fact, Trump\u2019s favorite president, Andrew Jackson, who said \u201cone man with courage makes a majority.\u201d What Old Hickory meant was that a human being possessed with an idea he or she believes in and the will to endure in the face of opposition is often how big things happen.\n\nWhat we saw last week on Obamacare was the exact opposite. No one seemed to believe in the product and no one was willing to pay any political price for its enactment. In that way, it is good that they abandoned the legislation. But it reveals something important about our political moment.\n\nWe have a president and Congress elected on the promise of upheaval, but who so far lack the willingness to pay the price.\n\nTrump\u2019s open, constant pursuit of a second term and the knock-kneed GOP\u2019s 2018 panic takes fundamental reform on big issues off the table. It usually takes some time for these realities to set in, but they didn\u2019t even make it 90 days, let alone 100.\n\nWe are now told that Republicans will move briskly toward tax reform, believing that the issue will be more popular. The White House even is promising that they will produce bipartisan legislation behind a major overhaul.\n\nIf they bring the same finger-in-the-wind approach to taxes that they did to health insurance, we will be in for another 18-day flop.\n\nReal leadership isn\u2019t doing what\u2019s popular. It is possessing a vision of the future and convincing people to take the harder way to get there. To pass real tax reform, it will require not deal-making, but rather a belief in an ambitious plan, salesmanship and, most of all, tenacity.\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: MORE THE BETTER\n\n\u201cThe ability of a country to pay taxes must always be proportioned, in a great degree, to the quantity of money in circulation, and to the celerity with which it circulates.\u201d \u2013Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 12\n\nTIME OUT: ANOTHER WAY TO GET YOUR GREENS\n\nNatGeo: \u201cScientists have found a way to use spinach to build working human heart muscle, potentially solving a long-standing problem in efforts to repair damaged organs. Their study, published this month by the journal Biomaterials, offers a new way to grow a vascular system, which has been a roadblock for tissue engineering. Scientists have already created large-scale human tissue in a lab using methods like 3D printing, but it\u2019s been much harder to grow the small, delicate blood vessels that are vital to tissue health\u2026One of the defining traits of a leaf is the branching network of thin veins that delivers water and nutrients to its cells. Now, scientists have used plant veins to replicate the way blood moves through human tissue.

Kislyak, according to the government officials.\u201d\n\nIvanka Trump to travel to Germany - WaPo: \u201cIvanka Trump is planning a trip to Germany to attend a summit on the economic empowerment of women, a senior administration official said Sunday.

Ted Poe's exit from the House Freedom Caucus after it helped sink the Republicans\u2019 ObamaCare overhaul has created widespread uncertainty about the political future of the caucus and its roughly 35 other members.\n\nThe picture emerging Monday appeared to be that caucus members realize that their future largely depends on fulfilling campaign promises to fully repeal and replace the 2010 health care law.\n\n\u201cYou cannot always say no,\u201d Poe told Fox News Monday morning, about 12 hours after his resignation from the conservative caucus and three days after House Speaker Paul Ryan cancelled a final vote on the bill in the GOP-led chamber.\n\nPoe, who supported the overall plan crafted by Ryan and his leadership team, also addressed the argument posed by President Donald Trump and others that voting against the plan could result in a 2018 re-election loss.\n\n\u201cI think we will repeal it,\u201d said Poe, a seven-term congressman. \u201cWe will do that.\u201d\n\nOhio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, a caucus co-founder, said Monday, \"We still have time.\"\n\nTrump met several times with Freedom Caucus members in recent weeks, with a focus on winning support from group leader Rep. Mark Meadows, even inviting him to the White House and his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago.\n\nHowever, Trump, amid the realization that the GOP plan might fail, hinted last week in a closed-door Capitol Hill meeting that non-supporters could suffer a primary defeat next year and said to Meadows, \u201cOh Mark, I'm going to come after you.\u201d\n\nMeadows, R-N.C., brushed aside both comments.\n\n\u201cI serve at the will of 750,000 people in western North Carolina. I\u2019m going to be a \u2018no\u2019 even if it sends me home,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know of too many people who can challenge me on the right.\u201d\n\nStill, voters in Meadows\u2019 largely blue-collar district and in some other conservative-leaning parts of the country appear to expect House Republicans to make good on repeal and replace vows.\n\n\u201cThey will come up with a plan that will make health care better for all Americans,\" Ralph Slaughter, chairman of North Carolina\u2019s Jackson County Republican Party, told Politico over the weekend.\n\nMeadows has signaled a desire to revisit the issue. But he and others might have missed their opportunity, considering Trump and Ryan now appear eager to move to tax reform and other big policy issues.\n\nPoe also told Fox News Monday that he has discussed his departure with members of the Freedom Caucus, which pushed out House Speaker John Boehner in 2015, apparently for not being conservative enough.\n\nBut none has expressed a desire to resign, too, he said.\n\nThe Harris County Republican Party, in Poe\u2019s east Texas district, declined Monday to talk about Poe\u2019s decision and whether re-election fears could have been a factor.\n\nCapitol Hill sources said Monday that caucus members and other House Republicans who opposed the overhaul plan still appear in a moment of reflection about a possible missed opportunity and the need to govern.\n\n\u201cPoe\u2019s departure is a sign that the Freedom Caucus needs to shift gears into a legislative mode,\u201d said David Payne, a Republican strategist and partner at Washington-based Vox Global. \u201cThey\u2019ve proven they can be a purity check. Now, they\u2019ll need to prove that they\u2019re a legislative force.\u201d\n\nPayne also argued that if House Republicans can unite and pass important bills in the coming weeks, the health care bill failure will quickly fade from memory.\n\n\u201cBut if a trend develops, the caucus might push Trump into the arms of moderate Democrats willing to pull bills to the left in exchange for passage,\u201d he said.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/27/whats-next-for-house-freedom-caucus-after-poes-exit.html"}, {"text": "White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer held his daily press briefing Monday, in which he is discussed the failed health care bill and the Russia probe.\n\nFollow FoxNews.com's live blog below.

The blows have landed in the state's biggest cities as well as towns surrounding its flagship university, and from the mountains to the coast.\n\nNorth Carolina could lose hundreds of millions more because the NCAA is avoiding the state, usually a favored host. The group is set to announce sites for various championships through 2022, and North Carolina won't be among them as long as the law is on the books. The NAACP also has initiated a national economic boycott.\n\nThe AP analysis \u2014 compiled through interviews and public records requests \u2014 represents the largest reckoning yet of how much the law, passed one year ago, could cost the state. The law excludes gender identity and sexual orientation from statewide antidiscrimination protections, and requires transgender people to use restrooms corresponding to the sex on their birth certificates in many public buildings.\n\nStill, AP's tally is likely an underestimation of the law's true costs. The count includes only data obtained from businesses and state or local officials regarding projects that canceled or relocated because of HB2. A business project was counted only if AP determined through public records or interviews that HB2 was why it pulled out.\n\nSome projects that left, such as a Lionsgate television production that backed out of plans in Charlotte, weren't included because of a lack of data on their economic impact.\n\nThe AP also tallied the losses of dozens of conventions, sporting events and concerts through figures from local officials. The AP didn't attempt to quantify anecdotal reports that lacked hard numbers, or to forecast the loss of future conventions.\n\nBank of America CEO Brian Moynihan \u2014 who leads the largest company based in North Carolina \u2014 said he's spoken privately to business leaders who went elsewhere with projects or events because of the controversy, and he fears more decisions like that are being made quietly.\n\n\"Companies are moving to other places because they don't face an issue that they face here,\" he told a World Affairs Council of Charlotte luncheon last month. \"What's going on that you don't know about? What convention decided to take you off the list? What location for a distribution facility took you off the list? What corporate headquarters consideration for a foreign company \u2014 there's a lot of them out there \u2014 just took you off the list because they just didn't want to be bothered with the controversy? That's what eats you up.\"\n\nOther measures show the country's ninth most populous state has a healthy economy. By quarterly gross domestic product, the federal government said, North Carolina had the nation's 10th fastest-growing economy six months after the law passed. The vast majority of large companies with existing operations in the state \u2014 such as American Airlines, with its second-largest hub in Charlotte \u2014 made no public moves to financially penalize North Carolina.\n\nShortly after he signed the law, Republican then-Gov. Pat McCrory issued a statement assuring residents it wouldn't affect North Carolina's status as \"one of the top states to do business in the country.\"\n\nHB2 supporters say its costs have been tiny compared with an economy estimated at more than $500 billion a year, roughly the size of Sweden's. They say they're willing to absorb those costs if the law prevents sexual predators posing as transgender people from entering private spaces to molest women and girls \u2014 acts the law's detractors say are imagined.\n\nLt. Gov. Dan Forest, one of the strongest supporters, accused news organizations of creating a false picture of economic upheaval. A global equestrian competition that's coming to North Carolina in 2018 despite HB2 is projected to have an economic impact bigger than the sporting events that have canceled, Forest said. The Swiss-based group behind the event estimated its spending poured about $250 million into the French region of Normandy the last time it was held \u2014 2014. The organization said the figure came from a study by consulting and accounting firm Deloitte, but the Federation Equestre Internationale declined to release the report.\n\nForest declined a request for an interview based on AP's analysis.\n\n\"The effect is minimal to the state,\" Forest told Texas legislators considering a similar law. \"Our economy is doing well. Don't be fooled by the media. This issue is not about the economy. This issue is about privacy, safety and security in the most vulnerable places we go.\"\n\nBut AP's analysis shows the economy could be growing faster if not for projects that have already canceled.\n\nThose include PayPal canceling a 400-job project in Charlotte, CoStar backing out of negotiations to bring 700-plus jobs to the same area, and Deutsche Bank scuttling a plan for 250 jobs in the Raleigh area. Other companies that backed out include Adidas, which is building its first U.S. sports shoe factory employing 160 near Atlanta rather than a High Point site, and Voxpro, which opted to hire hundreds of customer support workers in Athens, Georgia, rather than the Raleigh area.\n\n\"We couldn't set up operations in a state that was discriminating against LGBT\" people, Dan Kiely, Voxpro founder and CEO, said in an interview.\n\nAll told, the state has missed out on more than 2,900 direct jobs that went elsewhere.\n\nSupporters are hard-pressed to point to economic benefits from the law, said James Kleckley, of East Carolina University's business college.\n\n\"I don't know of any examples where somebody located here because of HB2,\" he said. \"If you look at a law, whether or not you agree with it or don't agree with it, there are going to be positive effects and negative effects. Virtually everything we know about (HB2) are the negative effects. Even anecdotally I don't know any positive effects.\"\n\nAn analysis by the state Commerce Department shortly before HB2 was enacted shows state officials expected the PayPal expansion to contribute more than $200 million annually to North Carolina's gross domestic product \u2014 an overall measure of the economy. By the end of 2028, the state expected PayPal to have added $2.66 billion to the state economy.\n\nThe same analysis of the Deutsche Bank project estimated a total impact of about $543 million by the end of 2027. The economic model has been used for more than a decade \u2014 with some updates along the way \u2014 when the state offers major discretionary tax breaks to attract jobs.\n\nState officials said they didn't run the same financial analysis for CoStar, Voxpro and Adidas, so losses attributed to them were calculated using payroll numbers and other figures from the companies or state documents.\n\nMeanwhile, canceled conventions, concerts and sporting events ranging from the NBA All-Star Game to a Bruce Springsteen show have deprived the state of more than $196 million. The number was compiled through email exchanges and interviews with local tourism officials.\n\nAll told, the state will have missed out on more than $3.76 billion by the end of 2028. The losses are based on projects that already went elsewhere \u2014 so the money won't be recouped even if the law is struck down in court or repealed.\n\nBy the end of 2017 alone, the lost business will total more than $525 million.\n\nTourism officials in several cities say the numbers they report represent only a fraction of the damage the law has done. They typically track large conventions but don't have firm numbers for when groups or tourists cancel smaller deals \u2014 or rule out North Carolina before booking.\n\n\"The biggest impact is how many times our phones are not ringing now,\" said Shelly Green, CEO of the Durham Convention & Visitors Bureau.\n\nWhen Green's bureau sought to tally cancellations, it was able to count several large sporting events and conventions that backed out, depriving the city of more than $11 million, she said. But officials found hotels and meeting planners were tight-lipped about other events.\n\n\"There are a lot more meetings that have canceled, but we don't have data on them,\" she said.\n\nElsewhere, tourism setbacks range from an estimated $100 million lost when the 2017 NBA All-Star Game moved out of Charlotte to $36,000 in spending taken elsewhere when the Lutheran Financial Managers Convention backed out of Fayetteville. Seven hundred part-time workers at Raleigh's PNC Arena lost at least $130,000 in wages because of cancellations by Pearl Jam, Cirque Du Soleil and others.\n\nOther financial signals of disapproval have been more symbolic than clearly harmful.\n\nMore than two dozen cities and states, from Honolulu to Vermont, have banned taxpayer-funded visits to North Carolina because of HB2. Most said they couldn't estimate the money not spent on business travel. But in Providence, Rhode Island, officials refused to spend even the remaining $495 to send three city employees to a Charlotte conference after sponsors picked up most of the costs, city spokesman Victor Morente said via email.\n\nDozens of investment firms have urged North Carolina to repeal HB2, but most of those contacted in recent weeks, such as John Hancock and Morgan Stanley, wouldn't discuss any financial measures they took to penalize the state. Trillium Asset Management, which manages more than $2 billion for wealthy families and foundations, had dozens of clients request that their holdings exclude bonds issued by North Carolina state or municipal governments, Chief Executive Officer Matt Patsky said in an interview.\n\nWhat impact did selling off several million dollars of municipal bonds have? Impossible to measure, Patsky said.\n\nIn September, despite the law, Asheville's Chamber of Commerce announced that biotech company Avadim was adding 550 jobs. Local officials call it the biggest single job creator in area history.\n\nBut HB2 jeopardized another project of similar size for the left-leaning mountain city. Chamber CEO Kit Cramer said last year that another company considering bringing 500 technology jobs was balking because of HB2, adding: \"That's a loss that would be incredibly hard to swallow.\" Cramer said in an email in March that the company hasn't made a decision. She didn't give further details; that potential loss wasn't included in AP's count.\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina's largest city, has lost projects totaling 2,000 jobs because of HB2, Chamber of Commerce research director Chuck McShane said in an email. According to separate documents obtained through public records requests, the majority were in the PayPal and CoStar projects.\n\nCoStar, a real-estate research firm, was entering final negotiations to bring 732 jobs to Charlotte in September when its board backed out because of negative publicity over HB2, according to an email between a chamber executive and a city official. When the company picked Virginia, the reversal cost North Carolina at least $250 million in economic impact over the next six years, according to figures from both states.\n\n\"I fear this will be an epidemic outcome for many projects we are still in the running for at this time,\" Jeffrey Edge of the Charlotte Chamber wrote in the September email exchange first reported by The Charlotte Observer.\n\nEconomic losses also hit smaller towns, such as those surrounding the University of North Carolina. When the San Francisco Symphony pulled out of two concerts scheduled for April 2017, the move had a ripple effect totaling about $325,000, according to Patty Griffin, of the Chapel Hill/Orange County Visitors Bureau.\n\n\"Memorial Hall will be empty those two nights and see no revenue for tickets or concessions, and no employees will work,\" she said via email. \"The attendees for most of them who have dinner, drinks and desserts either before or after the performance will not come out, which impacts local restaurants.\"\n\nGreen, the Durham tourism official, said, \"When you think about it, this whole thing is just such a Dumpster fire, and nobody wants to go near it.\"", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/27/bathroom-bill-to-cost-north-carolina-3-76b-report-says.html"}, {"text": "Two companies from the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division are being deployed to the Mosul to bolster security in Iraq at the request of the top American commander in Baghdad fighting ISIS, a U.S. defense official with knowledge of the order told Fox News.\n\nA U.S. defense official told Fox News the 200 additional troops from the 82nd Airborne Division are going to Mosul\u2014\u201cto provide additional \u2018advise and assist\u2019 support to our Iraq Partners as they liberate Mosul,\u201d according to the official.\n\nIn another sign the Pentagon is ramping up the fight against ISIS, jets from the aircraft carrier USS George HW Bush began striking ISIS targets on Friday, days after arriving in the Persian Gulf.\n\nLast month, Bush conducted airstrikes in Syria from the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nUS-BACKED FORCES SEIZE SYRIAN AIR BASE FROM ISIS\n\nIn recent weeks, multiple press reports said upwards of 1,000 additional American troops would deploy to Kuwait or Syria to act as a \"reserve force.\" These reports were said to be inaccurate by multiple Pentagon officials.\n\n\"I don't foresee us bringing in large numbers of coalition troops, mainly because what we're doing is in fact working,\" said Townsend in a press briefing with Pentagon reporters earlier this month.\n\nIRAQ PM SAYS ISIS WILL BE DEFEATED 'WITHIN WEEKS'\n\nSome of the additional forces from the 82nd Airborne Division will head to the Qayyarah Airfield West, or \"Q-West\" as the soldiers call it, the official said.

Your loss is my loss.\" Hussein's profoundly moving gesture generated a flicker of hope for Jordanians and Israelis. From the public reaction to the recent release of the schoolgirls' killer, Ahmed Daqamseh, however, we learn that the late monarch\u2019s humanity is no match for the hatred generated by Muslim clerics.\n\nDuring his lifetime, King Hussein saw it all. As a teenager, he was at the side of his grandfather, King Abdullah I, when he was assassinated at Jerusalem\u2019s Al-Aqsa Mosque, for his willingness to seek peace with the Jews. The assassin was a former terrorist connected with Haj Amin Al-Husayni, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, collaborator with Hitler, and architect of a militant Palestinian anti-Semitism. Fifty years ago, Hussein joined in Abdel Nasser\u2019s war with Israel in 1967, only to lose half his kingdom.\n\nIn the end, he rose above the hate and fear to make peace with Israel. And on that day in northern Israel, King Hussein displayed a nobility of compassion the world will never forget.\n\nThat nobility did not find its way to the people. Before Daqamseh\u2019s trial, 200 lawyers and the Jordanian Bar Association competed for the privilege of defending him. Four years later, his mother reflected, \"I am proud of my son, and I hold my head high. My son did a heroic deed and has pleased God and his own conscience. My son lifts my head and the head of the entire Arab and Islamic nation. I am proud of any Muslim who does what Ahmad did.\u201d\n\nAhmed Daqamseh had 20 years in prison to reflect on his murder of the seventh- and eighth-grade students as they alighted from a bus at the \u201cIsland of Peace,\u201d a joint Jordanian-Israeli tourist location under Jordanian control. He took pains to shoot some of his victims at close range, and later lamented only that his M16 had worked imperfectly, so he was unable to murder the entire busload of students.\n\nDaqamseh learned nothing during his incarceration. After walking out of prison, he said: \u201cThey (Jews) are human garbage \u2026This garbage should be burned or buried.\u201d Upon his release, hundreds of enthusiastic supporters traveled to his hometown to welcome their \u201chero.\u201d\n\nWith one exception, his \u201cheroics\u201d went unchallenged in the Jordanian media. Not surprising, when you consider a 2009 Pew poll that reported that negative attitudes toward Jews in Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinian territories and Lebanon reached 95-98 percent. The percentage plummeted to 35 percent among Israeli Arabs, who actually live among Jews \u2013 demonstrating that indoctrination, rather than personal experience, is the key factor in bigotry. Contempt for the \u201cother\u201d didn\u2019t end with Jews: 40 percent of the Arab respondents held negative views about Christians.\n\nWhere does this hate come from? Egypt\u2019s President Al-Sisi challenged the clerics of Al-Azhar, the world\u2019s oldest Sunni university, during a 2015 visit:\n\n\u201cIs it possible that 1.6 billion people [Muslims] should want to kill the rest of the world\u2019s inhabitants -- that is 7 billion -- so that they themselves may live? Impossible! I say and repeat again that we are in need of a religious revolution. You, imams, are responsible before Allah.\u201d\n\nAttitudes in the Middle East are shaped to an outsize degree by mosque and madrassah, where Muslim clerics hold the keys. Many Muslim religious leaders point fingers at ISIS and Al Qaeda, hoping to distract attention from the fundamentalist message they serve up regularly, teaching contempt \u2013 and worse \u2013 for Jews, Christians, Westerners and gays. Recently, Mufti Muhammad Hussein, Palestinian President Abbas\u2019 appointee as chief religious authority, publicly stated that killing Jews -- accepted in Islam as the \u201cpeople of the Book\u201d -- is a Muslim obligation. God knows what fate he will command upon Hindus and Buddhists, who are regarded as pagan.\n\nOne Israeli mother harbors a different message. Nurit Fathi\u2019s daughter Sivan was 13 years old when Daqamseh murdered her. Nurit misses \u201cher laughter, her smile, her joy of life,\u201d but insists that, \u201cDespite the murder, we are for peace.\u201d\n\nWhen the great Chassidic Rabbi Levi Yitzchak of Berditchiv was asked how a charity campaign was going, he replied that he was halfway there. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten the poor to agree to receive. Now all I have to do is convince the rich to give.\u201d In the Middle East, there are people who lost their children to terrorists, yet still yearn for peace.

All they ever cared about (can you blame them) is being taken care of if they are sick and being able to afford that care.\n\nThey don\u2019t like (nor do I) all the excess paperwork at the doctors\u2019 office these days and all the time I have to spend documenting things in the computer. Nothing\u2019s easy anymore. All my patients understand that when they have to wait it\u2019s not because I\u2019m on the golf course, but rather that I\u2019m stuck documenting or ordering things on patients I saw before them. Of course, knowing this doesn\u2019t make it easier and I can\u2019t blame my patients for feeling uneasy.\n\nBut I can promise you that the politicians in Washington, D.C., are not envisioning what it\u2019s like to seek care in an actual doctor\u2019s office. That was the problem before, and it\u2019s the problem now. No patient would ever confuse health insurance and health care the way the politicians have. Patients understand that insurance promises care but doesn\u2019t always deliver it, especially if you have a $12,000 deductible to overcome first or your doctor\u2019s schedule is full.\n\nNone of my patients (even those with Attention Deficit Disorder) would ever try to accomplish several different things at once in their job, and none of them would try to push their agenda down other peoples\u2019 throats at work exactly the same way it had been done to them seven years before.\n\nMost of my patients -- including the lawyers -- understand compromise and co-operation, negotiation and arbitration. Few would have recommended attaching Medicaid reform to Planned Parenthood defunding and lumping it all together with a scalping of taxes and deregulations and establishing a national marketplace and cutting so-called essential benefits and supposedly playing it out over three phases. All too complicated and testosterone-laced for the average patient.\n\nBut wait a minute. Isn\u2019t the average patient (and their doctor) supposed to be the target audience here?\n\nSo what now? Now that we\u2019ve reached a Shakespearean standstill, what\u2019s next? I have a suggestion: Can we finally try to sideline the insurance lobbyists (AKA THE SWAMP) and work to please the average patient (and their doctor)?\n\nWhy not start with this -- ALL of my patients recognize that the high deductibles and high premiums of ObamaCare are prohibitive. Yes, the government (tax dollars) pay down their premium if they are lower middle class so their bottom line is improved, but they are still faced with that mountainous deductible and few insurers, few doctors and few labs to serve them. That\u2019s why ObamaCare doesn\u2019t work.\n\nMany of my young, healthy patients want catastrophic insurance that they can use if they are in an accident and have to go to an emergency room rather than be faced with a huge bill. But most would rather buy a low cost policy than be forced to pay a high premium to cover someone else's mental health services or a copay on someone else\u2019s colonoscopy. Can you blame them? No wonder that according to HHS 45 percent of those who took the penalty rather than buy ObamaCare are under 35 years old.\n\nIn other words, my patients need a catastrophic option without all the \u201cessential\u201d benefits of ObamaCare. They need to NOT be forced to buy health insurance if it doesn\u2019t guarantee actual health care.\n\nMedicaid needs to be made more efficient, but NOT overhauled at this point. The popular expansion needs to stay. How about simply introducing a bridge-to-jobs program and premium pay-in for extra services and rewards for efficiency and good doctoring.\n\nPlanned Parenthood needs to be kept completely out of the equation; it has nothing to do with reforming or replacing ObamaCare and should never have been glued into a replacement bill.\n\nI bet if Medicaid is left alone we can get some Democrats to vote for a new bill. I bet that if we remove the one-size fits all prix fixe solution from ObamaCare and offer a la carte choices we will attract more small insurers to the market -- which will introduce competition and bring down the price.\n\nI also bet that if we increase Health Savings Accounts as part of the health care soup we will encourage patients to negotiate for services -- which could also bring down the price. While we\u2019re at it, why don\u2019t we pay doctors a bit more and add malpractice reform which will lead to less defensive doctoring and also bring down the price.\n\nBut the truth is I don\u2019t care about pleasing Democrats OR insurers or even doctors, for that matter. I care about my patients.

Probably. Should he have let Ryan take the lead? Probably not, for the House speaker couldn't deliver. Was the bill rushed and badly flawed? Absolutely.\n\nBut my sense is that Trump didn\u2019t care that much about the details, which is why he made several concessions, including on Medicaid. He wanted a deal, something he could declare a victory before turning to the rest of his agenda. He simply is not as passionate about the intricacies of medical insurance as he is about trade and immigration.\n\nIn the end, the bill that nobody liked died.

They say it would help fill Illinois' multibillion-dollar budget hole with $350 to $700 million in new tax revenue.\n\nA national advocacy group, the Marijuana Policy Project, based the estimate on the proposal's $50-per-ounce wholesale tax, Illinois' standard sales tax, federal marijuana consumption data and recreational pot prices in Colorado. The proposal earmarks 50 percent of wholesale revenues for the state's general fund and divides the remaining half 30/20 between education and public health.\n\nEvery state to legalize pot to date has done so by voter ballot initiative, according to Chris Lindsey, a legislative analyst with the project. But Illinois advocates are not alone in holding out hope for lawmaker approval. Seventeen other states \u2014 including Missouri \u2014 are also considering legislative action.\n\nRep. Kelly Cassidy, a Chicago Democrat who co-sponsored 2014 legislation that legalized medical marijuana in Illinois, is sponsoring the proposal in the House. She said states that legalized marijuana have seen an economic boost from increased tax revenue, new jobs and bolstered tourism.\n\n\"We're talking about all sorts of ways of raising revenue,\" Cassidy said, referring to state lawmakers' efforts to break a two-year budget logjam. \"We might as well be talking about this, too.\"\n\nBut she and fellow Chicago Democrat Sen. Heather Steans, who sponsored legislation that succeeded in decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of pot last year, know their new pitch could be a tough sell. They plan to jumpstart conversations with lawmakers, interest groups and the public this spring but won't move legislation forward in the current session.\n\nKey players like the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police currently oppose the measure. Ed Wojcicki, the association's director, called legalizing recreational pot \"an enforcement nightmare.\" He said existing science remains inconclusive about how to best identify impairment on the road and in other compromising situations.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Lou Lang of Skokie, lead sponsor of the medical marijuana proposal, suggested the staggered timeline could help lawmakers gain a more complete picture of potential benefits and consequences \u2014 especially as more data rolls in on Illinois' pilot medical marijuana program, which launched in late 2015.\n\n\"I do think this might be in Illinois' future,\" Lang said. \"I certainly support the idea of having a discussion.\"\n\nIllinois legalization advocates like Dan Linn, who directs the state chapter of a nonprofit lobbying group called NORML, have long been working toward this conversation. Linn said states where pot is legal have recorded no uptick in traffic fatalities. Instead of threatening public safety, he contended, regulating the already widely consumed substance will take the business out of the hands of criminals and impose important regulations like quality and age controls.\n\n\"There's not a drug dealer in this country that asks for an ID when someone's looking to buy drugs,\" he said.\n\nThe proposal is launching at a time when the federal government, which still lists marijuana as an illegal drug, is considering ramping up enforcement against recreational use. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said last month his department is reviewing an Obama administration memo that gave states flexibility in passing marijuana laws.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/27/illinois-lawmakers-see-marijuana-legalization-as-gateway-to-fiscal-boost.html"}, {"text": "Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, will be tapped to lead a new White House office that will effort to use business solutions to fix \u201cgovernment stagnation\u201d, a senior White House official told Fox News Sunday.\n\n\"We can confirm we are making an announcement tomorrow to establish the White House office of American Innovation and look forward to sharing additional details,\" the official said.\n\nThe office will be filled by former business executives and seeks to bring in new thinking to Washington, the Washington Post reported.

Col. Daniel thought the Pentagon had made a huge mistake.\n\nHe was driving in his car in 2009 when he found out \"the Raptor fleet is done at 187, and I remember thinking, 'This is not great.' I thought it was an error.\"\n\nBecause, \"more is better than less, right?\" said the F-22 pilot of the 95th Fighter Squadron. He spoke to Military.com on the condition that his last name not be used, due to safety concerns amid ongoing air operations against the Islamic State.\n\nMilitary.com recently sat down with a few pilots and a maintainer at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, as part of a trip to observe fifth-generation F-22s flying with fourth-generation F/A-18 Hornets for training.\n\nThe Air Force originally wanted 381 Raptors. Had the service acquired that many of the stealthy twin-engine fighters from Lockheed Martin Corp., life nowadays might be slightly less hectic for the service members who fly and maintain them.\n\nMore of the F-22 fleet could \"mitigate [operations] tempo, and we're always on the road so if we had more Raptors, there'd be more Raptor squadrons, more Raptor maintainers that would mitigate some training and operational demands,\" Daniel said.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nF-22 Raptors at Air Combat Exercise Red Flag 17-1\n\nLt. Col. Ben of the 325th Operations Group agreed.\n\n\"That's exactly right,\" he said. \"But these decisions are above my pay grade.\"\n\nDaniel added, \"Of course, there's a huge cost with that.\"\n\nHe's right. Indeed, cost was the driving factor behind then-Defense Secretary Bob Gates' decision to push for the Pentagon to prematurely stop buying the aircraft.\n\nAccording to a 2010 RAND study, to restart the F-22 production line to build 75 more of the jets would cost about $20 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars.\n\nTo build a new Raptor -- not a 1990s version -- \"you're not building the same airplane you were building before, and it becomes a much more expensive proposition,\" a defense analyst in Washington, D.C. told Military.com on background on Thursday.\n\n\"So do you build a new \u2018old\u2019 F-22, or do you build an improved one?\" the analyst said.\n\nAnd that figure is a rough estimate to restart a marginal lot of planes. It doesn't take into account the cost of hiring workers, integrating newer stealth technologies, or training and equipping additional pilots.\n\nPreparing Raptor pilots to fly from the nest takes time, too.\n\n\"To make a really good F-22 pilot, I need about seven to eight years to get him to where he is fully employing a jet and can actually quarterback the whole fight,\" Daniel said.\n\nBut as the Air Force weighs retiring its F-15C/D fleet sometime in the mid-2020s (though lawmakers in Congress will have a say in the matter), many defense experts question how the service plans to maintain its air superiority. For example, will the F-22 eventually take over the role of the F-15 Eagle? If so, will Raptor pilots be more in demand than ever?\n\nThe questions aren't abstract. Both the active-duty component and Air National Guard are considering retiring the Boeing-made Eagle, service officials told the House Armed Services Subcommittee during a hearing on Wednesday. The F-16 Fighting Falcon could take over missions from the F-15, they said.\n\nRep. Martha McSally, an Arizona Republican and former Air Force officer who flew the A-10 Thunderbolt II ground-attack aircraft, said \"prior to the F-22, [the F-15] was the best at air-to-air.\" The F-16, a fixed-wing, single-engine, fourth-generation platform, \"doesn't bring the same capability,\" she said.\n\nThe reference by Air Force officials to F-16 rather than F-22 during the hearing also caught the analyst by surprise.\n\n\"Why didn't the Air Force say F-22 restart?\" he said during a telephone interview. \"Why did they leak that they're looking to replace it with F-16s instead of using it as a case to examine F-22 restart?\"\n\nOne reason might be because the Senate hasn't yet confirmed Heather Wilson, a former Congresswoman nominated by President Donald Trump, to become the next Air Force Secretary, the analyst said. Until she's confirmed, \"the Air Force is worried about making any major decisions,\" he said.\n\nAnother reason might be because Air Force leaders have zero interest in restarting the F-22 production line. The reference to F-16 may suggest \"this is the end for F-22 restart story -- not the beginning of it,\" he said.\n\nEarlier this week, officials at Lockheed -- which produces the F-16 and F-22 -- told DefenseOne it plans to move the F-16 production line to South Carolina from Fort Worth, Texas, where it built the single-engine fighters for more than 40 years.\n\nAs of Sept. 30, the Air Force had 949 Fighting Falcons, according to Air Force inventory figures obtained by Military.com.\n\nBy comparison, the service has less than half as many Eagles and F-15E Strike Eagles. The F-15 inventory totals 456 aircraft and is split almost evenly between the two variants, with 236 of the older Eagles, including 212 one-seat F-15C models and 24 two-seat F-16D models, according to the service data.\n\n\"F-15C/D is just one job,\" the analyst said of the all-weather, tactical fighter. \"The Air Force is going to make the same argument it made on the A-10, which is, 'As we look around the Air Force to save money, we're going to retire things that have one job.'\n\n\"The F-16 is multi-role \u2026 and the F-16 has grown significantly since it was just a little squirt under the F-15's wing,\" he said.\n\nFor example, in December, Raytheon Co. was awarded a contract to upgrade the F-16 computer system as part of the Modular Mission Computer Upgrade, which features \"more than two times the current processing power and 40 times the current memory, equipping USAF pilots with near-fifth-generation aircraft computing power,\" the company said in a release at the time.\n\nJust this past week, the Air Force announced the 416th Flight Test Squadron at Edwards Air Force Base in California has begun testing F-16s equipped with Northrop Grumman's APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar, a fifth-generation Active Electronically Scanned Array fire-control radar.\n\n\"It is intended to replace currently used APG-66 and APG-68 radars and provide the F-16 with advanced capabilities similar to fifth-generation fighters like the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II,\" the service said in a release.\n\nThe Air Force claims it has the capacity in the F-16C community \"to recapitalize \u2026 radar to serve the same function as the F-15 has done and thereby reduce the different systems that we have to sustain and operate, so that makes it more efficient,\" said Maj. Gen. Scott D. West, director of current operations and the service\u2019s deputy chief of staff for operations at the Pentagon.\n\nThe effort will help minimize the number of systems pilots operate, West said during the hearing on Capitol Hill.\n\nAs for the Eagle, Air National Guard Director Lt. Gen. Scott Rice told Military.com that any planned upgrades will be fulfilled. However, the Air Force may want to look at the next block of upgrades to save on future sustainment and operational costs, he said.\n\nRice said he believes the Air Force is getting beyond comparing aircraft platforms, \"especially in the digital age\" when looking at the platforms as systems and \"how they integrate is as important and, in the future, will be even more important than the platform itself,\" he said.\n\nThe F-16 is a \"less capable dogfighter than the F-15,\" the analyst added, \"but at the same time the question is, 'How realistic is it that you're going to have a single F-16 without any help'\" from other fighter jets? \"That's not how we plan to fly,\" he said.\n\nLast year, the House Armed Services Air and Land Forces subcommittee tasked the Air Force to issue a study of what it would take to get the F-22 line up and running again.\n\nWhether the official study has been completed, \"preliminary assessment showed it was cost prohibitive to reopen the F-22 line,\" an Air Force spokeswoman told Military.com on Thursday, in line with RAND's study.\n\nEven so, Lockheed is offering advice on what it would take to do so, said John Cottam, F-22 program deputy for the company in Fort Worth.\n\n\"They have come to us and have asked us for inputs into that study, so we have been working very hard with them, in concert with them to provide that data,\" he said last month. \"With this new administration, they have priorities that are putting Americans back to work and making America strong, so we believe that what the Air Force provides could very easily resonate with the administration's policies.\"\n\nCottam added, \"As time goes on, if the report isn't delivered [to Congress], we can then keep delivering our responses and making it more and more refined.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Raptor pilots can't help but wonder if newly minted aircraft will again come off the production line.\n\nIn any exercise, pilots show up the first couple of days, \"integrate with other platforms -- everyone's trying to learn,\" Daniel said. \"By the end of the first week, everybody realized we need about 30 more F-22s in the lane because as soon as the F-22s leave, people start to die in the air-to-air fight.\"\n\nDaniel said, \"It's always disappointing that we don't have more, or don't have more missiles, more gas -- it's always frustrating as an F-22 pilot when you hear, 'Bingo, bingo,' and you're out of missiles and you go home and you start hearing other planes getting shot down.\"\n\nThe stealth, the speed, the \"unfair amount of information the jet provides to us \u2026 .it's magic,\" he said.\n\nEven with oncoming upgrades to the F-16, many fighter pilots and others question whether a fourth-generation fighter will -- or could -- ever step up to such a role.\n\n-- Oriana Pawlyk can be reached at oriana.pawlyk@military.com.

Bush nor Barack Obama chose to use the term. Thus, even though we have been at war in the Middle East since 2001 \u2013 and even though we continue to see horrific terrorist attacks by Islamic State loyalists from San Bernardino and Orlando to Paris and Brussels and now London just this week -- we have never had a Commander-in-Chief actually define for the American people the nature of our enemy.\n\n\u201cWe will unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth,\u201d you vowed in January.\n\nThen, before a Joint Session of Congress last month, you built on the theme that you began during the campaign, declaring that your administration is committed to \u201ctaking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism.\u201d\n\nSuch language has been sharply criticized by former aides to President Barack Obama, who insisted on saying he was countering \u201cviolent extremism.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was accomplished by declaring war on \u2018radical Islamic terrorism\u2019?\u201d Ben Rhodes, the former National Security Council official, Tweeted during the Joint Session. \u201cJust alienating Muslim allies who we need, and emboldening terrorists.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing magic about those three words,\u201d Tweeted Marie Harf, the former State Department spokeswoman. \u201cThey\u2019re not a strategy, they\u2019re a talking point.\u201d\n\nIgnore such partisan sniping, Mr. President. You are absolutely right to shine a spotlight on the homicidal ideology that drives jihadists to wage war against us and our allies. But be careful. Don\u2019t assume everyone knows what you mean. The phrase, after all, is simply shorthand. Now that you have captured people\u2019s attention by using the term, you must define it. As leader of the free world, you have an extraordinary platform to educate a national and global audience about the true nature and magnitude of the threat in more detail and with more precision. Seize it.\n\nHere are three suggestions:\n\nFirst, be clear and consistent that the vast majority of Muslims are not dangerous.\n\nThis may seem an obvious point, but there is genuine confusion among some. There are people \u2013 at home and abroad \u2013 who hear you use the phrase \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d and think you mean that the entire Islamic religion is radical and thus all Muslims are prone to terrorism. Since you\u2019re actually using the word \u201cradical\u201d to define a subgroup that approves of violence against innocents, and not to cast aspersions on the broader Muslim faith, be forward-leaning in making the distinction crystal clear.\n\nSince the Al Qaeda attacks of 9/11, the Pew Research Center, Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Gallup and other organizations have conducted extensive polling throughout Islamic world on Muslim attitudes regarding a wide range of political and religious subjects.\n\nAn analysis of the data suggests that the vast majority of Muslims overseas \u2013 upwards of 90 percent \u2013 generally do not support violence against civilians to advance their beliefs. However, between 7 and 10 percent of Muslims worldwide can be characterized as having radical views in that they openly state that they support the extreme violence of the Islamic State or support the use of suicide bombings against innocent civilian targets to advance their political or religious objectives.\n\nStudy this 90/10 split. Immerse yourself and your national security team in the data. Direct the State Department to do more polling. And start explaining the 90/10 split to the public so they understand you\u2019re not speaking about most Muslims.\n\nSecond, define for the public the nature of this violent subset and the gravity of the threat they pose.\n\nSaying that \u201conly\u201d 7 percent to 10 percent sympathize with jihadists is true and fair, but hardly comforting. In a world of 1.6 billion Muslims, this means upwards of 160 million people could be fairly characterized as sympathizing with \u201cradical Islam\u201d or, more precisely, \u201cmilitant Islamism,\u201d a violent political ideology that seeks to accomplish totalitarian objectives under the cloak of Islam.\n\nImagine if this subset established their own country. It could be the ninth largest country in the world. Larger than Russia. Half the population of the United States. Not all Muslims who hold extreme views will turn to violence, of course. But this is the pool from which Islamist terrorist organizations and states raise funds, recruit new members, and inspire \u201clone wolf\u201d attacks. Explain this to people.\n\nExplain the objectives of the jihadists. And point out sobering truths like the fact that in 2016 alone, 37 people were arrested in the U.S. for ISIS-plots. ISIS began as al Qaeda in Iraq. Now it has recruited terrorists from 120 countries, and have murdered more than 1,200 people in countries outside of Iraq and Syria. Most people don\u2019t know this.\n\nMake it clear that this is precisely why we need to improve vetting procedures to prevent confirmed radicals from entering the U.S. This is why we need to protect our borders from jihadists trying to infiltrate, and why we need a comprehensive plan to defeat the Islamic State and a defense budget that will get the job done right.\n\nThird, continue to strengthen ties to our Muslim allies, and seek their counsel not just on war-planning but on strategic messaging.\n\nYour recent meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent a strong message of unity in the face of terror, since Israel is on the frontlines of the fight against jihadism. But I\u2019m encouraged that you also recently met with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, the Saudi Deputy Crown Prince, and will soon meet with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\n\nYour meeting with Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II was also important, as he is America\u2019s most faithful Sunni Arab ally, a direct descendent of the Prophet Muhammad, and a courageous leader against the jihadists.\n\n\u201cFor those of us who are Muslim, this fight is very personal,\u201d the Jordanian King recently explained in an address to the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington. \u201cThese criminals are khawarej; outlaws to our faith. People nowadays talk about \u2018Fake News\u2019; the khawarej produce \u2018Fake Islam\u2019. They selectively paste together the words of Islamic texts, to promote a false and perverted ideology. In reality, everything they are, everything they do, is a blatant violation of the teachings of my faith.\u201d\n\nThe King added, \u201cI have called on the Muslim world to fight back boldly. We, like other faith communities, have a vast silent majority and it is time for that majority to get loud and to be clear in their condemnation.\u201d\n\nAmen. Avail yourself of the King\u2019s wise counsel, Mr. President. Ask him and other moderate Muslim leaders how best to shape your message. Then speak to the American people.\n\nI recently commissioned McLaughlin & Associates, a leading U.S. polling firm whose clients include your presidential campaign, to conduct a national survey to better understand how Americans view the war against ISIS. The results were sobering. A plurality believe we are losing the war, and most believe ISIS will launch catastrophic attacks inside the American homeland.\n\nSome of the most interesting results came when we asked people how they want their leaders to talk about the enemy we face.\n\nFortunately, we found that only 10 percent believe \u201cour leaders should say we are waging a war against the religion of Islam.\u201d\n\nSome 36 percent believe \u201cour leaders should not mention Islam at all, but simply say we are waging war against the forces of violent extremism.\u201d\n\nBut fully 45 percent believe \u201cour leaders should say we are waging war against the forces of radical Islam, but be careful to explain that most Muslims are not our enemy.\u201d\n\nGood.\n\nThis is the right way to talk about the war, shining a spotlight on the forces of the radicals, while affirming that the vast majority of Muslims at home and abroad are not our enemy, and should be mobilized as our allies in this war. And most of that, 45 percent, are people who voted for you, so you have a strong base of support for this approach and can build from there.\n\nMr. Trump, in the aftermath of the savage London attacks, you have a unique and historic opportunity to deliver a major address to the American people to define our enemy and explain your vision for victory.\n\nCarpe diem.\n\nJoel C.

When asked if he was still whipping the vote, Scalise replied, \u201cWe will have more conversations tonight.\u201d\n\nSeveral senior House GOP sources made clear that the administration was responsible for converting nays to yeas. Some House Republican leadership figures and White House sources openly lit into the Freedom Caucus, saying there was an effort to \u201cisolate\u201d those members for never budging.\n\n\u201cNothing\u2019s changed,\u201d sighed exhausted caucus leader Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., after the meeting. \u201cI\u2019m not confident in anything right now. All I\u2019m confident in is I\u2019m going home to go to bed.\u201d\n\nPeople weren\u2019t home in bed very long. Updated bill text arrived just before midnight Thursday, courting the likes of some moderates.\n\nGOP Reps. Tom MacArthur, N.J.; Martha McSally, Ariz.; Elise Stefanik, N.Y.; and Tim Murphy, Pennsylvania, all applauded the changes. The Rules Committee scheduled a 7 a.m. meeting to prepare the updated bill for the floor Friday.\n\n\u201cThe directive to us last night was to put our pencils down and turn our papers in,\u201d said Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas, as the House GOP prepared the health care bill for debate.\n\nBut something was amiss.\n\nVice President Pence was slated to head to Little Rock, Ark., and Memphis, Tenn., on Friday morning.\n\nBut the vice president cancelled the trip on little notice, and motored to the GOP\u2019s \u201cCapitol Hill Club,\u201d a hangout just behind the Cannon House Office Building. A secretive huddle with members of the Freedom Caucus at the Capitol Hill Club would avoid reporters streaming through the Capitol.\n\nRyan then dashed off to the White House to meet with the president.\n\nThere would be no need for either event if the vote count was solid.\n\nThe magic number to pass a bill in the House was 216, with 430 sitting members and five vacancies. The number necessary for passage was expected to be a little lower as there are always absences. (Hey, you try getting 430 people in the same room at the same time). Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., was out because his wife passed away.\n\nThe House usually conducts a series of \u201cbed check\u201d votes ahead of major issues on the floor. Such votes are often on parliamentary issues or non-controversial bills.\n\nThe checks enable leaders to determine how many members are actually present that day and also do final assessments of where members stand on an issue. On those roll calls, the total of members voting ranged between 422, 424 and 420. That meant the threshold to pass the health care bill could be 212, 213 or 211 yeas.\n\nBut the House was never within striking distance. If Republicans were within a vote or two, the GOP brass might be able to lug it across the finish line. But this bill was going to fail. Forging ahead with a roll call vote would put a lot of members on the record on a bill destined for the dust heap.\n\n\u201cIt is going to be tattooed to you,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., warned Republicans on Wednesday night at the Rules Committee, looking in the GOP direction of the dais.\n\nEveryone knew the gig was up around 3:30 p.m. et Friday. Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., presided over the House and recessed the chamber \u201csubject to the call of the chair.\u201d\n\nThe term means the House is out but will meet again at an undetermined time. If everything was set, they\u2019d hold the vote.\n\nTV monitors all around the Capitol flipped onto a graphic known as the \u201cscreen of death.\u201d The picture shows the Capitol Dome with a waving U.S. flag. The words \u201cThe House is in recess subject to the call of the chair\u201d are emblazoned across the top.\n\nRepublicans failed.\n\nThe exercise underscored that the internecine schisms that divided Republicans during the presidential election and under the tutelage of former House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, still remain.\n\nSome members think Boehner was no longer effective. Members of the Freedom Caucus helped nudge his departure in October 2015. Would things be different under Ryan?\n\nMaybe. But not really. New speaker. Same membership.\n\nBoehner often engineered a coalition of Democrats and Republicans to pass major legislation. Avoiding a government shutdown. Wrestling with the debt ceiling. But no Democrat was going to vote to repeal and replace ObamaCare. Republicans were on their own. And without help from the other side of the aisle, Ryan could never get to 216, 213, 212 or even 211 yeas.\n\n\u201cWe had roughly 200 votes,\u201d said House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden, R-Oregon, one of the authors of the GOP health care bill.\n\nThe question now is how much political capital did Republicans exhaust in this effort? They have to fund the government by April 28. A fight over the debt ceiling looms. Trump, Ryan and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, say now it\u2019s on to tax reform.\n\nDamage for Ryan?\n\nWhen Boehner resigned, former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., surfaced at the Capitol one day and spoke of what led to Boehner\u2019s exit.\n\n\u201cIn the leadership, you take on barnacles like a ship at sea and they start to weight you down after battle,\u201d said Lott, bounced from his post in 2002. \u201cOnce you get in the leadership, there ain\u2019t no such thing as purity.\u201d\n\nRyan\u2019s ship certainly accumulated major barnacles in this fight.\n\nAnd ObamaCare remains.\n\nThat\u2019s because Republicans have divided government. Yes, they have the House, Senate and White House. But the GOP remains fractured and fratricidal.\n\nSo why was \u201crepeal and replace\u201d such an effective campaign tool for Republicans?\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s just that. A great campaign tool. Kind of like tax reform. What lawmaker doesn\u2019t campaign on lowering taxes? Yet no major updates to the tax code in decades. How about abortion? Settled law. But both sides campaign on the issue and little changes.\n\nGun control? Democrats invoke the Columbine, Sandy Hook, San Bernardino and Orlando shooting massacres. A crazed gunman shot former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., in the head -- ironically delaying the House GOP\u2019s first vote to repeal ObamaCare in January 2011. Yet the firearms issue hasn\u2019t evolved much since 1994. Both sides deploy guns as a campaign issue.\n\nAnd so here we are with repealing and replacing ObamaCare.\n\nThe screen of death flashed on TV monitors all over the Capitol Friday afternoon. Repealing and replacing Obamacare was dead. And by nightfall, some Republican lawmakers were blasting out statements, pledging to continue the repeal and replace fight.\n\nCampaign 2018 had begun.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/25/divided-gop-makes-dismantling-obamacare-little-more-than-campaign-promise.html"}, {"text": "Vice President Pence tried Saturday to deliver a pep-talk to Americans after fellow Republicans\u2019 failed effort to overhaul ObamaCare -- admitting that members are \u201cback to the drawing board\u201d but vowing that President Trump will \u201ckeep fighting.\u201d\n\nPence spoke in the aftermath of House Speaker Paul Ryan on Friday cancelling the final vote for the ObamaCare replacement bill, upon concluding he didn\u2019t have enough votes despite the chamber\u2019s GOP majority.\n\nRepublicans Ryan and Trump after announcing the cancellation, sounded as if efforts to fulfill campaign promises to repeal and replace the 2010 health care law were essentially finished.\n\nRyan publicly said Americans would be living with ObamaCare for the \u201cforeseeable future,\u201d while Trump simply told The New York Times, \u201cIt\u2019s enough already.\u201d\n\nHowever, Trump and Pence on Saturday seemed to come back fighting.\n\n\u201cObamaCare will explode, and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cDo not worry!\u201d\n\nPence later said at a business event in Charleston, West Virginia, that small-business owners in the state repeatedly tell him about the need to dismantle ObamaCare because it \u201cstifles growth\u201d and slows job creation.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is never going to stop fighting to keep his promises to the American people,\u201d he said\n\nHe also argued those who claimed victory in Republicans\u2019 failure Friday are merely championing the status quo and said, \u201cI promise you, that victory won\u2019t last for long.\u201d\n\nPence also put pressure on West Virginia Sens.

A big part of the complaint: a huge security presence, with even a trip to the playground requiring three vans.\n\nNeighbors of Trump, her husband Jared Kushner and their three children have groused that sidewalks have been closed, public parking overrun and that the family and their staff haven't learned the trash pickup schedule outside their $5.5-million home.\n\n\"It has been a three-ring circus from the day that they've moved in,\" Marietta Robinson, who lives across the street, told with The Associated Press.\n\nThe house in the Kalorama neighborhood was bought in December by a company with ties to a Chilean billionaire. The company is renting it to Kushner and Trump, who moved in just after the inauguration of her father, President Donald Trump. Both work in the White House as advisers to the president.\n\nResidents of the enclave of four- and five-story townhomes and elegant single-family properties about 2 miles north of the White House are accustomed to VIP neighbors. Former President Barack Obama and his family have lived there since he left office, and the Secret Service closed off their entire block to traffic. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos bought a home there, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also moved in recently.\n\nYet no one has raised the ire of the community like the Trumps. At a recent neighborhood commission meeting, Fox News anchor Chris Wallace was among those who showed up to complain about parking problems.\n\nSome in the neighborhood have also complained about the family's rental arrangement. The company that owns the house didn't obtain a rental license for two months, securing one just this week after it was warned by city regulators.\n\n\"Maybe some of the upset has to do with politics a little. I couldn't say for sure, but I know that people don't seem to be upset about Tillerson's situation. It's much less intrusive,\" said Ellen Goldstein, an elected neighborhood commissioner.\n\nThe Secret Service has sole responsibility under law for protecting the family, but neighbors have noticed what they describe as an unusually large and aggressive security presence. Ivanka Trump arrives and departs in a four-vehicle motorcade, Robinson said.\n\n\"There are more of them than I have ever seen,\" Robinson wrote in a letter to Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser and other city officials. \"Frequently several of them are milling outside of the house at all hours having conversations and staring meanly at anyone in view.\"\n\nThe letter \u2014 which also complained about parking, trash and noise \u2014 spurred the city government into action. On Friday morning, District transportation crews were outside the house, removing \"No Parking\" signs.\n\nThe department said no permits had been sought for parking exemptions or sidewalk closures on the street since Trump moved in. Yet vehicles associated with the Trump-Kushner house have been seen parking in the restricted areas for hours at a time, and barriers have been erected on the sidewalk in front of the house, forcing pedestrians to cross the street, next-door neighbor Rhona Wolfe Friedman said.\n\nEven without extra restrictions, street parking for non-residents is limited to two hours.\n\n\"The parking patrol on Tracy Place has always been ultra-vigilant,\" Robinson wrote to the mayor. \"Suddenly, the parking enforcement has disappeared.\"\n\nA Secret Service spokeswoman, Nicole Mainor, said agency officials met with neighbors and city officials on Friday morning and addressed their concerns about parking and other disruptions.

By blocking the American Health Care Act of 2017, the conservative group has guaranteed that Americans will struggle forward under the burden of Obamacare. In the next few months insurers will announce their premium hikes for the coming year; chances are, given the continuing withdrawal of major companies from the marketplaces and the ongoing failure of the bill to attract enough young and healthy participants, the new rates will not be pretty. Last year premiums went up 25%; it\u2019s likely the increases will be higher this year.\n\nRepublicans will own those higher rates. Their failure to repeal the financial underpinnings of Obamacare and start replacing that failing program with an approach that encourages competition and that embodies numerous other common sense reforms will mean that families hit by ever-higher costs will blame the GOP. Voters elected Donald Trump and a GOP Congress to get this job done \u2013 the number one promise of every Republican campaign since 2010.\n\nNow the Republican Party inherits the Sisyphean task of managing Obamacare\u2019s inevitable decline. They are no longer critics; they are now the producers of the show. It is unlikely that House Speaker Paul Ryan or Trump will have the political will and patience to return to the drawing board and attempt to craft a brand new bill. They have made other commitments to voters, and so Obamacare, as a defeated Paul Ryan admitted after withdrawing the AHCA, is the law of the land. Live with it.\n\nOf course, the damage is not limited to healthcare reform. The undermining of the House leadership is profound and clouds prospects of tax reform, infrastructure spending and other important jobs to be done. If Ryan cannot be counted on to herd the cats on healthcare, how do we know he can round up votes on tax reform?\n\nIt is the young Trump presidency, however, that takes the biggest hit here. Trump was elected because people across the political spectrum thought he could fix some of our problems. He was the businessman who could import common sense to Washington, and the deal maker who could bring people together. He made big promises; a country tired of stalemate and disappointment believed that he could bring back jobs, reduce our debt, build the wall, find a better healthcare solution.\n\nHis credibility and credentials now lie in tatters. All that optimism that has stoked the stock market and boosted investment plans \u2013 all that may fade.\n\nWho is to blame? House Speaker Paul Ryan will be dragged through the mud for failing to win enough votes. He will also be criticized for concocting an arguably complicated and overly cerebral approach to the mission at hand. The AHCA was only part of the solution; Ryan vowed to press forward with more changes \u2013 like allowing insurers to compete across state lines, expanded health savings accounts and Medicaid reforms \u2013 in future legislation. It was a complex three-step approach; framing a sales pitch was all but impossible.\n\nHe was hemmed in by the strictures of reconciliation, through which Obamacare was to be dismantled but even so, it was a hard story to tell. Once the CBO published their score, showing that 24 million would lose coverage by 2026, Nancy Pelosi and her colleagues were off to the races, souring the country on Ryan\u2019s bill. Few noted that subsequent measures would make the numbers significantly more appealing. Negative polling encouraged those keen to defeat it, and defeat it they did.\n\nNancy Pelosi mocked Trump for bringing the bill to the floor before he had the votes; that won\u2019t sit well with a president who likes winning. So far, he is blaming Democrats, but he will doubtless find others \u2013 including perhaps the Speaker \u2013 to chastise for the loss. That will be unfortunate. As an outsider, President Trump has to rely on some seasoned hands to move bills through Congress; notwithstanding this recent defeat, Vice President Pence, chief of staff Reince Priebus and Paul Ryan are an excellent and necessary team. Relying on executive orders, as Obama did, produces unsustainable measures easily overturned by the courts.\n\nOutraged Republicans should save most of their ire for the Freedom Caucus. The group of 30-odd conservatives are patting themselves on the backs this evening; joining their celebration are Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. Hillary Clinton declared the failure a victory, while disgusted Republicans across the country wonder how it went so wrong.\n\nCaucus leader Mark Meadows, who hails from western North Carolina, may find himself under scrutiny. People may wonder why the American Society of Anesthesiologists was one of the top five funders of Meadows\u2019 campaign and why health professionals were among the top five industries donating to his reelection in 2016. Medical groups typically like Obamacare, which provides healthcare services to an expanded population. Did they count on Meadows undermining Obamacare repeal? Did they know that thanks to his efforts, Obamacare would carry on?\n\nMeadows could well find himself with a primary challenger in 2018 who promises to support Donald Trump. After all, Trump carried North Carolina, and especially the western regions.\n\nAnd Meadows may not be alone. The National Republican Congressional Committee has been hauling in record amounts of money these past few months \u2013 money that can go to fielding candidates that support the White House. The Chair of the NRCC is Ohio\u2019s Steve Stivers, who was a yes vote for the AHCA. His predecessor at the NRCC was Oregon Representative Greg Walden, who campaigned all-out for the AHCA. It\u2019 unlikely either Stivers or Walden will champion the reelection of Meadows or his colleagues.\n\nThe Trump White House is apparently going to move on to the other items on the agenda. The country will watch to see if the administration can bring tax reform about. With Democrats obstructing every move, nothing will be easy. But with Democrats and the Freedom Caucus standing in the way of the Trump agenda, nearly everything becomes impossible.\n\nLiz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

He spoke of Norton as a peer in the aviation community.\n\n\"Having had the honor of serving alongside Major Norton, I saw first-hand his professional acumen,\" Swan wrote. \"I can tell you he was a quiet professional whose strength of character, gifted ability, and natural leadership epitomized what we all aspire to be as Marine officers and aviators. This is now shallow praise; but a testament to the man, his family and his friends that enabled him to have such a positive influence on those around him.\"\n\nOn the night of the crash, the training mission profile required Norton to conduct diving attacks, including bomb delivery and strafing runs, on targets in the desert designated by two AH-1Z Cobra helicopters providing support. His Hornet was armed with 250 rounds of PGU-48 20mm high-incendiary ammunition; one GBU-16 1,000-pound Paveway II bomb; and two 500-pound BDU-45 practice bombs.\n\nHaving completed one bombing dive and one strafing run, Norton had initiated another dive for a strafing run. About 90 seconds later, his aircraft crashed, creating a fireball in the desert.\n\n\"Maj. Norton \u2026 had already begun planning how he intended to complete this dive and then return to Miramar with the gas remaining,\" the investigating officer found. \"Additionally, he would have also been calculating how long he would need to pull the trigger to expend his remaining rounds. These mental calculations, while not causal, became the first of several distractors during Dive #3 that led to Maj. Norton being cognitively saturated.\"\n\nNorton dived lower and faster on the third dive than he had on the second, investigators found. He began pulling the trigger some 1,100 feet lower to the ground, focusing on engaging his targets at his current speed of more than 550 miles per hour as pre-set voice warnings began to kick in.\n\nA voice warning in the cockpit began to blare \"altitude, altitude,\" as it had on the previous two dives, when he came within 1,900 feet of the ground. But as Norton dove lower, he apparently missed another warning sign: a visual \"up\" arrow indicating a need to gain altitude immediately.\n\nA third warning, a verbal \"pull up, pull up,\" command came on late, just a second before impact, because the system was programmed not to allow one verbal warning to interrupt another.\n\nNorton responded to this third warning with a reaction time of .6 seconds, not fast enough to pull the aircraft out of danger.\n\nBy the time the fourth and most urgent warning, a siren, began, there was only a third of a second remaining before impact.\n\nThe investigating officer made few recommendations in light of the crash, but did suggest that the hard radio altimeter warning, the third to kick in, did not offer the pilot enough reaction time at its recommended setting of 800 feet.\n\nThe impact of the loss of Norton, a graduate of the Navy's elite TOPGUN fighter school, and a veteran of Afghanistan, is evident in Swan's statement in the investigation endorsement.\n\n\"I have no doubt his legacy of tactical expertise, dedication, humor, humility, and friendship will be felt in perpetuity,\" Swan wrote. \"He certainly will be missed by all who knew him.\"\n\nNorton's mother, Mary Vanderhoof, told The Santa Cruz Sentinel last September that he would be buried next to Maj. Taj Sareen, a squadron mate, friend, and fellow pilot who died in a Hornet crash near Royal Air Field Lakenheath, England, in October 2015.\n\n-- Hope Hodge Seck can be reached at hope.seck@military.com.

House Speaker Paul Ryan pulled the bill minutes before a vote was to take place as it became apparent there was not enough support for passage. Democrats were united against it, and a conservative bloc of Republicans were unmoved by 11th-hour negotiations.\n\n\u201cWe had no Democratic support,\u201d Trump said from the Oval Office. \u201cThey weren\u2019t going to give us a single vote.\u201d\n\nThe president added that the \u201cbest thing we can do, politically speaking, is let ObamaCare explode. It\u2019s exploding right now\u2026 Almost all states have big problems.\u201d\n\nTrump claimed he never said he would \u201crepeal and replace [ObamaCare] within 64 days,\u201d though he repeatedly promised during the campaign he\u2019d do it on Day One.\n\nRyan, R-Wis., withdrew the legislation after Trump called and asked him to halt debate without a vote.\n\n\u201cWe came really close today but we came up short,\u201d Ryan said. He added that Friday\u2019s developments were \u201cnot the end of the story\u201d though he immediately pivoted to other items on the GOP agenda, including tax reform.\n\n\u201cWe have big, ambitious plans to improve people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said.\n\nRyan made the walk to the White House shortly after noon to tell the president he lacked the votes to push the bill through. Friday marks the seventh anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act by former President Barack Obama.\n\nThe GOP bill would have replaced ObamaCare, which mandated that almost every American have health insurance.\n\n\u201cThis was a rejection of the repeal of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez said in a written statement. \u201cIn the words of my friend Joe Biden: This is a BFD.\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called the failed GOP health care bill a \u201cvictory for the American people.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have spent seven years campaigning against Obama's signature health care law, and cast dozens of votes to repeal it in full or in part. But when they finally got the chance to pass a repeal bill that actually had a chance to get signed, they couldn't pull it off.\n\nWhat happens next is unclear, but the path ahead on other priorities, such as overhauling the tax code, could grow more daunting.\n\nThe development came on the afternoon of a day when the bill, which had been delayed a day earlier, was supposed to come to a vote, come what may. President Trump's top aides had told Ryan to call a vote - and possibly call the bluff of balky Republicans in the House Freedom Caucus.\n\nBut instead of picking up support as Friday wore on, the bill went the other direction, with some key lawmakers coming out in opposition.\n\nRep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., chairman of the powerful Appropriations Committee, said the bill would raise costs unacceptably on his constituents. Rep. Barbara Comstock of Virginia, a key moderate Republican, and GOP Rep. David Joyce of Ohio also announced \"no\" votes.\n\nThe defections raised the possibility that the bill would not only lose on the floor, but lose big.\n\nIn the face of that evidence, and despite insistences from White House officials and Ryan that Friday was the day to vote, leadership pulled back from the brink.\n\nThe GOP bill would have eliminated the Obama statute's unpopular fines on people who do not obtain coverage and would also have removed the often-generous subsidies for those who purchase insurance.\n\nRepublican tax credits would have been based on age, not income like Obama's, and the tax boosts Obama imposed on higher-earning people and health care companies would have been repealed. The bill would have ended Obama's Medicaid expansion and trimmed future federal financing for the federal-state program, letting states impose work requirements on some of the 70 million beneficiaries.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the Republican bill would have resulted in 24 million additional uninsured people in a decade and lead to higher out-of-pocket medical costs for many lower-income and people just shy of age 65 when they would become eligible for Medicare. The bill would have blocked federal payments for a year to Planned Parenthood.\n\nDemocrats were uniformly opposed. \"This bill is pure greed, and real people will suffer and die from it,\" said Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington state.\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram, John Roberts, Jennifer Bowman and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/24/trump-blames-democrats-for-gop-health-care-bill-failure-says-obamacare-is-imploding.html"}, {"text": "The most talked-about man in Washington this week might have gone unrecognized outside the beltway before a dramatic press conference at which he claimed to have seen evidence President Trump was spied on.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., is now solidly in the public eye as he leads the charge on two major investigations. One is the investigation into Russia\u2019s apparent interference in the 2016 presidential election, and the other is President Trump\u2019s claim that former President Barack Obama wire-tapped Trump Tower.\n\nNunes hasn't exactly been silent about the investigations, but it was a meeting he had with Trump Wednesday - and a memorable news conference right before - that put him front and center.\n\n\u201cI have a lot more friends, that\u2019s definitely for sure. Every time I\u2019m on the (House) floor, I have members coming up to me.\u201d - Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif.\n\nAt the dramatic news conference, Nunes announced he had obtained on Tuesday intelligence that indicated President Trump's personal communications had been swept up in what he described as \"incidental\" surveillance.\n\n\"There seems to me to be some level of surveillance activity, perhaps legal, but I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s right,\" Nunes said Wednesday. He added that he wasn't sure \"the American people would be comfortable with what I read.\"\n\nNunes disclosed he had not shared any of the documents he discussed with the president with a single one of his committee colleagues. His democratic counterpart, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said that by Friday afternoon, he still hadn't been shown the information.\n\n\"It's not just that he hasn't shared them with Democrats on the committee,\" Schiff said on Friday, \"he hasn't shared them with the Republicans on the committee. All of us are essentially in the dark.\"\n\nComplicating the matter, Schiff said, was the fact that \"it is associates of the president who are potentially the subject of investigation... So to take evidence that may or may not be related to the investigation to the White House was wholly inappropriate and, of course, cast grave doubts into the ability to run a credible investigation.\"\n\nNunes may be crusading against the surveillance of Americans, but in the past he has criticized those who would limit the scope of National Security Agency programs. Speaking with CQ Roll Call back in 2014, Nunes suggested \u201cthe attack on NSA has just been sad to watch... We\u2019ve got other foreign governments spying on everyone.\u201d\n\nAt the time, House Intel was drafting a bill to revamp surveillance policies and end the NSA practice of collecting and storing data on Americans' phone, email and Internet use.\n\nNunes represents California's 22nd congressional district, and has served in the House of Representatives since 2003. He worked on his family's farm as a child and raised cattle as a teenager, before buying some farmland of his own along with his brother. At the age of 23, he became one of the youngest Californians to be elected to public office, serving as a trustee for a local community college.\n\nWhen former House Intel Committee Chairman Mike Rogers' announced his surprise retirement back in 2014, Nunes' name quickly bubbled up as a possible replacement. Nunes was quoted at the time as saying he had always planned on pursuing the chairmanship, offering both his work on the committee itself and as chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade, of which he remains a member, as proof of his credentials.\n\nWhen then-Speaker John Boehner announced Nunes would assume the chairmanship in November of 2014, he suggested Nunes had been \"instrumental in ensuring that our intelligence professionals have the resources they need to keep America safe.\"\n\nThe appointment of Nunes, a harsh critic of the Obama administration on issues like Benghazi, created concerns that the frequently secretive committee could be plunged into a cycle of public partisanship. The ongoing & increasingly public feud this past week between Nunes and Schiff suggests that some of those concerns may have been justified.\n\nNunes wound up becoming a member of the president's transition team, and was reportedly instrumental in the selection of Gen. James Mattis for the role of Defense Secretary, with McClatchy DC describing Nunes as \"a combination of headhunter, Capitol Hill liaison and shaper of policy.\"\n\n\u201cI have a lot more friends, that\u2019s definitely for sure,\u201d Nunes told McClatchy back in December. \u201cEvery time I\u2019m on the (House) floor, I have members coming up to me.\u201d", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/24/rep-devin-nunes-man-in-dc-spotlight.html"}, {"text": "On March 16, the Marine Corps Trademark and Licensing Office received a tip about Disgruntled Decks, a \"Cards Against Humanity\"-style game filled with inside jokes and crass humor aimed at a military audience.\n\nIts Marine Corps edition contained more than half-a-dozen cards using the term \"wookie,\" a derogatory word for a female Marine, some of them with unprintable references to women's genitalia and bodily functions.\n\n\"Furry wooks with no-shave chits,\" reads one of the tamer ones, an apparent reference to female Marines with a lot of body hair.\n\nWithin 24 hours, the Trademark and Licensing Office had filed complaints with Facebook and Amazon, claiming Disgruntled Decks was using Marine Corps trademarks without permission.\n\nWithin another eight hours, Amazon was no longer offering the Marine deck for sale and Facebook had disabled certain commercial elements of the game's page, Jessica O'Haver, director of the office, told Military.com.\n\nO'Haver said the office also sent a notice to the popular game Cards Against Humanity, on which Disgruntled Decks is modeled, to allow the company to protect its own trademarks if appropriate.\n\nAn attorney for Disgruntled Decks also responded, setting up a meeting with Corps officials for March 28. In the meantime, the Marine game continues to feature on the company's website, but the box has been altered to be more generic, reading simply \"Corps Edition.\" The game is currently unavailable for sale, the site states.\n\nA spokesperson for Disgruntled Decks confirmed to Military.com that the company's intellectual property attorney is set to meet with Marine officials next week. The company had no comment as the matter is ongoing, the spokesperson said.\n\nAs Marine leaders wage a public fight against online harassment and targeting of female troops by male Marines in the wake of reports that a Facebook Page, Marines United, has circulated nude and compromising images of women without their consent, the Trademark and Licensing Office is taking another tack.\n\n\"Hit them in the pocketbook,\" O'Haver said.\n\nIt's not a new role for the office. In 2013, when reports of abusive and misogynistic Facebook pages run by and for Marines received congressional attention, O'Haver said the office went after groups that used the Marine Corps name or logo to sell merchandise.\n\n\"When there's a group or a cause, any kind of online presence, and they start building their presence and their popularity, they start commercializing,\" she said.\n\nOfficials filed trademark infringement complaints against one group, Just The Tip of the Spear, getting its Facebook page taken down temporarily, and ultimately working with its clothing vendor to keep the group from selling Marine Corps-branded merchandise.\n\nAt best, it was a limited solution. The page continues to resurface despite shutdown attempts, and if the group's commercial aspirations were thwarted, its behavior was unchecked.\n\nBut as the Marine Corps struggles to determine how to appropriately discipline or prosecute troops for bad behavior online, trademark protection may provide an additional tool for the service to place a check on a culture that mocks and belittles women.\n\nIn the wake of reports about the Marines United Facebook group, O'Haver said her office wrote to all official Marine Corps licensees -- roughly 500 entities, 350 of them commercial -- warning them not to create any Marine Corps-branded merchandise on behalf of, or even alluding to, Marines United.\n\n\"We alerted them proactively,\" O'Haver said.\n\nWhile the Trademark and Licensing Office will not necessarily scour the internet looking for merchandise that negatively portrays female Marines, O'Haver said it will take action if \"disparaging and tarnishing-type products\" are brought to its attention.\n\n\"If somebody is maximizing the profitability of Marine Corps trademarks in a negative way, we can address that,\" she said.\n\n-- Hope Hodge Seck can be reached at hope.seck@military.com.

He said it would be one proposal that would cover both cutting individual and corporate taxes in the same legislation.\n\n\"We are not cutting this up and doing little pieces at a time,\" Mnuchin said.\n\nHe said the goal was still to win congressional approval of the tax measure by August. But if the timeline is delayed, he said he expected the proposal to pass by the fall.\n\nAt the White House, press secretary Sean Spicer acknowledged the August deadline is an \"ambitious one\" for such a comprehensive and complicated project, but he said it's a goal the administration \"is going to try to stick to.\"\n\n\"Tax refund is something the president is very committed to,\" Spicer told reporters. Mnuchin had lunch at the White House Friday with President Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nIn his earlier appearance, Mnuchin did not reveal whether the administration will include a contentious border adjustment tax that is in a House tax proposal. The measure, which would impose a 20 percent tax on imports, has positive and negative features, Mnuchin said. He also would not reveal exactly what corporate tax rate the administration would propose, other than it will be \"a lot lower\" than the current 35 percent rate.\n\nIn a wide-ranging public interview event with the news site Axios, Mnuchin also said Trump's proposal to boost infrastructure spending would probably include $100 billion to $200 billion in federal money and depend on public-private partnerships to boost the total to $1 trillion over the next decade.\n\nMnuchin was asked whether the administration's tax plan would lower rates at all levels but not include an absolute tax cut for high income individuals because the lower rates for the wealthy would be offset by increases in other areas such as reduced deductions. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, dubbed this goal the \"Mnuchin rule\" during his confirmation hearing.\n\nMnuchin did not commit specifically on the goal but said, \"The president's objective is a middle income tax cut. ... Our primary focus in a tax cut for the middle income (earners) and not the top.\"\n\nWhile Wall Street has staged a huge rally since Trump's surprising election victory, Mnuchin said he believed the market could move still higher as the administration succeeds in implementing its economic program to cut taxes and eliminate burdensome regulations.\n\nHe predicted Trump's plan would achieve economic growth of 3 percent to 3.5 percent, up significantly from anemic growth around 2 percent seen in the current recovery, the weakest in the post-World War II period. He said \"this is definitely not all baked in\" to market expectations.\n\nThe Treasury secretary, who participated in his first meeting of Group of 20 finance ministers last weekend in Baden-Baden, Germany, called the meeting a success. He said while news coverage focused on the administration's successful push to drop a pledge to oppose trade protectionism, that took only a small portion of the discussion time.\n\n\"On trade, the point I made was that the president wants to have free trade ... but he wants to renegotiate deals\" that are not favorable for American workers, Mnuchin said.\n\nIn addition to renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, Mnuchin said the administration was also planning to focus on stronger enforcement of other trade agreements.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/24/mnuchin-says-administration-tax-plan-coming-soon.html"}, {"text": "**Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day?

What they ought to be talking about is who would get the blame if it passed.\n\n\n\nPolitics is a business obsessed with short-term thinking and an emphasis on tactics rather than strategy, and boy howdy has that been on display in Washington in the less than three weeks since Republicans plopped out their health insurance overhaul plan.\n\n\n\nIf you wanted evidence of how bad this city\u2019s attention deficit disorder is, just think about that for a second: It\u2019s only been 19 days, and we are already fatigued with the discussion about an issue so enormous.\n\n\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer lamented today, \u201cAt some point there\u2019s a political cost to dragging this out.\u201d It would seem that \u201cdragging out\u201d ain\u2019t what it used to be.\n\nIt took 16 weeks to draft the Constitution and another 40 weeks to ratify it. If American politicians had to do it today, they\u2019d fight for a month and then just copy and paste a script from \u201cSchoolhouse Rock.\u201d\n\n\n\nWe are told by the NYT that as the bill began to collapse, the president and his advisers were getting ready to unsurprisingly, shank Speaker Paul Ryan like a prison-yard canary.\n\n\n\nSeveral other outlets have reported that the blame for the bill\u2019s failure would be laid at the feet of conservative members who refused President Trump\u2019s repeated overtures to pass his first legislative initiative.\n\n\n\nNow c\u2019mon, people\u2026 We know that in politics, 72 hours can feel like an eternity, but how long really do you think the blame for the death of a broadly unpopular bill with no core constituency of its own would linger?\n\n\n\nYes, it\u2019s embarrassing whenever you try and fail at legislation, especially when it\u2019s the first one out of the chute for a president in his first 100 days. Democrats and the pundit class would declare Trump a lame duck already and howl over his failure.\n\n\n\nBut do you think anybody would still be talking much about it by this time next week? By Wednesday? Monday?\n\n\n\nThe post-mortems would fade into background noise and the attention would turn to the ongoing battle over Russian interference and Obama administration surveillance, as well as the locked-and-loaded tax plan Trump has been dying to release. It would be hard to imagine the demise of TrumpCare lasting long as a topic discussion.\n\n\n\nThe reason is simple: nobody wants the thing, apparently including its creators.\n\n\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just that the bills is broadly unpopular. It\u2019s even unpopular with Trump\u2019s core supporters. As Harry Enten observes, \u201cRight now, though, the share of Hillary Clinton voters who oppose the Republican bill is much larger than the share of Donald Trump voters who support it.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt may stand as a failure for the ages that Republicans did not manage to come up with a real replacement of their own in the seven years they spent railing against the many malignancies of ObamaCare.\n\n\n\nBut nothing is going to change that now, and, as Rich Lowry points out it\u2019s not like good options abounded for the GOP.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s the essential choice: Republicans can keep ObamaCare and admit defeat, learning to live with a new social welfare program and expansive federal regulation of insurance. Or, the GOP can take possession of a stingier version that simultaneously offends the consciences of conservatives while offending the well-being of many of the same working-class voters who put the GOP in total control of Washington.\n\n\n\nThe third option, which has been a fetishistic obsession among the think-tank set, was a radical remaking of the system with broad, fundamental changes to the way insurance and health care function.\n\n\n\nThe moment Trump won the Republican nomination, that sucker was off the table.\n\n\n\nWe have seen Republicans learn to live with the unthinkable before. Never forget that \u201cbudget sequestration\u201d was designed as a doomsday punishment to force both parties to the table for a grand fiscal bargain.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take many months for the GOP to be claiming it was good policy.\n\n\n\nAs Cousin Eddie Johnson told Clark Griswold, \u201cI don\u2019t know why they call this stuff Hamburger Helper. It does just fine all by itself, huh?\u201d\n\n\n\nFaced with another chance to serve red meat, this time on health care, Republicans again preferred an all-filler product.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s say that the bill passed and, like the Democrats before them, Republicans found themselves as the progenitors of unpopular legislation in need of constant reform and adjustment.\n\n\n\nPicture the 2018 midterms with raucous town halls and anguished legislators explaining why they voted for a bill they knew was flawed. Then jump to the 2020 election being litigated around the question of whether to repair or replace TrumpCare.\n\n\n\nTrust us: There would be no question who got the blame then: The guy with his name at the top of the ticket.\n\n\n\nTrump has long claimed that his preferred strategy was to simply let ObamaCare collapse and deliver ruination to its beneficiaries, thereby evading responsibility for the issue entirely, and forcing Democrats to the bargaining table under adverse circumstances.\n\n\n\nThat probably wasn\u2019t a real option in the sense that voters would blame the party in power for problems with any law, especially that party had the opportunity to fix.\n\n\n\nBut what most voters might not blame Trump and his party for, however, is continuing to kick the can on ObamaCare.\n\n\n\nMaybe if they call it \u201cHealth Insurance Sequestration\u201d they can get the House on board.\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: FALSE JEALOUSY\n\n\u201cAn over-scrupulous jealousy of danger to the rights of the people, which is more commonly the fault of the head than of the heart, will be represented as mere pretense and artifice, the stale bait for popularity at the expense of the public good.\u201d \u2013 Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 1\n\nTIME OUT: SOAKED\n\nNatGeo: \u201cIn 2010 Dominique Demarville, cellar master for the champagne house Veuve Clicquot, got what he thought was a joke call: 168 bottles of likely the world\u2019s oldest champagne had been found in a shipwreck beneath the Baltic Sea.

There is a law that provides for simple majorities on budget matters, strictly speaking taxes, other revenues and spending.

In defeating the efforts of Paul Ryan, Mike Pence, Tom Price and Donald Trump to dump ObamaCare and replace it with a slimmed-down, more intelligent and flexible program, they have given Democrats incalculable ammunition to make that case.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time. Over the past several years the House voted dozens of times to repeal all or part of ObamaCare, a gesture both pointless and borderline absurd; President Obama was never going to sign legislation dooming his legacy achievement, even if somehow the measure made it through the Senate. But it sure made House Republicans feel good about themselves.\n\nNow that they actually have a chance to do something meaningful \u2013 repeal the taxes and fees that are the undercarriage of the Affordable Care Act \u2013 they can\u2019t make it to the finish line.\n\nLet us consider some hard facts:\n\nNumber One: Conservatives are not in the majority in the United States. If they were, Evan McMullin would be president.\n\nNumber Two: The country does not want to return to the pre-ACA era. President Obama produced a monstrous piece of legislation, which was doomed by its excessive mandates and its inability to attract young, healthy patients. But the bill itself is not Obama\u2019s legacy. Rather, he will be credited with changing the country\u2019s viewpoint on universal health care. Few Americans today think we should be the rare developed nation that fails to provide medical services to every citizen.\n\nNumber Three: Crafting a compromise health care bill that will safeguard popular provisions that President Trump vowed to keep, like protections for those with preexisting conditions or the ability to keep children up to the age of 26 on their parent\u2019s insurance, is not easy.\n\nThe ACA is something of a mess, and the scoring received by the CBO reflects its shortcomings. But there is more to follow, such as allowing insurers to compete across state lines, which will make it better.\n\nThe Senate, too, will have a chance to weigh in.\n\nThe vote, in other words, is not strictly on the ACA, but on a process which will lead to an improvement over the status quo. The bill as it now stands is imperfect, but it\u2019s better than ObamaCare.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus and others opposing the ACA must accept that the push for this bill is bigger than their principles and it is bigger than health care.\n\nThis is a battle to establish the legitimacy of the Trump presidency. Never in our country\u2019s history has a duly elected president faced such opposition \u2013 from his political opponents and from different voices in his own party. And also perhaps, from the country\u2019s intelligence services.\n\nThe United States has entered a danger zone, where trust in our political leaders and our institutions has plummeted. The only way out is for President Trump to follow through on the promises he made to voters, promises which will put the country back on track.\n\nBut, it all starts here. If the health care bill does not pass because of resistance within his own party, the president will be gravely wounded.\n\nSince other measures, and most especially tax reform, are backed up behind the ACA, it is quite possible that the reckless behavior of the Freedom Caucus will derail the Trump train.\n\nThat would be a disaster. The country has seen a healthy surge in optimism since President Trump was elected. Consumers, small business owners, investors \u2013 all have high hopes that lower taxes and lighter regulation will buoy spending and investment, ushering in higher growth, more jobs and better pay after these past eight sluggish and dispiriting years.\n\nThey are hopeful that Obama\u2019s progressive agenda will be swept aside, allowing the country to return to policies buttressed by common sense and a common purpose. That agenda hangs by a thread.\n\nWith Republican majorities in the House and the Senate and with President Trump in the Oval Office, conservatives have the best chance they\u2019ve had in well over a decade to help craft policy. If they cannot find a way to support President Trump at this critical juncture, they may well lose that opportunity in 2018.\n\nThat said, they are not the voice of the nation or even of the Republican Party; what they want is unrealistic. It is not politically possible to repeal ObamaCare and not put something in its place. Imagine the confusion and anxiety; real people will suffer, and for what? Only 20 percent of the country wants ObamaCare repealed, according to a recent poll. This is not a popular position.\n\nWhat do most people want? To make insurance more affordable and accessible, which is what the ACA aims to do as well.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus needs to get on board \u2013 now.\n\nBradley Byrne of Alabama summed it up beautifully on Thursday, asking: \u201cAre you for President Trump and for repealing and replacing ObamaCare or are you against President Trump and against repealing and replacing ObamaCare?\u201d He\u2019s correct \u2013 it\u2019s that simple.\n\nLiz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

While ABC and CBS evening news shows Thursday admitted the attacker was Islamic, only NBCNews.com showed any prominent connection of the Big Three\u2019s websites.\n\nOddly, it was \"NBC Nightly News\" that linked the attacker to ISIS, but never said \u201cIslam\u201d or \u201cMuslim.\u201d Chief global correspondent Bill Neely undermined that connection, saying of terrorist Khalid Masood, \u201cISIS propaganda calling him their fighter but no evidence.\u201d\n\nNBCNews.com was more honest, writing on its front page: \u201cLondon Attacker Was Born 'Adrian Russell Ajao,' Was Reportedly Muslim Convert.\u201d Interestingly, the headline on the story itself made no mention of the Muslim connection.\n\nABC and CBS flipped that script, mentioning the link to Islam on their broadcasts but not on the front page of their websites. ABC News\u2019s Chief Foreign Correspondent Terry Moran was clear: \u201cBelieved to have acted alone, though he was long known to authorities here as an islamist radical.\u201d\n\nABCNews.com was less honest. The main headline about the story hid the connection, perhaps because the story itself also made no connection: \u201cTwo more 'significant arrests' made over London terror attack.\u201d\n\nOn CBS, correspondent Elizabeth Palmer did what she could to downplay the Islamic connection. \u201cOvernight officers raided properties linked to Masood, who had a petty criminal record but was not currently under investigation for any violent extremism. Nonetheless, ISIS claimed today he was a soldier of the islamic state.\u201d Note how she emphasized the connection was a mere ISIS claim.\n\nCBSNews.com had no headline mention of the Islamic connection. \u201cCivilian death toll climbs after London terror attack.\u201d The only Islamic mention in that story went again to ISIS, \u201cThe Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has claimed responsibility for the attack, saying Thursday that Masood was a \u2018soldier of the caliphate,\u2019 but offering no evidence that he had prior links to or coordination with the group.\u201d\n\nAt least Wednesday night, Neely didn\u2019t pull any punches with viewers, \u201cBritish police now say they know who the attacker was and they believe islamist-related terrorism is behind it.\u201d Early Thursday morning, ISIS (the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) claimed responsibility for the attack. Hours later all three broadcast news sites still had no obvious indication that Islam, Muslims or, in some cases, even ISIS were to blame.\n\nEven when British police identified the attacker as Khalid Masood, who the Herald Sun called a \u201cMuslim convert,\u201d that information was to find. Again, none of the three outlets mentioned Islam or Muslim in their stories about the terrorist. It\u2019s as if media think by not saying he\u2019s Muslim, we won\u2019t notice.\n\nIt\u2019s a theme. (Some of the stories below may have been updated since they were first posted, as web news often is.) More than three hours after ISIS took credit for the attack, the main ABCNews.com page had no mention of ISIS or Islamists were involved. There were four headlines about the terror attack, including the major one which read: \u201cUtah man celebrating wedding anniversary killed in London attack.\u201d\n\nNBCNews.com had several stories about the London attack but never admitted ISIS had claimed responsibility. The site focused on the \u201cextremism\u201d angle and left out Islam: \u201cLondon Attacker Was British-Born, Had Been Investigated for 'Violent Extremism.'\u201d\n\nCBSNews.com was only slightly better. It acknowledged ISIS had claimed the attack, but even undercut that link by writing: \u201cISIS makes claim, but provides no evidence.\u201d The only mention of Islam on the site\u2019s front page was: \u201cCBSNews.com Islamic television station in Senegal blames saboteur for airing hardcore porn.\u201d Because that\u2019s the big news of the day.\n\nPerhaps the outlets\u2019 web teams should watch their own network programs. \"Good Morning America's\" Moran was willing to make the connection as the program began Thursday at 7 a.m. \u201cUsually such a bustling area but now a crime scene. This is where it ended. Right there under the shadow of Big Ben where the attacker was killed and we know now he was British born. Homegrown terror inspired by Islamist ideology.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Palmer was equally direct during \"This Morning\" at almost the same time: \u201cThis morning they announced the attacker was a lone wolf, probably inspired by islamic extremism.\u201d\n\nInstead, the news sites undoubtedly take their cues from a profession that has hidden identity of crime suspects for decades. And, of course, from major news outlets who ignored that component on their front pages. The New York Times, Washington Post and USA Today had no mention of Islam, Muslims or ISIS on Thursday morning\u2019s front pages. While The Wall Street Journal didn\u2019t have it in a headline, it\u2019s main story began: \u201cA suspected Islamic terrorist.\u201d\n\nDan Gainor is the Media Research Center's Vice President for Business and Culture.

He has a vested interest in focusing on Trump and Russia, because that narrative diverts our attention from his personal effect on the outcome of the 2016 election.\n\nComey could have shared his concerns about both campaigns before the November election, and let the public decide. He did not.\n\nIf it was appropriate to withhold information about an investigation into the Trump campaign in July, he should have applied that same logic to the Clinton campaign in October. Hillary Clinton, charged not with a crime but by innuendo, paid the price at the polls. She was convicted in the court of public opinion.\n\nComey\u2019s announcement this week that the FBI was investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government made national and world headlines and rocked the White House.\n\nBut why now?

Or did an insider leak a story to the FBI back then for political purposes?\n\nSomeone on the House or Senate Judiciary Committee should ask for the FBI agents\u2019 time sheets over the past eight months to see if the Bureau was actually investigating, or whether this is another case of abuse of process \u2014 using an alleged investigation to smear a candidate.\n\nA torrent of leaks and partisan charges has been passed off as fact.

At worst, it\u2019s bait-and-switch.\n\nEarlier this month, Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself, wisely, from an investigation into an alleged Russian role in the election, given his contacts last year with the Russian ambassador.\n\nThe American system of justice depends on the FBI being above politics.

Its members are expected to put politics aside to oversee sensitive intelligence programs that are crucial to protecting our nation\u2019s national security.\n\nThat\u2019s not what we saw in Monday\u2019s rare open Intelligence Committee hearing. Democratic members spent every minute of the hearing to smear the president before the cameras. By doing so, they made a mockery of bipartisan intelligence oversight.\n\nRepublican Intelligence Committee members were taken off guard by hyper-partisan behavior of their Democratic colleagues. At the hearing there were some useful exchanges between Republican members and Comey on the seriousness of recent leaks of intelligence as well as the unmasking and illegal disclosure of General Michael Flynn\u2019s name from NSA reports. Unfortunately, these discussions were overshadowed by the Democrats who were much more aggressive in pushing their Trump-Russia conspiracy theories.\n\nCongressional Republicans must learn from this episode that the Democratic Party is so obsessed with destroying President Trump that their Democratic colleagues cannot be trusted to engage in good faith deliberations or hearings on anything that they can use to hurt Trump. Sadly, this includes national security.\n\nThis means there should be no more open hearings on issues like Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Committee chairmen should run such hearings with iron gavels and give Democratic members zero leeway to turn them into political circuses.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes proved that he knows what he\u2019s up against in the aftermath of Monday\u2019s intelligence committee hearing by the way he handled new information suggesting that the Obama administration did surveil the Trump campaign.\n\nNunes was given intelligence, apparently under the table from U.S. intelligence officers, which indicates the names of Trump campaign aides were \u201cdemasked\u201d in intelligence reports that had nothing to do with Russia or any alleged wrongdoing by the Trump campaign.\n\nThis is a big deal because the names of American citizens incidentally collected by U.S. intelligence agencies are blacked out and are not supposed to be revealed unless there is a compelling national security reason.\n\nNunes has been condemned by Intelligence Committee Democrats and the news media by the way he disclosed this information since he presented it to the press without informing his Democratic colleagues in advance. Nunes also informed the White House about this information before he briefed the committee and is refusing to tell Democratic committee members the name or names of his sources.\n\nMaybe Nunes should not have brought this information to the White House before he briefed committee members. (He apologized to them for this.)\n\nMy view is that Nunes took the right approach. He knows it is pointless to work with committee Democrats on this issue and if he had brought this intelligence to them before his press conference, they would have quickly leaked this information to the press to discredit it.\n\nNunes also is absolutely right in not revealing the name or names of his sources since there is a good chance committee Democrats would try to out these sources or get their managers to retaliate against them. I saw this happen when I worked for the CIA.\n\nThis story looks like it will soon get even more interesting. Fox News\u2019 James Rosen reported Thursday that the committee may soon receive \u2013 possibly today -- intelligence that \u201cis said to leave no doubt the Obama administration, in its closing days, was using the cover of legitimate surveillance on foreign targets to spy on President-elect Trump.\u201d\n\nNunes was smart to double down on his effort to fight back against Democratic politicization of intelligence oversight when he said at a press conference Friday that he was cancelling an open hearing next week on the Russia election hearing and had turned it into a closed hearing.\n\nIn addition, Nunes said he has recalled FBI Director Comey and NSA Director Rogers to testify to this hearing.\n\nI assume Nunes\u2019 new information, the FBI\u2019s refusal to fully cooperate with the committee\u2019s investigation and Comey\u2019s failure to fully answer questions about intelligence leaks are why Nunes is recalling Comey and Rogers.\n\nPredictably, Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee complained bitterly in a follow-up press conference Friday that Nunes cancelled the open hearing and questioned why Comey and Rogers were being recalled.\n\nIt was the height of gall for Schiff to complain that Nunes\u2019 actions indicate he is not interested in an independent and objective investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election after Schiff and his Democratic colleagues proved at Monday\u2019s hearing that they are only interested in using this investigation to destroy the Trump presidency.\n\nNunes realizes this and decided to fight back. Until congressional Democrats start putting the good of the country above their hatred of President Trump, Republican congressional leaders must employ similar tactics to do the work of the American people and safeguard our national security.\n\nFred Fleitz is senior vice president for policy and programs with the Center for Security Policy, a Washington, DC national security think tank.

As Americans outside the beltway know, our federal government consists of the executive, legislative branch and judicial branches, and each has a duty to use its Constitutional authority in the best interests of all of us.\n\nThe executive branch \u2013 that would be President Trump - has been working hard to keep the promises he made to the American people. But the legislative branch is not doing its part. The effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare, a promise not only Trump made to voters, but one virtually every Republican lawmaker signed on to, has been contentious, unorganized and disjointed.\n\nAnd now, it is in jeopardy.\n\nFor seven long years, the GOP ran on repealing and replacing ObamaCare. They said, \"Give us the House.\" They got that in 2010. They said, \"Give us the House and the Senate.\" They got that in 2014. Then they said, \"Give us the House, the Senate and the presidency.\" On Nov. 8, they got that wish, and frankly, in spite of many Republicans not even supporting the nominee of their party.\n\nIn a perfect world, the work on repealing and replacement of ObamaCare would have begun on Nov. 9. And in a perfect world, the GOP would have built consensus among the different factions within the GOP -- meaning the moderates, the conservatives, the Freedom Caucus, the Study Group -- before ever unveiling the bill. That, too, never happened.\n\nInstead, in the two weeks leading up to the release of this bill, House members were saying they were dissatisfied with the legislative process. They were being left in the dark, they had concerns that the bill would not work for their constituents. And, by the way, they never got to see it. So once the American Health Care Act was really revealed, infighting and a public civil war ensued.\n\nThe bill was quickly labeled \"RyanCare\" after its champion, House Speaker Paul Ryan. Others called it \"ObamaCare lite.\" President Trump didn't write this legislation, yet he was tasked with bringing together all the GOP factions and special interests to strike a deal. Respected groups and think tanks like the Heritage Foundation, the Club for Growth, FreedomWorks, Cato, Americans for Prosperity, and frankly, every major conservative radio talk show host in the country and the American people, were all confused, angered and frustrated.\n\nHouse Republicans \u2013 the legislative branch \u2013 were clearly ill-prepared for this moment to lead. They have now failed the president, and it's starting to look like they're the gang that can't shoot straight. President Trump was not served well by his party in the House of Representatives, and he has been put in the position now to do their job and marshal the votes to pass the bill.\n\nMy advice tonight for Ryan and the House Republicans is to do what they should have done from the beginning. Get everyone in a room, take away their phones, order pizza, get some beer and lock the doors. The meeting should include moderates, the GOP Study Group, the Freedom Caucus, members of the U.S. Senate, because we have to deal with the reconciliation and procedural issues. The White House should be represented, including the vice president, the Health and Human Services secretary.\n\nAnd the meeting is not over until they have a deal a majority of the House can support. Even at this hour, there's still time.\n\nHouse members, it is time to serve your president and the people you represent. It's time for you to fix this and show the American people that they did the right thing by giving you the power and the authority to lead.\n\nAdapted from Sean Hannity\u2019s monologue on \u201cHannity,\u201d March 24, 2017\n\nSean Hannity currently serves as host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) Hannity (weekdays 10-11PM/ET).

If Democratic Senators had made any progress in attacking Gorsuch\u2019s qualifications, record, or judicial philosophy, they could persuade their Republican colleagues to reject Gorsuch. With 48 Senators in their caucus, Democrats would only need persuade three Republicans to join them.\n\nBut they cannot. Anyone watching the confirmation hearings \u2013 and between us we have watched all of them going back to the ones for Antonin Scalia, whose untimely death created the current vacancy \u2013 can tell that the Democratic Senators had already thrown in the towel. They have spent most of their time attacking Donald Trump for matters that have almost nothing to do with Gorsuch, or criticizing their Republican counterparts for refusing to confirm President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee, Merrick Garland, for the same seat a year ago.\n\nSenator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) pursued the standard Democratic attack line. He questioned Gorsuch on the obscure Emoluments Clause, which prohibits federal officers from receiving gifts or titles from foreign governments. The Emoluments Clause has not given rise to a single Supreme Court case in American history, but Leahy just wanted to score political points on Trump\u2019s difficulties in disentangling himself from his businesses. Gorsuch easily avoided the question. Given \"ongoing litigation\" involving that clause, Gorsuch said, \"I have to be very careful about expressing any views.\"\n\nLeahy also invited Gorsuch to criticize White House counselor Stephen Bannon, whom Leahy accused of \u201cgiving a platform to extremists and misogynists and racists.\u201d This, of course, also has almost nothing to do with whether Gorsuch would be a fit Supreme Court Justice. Again, Gorsuch easily sidestepped. \"What vision do you share with President Trump?\" the senator asked. \"Respectfully, none of you speaks for me,\" Gorsuch said. \"I am a judge. I am independent. I make up my own mind.\"\n\nGorsuch is running out the clock and the Democrats can see that they are behind on the scoreboard.\n\nIn deciding to play to the peanut gallery of left-wing activist groups with these questions, Democratic Senators gave up their opportunity to build a constitutional case against Gorsuch. Nor could Democrats cannot seem to get past their grievance about the Scalia seat. The Democratic base feels that the Scalia's seat is properly Garland's and that Gorsuch should not benefit from \"stolen goods.\" But this sort of theft, if theft it be, has a long history. Distinguished Virginia law professor Lillian Bevier never got her committee vote, much less a floor vote for her nomination to the Fourth Circuit when Democrats controlled the Senate in 1992. Stellar appellate lawyer Miguel Estrada never received a floor vote in two years for his nomination to the D.C. Circuit. Does anyone doubt that if the shoe were on the other foot, a Democratic Senate majority in 2016 would have delayed confirming Gorsuch if proposed by a Republican President?\n\nDemocrats have finally pursued one last strategy, to paint Gorsuch as the cold-hearted nominee who always sides with big business. Their favorite example is the tale of the \"frozen trucker\". A statute provided that employers may not fire an employee who \u201crefuses to operate a vehicle because ... the employee has a reasonable apprehension of serious injury to the employee or the public.\u201d In this case, Gorsuch concluded that by driving a truck to avoid the effects of frigid weather, the employee had \"operate[d] the vehicle\" and hence the bar on firing an employee for refusing to operate the vehicle did not apply. At a minimum, this seems a reasonable interpretation, for the statute apparently focuses on an employee's unwillingness to drive an unsafe vehicle.\n\nBut whether Gorsuch was right or wrong, Democratic Senators argue that Gorsuch simply had to agree that the statute protected the driver because the driver was the \"little guy.\" There is no legal principle that demands that judges should always favor the weaker party. Many Democratic judges recognize that the law does not systematically favor the underdog and rule for \"big business\" all the time. The aphorism \"Justice is blind\" and \"equal justice under law\" reflect a proper desire to level the legal playing field. We know a way to decide cases so that the \u201cbig guy\u201d wins 50 percent of the time and the \u201clittle guy\u201d wins 50 percent of the time \u2013 it is called a coin flip.\n\nDemocrats have tried to \"Bork\" Gorsuch. But every nominee to the High Court has taken a page out of the post-Bork playbook. The more a nominee says, the more ammunition she supplies to her opponents. Nominees say nothing of consequence, other than defending the rule of law and asserting that judges should enforce existing rules rather than revising them. After Bork, a nominee will never again attempt to educate the Senators who will decide his or her fate. Humility, circumspection, and an insistent refusal to answer hypothetical questions are the cardinal rules of confirmation hearings. Gorsuch is running out the clock and the Democrats can see that they are behind on the scoreboard.\n\nRepublicans have created a target-rich environment for Democrats, with Russia, executive orders, health care, the budget, and the Donald's tweets all vying for limited attention.

Nobody looks good in this mess.\n\nWe thought we had some clarity on Monday when James Comey testified that the FBI has no evidence to support President Trump\u2019s claim that Barack Obama had him wiretapped or surveilled during the campaign. The two congressional intelligence committees agreed.\n\nNow Devin Nunes, the Republican chairman of the House panel, has muddied the waters on this issue\u2014and damaged his credibility in the process. In fact, he apologized yesterday for his handling of the matter.\n\nNunes\u2019 big mistake was rushing over to brief the White House about his findings. Remember, this guy is supposed to be heading a bipartisan investigation, and he looked like he was huddling with his home team.\n\nThe panel\u2019s ranking Democrat, Adam Schiff, said the chairman\u2019s action \u201ccasts quite a profound cloud over our ability to do the work.\u201d\n\nBut the president says he now feels \u201csomewhat\u201d vindicated by what Nunes is saying. \u201cThat means I\u2019m right,\u201d he told Time magazine.\n\nSo what exactly is Devin Nunes alleging?\n\nWell, he says he\u2019s seen intelligence reports that refer to Americans affiliated with Trump, and possibly the president, being \u201cincidentally\u201d picked up in \u201csome level of surveillance activity \u2014 perhaps legal, but I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nThis appears to mean the Trump people were picked up or discussed on routine intercepts of foreign citizens, information that is obviously classified. Nunes said U.S. intel agencies were abusing their power.\n\nEven if true, this involves the transition period when Trump was already president-elect, not Trump\u2019s charge that the Obama administration was going after him during the campaign. And \u201cincidental\u201d intercepts don\u2019t square with Trump\u2019s original charge that he was targeted.\n\nNunes would not say how he obtained the documents and did not share them with other committee members.\n\nAs if that weren\u2019t convoluted enough, CNN carried a report about Trump and Russia that is also hard to unpack.\n\nPamela Brown, part of the network\u2019s investigative team, said that according to unnamed officials, \u201cthe FBI has information that indicates associates of Donald Trump communicated with suspected Russian operatives to possibly coordinate the release of information damaging to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\u201d\n\nThat would be explosive if true. But possibly coordinate? If it\u2019s only possible, doesn\u2019t that fall short of a solid story?\n\nA couple of sentences later, Brown offered this caveat: \u201cThough officials we\u2019ve spoken to caution that this information is not conclusive and the investigation is ongoing.\u201d These other officials say it is \u201cpremature\u201d to assume the campaign colluded with Moscow based on \u201clargely circumstantial\u201d evidence.\n\nNot conclusive? Premature? Circumstantial?\n\nI spent many years as an investigative reporter, and to me, information that is \u201cnot conclusive\u201d and \u201ccircumstantial\u201d about something that \u201cpossibly\u201d happened doesn\u2019t clear the bar.

Because this story is no joke. Unfortunately, it's all too real.\n\nI am a branding, marketing and promotion expert. I\u2019ve used branding techniques to build several million dollar businesses and successful careers in a dozen fields. I lecture on \u201cBranding- American Style\u201d all over the globe.\n\nWhat\u2019s the greatest brand in the world? Las Vegas. The brand name \u201cLas Vegas\u201d says fun, fame, glitz, glamour, gambling, golf, sex, shopping, sunshine and striking it rich -- all in one!\n\nNo other brand in the world does that.\n\nNo matter where I go in the world, when I say I\u2019m from Las Vegas\u2026the reaction is amazing and instantaneous. Whomever I\u2019m talking to smiles, laughs, and screams \u201cVegas baby! You live there? WOW. Lucky you!\u201d\n\nJust the mention of those two magic words makes everyone in the world stop like I\u2019m in one of those old E.F. Hutton television commercials. Those two magic words are \u201cLas Vegas.\u201d Not \u201cHarry Reid.\u201d\n\nOutside America no one has any idea who former Nevada Democratic Senator and Majority Leader Harry Reid is.\n\nInside America even 90 percent of Democrats haven\u2019t a clue who Harry Reid is.\n\nDon\u2019t believe me? Just watch those \u201cman in the street\u201d polls taken on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live\u201d on ABC.\n\nLast year, Kimmel asked people on Hollywood Blvd. who Joe Biden was. You know, the vice president of the United States for eight consecutive years. No one knew. Biden was anonymous to typical Americans.\n\nSo, trust me, even most Democrats (outside Nevada) haven\u2019t a clue who Harry Reid is.\n\nBut I guarantee you most of the 62 million Trump voters know the name. Republicans outside Nevada despise Harry Reid. He is public enemy number one.\n\nThis is a reality. It doesn\u2019t matter if you like him, or think he \u201cbrought home the bacon\u201d for Nevada. This is about branding and growing Vegas tourism, not your partisan beliefs.\n\nTo Republicans nationally, Harry Reid is the vicious politician who carried Obama\u2019s water for eight years; who shoved ObamaCare down our throats; who fought for open borders and illegal immigration; who made sure we all were taxed and regulated to death.\n\nTo every Republican I know Harry Reid is the devil personified. To many Republicans, he is also a symbol of corruption and hyper-partisanship in Washington, D.C.\n\nBy the way, I hate to break this to Democrats, but tourists are upscale. People on welfare and food stamps don\u2019t tend to travel much. They certainly can't afford to travel to Las Vegas. Vegas has become a very expensive tourist destination with world class five star hotels and the finest restaurants in the world.\n\nAdd in expensive spas, shows and golf courses. Nothing is cheap in Vegas anymore.\n\nThe tourists visiting Vegas have to have money. More importantly, a huge percentage of conventioneers are upscale business executives. That means a large majority of Vegas tourists voted for Trump. Like it, or not, the typical Vegas visitor and especially conventioneer, is a Republican.\n\nNow think about this for a moment. Sixty-two million people think Harry Reid is the devil. And most of the rest have never heard of him. And Nevada Democrats in our state legislature want to rename our airport after him.\n\nYes, you heard me -- they want to rename McCarran International Airport as \u201cHarry Reid Airport.\u201d\n\nHell of a branding idea.\n\nNevada's Democrat state senators and assemblymen all have one thing in common -- none of them has ever run a successful business. They know nothing about branding, or in this case, about destroying a brand with a name that inspires anger and negativity.\n\nHarry Reid\u2019s name on our airport would be the worst branding disaster in business history. It would be an albatross to Vegas tourism.\n\nHis name makes 62 million Republicans want to vomit, or throw stones, or both.\n\nEvery time the pilot announces \u201cWe are beginning our descent into Harry Reid Airport\u201d passengers will gag. Is that the first reaction you want a Vegas visitor to have?\n\nWe are the tourist capital of the world. The number one rule of tourism is to keep politics out of it. Or have you noticed any Hilton, Hyatt or Marriott hotels named after Republicans or Democrats? Our airport shouldn\u2019t remind anyone of partisan politics.\n\nThe truth is McCarran is a poor choice too. Who the heck is Pat McCarran? The answer is...he was Nevada's U.S. Senator a long time ago. His name means nothing to over 40 million tourists a year- many of them international travelers.\n\nSo, let's use this as a teachable moment (as former President Obama used to say). This branding expert has two good ideas. First, let\u2019s kill this ridiculous partisan idea of equating Vegas tourism with Harry Reid. That\u2019s a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nSecondly, let\u2019s get rid of the name McCarran too. Remember the famous business advice \"KISS: keep it simple, stupid.\" Let\u2019s keep it simple for Vegas visitors and at the same time, accentuate the greatest brand in the world.

Asa Hutchinson signed Wednesday allowing concealed handguns at colleges, government buildings, some bars and even the state Capitol. It allows people with concealed handgun licenses to carry in the locations if they complete eight hours of active-shooter training.\n\nThe change , which now heads to the House, also would exempt the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and the state hospital from the gun rights expansion.\n\nThe law as-is would let guns into Razorback Stadium while umbrellas remain banned.

Because these appear to be reasonable exceptions, I will support these amendments,\" the Republican governor said in a statement.\n\nThe law that Hutchinson signed Wednesday originally was intended to only allow faculty and staff to carry concealed handguns at college campuses, but the bill expanded as it hit roadblocks in the Legislature.\n\nThe lawmaker behind the expanded concealed gun law said the exemptions approved by the Senate would undermine that measure.\n\n\"It will kill the campus carry bill we just passed,\" Republican Sen.

None have opted to do so since that law was enacted in 2013.\n\nA Democratic lawmaker whose district includes the University of Arkansas campus in Fayetteville said the changes help address some concerns, but called the expanded gun rights law \"awful\" and the move to swiftly amend it shows the problems it'll pose around the state.\n\n\"The whole thing just makes us look careless and short sighted,\" Rep.

You have to admit they have some reason to do so. Given the GOP\u2019s propensity to appoint people to the Supreme Court who go wobbly, see e.g. Kennedy, Souter, and Roberts on Obamacare, the base gets concerned when certain things are said.\n\nBut the freakout over Gorsuch is beyond the bounds of reason.\n\nYes, Neil Gorsuch said he would walk out of Trump\u2019s office if Trump had asked him to overrule Roe v. Wade. The man is supposed to defend the independence of the third branch of government and you want him to agree to that? The headlines alone would give certain squishy Republicans the opportunity to oppose him.\n\nYes, Neil Gorsuch said Roe v. Wade and Obergerfell are the law of the land. And guess what? They are.\n\nBut Gorsuch has a history of rejecting stare decisis when he thinks the courts have gotten it wrong. Stare decisis is the concept that judges must give due deference to precedent. It is the argument that Democrats make about Roe v. Wade, but if a Republican asked Gorsuch about Plessy v. Ferguson, the Democrats would be appalled if Gorsuch defended stare decisis. Plessy, if you don\u2019t know, is the case that established \u201cseparate but equal\u201d between blacks and whites as the law of the land.\n\nGorsuch also has a paper trail and track record of not giving deference to bureaucrats. In fact, Gorsuch is to the right of Scalia on that issue and believes unelected bureaucrats are not allowed to make law. Likewise, Gorsuch takes a more restrictionist view of Presidential power than Scalia, which both sides should like.\n\nThen there is the issue of Gorsuch\u2019s true feelings. We know what he thinks. Long before Gorsuch was nominated for a spot in the federal judiciary he advocated for the position that when a private person takes the life of another person, regardless of that person\u2019s form or condition, it is murder.\n\nGo back to the Elena Kagan confirmation hearing and you will find a woman who affirmed various conservative cases were the law of the land. She even refused to go down the road of gun control in her confirmation hearing. But then we see what happened on the bench. If you forgot, Elana Kagan affirmed that Citizens United is the law of the land. *gasp* Not a single Democrat freaked out over that, though. They recognized the kabuki theater.\n\nEvery person who has ever been nominated for the Supreme Court has been intentionally nebulous and intentionally deferential. We are crazy to think Gorsuch is going to be an ideological zealot in his confirmation hearing and provide not just Democrats, but Republicans like Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, a chance to sabotage his nomination.\n\nCalm down, Republicans. Gorsuch has a paper trail. It is conservative, it is pro-life, and it is not deferential to the prior Supreme Court cases that got it wrong. I dare a Republican to ask him about Plessy and see if Democrats really care as much as they claim about stare decisis.\n\nErick Erickson is a Fox News contributor.

(Associated Press)\n\nNunes said the surveillance appears to have been legally obtained, but what is now in question is whether all the intelligence collected relating to Trump and members of his team should have stayed under wraps.\n\n\"This is a normal, incidental collection, based on what I could collect,\" Nunes said. \"This appears to be all legally collected foreign intelligence under [the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act], where there was incidental collection that ended up in reporting channels and it was widely disseminated.\u201d\n\nThe act, known as FISA, allows for warrantless surveillance of foreign nationals, even if that foreigner is speaking with a U.S. citizen. The identity of the American is supposed to be hidden, or \u201cmasked\u201d in intelligence community reports and documents, which seemingly isn\u2019t always the case.\n\nTRUMP TEAM COMMUNICATIONS CAPTURED BY INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY SURVEILLANCE, NUNES SAYS\n\nDemocrats have criticized Nunes for alerting the press and meeting with the president about the surveillance data, but failing to brief any Democrats on the committee \u2013 even leaving the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff, out of the loop. Minority House Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., released a statement in response to Nunes\u2019 findings, as well as the way in which he revealed them.\n\n\u201cThe unmasking of legally intercepted intelligence is often appropriate and necessary to understand the context of foreign intelligence information,\u201d Pelosi wrote in her statement. \u201cChairman Nunes\u2019 actions are disrespectful of ranking member Schiff and the bipartisan membership of the intel committee.\u201d\n\nTrump has said he feels vindicated after many questioned his claims that Obama ordered surveillance on him.\n\nThe allegations come on the heels of the Obama administration expanding the power of the National Security Agency in an executive order shortly before he left office in January. The NSA can now share intercepted personal communications more freely with the other 16 U.S. government intelligence agencies, before applying privacy protection measures.\n\nCritics claim that the Obama order allowing for increased accessibility to raw intelligence can lead to greater opportunities for leaks.\n\nOn Thursday, following a meeting with the House Intelligence Committee to discuss Nunes' finding that there was incidental collection of President Trump\u2019s team, Nunes announced that he would not share any of his sources, and had not shown members of his committee the documents he had seen. That same day, Rep. Jackie Speier, a California Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters that Nunes apologized for not briefing the committee on his findings sooner.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/23/trump-surveillance-saga-gives-new-meaning-to-common-intel-word.html"}, {"text": "**Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day?

Schumer\u2019s announcement today that he would vote against allowing a final vote on Gorsuch\u2019s nomination accelerated an already perilous game of chicken for Senate Democrats. If they block a nominee as widely respected as Gorsuch, it will make it only too easy for Republicans to expand the so-called nuclear option within Senate rules.\n\n\n\nA word here about otherwise unimportant Senate procedures.\n\n\n\nFrustrated Democrats in 2013 lowered the threshold for ending debate on presidential appointments other than to the Supreme Court to a simple majority, but left the high court out because of the objections of some in their party who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have voted for the change.\n\n\n\nRepublicans have been unambiguous about their threat to expand the appointment of justices, but many in Washington assumed that it would not be necessary because Gorsuch had such rave reviews and bipartisan support.\n\n\n\nThe last nominee to face a filibuster was Samuel Alito eleven years ago, but it was a symbolic affair. Just 25 senators, including Schumer, but also Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton and, yes, Barack Obama voted against moving to the final vote, which Alito easily cleared.\n\n\n\nWonder if anybody was thinking about 2008\u2026\n\n\n\nThe considerations for Democrats this time around are similar in that their party\u2019s base demands absolute opposition to the sitting Republican president regardless of the issue.\n\n\n\nFor those senators considering presidential runs in 2020 as well as those from states where primary challenges from the left are real considerations, \u201cno.\u201d And the hatred for Donald Trump may exceed the Alito era venom directed toward alleged war criminal George W. Bush.\n\n\n\nNow we get to learn a little bit more about Schumer in his new role as his party\u2019s most powerful figure.\n\n\n\nIs the cagey New Yorker saying that he will again vote to block final passage, a reflection of a new, hard-left lurch for the previously pragmatic Schumer; or is it a ploy?\n\n\n\nThat depends whether or not Schumer means for the filibuster to succeed.\n\n\n\nSenate leaders sometimes choose to vote with doomed causes for the sake of placating hardliners and preserving future options. Imagine if Schumer knew that at least eight Democrats were going to allow Gorsuch to proceed to a final vote and decided he would take a hardline stance for the sake of appearances.\n\n\n\nSurely, Schumer knows that a successful filibuster would make it only too easy for his Republican counterpart, Mitch McConnell, to go nuclear. Gorsuch is so free of controversy he makes Chief Justice John Roberts look like a roadie for M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce.\n\n\n\nYes, Democrats can take advantage of the diminished standards for confirmation when next they hold the White House, but given the fact that Trump could have two or more additional appointments to make in his term, the hope of future gains would be slim solace.\n\n\n\nIf Schumer is really trying to provoke the filibuster fight right now, that means he is in an extraordinarily weak position within his party. Sacrificing the chance to block future Trump nominees less palatable than Gorsuch for a symbolic fight today is no the act of a leader in control of his conference.\n\n\n\nBut if Schumer is providing some belly scratches for upset liberals by voting for what he knows to be a doomed filibuster, he may be up to the moment that faces him and his party in the era of Trump.\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: SWEET SPOT\n\n\u201cNo well-informed man will suppose that the affairs of such a confederacy can be properly regulated by a government less comprehensive in its organs or institutions than that which has been proposed by the convention.\u201d \u2013 Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 13\n\nTIME OUT: ABS AS FLAT AS \u2018LEAVES OF GRASS\u2019\n\nNew Yorker: \u201cIn 1858, Walt Whitman, at the age of thirty-nine, was eking out a living as a journalist at the Brooklyn Daily Times, generating thousands of words a week at an unflagging pace\u2026[C]ritics had variously shrugged and gawped at the first edition of his \u2018Leaves of Grass,\u2019 published three years before\u2026 Whitman cultivated a bohemian image and dreamed of reinventing himself as a travelling orator.

What\u2019s being discussed for the Gorsuch nomination is an incremental advancement of nuclear tactics. Democrats change the rules so that lower court nominations and other presidential appointments could be advanced with just 51 votes, but exempted the Supreme Court. The proposal at hand is to bring the high court into that category, but not apply the new rule to regular legislation. Certainly, as discussed above, if a nuclear strike is being contemplated, there will be voices urging Republicans to go all the way.

With confirmation by the full Senate looming, sources told Fox News Democrats were weighing a number of strategic options -- including a stand down in exchange for a GOP pledge to not go \"nuclear\" on a future nomination by President Trump -- despite their public statements.\n\n\"He will have to earn 60 votes for confirmation,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Thursday, referring to the threshold for ending a filibuster and preventing the minority party from blocking the confirmation.\n\nJudge Gorsuch's nomination will face a cloture vote & as I\u2019ve said, he will have to earn sixty votes for confirmation.

Gorsuch was nominated January 31 to fill the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Confirmation hearings in the Senate Judiciary Committee will conclude, but the nominee finished his testimony on Wednesday.\n\nRepublicans, who hold 52 seats in the upper chamber, have the option of changing Senate rules so that a filibuster can be ended with a simple majority vote. Democrats, when in the majority during the Obama administration, made the rules change effective for all non-Supreme Court nominations.\n\nDemocrats are leery of pressing the ongoing confirmation process to the point Republicans invoke the so-called nuclear option, as it would make a subsequent Trump nomination a fait accompli. But on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell expressed doubt that any Democrats would vote to confirm Gorsuch, a strong signal the Kentucky Republican is ready to change the rule.\n\n\u201cIt does sound like he\u2019s laying the groundwork for the nuclear option,\u201d Senate Minority Whip Richard Durbin said of McConnell. \u201cLet\u2019s wait and see how this evolves.\u201d\n\nTrump Adviser for the Supreme Court Leonard Leo scoffed at the idea Republicans could be pressured into withholding the nuclear option in exchange for Gorsuch's confirmation.\n\n\u201cThis absurd \u2018deal\u2019 would prolong an environment in which Democrat Supreme Court nominees get up or down simple majority votes and Republican nominees get filibustered -- that\u2019s not a deal, it\u2019s a unilateral disarmament,\u201d Leo said.\n\nDemocrats from states that supported Trump in the presidential election could find themselves under pressure from voters to not appear obstructionist, especially to an appealing nominee.

This should be welcome news for conservatives seeking repeal of the law, but it\u2019s even better news for consumers looking for lower health insurance premiums.\n\nConservatives have long argued that the essential health benefits requirement in Obamacare most represents the law\u2019s aggregation of power in the federal government. This provision gives Washington the authority to determine precisely what benefits every health insurance plan sold on ObamaCare\u2019s exchanges must cover. It\u2019s also at least partially responsible for the rapidly increasing premiums for plans sold on the law\u2019s marketplaces.\n\nThe notion that every plan sold on ObamaCare exchanges across the country must offer the same set of benefits may seem relatively uncontroversial, particularly when some of the requirements (such as those requiring coverage for prescription drugs or laboratory services) may seem perfectly reasonable. But what if someone \u2013 let\u2019s say, an unmarried man without kids \u2013 doesn\u2019t want to pay for a plan that includes pregnancy and newborn benefits, or pediatric services. Under ObamaCare, he\u2019s forced to purchase (and pay for) a plan that includes them anyway.\n\nThe better approach is to allow consumers to have a choice of plans that include benefits that suit their needs \u2013 and to have the option to select a richer set of benefits at a correspondingly higher premium. By standardizing health plan design and benefit structure on ObamaCare\u2019s exchanges, the law dramatically limited consumer options because of the belief that \u201cWashington knows best.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s also evidence to suggest that the essential health benefits requirement also drives up premium costs. In fact, a 2013 report from online health insurance marketplace eHealth, Inc. concluded that average monthly premiums for health insurance plans that cover a comprehensive suite of benefits, such as those mandated by the essential health benefits requirement in ObamaCare, were 47 percent higher than plans without those benefits.\n\nPreviously, Republicans were hesitant to include repeal of the essential health benefits requirement in the American Health Care Act because of concerns that such an inclusion might not pass muster as part of the budget reconciliation process they are using to consider the legislation. Under this process, each provision included in the legislation must have more than a \u201cmerely incidental\u201d impact on government revenue or spending. While there remains some uncertainty about whether repeal of the essential health benefits provision qualifies, the impact of such a change is worth the attempt \u2013 so long as it does not torpedo the entire legislation and, with it, the GOP's only real chance to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nTurning back the essential health benefits requirement would be a big step forward toward efforts to lower health care costs, expand consumer choices, and reverse the federalization of health policy inherent in President Obama\u2019s signature health care law.\n\nNow, it\u2019s up to House Republicans to support this legislation, to ensure that the effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare doesn\u2019t stall near the finish line.\n\nLanhee J.

Those concerns have been exacerbated by President Donald Trump\u2019s criticism of NATO, with many Europeans worrying that the region may not be able to count on the United States in case of an attack.\n\nLast year NATO jet scrambled in response to Russian warplanes venturing close to NATO-member airspace 800 times, a huge jump from the 400 tallied in 2014 and 2015, VOAnews.com reported.\n\n\u201cWe are protecting NATO airspace, NATO borders,\u201d VOA News quoted a Netherlands Air Force spokesman as saying. \u201cAnd, it is not necessarily just the Russians -- it\u2019s any aircraft that does not comply with the rules that we have ... that apply in the air.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Taylor and some other experts in the U.S. see Russia as more of a nuisance for now than a genuine military threat.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a major issue to watch in terms of a military threat,\u201d Taylor said of Russia attacking one of those countries that have been on alert recently. \u201cPeople are more worried about Russia making a political move to interfere with elections and spread fake news to make one of those countries look bad.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s also concern, Taylor added, about Russia trying to stir up Russians living inside those states along the border.\n\n\u201cThey worry that Russia would engage in low-level provocative actions, try to test NATO\u2019s willingness to come to their defense.\u201d", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/23/perceived-russian-threat-causes-sweden-lithuania-to-prepare-for-attacks.html"}, {"text": "This week, Judge Neil Gorsuch sat before the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he eloquently and graciously handled a barrage of harsh and overtly political questioning from Democratic Senators. In doing so, he demonstrated why he is a mainstream, independent-minded jurist who will be an outstanding Supreme Court justice.\n\nBased on Judge Gorsuch\u2019s record on the bench and his impeccable academic and legal credentials, this should come as no surprise. He has a long history of interpreting the law faithfully, thoughtfully and consistently. An in-depth review of his cases reveals a pattern that he fairly applies the law as it is written, regardless of who is before him. These are the reasons why he has such broad bipartisan support from so many respected attorneys and legal experts from across the nation, including Neal Katyal, who was an acting solicitor general for former President Barack Obama.\n\nThe main opposition to Judge Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation comes from a handful of Democratic Senators who are using the playbook of far-left special interest groups, the same groups that routinely attack anyone who doesn\u2019t actively promote their agenda.\n\nThis kind of politically-motivated and ideologically-driven opposition was on full display during the confirmation hearing, where Democrats tried their best to find reasons not to support Gorsuch, even though not a single one of them ever accused Gorsuch of being unqualified.\n\nThey instead resorted to hyperpartisan hyperbole, pushing a false narrative that Gorsuch sides with the \u201cpowerful\u201d against the \u201cpowerless.\u201d\n\nMy Democratic colleagues, many of whom hold law degrees, should know better than to intentionally oversimplify court rulings to mislead the public and score political points. However, pressured by the most extreme elements of their own party, they proceeded to mispresent Gorsuch\u2019s record and question his character, with the entire country watching.\n\nUsing only a select handful of Gorsuch\u2019s thousands of prior rulings, they attempted to caricature him as \u201csticking it to the little guy\u201d by evaluating these select cases solely on the identity of the parties involved. This narrow-minded way to evaluate Gorsuch grossly takes his rulings out of proper context, ignoring that they were based on his interpretation of the law, which is exactly what the American people should expect from jurists.\n\nDemocrats creating the expectation that judges should act as politicians in robes is a dangerous precedent to set, threatening the very independence of the judiciary. It is a radical departure from the longstanding, bipartisan expectation that all judges should make their decisions based on the law as written, independent of political considerations or even personal feelings. We already have two branches of federal government that factor political considerations into their decision-making, and our Founding Fathers determined long ago that we don\u2019t need a third.\n\nDuring the hearing, Democrats also spent time attempting to pin Judge Gorsuch down with hypothetical cases that could come before him, which he rightfully declined to answer. He followed the same standard as Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg during her confirmation hearing in 1993. Justice Ginsburg cited her obligation to stay impartial and provide fairness to future litigants on matters that could come before the Supreme Court, a wise decision Judge Gorsuch also made.\n\nTo put it simply, Democrats repeatedly tried, but spectacularly failed to make a single dent in Judge Gorsuch\u2019s record during the hearing. Regardless, they are still signaling their intention to filibuster his confirmation.\n\nIn politics, as in physics, every reaction is met with an equal and opposite reaction. Filibustering an impeccably qualified Supreme Court nominee will surely be met with a reaction that would have significant political ramifications and major consequences for future confirmations. I hope we never get to that point.\n\nMy Democratic colleagues should not forget that President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominees Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were both given up or down votes by Republicans. In fact, Republicans could have filed cloture, requiring a 60-vote threshold that could have very well jeopardized their confirmations. While most Republicans couldn\u2019t disagree more with the nominees\u2019 political preferences, they didn\u2019t resort to such tactics and the nominees were treated fairly. In the end, both Sotomayor and Kagan received simple up or down votes and were confirmed with bipartisan support.\n\nSenators should not play politics by threatening filibusters and evaluating Judge Gorsuch based on what his policy preferences are or how he might come down on a specific case that may come before the Court. Instead, the simple role of every senator over the next several weeks is to evaluate whether Judge Gorsuch is qualified, whether he will uphold the Constitution, and whether he will apply the law faithfully and fairly.\n\nThe resounding answer to each is \u201cyes.\u201d Judge Gorsuch deserves an up or down vote, and he deserves to be our next Supreme Court Justice.\n\nThom Tillis is the United States Senator for North Carolina.

The Flynn episode was just one in a series of politically damaging leaks that have hurt the nascent Trump White House.\n\n\u201cThe real story here is, who released General Flynn\u2019s name?

The court said a former top lawyer at the NLRB had served in violation of federal law governing such appointments. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that Obama appointee Lafe Solomon was not allowed to serve as acting general counsel of the NLRB while he was, at the same time, nominated to fill that role permanently, pending Senate confirmation.\n\nAt issue is the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, which prevents the president from using temporary appointments to bypass the Senate\u2019s advice-and-consent role. The rule prohibits a person nominated for a position requiring Senate confirmation from serving in that position temporarily. Obama named Solomon as acting general counsel in June 2010 and he held the office until Nov. 4, 2013.

Because the president had not yet nominated nor the Senate confirmed a solicitor general, Francisco began to serve as acting solicitor general.\n\nBut when Trump announced the official nomination of Francisco to serve as the permanent solicitor general, Francisco moved to another job in the Department of Justice pending Senate confirmation, and another person stepped in as acting solicitor general.\n\nThe White House told Fox News on Wednesday that they had \u201cnothing to add\u201d to the Supreme Court\u2019s Tuesday decision.\n\nBut Anne Joseph O'Connell, a professor at the University of California Berkeley Law School, told Fox News that the White House could avoid nominating people for jobs covered by the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, which allows acting officials to serve for \u201crelatively long\u201d periods of time.\n\n\u201cThe administration can go from one acting official to another acting official,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cWhen the Senate and White House are controlled by different parties, I worry this might become the default track.\u201d\n\nAccording to Partnership for Public Service\u2019s Political Appointee Tracker, 495 key executive branch positions, which require Senate confirmation, await nomination.\n\nStier said the ruling underscored the importance of the nomination process.\n\n\u201cOn the whole, this ruling reaffirms the importance of the president and the Senate working together to confirm nominees for politically appointed positions.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nBrooke Singman is a Reporter for Fox News.

True to current form, the media largely either missed or maligned it.\n\nDuring his visit to the Hermitage, Jackson\u2019s home and final resting place in Nashville, Tennessee, President Trump paid respects to his predecessor on Jackson\u2019s 250th birthday.\n\nHe was the first president to do so since Ronald Reagan in 1982. And in his speech President Trump said something I have been saying for nearly a year now: That Presidents Trump and Jackson have a tremendous amount in common.\n\nFirst, President Trump earned the respect of the Americans who elected him largely by being an outsider and a disruptive force chosen to break up existing Washington power structures. He did this in the campaign by defeating long-time political power brokers in Republican circles. He disrupted the general election by defeating Hillary Clinton \u2013 much to the dismay of the establishment in Washington and the media. And he has been working from the White House to further disrupt entrenched special interests and the pervasive, entrenched Washington bureaucracy.\n\n\u201cIt was during the Revolution that Jackson first confronted and defied an arrogant elite. Does that sound familiar to you?,\u201d President Trump said, \u201cI wonder why they keep talking about Trump and Jackson, Jackson and Trump. Oh, I know the feeling, Andrew.\u201d\n\nSecond, both men are intensely American figures who focus nearly all their energy on wresting power away from the ruling class and returning it to normal Americans. This is expressed in both men\u2019s populist messages and actions.\n\nFinally, President Trump, like President Jackson, is heavily criticized by the elites of the day. Trump recognized this and expressed it clearly at the Hermitage.\n\n\u201cAndrew Jackson rejected authority that looked down on the common people. First as a boy, when he bravely served the Revolutionary cause. Next, as the heroic victor at New Orleans where his ragtag \u2013 and it was ragtag \u2013 militia \u2026 drove the British imperial forces from America in a triumphant end to the War of 1812. He was a real general, that one,\u201d President Trump said.\n\n\u201cAnd, finally, as President \u2013 when he reclaimed the people\u2019s government from an emerging aristocracy. Jackson\u2019s victory shook the establishment like an earthquake. Henry Clay, Secretary of State for the defeated President John Quincy Adams, called Jackson\u2019s victory \u2018mortifying and sickening\u2019. Oh, boy, does this sound familiar. Have we heard this? This is terrible. He said there had been \u2018no greater calamity\u2019 in the nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s speech placed the movement that elected him into the context of American history. Over the nearly 250 years that our Republic has grown and changed, the American people have periodically rejected what they sensed as \u201can emerging aristocracy\u201d and felt the need to elect someone like Trump or Jackson who can shake \u201cthe establishment like an earthquake.\u201d You see this in the American Revolution, the Jacksonian Revolution and now the Trumpian Revolution.\n\nThe speech, and President Trump\u2019s visit, also helped frame the events of the past week. In the context of Jackson, President Trump\u2019s America First budget makes perfect sense. His budget supports the priorities and interests of the American people \u2013 not those of unelected bureaucrats.\n\nIn Detroit, President Trump pledged a \u201cnew economic model\u201d for manufacturers that calls for fewer regulations and lower taxes, so more Americans can find jobs to support their families.\n\nFinally, channeling Jackson is perfect for repealing and replacing Obamacare\u2014which will return health care decisions back to the people, doctors and states.\n\nNaturally, Tennessee news outlets were virtually the only agencies to cover the event. And while national media largely ignored it, a few liberal columnists couldn\u2019t help but criticize Trump for saluting Jackson, who has become persona non-grata among the elite, liberal intelligentsia \u2013 despite Trump acknowledging Jackson was \u201ca flawed and imperfect man\u201d and \u201ca product of his time.\u201d\n\nBut this is to be expected. One such columnist, Michael Gerson, pointed out another thing President Jackson had in common with President Trump:\n\n\u201cHis opponents regarded his presidency as unimaginable, until he beat them,\u201d Gerson wrote.\n\nAs his administration continues to grow and change, I suspect President Trump will continue to be a disruptive force in Washington on behalf of normal Americans.

If the Democrats write off everyone who backed Trump, even if it was because they didn\u2019t trust Hillary, aren\u2019t they making it harder to put together an electoral majority of liberals and minorities?\n\nSalon takes a different tack with a critical piece titled \u201cThe Smug Style in American Politics.\u201d (There are photos of Rachel Maddow, Bill Maher and Keith Olbermann, though they have nothing to do with the article.)\n\nThe story by Conor Lynch says the Democratic view is of \u201clarge numbers of American people voting against their apparent interests because of their ignorance and cultural backwardness.\n\n\u201cAfter decades of watching millions of Americans vote for right-wing charlatans who advocated economic policies that serve the wealthy and screw everyone else, some liberals have basically given up on appealing to these perceived yokels, who seem to care more about criminalizing abortion and hoarding guns than obtaining health are and decent wages. They are dumb, credulous and often intolerant; so why should we \u2014 progressive, rational, forward-thinking liberals \u2014 sympathize or try to reason with them?

Instead, senators heard from lawyers, advocacy groups, critics and former colleagues on his qualifications.\n\nDemocrats have shown continued opposition to Gorsuch, and started to come out formally against his nomination Thursday.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced he would lead a filibuster against Gorsuch's confirmation, calling the nominee a judge who \"almost instinctively favors the powerful over the weak.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., said Gorsuch was \"not the right choice.\"\n\n\"I do not believe Judge Gorsuch\u2019s judicial approach will ensure fairness for workers and families in Pennsylvania,\" he said in a statement.\n\nDemocrats Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Ed Markey of Massachusetts have also declared their opposition.\n\nGorsuch frustrated Democrats during his Wednesday hearing by following the precedent set by previous justices in refusing repeated attempts to push him to talk about key legal and political issues.\n\nWhen Democrats sought to tease out his views on everything from campaign finance laws to gay marriage and abortion, Gorsuch refused to discuss how he would rule.\n\n\"I have declined to offer any promises, hints or previews of how I'd resolve any case,\" he said.\n\nHowever, he told Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.-- who expressed concern that he would seek to overturn Roe v. Wade -- that \"no one is looking to return us to horse and buggy days.\"\n\nThe biggest hiccup for Gorsuch came from outside the hearing. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously Wednesday in a case involving learning-disabled students, overturning a standard for special education that Gorsuch had endorsed in an earlier case on the same topic.\n\nDemocrats used the ruling to question why his thinking was turned unanimously by the high court.\n\nGorsuch said he was bound by an earlier decision from the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and objected to what he saw as insinuations that he didn't care about disabled students.\n\n\"If anyone is suggesting that I like the result where an autistic child happens to lose, it's a heartbreaking accusation,\" he said angrily.\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, couldn't get enough of the Colorado native. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he hadn't seen a better nominee in 40 years in the Senate.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., lamented what he called the deterioration of the Senate confirmation process since Antonin Scalia, whose seat Gorsuch would fill, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg were confirmed with more than 90 votes each.\n\n\"What's happened? Did the Constitution change? I don't think so, I think politics has changed. I think it's changed in a fashion that we should all be ashamed of as senators, and I think we're doing great damage to the judiciary by politicizing every judicial nomination,\" Graham said.\n\nA committee vote is expected April 3, with a Senate floor vote later that same week. Republicans control the Senate 52-48, so it would require eight Democrats to move Gorsuch past procedural hurdles that require 60 votes.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/23/supreme-court-nominee-gorsuch-meets-dem-resistance-as-hearing-reaches-day-4.html"}, {"text": "House Republicans' ObamaCare replacement plan was in peril early Thursday after lengthy leadership and committee meetings failed to produce an agreement that would shore up support among conservative members.\n\n\"We have not cut the deal yet,\" said House Rules Committee Chairman Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas. The committee spent 13 hours in session Wednesday without setting up a formal rule governing debate on the health care bill, which had been expected to be voted on by the full House Thursday.\n\nSessions said he suspected that House Republicans would try to agree on a path forward for the bill when they meet in conference Thursday morning.\n\nThe Rules Committee, usually tightly controlled by GOP leadership, had been expected to let the chamber vote on revisions that top Republicans concocted to win votes. These include adding federal aid for older people and protecting upstate New York counties -- but not Democratic-run New York City -- from repaying the state billions of dollars for Medicaid costs.\n\nInstead, the meeting broke up without any of the amendments being voted on.\n\nWhile the committee was in session, House Speaker Paul Ryan was meeting with moderate Republicans from Pennsylvania, Illinois, Maine and New York as well as members of leadership. One of those moderates, Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., issued a statement Wednesday saying he would oppose the bill.\n\n\"I believe this bill, in its current form, will lead to the loss of coverage and make insurance unaffordable for too many Americans, particularly for low-to-moderate income and older individuals,\" Dent said before calling for House Republicans to \"step back from this vote and arbitrary deadline to focus on getting health care reform done right to ensure that American families have access to affordable health care.\"\n\nHowever, another Pennsylvania Republican, Lou Barletta, said he had switched from \"no\" to \"yes\" after Trump endorsed his bill to use Social Security numbers to hinder people from fraudulently collecting tax credits. Barletta, an outspoken foe of illegal immigration, said he had been promised a vote next month on the measure by Ryan.\n\nThe talks had focused on language to placate conservatives demanding repeal of ObamaCare's requirements that insurers pay for so-called \"essential health benefits\" \u2014 specified services like maternity care, prescription drugs and substance abuse treatment.\n\nEarlier Wednesday evening, the leader of the House Freedom Caucus sounded a note of optimism after President Donald Trump huddled at the White House with 18 lawmakers, a mix of supporters and opponents.\n\n\"Tonight is an encouraging night,\" said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., who for days has said he has the votes to kill the measure. \"But I don't want to be so optimistic as to say the deal is done.\"\n\nThe Republican legislation would halt Obama's tax penalties against people who don't buy coverage and cut the federal-state Medicaid program for low earners, which the statute expanded. It would provide tax credits to help people pay medical bills, though generally skimpier than the aid Obama's statute provides. It also would allow insurers to charge older Americans more and repeal tax boosts the law imposed on high-income people and health industry companies.\n\nIn a count by The Associated Press, at least 26 Republicans said they opposed the bill and others were leaning that way, enough to narrowly defeat the measure. The number was in constant flux amid eleventh-hour lobbying by the White House and GOP leaders.\n\nIncluding vacancies and expected absentees, the bill would be defeated if 23 Republicans join all Democrats in voting \"no.\"\n\nIn a show of support for the opponents, the conservative Koch network promised Wednesday night to spend millions of dollars to defeat the health care overhaul, the influential network's most aggressive move against the bill.\n\nModerates were daunted by projections of 24 million Americans dropping their health coverage in a decade and higher out-of-pocket costs for many low-income and older people, as predicted by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nIn addition to Trump's powow at the White House, Vice President Mike Pence saw around two dozen lawmakers. Participants in the Pence meeting said there were no visible signs of weakened opposition and described one tense moment. Rep. Randy Weber, R-Texas, said White House chief strategist Steve Bannon told them: \"We've got to do this. I know you don't like it, but you have to vote for this.\"\n\nWeber said Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, bristled.\n\n\"When somebody tells me I have to do something, odds are really good that I will do exactly the opposite,\" Barton said, according to Weber.\n\nRep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said that talk of deleting the insurance coverage requirements had converted him into a supporter. But before the late talks, others were skeptical.\n\n\"We're being asked to sign a blank check,\" said Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., who's been an opponent. \"In the past, that hasn't worked out so well.\"\n\nSome Republicans were showing irritation at their party's holdouts, all but accusing them of damaging the GOP.\n\n\"At some point we have to cowboy up and prove we can govern,\" said Rep. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D. \"Otherwise we're just going to be the `no' party and some people are OK with that, it appears.\"\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram and the Associated Press contributed to this report.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/23/obamacare-replacement-bill-in-jeopardy-after-conservatives-moderates-fail-to-reach-deal.html"}, {"text": "A Hawaii lawmaker who says she was pressured to give up her leadership post at the statehouse after criticizing President Donald Trump resigned Wednesday from the Republican Party.\n\nRep.

Joseph Dunford said Wednesday that the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, backed by the U.S. in the effort to rout ISIS from Raqqa, has an office in Moscow.\n\n\"I'm going to be quite honest with you,\" Dunford told senators questioning the scope of the accelerated campaign to defeat ISIS, the shifting loyalties of the various factions supported by the U.S. in the fight, and the potential threat from Russia's backing of opposing groups.\n\n\"The group that we are supporting, certainly at the political level, has been engaged in Russia,\" he said of the YPG, or People's Protection Units. \"The YPG has a political office in Moscow itself, but the groups that we're providing support to on the ground are not being supported directly by Russian military forces.\"\n\nTurkey considers the YPG an extension of the PKK (Kurdish Workers Party), which has been labeled a terrorist organization by Turkey and the U.S. Turkey has repeatedly threatened to attack the YPG, but the U.S. considers the group the most effective rebel fighting force in northeastern Syria.\n\nArmy Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, commander of Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve, has said that the YPG fighters will take part in the eventual assault to take Raqqa, the self-proclaimed capital of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.\n\nDunford was testifying with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis before the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee on a $30 billion supplemental for defense spending this year, but the hearing turned into a wide-ranging overview of how the money would be used.\n\nMattis disclosed that the 30-day plan he gave President Donald Trump late last month to speed up the anti-ISIS campaign was short on specifics. \"We've got the skeleton plan put together. We're fleshing it out,\" he said, adding it will be weeks or months before it is a finished product.\n\nMattis described the strategy as an \"interagency-developed report\" that embraces \"economic, diplomatic, military, covert means.\"\n\n\"We should have this done in the next couple of months, if that long,\" he said. \"It may not even take us another month, but we're still putting it together.\"\n\nIn the meantime, a small contingent of Army Rangers and Stryker combat vehicles have moved into Manbij, about 70 miles north of Raqqa, to provide a \"visible presence\" of U.S. forces to ward off any attempts by Turkish-backed local forces or Syrian army troops backed by Russia to enter the city.\n\nIn addition, about 400 Marines from the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit have entered Syria to set up a firebase with M777 .155mm howitzers to support an assault on Raqqa. The 2nd Brigade Combat Team of the 82nd Airborne Division is also deploying to Kuwait for potential use in the train, advise and assist role in either Iraq or Syria.\n\nWhen his detailed plan for defeating ISIS is complete, Mattis said, the U.S. will seek to put pressure on the group on several fronts simultaneously. The plan is to \"increase the number of fights in a number of locations so they have cascading problems. We intend to throw them on their back foot.\"\n\nThe Iraqi Security Forces, advised by the U.S., have used similar tactics in the months-long campaign to retake Mosul in northwestern Iraq. The attack had stalled until the ISF began pushing against ISIS on three separate avenues of approach.\n\nMattis suggested that a major increase in the number of U.S. troops on the ground may not be necessary to carry out the new plan. Currently, \"a few troops have been added for fire support or for monitoring,\" he said in a reference to the Army Rangers in Manbij and the Marines at the firebase near Raqqa.\n\n\"They're not there permanently,\" although they are in addition to the 500 U.S. troops currently authorized for Syria, he said.\n\nIn seeking to walk the senators through the complicated battlefield in Syria, Dunford drew a distinction between the YPG and the affiliated group called the \"Afrin Kurds\" who operate well west of Manbij in the Afrin area of northwest Syria and are directly supported by the Russians.\n\n\"I can confirm for you that the specific group [Afrin Kurds] that's being supported by the Russians is not a group that has received training, equipment, resources from us in the northwest part of Syria,\" Dunford said.\n\n\"In the specific groups that we do provide support to and the ones that we have asked to provide additional support to, we do have a very detailed vetting process that we use to mitigate the risk of weapons or equipment falling in the wrong hands,\" he said.\n\nOn the budget, Mattis called on Congress to \"look reality in the eye\" and approve a $30 billion supplemental in defense spending for fiscal 2017. \"Looming threats have outstripped the level of resources we have been allocating to defense,\" he said.\n\nThe additional funding request, backed by President Donald Trump, \"will help address the worsening security situation confronting us around the globe,\" Mattis said.\n\n\"We must recognize that hesitation now to invest in defense would deepen the strategic mismatch between our future security and the military means to protect our people and freedoms,\" he said.\n\nMattis also urged lawmakers not to neglect the role of diplomacy in avoiding conflicts. Trump has proposed major cuts in the State Department's budget, but Mattis said \"diplomatic solutions will remain our preferred options.\"\n\nHowever, \"we cannot deny the role of our military in setting the conditions for diplomatic progress.\"\n\nMattis said the $30 billion would \"get our aircraft back in the air, our ships back to sea, and our troops back in the field with refurbished or new equipment and proper training. This is a necessary investment to ensure our military is ready to fight today.\"\n\nThe $30 billion includes $24.9 billion in the base budget and $5.1 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations -- the so-called \"war budget\" to fund the anti-ISIS campaign.\n\nAt a Pentagon briefing last week, budget officials said the $30 billion would pay for 28,000 more soldiers and modernization of Army aircraft, drones and air defense systems; 6,000 more service members for the Navy and Marine Corps, as well as pilot training and 24 F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets; and 4,000 airmen, as well as more pilots, additional F-35 Joint Strike Fighters and C-130 Hercules tanker variants, and upgrades to F-15 and F-16 fighter jets.\n\n-- Richard Sisk can be reached at Richard.Sisk@Military.com.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/22/us-backed-syrian-militia-has-office-in-moscow-dunford.html"}, {"text": "The United States has declined to join other countries in criticizing China over allegations of torture against human rights lawyers.\n\nThe U.K., Germany, Canada and eight others signed a letter raising concerns about lawyers and rights activists detained incommunicado for long periods.

Count among that number President Trump himself.\n\n\n\nHe is increasingly focused on the tax cuts he wants Congress to enact and treats the overhaul of former President Obama\u2019s health insurance law as more a matter of necessity \u2013 and perhaps annoyance \u2013 than opportunity.\n\n\n\nThe argument basically is that whatever bill Congress eventually gags out on health insurance after a back-and-forth with the Senate, and lots of grisly sausage making, won\u2019t look much like this anyway. And the important thing is to just get some momentum going on the president\u2019s ambitious policy proposals.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s not a crazy idea. But it\u2019s also understandable that conservative Republicans would resist the concept knowing that it\u2019s probably all downhill from here for their policy preferences.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not that hard to imagine a scenario where a compromise bill limps out of the House and the Senate with at least some Democratic support and conservatives being left with little to do other than stomp on their hats.\n\n\n\nWhatever you think about their opposition to the bill, at least grant them the presupposition of sincerity. Conservatives believe this legislation will hurt people and the country in the long run. And they understand this is their best chance to stop it.\n\n\n\nTrump, who is obsessed with winning, and conservatives, who are obsessed with policy, are both acting in what they believe to be rational ways for their own interests.\n\n\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not both at least partly wrong\u2026\n\n\n\nIf Trump\u2019s first legislative foray crashes and burns in the House Thursday, his ability to enact the rest of his agenda will be cast into doubt. He is an unpopular, divisive figure, who has also seen his young administration perpetually marred \u2013 whether you think fairly or not \u2013 by scandal.\n\nA high-profile loss on TrumpCare would not just diminish his perceived power in Washington, but also likely set off a panic among investors who to this point have been irrationally exuberant about the chances for sweeping economic reforms. Surging stocks and consumer confidence would come tumbling down.\n\n\n\nIf conservatives kill TrumpCare they will in fact have felt a serious blow to the president who holds their only chance for acting on health care or any other policy priority.\n\n\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that passing it is the right thing to do either.\n\n\n\nThere is strong reason to believe that TrumpCare will be even less popular than ObamaCare. It is essentially a stingier version of the original. It will be automatically disliked by all Democrats and some Republicans, an intensified inversion of what happened with the 2010 law.\n\n\n\nAs much as Trump wants a short-term political victory, he could be setting himself up for enormous political pain in 2018 and 2020.\n\n\n\nThe president warns that Republicans could lose Congress if they don\u2019t pass this bill, but they could also lose it if they do pass it. That\u2019s why so many in Congress are urging Trump and Speaker Paul Ryan to ask for a do-over.\n\n\n\nConservatives\u2019 think that, informed of their concerns, Trump and Ryan should go back to the drawing board and craft new legislation more ambitious in scope and more effective.\n\n\n\nThere is an alternative, however\u2026\n\n\n\nTrump could also just let this measure fail in the House, blame conservative Republicans for obstructionism and just move on. Yes, it would necessitate coming up with some even more cockamamie patch for ObamaCare, but that would come later and be done in a midnight massacre of parliamentary tricks.\n\n\n\nIf it was good enough for almost every spending bill of the past five years, why not for a short-term bailout of the insurance industry this fall? And assuming that Trump really doesn\u2019t care about the policy specifics here, what is the point of enacting unpopular legislation at all?\n\n\n\nFurther, if Trump can stick the blame on conservative Republicans for not repealing ObamaCare, he will be off the hook for his campaign promises in this area indefinitely. Ryan\u2019s next demands can be met with raspberries at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, as well. Yes, markets will skid and worries will grow, but better to do it now on an issue Trump cares less about than later when the core of his policies \u2013 tax cuts and a trillion-dollar infrastructure stimulus package \u2013 are on the line.\n\n\n\nIf Republicans really don\u2019t care about deficits and are ready to accept the federal government\u2019s obligation to try to provide universal coverage, maybe Trump should just keep the more generous plan propped up for at least another year or so, and, absolved of blame in this matter, simply move on.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the point of being post-ideological if you can\u2019t take advantage of the political upsides?\n\n\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: HA!\n\n\u201cIt may safely be received as an axiom in our political system, that the State governments will, in all possible contingencies, afford complete security against invasions of the public liberty by the national authority.\u201d \u2013 Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 28\n\nTIME OUT: TROPHY OF CHAMPIONS\n\nHistory: \u201cOn this day in 1894, the first championship series for Lord Stanley\u2019s Cup is played in Montreal, Canada.

The legislation is expected to clear the Rules Committee, but at least 23 Republican members have come out against it, enough to doom the bill in the House.

That loss was bigger than most experts anticipated, and led to a round of predictable laments from congressional Democrats \u2014 and less predictable ones from Republican senators, including Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and John Thune of South Dakota, who told reporters that the bill needed to be \u2018more helpful\u2019 to low-income people who wanted insurance.

Durbin suggested that Gorsuch had lowered the bar even more.\n\nGorsuch, handed a copy of the ruling during a break on the third day of his hearings, noted that his panel reached its decision unanimously based on a 10-year-old precedent. He reiterated earlier testimony that he felt compelled to take precedent into account when reaching decisions, even when he disagreed with the result.\n\nCONSERVATIVES HAIL TRUMP'S SUPREME COURT PICK\n\nDurbin also said Gorsuch had ruled against disabled students in 8 of 10 cases dealing with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n\n\"To suggest I have some animus against children, senator, would be a mistake,\" Gorsuch said.\n\nThe case helps clarify the scope of the IDEA, a federal law that requires a \"free and appropriate public education\" for disabled students. Lower courts said even programs with minimal benefits can satisfy the law.\n\nDisability advocacy groups argued that schools must offer more than the bare minimum of services to children with special needs.\n\nThe ruling does not go as far as the parents wanted.

They warned that it could also lead parents to make unrealistic demands.\n\nThe case involved a boy known only as Endrew F. who attended public school outside Denver from kindergarten through fourth grades.

Concealed handguns are still banned at K-12 schools, courtrooms and prisons.\n\nIt also prohibits concealed handguns from disciplinary hearings on campus grounds. Private colleges and universities that do not want to allow concealed carry on their campuses must post notices with that designation.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/22/arkansas-governor-expands-where-concealed-weapons-are-allowed.html"}, {"text": "\"Devastating!\" shouts Chuck Schumer. Even Republicans are unhappy. Big spending \"conservative\" congressman Hal Rogers calls President Donald Trump's proposed budget cuts \"draconian, careless and counterproductive.\"\n\nBut Trump's cuts are good! Why do politicians always assume that government spending helps people? It always has unintended consequences.\n\nForeign aid is attached to idealistic notions like ending global poverty and making friends abroad. Politicians also thought that by rewarding countries that behave well, America could steer the whole world toward responsible practices like holding elections and allowing companies (especially U.S. companies) to operate without interference. The young nation of Israel could be propped up with money for its military defense and infrastructure projects.\n\nBut today, the U.S. sends money to friends and foes alike, and it's hard to know what those countries do with it. Israel gets billions of dollars -- but we give even more money to Israel's enemies.\n\nMoney we give to impoverished nations seldom reaches the poor people we want to help. The funds routinely go to the kleptocrat governments that made those countries such horrible places to live in the first place. Our gifts prop up authoritarians, making it easier for them to avoid free market reforms.\n\nWe're just as dumb about spending at home.\n\nThe Department of Education doesn't teach any kids. It imposes standards on local schools that make it harder for them to experiment. It hires bureaucrats who do endless studies -- instead of letting competition show us what teaching methods get the best results.\n\nThe Department of Education also promotes government-subsidized student loans that trick students into thinking that no matter which school they pick, no matter their major, they will graduate with useful, marketable skills. Many go deeply into debt just when they should be getting a start in life.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture tips American elections. Presidential candidates promise farm subsidies to try to win the early Iowa primary. Politicians say the subsidies will rescue struggling small farms, but they rarely do. Most of the money goes to big, well-connected agribusiness. They shouldn't get subsidies any more than other businesses should.\n\nThe so-called \"war on poverty\" has now cost almost $22 trillion, about three times what we've spent on all America's wars. Yet poverty endures, even as markets and technology should have eliminated most of it.\n\nBefore the war on poverty began, Americans were steadily lifting themselves out of poverty. The well-intended handouts increased dependence and stopped that natural progress. They perpetuated poverty.\n\nObviously, some federal programs do help people. When you spend trillions of dollars, some of it will be put to good use.\n\nBut that doesn't mean the Economic Development Administration, \"Essential\" Air Service, Community Services block grants or even Meals on Wheels deserve a penny more of your taxes.\n\n\"There is no magic money tree in Washington,\" the Cato Institute's Chris Edwards reminds us. At DownsizingGovernment.org, he lists many more programs that ought to be cut. Even when programs do good things, he says correctly, \"It is more efficient for the states to fund their own activities -- school and antipoverty programs -- because doing so eliminates the expensive federal middleman.\"\n\nHaving our money back means being able to pay for things we choose as individuals -- including helping out the poor more effectively than the government.\n\nFinally, even areas where Trump wants to boost spending, like the military, should be cut. We spend more on defense than the next seven nations combined -- China, Saudi Arabia, Russia, the United Kingdom, India, France and Japan.\n\nAre we less likely to be attacked because of it? Less hated? No. Often, our expensive \"defense\" puts us in harm's way.\n\nTrump and Paul Ryan do deserve credit for demanding that spending increases be offset with cuts elsewhere. But it's a tragedy that they didn't use this moment to try to cut more, and to cut the biggest unsustainable spending: Medicare and Social Security. Not addressing those entitlements today will mean more suffering for the poor and the elderly in the future.\n\nDo the humane thing. Keep hacking away at that budget.\n\nJohn Stossel is the author of \"No They Can't!

Epstein is a billionaire and former money manager who hobnobbed with the world\u2019s elite, including U.S. presidents.\n\nIn 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to a single state felony charge of soliciting prostitution from a minor. He served 13 months of an 18-month sentence and registered as a sex offender in Florida. Epstein\u2019s secretive plea deal prohibited the feds from prosecuting him or \"co-conspirators\" for any crimes related to the sex abuse case.\n\nWHO IS LABOR SECRETARY PICK ALEXANDER ACOSTA?\n\nAcosta, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida at the time, came under fire for the light sentence. About 40 young minors, some as young as 13, had come forward to claim Epstein had sexual contact with them.\n\nIn 2011, two years after he left the U.S. attorney\u2019s office, Acosta wrote a letter defending the sentence.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is this: Mr. Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire, served time in jail and is now a registered sex offender,\u201d the letter said. \u201cHe has been required to pay his victims restitution, though restitution clearly cannot compensate for the crime. And we know much more today about his crimes because the victims have come forward to speak out.\u201d\n\nHe also said those critical of the sentence were \u201cnot the ones who at the time reviewed the evidence available for trial and assessed the likelihood of success.\u201d\n\nSix years later, Acosta is again defending the sentence \u2013 this time in front of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, who was Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate on the campaign trail, kicked off the hearing by quoting a Washington Post article published Tuesday that raised questions about how Acosta handled the case.\n\nKaine asked about a claim in the article that Acosta did not pursue a federal indictment, even though his staff had advocated that he do so. Acosta denied that was the case.\n\nBILLIONAIRE SEX OFFENDER EPSTEIN ONCE CLAIMED HE CO-FOUNDED CLINTON FOUNDATION\n\n\u201cThat is not accurate\u201d Acosta said. \u201cThis matter was originally a state case\u2026 the Grand Jury in Palm Beach County [Florida] recommended a single count of solicitation not involving minors, I believe, and that would have resulted in zero jail time, zero registration as a sexual offender and zero restitution for the victims in this case.\u201d\n\nAcosta said his office stepped in to make sure that did not happen.\n\n\u201cBased on all the evidence, professionals within a prosecutor\u2019s office decided,\u201d he added, \u201cthat a plea that guarantees someone goes to jail, that guarantees that someone register generally, that guarantees other outcomes is a good thing.\u201d\n\nKaine also whether he made that decision himself or whether that was \u201ca consensus decision in your office.\u201d\n\nAcosta\u2019s responded: \u201cIt was a broadly held decision, yes.\u201d\n\nDespite the controversy created over the Epstein case, Acosta is expected to be confirmed as labor secretary.

Democrats are threatening to filibuster, and Republicans are threatening to ram through the nomination in response.\n\nBuilding a case for Democratic opposition, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tweeted that Gorsuch\u2019s testimony was \u201creplete with humble metaphors & homespun stories but pitifully short on substance,\u201d blasting him for \u201cskillful evasion of questions.\u201d\n\nIn the hearing room, ranking Democratic Sen.

Some, like Schumer, have even suggested his confirmation vote be delayed due to an FBI probe of the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia.\n\nRepublicans, though, have ridiculed the calls \u2013 and have the votes to push the nomination through if necessary, even if it means lowering the Senate vote threshold for confirmation.\n\nGorsuch seemed to flash frustration, if only briefly, on Wednesday during a tense round with Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., who as he did a day earlier pressed him on the role of money in politics and the controversial Citizens United campaign finance ruling.\n\nIn response to concerns that some on the Supreme Court could be bending to the will of corporations and Republicans, Gorsuch said: \u201cI\u2019m distressed to hear that you think that judges or the Supreme Court is an organ of the party. \u2026 It distresses me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt distresses me, too,\u201d Whitehouse said.\n\nGorsuch went on to say the rule of law works well and \u201cto speak like that diminishes what we have.\u201d He added, \u201cIt is, for me, a failure to appreciate the beauty of our system,\u201d noting the courts resolve thousands of cases unanimously.\n\nWhitehouse acknowledged that the 10th Circuit court on which Gorsuch serves rarely has party-line decisions, but noted the Supreme Court has had numerous 5-4 rulings.\n\n\u201cThere is a point where it becomes reasonable to discern a pattern, and I see a pattern and it distresses me,\u201d he said, again voicing concern corporations could \u201ccapture\u201d the high court.\n\n\u201cNobody will capture me,\u201d Gorsuch said.\n\nIf confirmed, Gorsuch would fill the seat left vacant by the death of Antonin Scalia. Democrats are concerned that despite his professed independence, Gorsuch would act as a reliable conservative vote on a split court.\n\nSen. Al Franken, D-Minn., touched on this point Wednesday afternoon as he echoed Whitehouse\u2019s comments, saying they\u2019re worried about \u201canother 5-4 Roberts court\u201d ruling against workers and consumers. He questioned Gorsuch\u2019s claim that there\u2019s no such thing as partisan judges. If that\u2019s the case, Franken said, \u201cWhat was Merrick Garland about?\u201d\n\nGorsuch also faced scrutiny Wednesday following a unanimous Supreme Court ruling on special education accommodations that tossed lower standards the judge had set in a 2008 opinion.\n\nGorsuch\u2019s second day of questioning by lawmakers \u2013 and third hearing session overall \u2013 followed an opening round that lasted nearly 12 hours on Tuesday. Mostly cordial, that session became tense at times as Senate Democrats pressed him on a handful of controversial past court cases in which he was involved including one dealing with workers\u2019 rights, as well as on concerns about his independence from President Trump.\n\nGorsuch insisted throughout that he would be his \u201cown man,\u201d and sought to parry concerns about some of his past decisions by insisting he was only following the law as written. While lawmakers repeatedly tried to gauge his view on other seminal court cases like Roe v. Wade and matters that could come before the high court soon like the president\u2019s travel ban, Gorsuch followed a long tradition of Supreme Court nominees declining to voice their opinion on such controversies.\n\nThe hearings are expected to wrap Thursday with statements from outside witnesses.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/22/partisan-tensions-flare-in-final-stretch-gorsuch-hearings.html"}, {"text": "A gun owner crossing state lines with a legally registered firearm can land in prison under what critics say is a \u201cpatchwork\u201d of laws that have little to do with public safety.\n\nA bill working its way to President Trump\u2019s desk could change that, by allowing gun owners who are allowed to carry concealed guns in their home states to exercise the rights in any other state that does not prohibit concealed carry.\n\n\u201cOur Second Amendment right doesn\u2019t disappear when we cross state lines,\u201d Sen.

He serves on the 10th Circuit U.S Court of Appeals in Denver.\n\nThis week there have been hearings in the Senate because that body must approve Judge Gorsuch to the nation's highest court.\n\nPredictably, some liberal politicians do not like the judge simply because he is not a liberal.\n\nSo even though his record is stellar and his philosophy independent, some Democratic senators will not vote for him. Here\u2019s what California Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein said:\n\n\u201cJudge Gorsuch has also stated that he believes judges should look to the original public meaning of the Constitution when they decide what a provision of the Constitution means. This is personal, but I find this originalist judicial philosophy to be really troubling \u2026 I firmly believe the American Constitution is a living document, intended to evolve as our country evolves.\u201d\n\nSenator Feinstein should know better.\n\nIf judges are free to rule on judicial evolution, that means they become politicians.\n\nAll judges in America should have just one rule: what was the intent of the original Constitution?\n\nIf they reject that, and make their decisions based upon their own political beliefs, what do we have? Another extension of Congress, not a Supreme Court.\n\nHere's the best example: There's no question the Constitution gives the president the power to stop some foreign nationals from coming to the USA. There\u2019s no question about it.\n\nBut activist judges have blocked President Trump's travel order saying, in essence, it is anti-Muslim.\n\nIf that were the case, Muslims from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and other countries would be included in the president's order. But they\u2019re not.\n\nSo everybody knows politics, not the law, is involved here.\n\nAnd eventually, the president will win in federal court. Take it to the bank.\n\nBut the activist judges don't care. They have temporarily blocked the order and are liberal heroes.\n\nAs for Judge Gorsuch, it looks like he's a traditional man who believes the intent of the Constitution should reign.\n\nAgain, that seems to be unacceptable to Senator Feinstein and others because they want a judge to be political. They want a liberal judge.\n\nFinally, the best example of constitutional debate is the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms.\n\nIt is clear that the Founding Fathers wanted Americans to have the ability to protect themselves.\n\nBack then, militias were the mechanism -- private citizens with guns organizing against threats.\n\nToday, the threats are more personal -- terrorists and criminals, not frontier marauders.\n\nAmericans have a constitutional right to defend themselves against those who would harm them.\n\nThat's why firearms cannot be banned.\n\nBut they can be limited. You can't have a bazooka or a hand grenade.\n\nThat's reasonable.

With a Congress and White House that look at drilling more favorably, some Alaska Native corporations are now looking to cash in on any future oil revenues.\n\nThe Arctic Slope Regional Corp., the only regional Native corporation that has rights to future oil revenues from the subsurface land it owns beneath ANWR, has demanded that other corporations stop asking Congress to require the company to share any of its oil wealth, according to a letter obtained by the Alaska Dispatch News.\n\n\"We also indicated our unhappiness at attempts by a few to re-open a long-resolved issue and attempt to undermine a settlement agreement from years ago,\u201d Ty Hardt, ASRC's director of communications, said in an email to the newspaper. The ASRC represents around 13,000 I\u00f1upiat Eskimo shareholders in northern Alaska.\n\nThe Alaska Native Corporations is a group of 12 regional corporations that was established in 1971 when Congress passed the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, which settled land and financial claims made by the Alaska natives.\n\nIn the letter \u2013 dated Feb. 10 \u2013 the president of Arctic Slope Regional Corp., Rex Rock Sr., asked Bering Straits Native Corp. President Gail Schubert to stop lobbying Congress to pass legislation requiring Rock\u2019s company to share any future oil revenues from ANWR with the other corporations.\n\nRock\u2019s letter comes at a time of high hopes from the Native Corporations \u2013 and Alaska\u2019s congressional delegation \u2013 that the four decade-long ban on oil exploration in ANWR will be lifted under President Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress.\n\nTrump\u2019s appointment of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state and Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke as Interior Secretary buoyed the hopes of many energy industry insiders and Alaskan lawmakers who have seen attempts to drill the ANWR thwarted during President Obama\u2019s time in office.\n\n\"As we work with members of our Congressional delegation to finally conclude more than four decades of effort to authorize a responsible oil and gas program in ANWR, we understand that you are attempting to enlist Congress' assistance in taking private property owned\" by ASRC, Rock said in his letter. \u201cASRC and its shareholders strongly oppose this proposed taking.\u201d\n\nExpand / Contract A polar bear sow and two cubs are seen on the Beaufort Sea coast within the 1002 Area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in this undated handout photo provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Reuters)\n\nAt the heart of the battle over ANWR \u2013 a 19 million-acre tract of land flanked by the Brooks Range to the south, the Beaufort Sea to the north and Canada\u2019s Yukon province to the east \u2013 is a section of the refuge called the coastal plain, or section 1002.\n\nOn one side of the debate: Alaska\u2019s Republican lawmakers, its Native corporations and a fossil fuel industry that sees the estimated 7.7 billion barrels of oil under the coastal plain a boon to the state\u2019s flagging economy that has suffered from low oil prices on the global market and a decline in crude flowing through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.\n\nOn the other side: Environmental groups and the indigenous Gwich'in people, who consider the coastal plain sacred land and say oil drilling would ruin a fragile habitat for gray wolves, polar bears, porcupine caribou and more than 200 species of migratory birds.\n\n\u201cANWR is a national treasure and an amazing piece of land,\u201d Nicole Whittington-Evans, the Wilderness Society\u2019s Alaska regional director, told Fox News. \u201cIt is not a place where oil and gas development should be allowed.\u201d\n\nThe refuge was created in 1980 as part of comprehensive public-lands legislation signed into law by President Jimmy Carter that put more than 100 million federal acres in Alaska under conservation protection. Lawmakers at the time recognized the potential for oil drilling on the coastal plain, but they prohibited leasing or other development on the land unless authorized by a future Congress.\n\nANWR Facts Refuge was created in 1980 under Carter Adminstration\n\nEncompasses 19 million acres along Alaska's northesatern border with Canada\n\nHome to polar bears, porcupine caribou, gray wolves and over 200 species of migratory birds\n\nThere are an estimated 7.7 billion barrels of oil under ANWR's coastal plain\n\nThat is basically where the issue has stood for the past 37 years as Alaskan lawmakers\u2019 and oil industry executives\u2019 advances have been thwarted in Congress.\n\nIn 1995, the Alaskan delegation inserted a provision opening ANWR to development in a budget reconciliation bill, but the bill was vetoed by President Bill Clinton. In 2005, despite having the Senate, House and White House all in Republican hands, a push to open ANWR was also unsuccessful as a number of moderate Republicans voted against it\n\nBut with a more polarized Congress in 2017 \u2013 and little willingness from either party to cross the aisle \u2013 both supporters and opponents of drilling in ANWR see drilling as a very real possibility.\n\nOne option available to Alaskan lawmakers \u2013 and a scenario that increasingly concerns environmental groups \u2013 is repeating their move in 1995 and attaching an ANWR provision to a budget reconciliation bill. This only requires 51 votes, cannot be filibustered and, unlike in 1995, won\u2019t face the threat of a veto by a Democratic president.\n\n\u201cRepublicans may try to put drilling in the Arctic into the budget reconciliation bill,\u201d Athan Manuel, the director of the land protection program at the Sierra Club, told Fox News. \u201cSo we have our work cut out for us to win over some Republicans.\u201d\n\nWhether or not ANWR makes it into a budget reconciliation bill anytime soon is still unclear, but what is clear are the divisions between the Alaska Native Corporations that have boiled up to the surface in light of the prospect of drilling in the region.\n\nArctic Slope Regional Corp. has already pulled out of the Inuit Arctic Business Alliance \u2013 a group that, along with Bering Straits Native Corp., it helped found in 2015 to ensure that each corporation benefited from development in the Arctic.\n\nRock said that his company\u2019s departure from the group had nothing to do with the conflict over ANWR, but the move came three weeks after his sharply worded letter in which he called Schubert\u2019s lobbying to Congress \u201ca breach of terms and obligations.\u201d\n\n\"I therefore request that you cease these efforts immediately and desist from any further efforts that would result in an infringement of ASRC's property rights,\" Rock wrote. \"Otherwise, ASRC will take any and all legal remedies available to rectify the situation.\"", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/22/native-alaskans-divided-over-oil-drilling-in-pristine-arctic-refuge-and-potential-riches-it-could-bring.html"}, {"text": "As Senate Democrats float new options for complicating a vote on President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Republicans appear ready to return fire with a bomb of their own \u2013 a nuclear one.\n\nTop Republican Sen.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., both called Tuesday for a postponement on any vote to confirm Gorsuch to the nation\u2019s highest court.\n\n\u201cIt is unseemly to be moving forward so fast on confirming a Supreme Court justice with a lifetime appointment while this big gray cloud of an FBI investigation hangs over the presidency,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cYou can bet if the shoe were on the other foot and a Democratic president was under investigation by the FBI the Republicans would be howling at the moon about filling a Supreme Court seat in such circumstances.\"\n\nWarren added on Twitter: \u201cNeil Gorsuch is up for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court from a President whose campaign is under FBI investigation.\u201d\n\nRepublicans panned the call as \"ridiculous.\" But Democrats could still try and filibuster, requiring Gorsuch to garner 60 \u201cyea\u201d votes in the Senate. That's a high bar for Republicans, who have just 52 members in the Senate.\n\nThat's where the so-called \"nuclear option\" comes in. If majority Republicans change the threshold, Gorsuch could be approved with a simple majority of 51 votes.\n\nThe nuclear option was first used by Democrats for circuit court judicial appointments in 2013 and top Republicans \u2013 including President Trump \u2013 have indicated for weeks it\u2019s a serious option in order to get Gorsuch on the court.\n\n\u201cIf we end up with that gridlock, I would say, \u2018If you can, Mitch, go nuclear,'\u201d Trump said Feb. 1.\n\nRepublican Senate leaders so far have refrained from using the term \u2013 but their exasperated rhetoric shows they\u2019re at least kicking the tires of a legislative Enola Gay.\n\n\u201cIf Judge Gorsuch can\u2019t achieve 60 votes in the Senate, could any judge appointed by a Republican president be approved with 60 or more votes in the Senate?\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., asked on Tuesday. \u201cIf they don\u2019t find Gorsuch acceptable, are they taking the position the vacancy should never be filled?

And his words from back in 2015 carry a prophetic poignancy in light of the horrific rape of a 14-year-old Maryland girl in a high school bathroom, allegedly by two much older immigrants. One suspect is here illegally, and the other\u2019s immigration status is not yet clear.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems,\u201d then-candidate Trump said nearly two years ago. \u201cWhen Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with [them]. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\n\n\u201cIt's coming from more than Mexico,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt's coming from all over South and Latin America.\u201d\n\nTrump was mocked mercilessly in the alt-left propaganda media and roundly roasted by Hispanic activists following those comments. Here's a small sampling of what his critics said.\n\n\u201cWhen you say that immigrants from Mexico are criminals and rapists, isn't that spreading hate?\u201d Univision anchor Jorge Ramos wondered.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m outraged,\u201d said Latin American activist Ana Maria Salazar told CNN. \u201cI can't understand how is it possible that a presidential candidate for the United -- who wants to be president of the United States can speak and use hate language.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe natural reaction is to think that he's a clown, let's ignore him,\u201d Feliz Sanchez, of the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts, told MSNBC.\n\nNow that President Trump sits in the White House, violent crimes carried out by illegal immigrants continue to take place, including last week\u2019s brutal rape by suspects aged 17 and 18. Despite their age, the alleged rapists were attending high school as 9th graders.\n\nThis terrible crime is just the latest in a long list of Americans who are victims because of illegal immigration.\n\nDuring the presidential election, the murder of Kate Steinle became national news. She was gunned down in the summer of 2015 in front of her parents in the sanctuary city of San Francisco. The killer was an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times.\n\nThese high-profile incidences are just the tip of the iceberg. Last year, Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cHannity\u201d held a town hall with then-candidate Trump, and we had mothers whose children were killed at the hands of illegal immigrants. It was a sobering moment.\n\nTheir heart-breaking stories unfolded, underscoring their personal tragedies as well as twisted local government policies that seem to place people who sneak into the U.S. above innocent Americans.\n\n\u201cMy son was an integral part of a community, and his life was cut short by a repeat criminal,\u201d Laura Wilkerson told us.\n\n\u201cAs the illegal drove by, he shot into the passenger side,\u201d said Sabine Durden, whose son was also killed by illegal immigrants. \u201cMy son was sitting at a red light, waiting for it to turn green. He was less than a mile from his home.\u201d\n\nFor years, I have been raising real concerns about illegal immigration. Back in 2014, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and I sat in on a border security briefing. I learned that in the previous seven years in Texas alone, illegal immigrants had been responsible for about 642,000 criminal offenses.\n\nBetween 2011 and February 2017, illegal immigrants were responsible for 1,162 homicide charges, 68,151 assault charges and 6,098 sexual assault charges in the Lone Star State.\n\nOf course, Texas is not the only state impacted by criminal illegal immigrants. In 2015, 36.6 percent of all federal sentences were given to illegal immigrants, including convictions for drug trafficking, kidnapping, and murder.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2015, despite the dangers listed above, the Obama administration released 86,288 criminal illegal immigrants right back into the general U.S. population. You won\u2019t hear about that in the alt-left media. Thankfully, we have a new president, and he has a new attitude.\n\n\u201cI met with many American families whose loved ones -- sons and daughters, husbands and wives -- were viciously killed by illegal immigrants,\u201d Trump said recently. \u201cThese American victims and their families were ignored by the media. The media doesn't want to talk about it.\n\n\u201cBut these Americans were not ignored by me,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere were not ignored by you. You showed that on Nov. 8. There were not ignored by you, and they will never be ignored by any of us.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump is right: We can never forget those whose lives were destroyed by illegal immigrants.

Democrats are threatening to filibuster, and Republicans are threatening to ram through the nomination in response.\n\nBuilding a case for Democratic opposition, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tweeted that Gorsuch\u2019s testimony was \u201creplete with humble metaphors & homespun stories but pitifully short on substance,\u201d blasting him for \u201cskillful evasion of questions.\u201d\n\nIn the hearing room, ranking Democratic Sen.

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., in a fiery statement, accused Democrats of holding a \u201cdouble-standard.\u201d He said lawmakers are doing \u201cgreat damage to the judiciary\u201d by \u201cpoliticizing\u201d every nomination and looking for nominees to agree with their worldview.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking the nomination process to a place it was never intended to go by the framers of the Constitution,\u201d Graham said. \u201cAlexander Hamilton would be rolling in his grave.\u201d\n\nSen.

Some, like Schumer, have even suggested his confirmation vote be delayed due to an FBI probe of the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia.\n\nRepublicans, though, have ridiculed the calls \u2013 and have the votes to push the nomination through if necessary, even if it means lowering the Senate vote threshold for confirmation.\n\nGorsuch seemed to flash frustration, if only briefly, on Wednesday during a tense round with Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., who as he did a day earlier pressed him on the role of money in politics and the controversial Citizens United campaign finance ruling.\n\nIn response to concerns that some on the Supreme Court could be bending to the will of corporations and Republicans, Gorsuch said: \u201cI\u2019m distressed to hear that you think that judges or the Supreme Court is an organ of the party. \u2026 It distresses me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt distresses me, too,\u201d Whitehouse said.\n\nGorsuch went on to say the rule of law works well and \u201cto speak like that diminishes what we have.\u201d He added, \u201cIt is, for me, a failure to appreciate the beauty of our system,\u201d noting the courts resolve thousands of cases unanimously.\n\nWhitehouse acknowledged that the 10th Circuit court on which Gorsuch serves rarely has party-line decisions, but noted the Supreme Court has had numerous 5-4 rulings.\n\n\u201cThere is a point where it becomes reasonable to discern a pattern, and I see a pattern and it distresses me,\u201d he said, again voicing concern corporations could \u201ccapture\u201d the high court.\n\n\u201cNobody will capture me,\u201d Gorsuch said.\n\nIf confirmed, Gorsuch would fill the seat left vacant by the death of Antonin Scalia.

Mostly cordial, that session became tense at times as Senate Democrats pressed him on a handful of controversial past court cases in which he was involved including one dealing with workers\u2019 rights, as well as on concerns about his independence from President Trump.\n\nGorsuch insisted throughout that he would be his \u201cown man,\u201d and sought to parry concerns about some of his past decisions by insisting he was only following the law as written. While lawmakers repeatedly tried to gauge his view on other seminal court cases like Roe v.

Even as she continues to advocate for Syrian refugees and helps coordinate European contributions in the fight against terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan, her chief headache these days is Brexit: a messy divorce whose terms are expected to take at least two years to negotiate.\n\nHaving received permission from the British Parliament this week to commence those negotiations, British Prime Minister Theresa May has indicated that the formal process will begin on March 29.\n\n\u201cI have the impression this will be more difficult for the United Kingdom than for the rest of us in the EU,\u201d Mogherini told Fox News.

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., himself characterizes this nexus as a \u201cbinary choice.\u201d The outcome is either an epic victory or a catastrophic defeat. The deal-maker-in-chief told House Republicans as much when he journeyed to Capitol Hill Tuesday morning to make his closing argument on health care.\n\n\u201cA loss is not acceptable, folks,\u201d the president warned when speaking in private to House Republicans.\n\nTrump augured that Republicans could very well lose control of Congress if they stumble.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll get the vote Thursday,\u201d the president told reporters as he departed the confab. \u201cI think we will get a winner vote.\u201d\n\nVisits to Congress to implore lawmakers to support major legislative initiatives are tricky for presidents. President Obama came to Capitol Hill in June 2015 to cajole members of his own party to back a framework for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact. Obama\u2019s petition failed. TPP is now dead.\n\nThis congressional expedition carries particular risk for Trump. His \u201cart of the deal\u201d bluster will resemble grandiose braggadocio should his entreaties fail with members of his own party.\n\nIt only takes 21 Republican defections to torpedo the legislation in the House. House Freedom Caucus leader Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., contends he has more than enough members to quash the legislation unless there are changes.\n\nVice President Pence invited Meadows into a one-on-one audience in his Capitol Hill House office Tuesday afternoon. But to no avail.\n\n\u201cDid he put on pressure? Yes,\u201d said Meadows of the vice president\u2019s efforts. \u201cWas it brass knuckles and bare fists? No.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought the president did a good job,\u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, another Freedom Caucus leader. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t change the four corners of the document.\u201d\n\nCould more changes come to the bill?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still waiting,\u201d said Rep. Dan Donovan, R-N.Y., who met with the president Tuesday and isn\u2019t yet committed. \u201cI don\u2019t know when it\u2019s locked down and there can\u2019t be any changes.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll know more if the bill is \u201clocked down\u201d soon. As he departed the Capitol Tuesday, Trump said \u201cthere are going to be adjustments made.\u201d\n\nThe House Republican leadership team already engineered a host of changes for the bill Monday night through what\u2019s called a \u201cmanager\u2019s amendment.\u201d This is a series of alterations on taxes, Medicaid and work requirements designed to capture a number of GOP votes. House leaders plan to Velcro the manager\u2019s amendment onto the bill Wednessday in the House Rules Committee \u2013 the final way station for legislation en route to the House floor.\n\nThe Rules Committee determines what, if any, amendments are in order for debate on a bill and decides how much time the House devotes to a given issue. Expect a cavalcade of lawmakers to trek up to the Rules Committee in what could be an all-day session to try to persuade Chairman Pete Sessions, R-Texas, to make their amendments in order for debate.\n\nRep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., has an amendment which simply repeals the original Affordable Care Act (ACA) by the end of next year. Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wis., authored an amendment to slash the \u201ckids on insurance\u201d provision from age 26 to age 23. Rep. Jamie Herrera Beutler, R-Wash., crafted an amendment to exempt children from state Medicaid block grants.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the Rules Committee will permit any amendments on the floor if the measure goes to debate Thursday. But the Republican leadership team could do so if it believes a given amendment scores the votes to pass the bill.\n\nWhat is past is prologue.\n\nIn November, 2009, then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., didn\u2019t have the votes to approve the original version of ObamaCare. So Pelosi made the decision for the Rules Committee to make two amendments in order. One was a Republican \u201calternative\u201d to the Democrats\u2019 plan. The other amendment was the \u201cStupak amendment,\u201d written by then Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich. The Stupak amendment built an additional firewall to prevent federal dollars from covering abortion services. The House accepted the Stupak amendment and incorporated its provisions into the ACA. As a result, the successful adoption of the Stupak amendment secured the votes of more than a dozen pro-life Democrats. The House approved the first version of Obamacare on a razor-thin, 220-215 vote.\n\nIf Republicans are to repeal and replace ObamaCare, they may need to concoct a similar silver bullet like the Stupak amendment to marshal the necessary votes.\n\nGranted, some Republicans are \u201cundecided\u201d because they may represent challenging districts. Those lawmakers may vote yes if the House is passing the measure. Or, if those members really want to vote no, they\u2019ll wait to see if the plan tanks and then cast a nay ballot. Some Republicans are holding out to extract concessions from leaders. A few are posturing. A handful of GOPers are \u201cin case of emergency, break glass\u201d votes. In other words, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., will keep those members in his hip pocket to vote yes if they get into trouble on the floor. Scalise will cut those members loose if it\u2019s clear the House has the votes to okay the bill and those votes aren\u2019t necessary.\n\nOne of the 11 steps in Trump\u2019s book \"The Art of the Deal\" is to \u201cdeliver the goods.\u201d\n\nTrump made some progress Tuesday.

Many weapons experts say the North could have a functioning nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the continental U.S. within a few years. North Korea carried out two nuclear tests last year.\n\nOn Sunday, North Korea claimed it conducted a successful ground test of an engine capable of being used on a long-range missile.\n\nOn a visit to South Korea last week, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the Obama-era policy of \"strategic patience\" was over and called the past 20 years of negotiating with the rogue communist regime a failure.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News's Rich Edson along the DMZ separating North and South Korea, Tillerson would not rule out helping Asian allies Japan and South Korea get nuclear weapons.\n\nNorth Korea last conducted a test of a Musudan missile in October, which also ended in failure.

He said \u201cgosh\u201d and \u201cgolly\u201d and then quoted Hamilton and Socrates.\n\nTo be sure, Trump picked Gorsuch because he has a solidly conservative record. The hearings are a kabuki dance in which both liberals and conservatives duck specifics while promising to be impartial on the high court.\n\nAnd Gorsuch probably would have had smooth sailing if Democrats weren\u2019t still furious at Mitch McConnell and company for refusing to give Merrick Garland a hearing last year\u2014a move that Democrat Pat Leahy called \u201cshameful\u201d at the hearing.\n\nLeahy turned up the temperature, saying it appeared that Trump \u201coutsourced your nomination\u201d to \u201cfar-right special interest groups.\u201d But Gorsuch deflected his repeated attempts to get him to take a stand on a religious test and surveillance, drawing a laugh when he said \u201cI admire the various ways\u201d the senator kept trying to draw him into pending cases.\n\nAn emotional moment came when Dick Durbin confronted Gorsuch over an allegation that he asked his law students if they knew a woman who had taken maternity benefits and left the country. Gorsuch said passionately that he was discussing the ethics of employers asking female applicants if they plan to get pregnant, and is disturbed that many female students say in a show of hands that it\u2019s happened to them.\n\nThe initial press headlines reflected how Gorsuch framed the day.\n\nNew York Times: \u201cGorsuch Vows Independence; Offered Trump \u2018No Promises\u2019\u201d\n\nWashington Post: \u201cGorsuch: \u2018No Such Thing as a Republican Judge or a Democratic Judge\u2019\u201d\n\nHaving covered Gorsuch\u2019s mother Anne when she ran Ronald Reagan\u2019s EPA, a rocky tenure in which she was charged with contempt of Congress, it is fascinating to watch how easily he deals with Congress.\n\nI also covered the hearings for Antonin Scalia, whose seat Gorsuch would take.

He went on to repeat earlier comments he reportedly said in private about Trump\u2019s attack on judges.\n\n\u201cWhen anyone criticizes the honesty or integrity or motives of a federal judge, I find that disheartening and demoralizing.\u201d He was asked if that statement applied to the president and he said, \u201cAnyone is anyone.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times summed up the Republican line of questioning: \u201cRepublicans largely used their questioning to help insulate Judge Gorsuch from expected criticism, offering 30-minute safe harbors.\u201d\n\nDemocrats see Gorsuch, a George W. Bush appointee in the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, as a judge who will interpret the law in a similar fashion of the man he may replace: Antonin Scalia.\n\nSen.

But their dream of delivering political retribution has, thus far, fizzled. That is not likely to change.\n\nGorsuch\u2019s credentials are too impeccable, his intellect too keen and his temperament too even to fall victim to the kind of debasement that felled Judge Robert Bork and coined an infamous phrase.\n\nIf the Gorsuch confirmation hearings have proven anything, it\u2019s that his opponents have no powder in their guns. Try as they may, there is little in the record of Neil Gorsuch that can be faulted. His rulings have been fair, his legal mind agile, and his fidelity to the law unimpeachable.\n\nFor conservatives, Gorsuch is the anti-Bork --the right messenger, delivering The Right\u2019s message.\n\nIt has been 30 years since the shameful treatment of Bork, a brilliant, albeit conservative U.S. Court of Appeals judge whom President Ronald Reagan nominated to the Supreme Court. The ensuing Senate approval process in 1987 devolved into a detestable campaign of lies and vilification, which diminished the stature of the Senate and forever altered the discourse in judicial confirmation hearings.\n\nBork and Gorsuch possess remarkably similar credentials. Both served as top officials in the Department of Justice. Both became scholars of antitrust. Both were elevated to the United States Court of Appeals. And, importantly, both fervently embraced the judicial doctrine of \u201coriginalism.\u201d\n\nThe Verb \u201cTo Bork\u201d Is Born\n\n\u201cOriginalism\u201d is the belief that judges should attempt to interpret the original words of those who authored the Constitution, as they were understood at the time they were written. It eschews the growing practice among liberal judges to make law by \u201clegislating from the bench\u201d and interpreting the founding fathers' words through the lens of modern mores.\n\nBork was an early advocate of originalism and became the first Supreme Court nominee to openly support what was then a new brand of judicial conservatism during a confirmation hearing. For Democrats, it was the equivalent of a jurisprudential boogeyman. They reacted with alarm, declaring originalism hostile to their own notion of expanding individual rights and anathema to idea of the Constitution as a \u201cliving\u201d document that should evolve over time, depending on how the political winds blow.\n\nExpand / Contract Judge Robert Bork's Supreme Court nomination was derailed 30 years ago. (Associated Press)\n\nA bitter and divisive ideological war was waged against Bork in the Senate, as Democrats grossly misrepresented the nominee\u2019s views and smeared his good name with unconscionable deceit. His elevation to the high court was defeated, and the verb \u201cBorked\u201d was conceived.\n\nThe ugly stain was set a mere 45 minutes after President Regan announced his nominee. Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., took to the floor of the Senate to deliver a mendacious denunciation:\n\n\u201cRobert Bork\u2019s America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens\u2019 doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution,\" Kennedy bellowed, spinning a fantastic fable that bore no resemblance to the truth behind Bork\u2019s judicial philosophy.\n\nExpand / Contract Kennedy, shown here conferring with future Vice President Joe Biden, painted a frightening picture of \"Judge Bork's America.\" (Associated Press)\n\nThe stunned jurist remarked, \"There was not a line in that speech that was accurate.\u201d\n\nBut the damage was done.\n\nHysteria over originalism has abated over time. It has since become a respected way for many judges to apply the law and interpret the Constitution. Liberals still loathe the concept, but have come to accept it with equanimity, giving Gorsuch the kind of advantage Bork never enjoyed.\n\nAnd, too, Ted Kennedy is gone. The \u201cLion of the Senate\u201d, who so dominated the Judiciary Committee in the dark days of Bork, has been replaced by the likes of Al Franken, a non-lawyer who has shown himself to be more of a court jester than a court expert, and not a very able one, at that.\n\nRight Message, Wrong Messenger\n\nWhile Bork possessed a sterling legal mind, his personality and demeanor were ill-suited for the battle. During the hearings, he proved pompous and combative, surly and priggish. He exhibited none of the affability and wit that so often disarmed his colleagues. He refused to dodge or diffuse confrontational questions. His ripostes were delivered with all the subtlety of a brick to the face. His antagonists recoiled, and so did many Americans who witnessed the fracas on national television.\n\nThis is where the comparisons to Bork and Gorsuch end. The new nominee is a model of modesty, charm and composure.\n\nWitness the recent observation of the online liberal/progressive magazine, Slate.com, which aptly described his character and countenance in a column entitled \u201cNeil Gorsuch Is Not a Villain.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeil Gorsuch, Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, is a brilliant, witty, handsome, eloquent, perfectly pedigreed judge,\" the article stated. \"He is, to put it another way, an extraordinarily difficult jurist for Democrats to oppose.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Democrats on the Judiciary Committee have tried their level best to oppose Gorsuch with exaggerated or unfounded claims. During questioning, they have all but accused the nominee of pledging allegiance to President Trump, favoring wealthy corporations over the \u201clittle guy,\u201d authoring policy on torture, promising to overturn Roe v. Wade, and even uttering a sexist question while teaching a law school class on ethics.\n\nThere is no evidence any of it is true, and repeatedly Gorsuch refused to take the bait or otherwise respond with enmity, as Bork did. In essence, the attempt to sully Gorsuch fell flat. Other than an abiding disdain for his judicial philosophy, Democrats have scant justification for opposing him.\n\nFor conservatives, Gorsuch is the anti-Bork --the right messenger, delivering The Right\u2019s message.\n\nHis honesty about who he is and what he believes is a refreshing change from other nominees who preferred mystery over substance. He is neither a constitutional chameleon nor a spineless sneak cloaking himself in secrecy. Far from it.\n\nThe Courage Of His Convictions\n\nBefore he ever became a judge, Gorsuch bravely disparaged the very confirmation process to which he must now submit. He was right to do so. In 2002, he decried how \"some of the most impressive judicial nominees are grossly mistreated,\u201d citing two appellate judges who were \u201cwidely considered to be among the finest lawyers of their generation.\u201d\n\nOne was John Roberts, who later became Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The other turned out to be Merrick Garland, whose nomination by President Obama for the seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia was delayed and derailed by Senate Republicans. Gorsuch averred that confirmations have become so politicized that judges are at risk for being treated as \u201clittle more than politicians with robes.\u201d Think what you may of the jurist from Colorado, but that measure of candor takes courage.\n\nGorsuch has hardly been shy in espousing his conservative views. In a 2005 article for National Review, he took direct aim at both liberals and activist judges:\n\n\u201cAmerican liberals have become addicted to the courtroom, relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda on everything from gay marriage to assisted suicide to the use of vouchers for private school education,\" Gorsuch wrote. \"This overweening addiction to the courtroom as the place to debate social policy is bad for the country and bad for the judiciary.\u201d\n\nAs for his unabashed endorsement of originalism, Gorsuch has never concealed his admiration for the originalist he would replace, Scalia, though he admits they did not always agree.\n\n\"The great project of Justice Scalia\u2019s career was to remind us of the differences between judges and legislators,\u201d Gorsuch said at a memorial lecture in honor of the late justice.\n\nJudges must apply the law as it is, focusing backward, not forward, he said. They should not decide cases based on their own moral convictions.\n\nIn an opinion last year, he offered a more concise guiding principle, \u201cJudges judge best when they judge least.\u201d\n\nAt his confirmation hearing, Gorsuch has refused to back away from his originalist convictions. In his opening statement, he described Scalia as a mentor who \"reminded us that words matter \u2013that the judge\u2019s job is to follow the words that are in the law\u2013 not replace them with words that aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIn answers to Senators' questions, Gorsuch consistently pledged strict devotion to the law as written and originally intended, not as others may hope or imagine. In so doing, he adhered to his convictions in a way that is rarely seen among leading jurists.\n\nThe Legacy Of Bork\n\nThe \u201cBorking\u201d of Judge Robert Bork may have forever altered the way nominees approach their confirmation hearings. Faced with uncomfortable questions about their views on abortion, religious liberties, gay rights, gun rights, free speech, federalism and the separation of powers, most nominees now strain to yield as little information as possible. Sincerity gives way to prevarication. Probity takes a back seat to guile. They bob and weave.\n\nIt\u2019s like watching a legal version of boxing's famous \u201crope-a-dope\u201d in the 1974 Rumble in the Jungle. Senators on the Judiciary Committee resemble George Foreman swinging away endlessly, hoping to land a knockout blow. Nominees play the role of Muhammad Ali, leaning against the ropes with gloves raised to deflect the many punches until the opponent drops, inexorably, from fatigue.\n\nAn expected contest of judicial philosophies, like the fight, becomes a farce. Any hope of honesty and transparency in the confirmation hearing is lost to the trick of an evasive technique. Blows (competing ideas) are absorbed and soon dissipate. And everyone departs the arena none the wiser. Least of all, the American public.\n\nAnd so it is that nearly all Supreme Court nominees since Bork have volunteered precious little about what they may believe or how they might decide cases that affect, sometimes dramatically, the lives of citizens everywhere. It is the unfortunate legacy of Robert Bork.\n\nTo his credit, Gorsuch faced many of the hard questions with a forthright mien and manner uncommon among recent confirmation hearings. He sought not to deflect or demur whenever a response might pose a risk. Perhaps it is because his rectitude is beyond reproach. Maybe it is because the vast majority of his rulings are justified under the law and, therefore, correct.\n\nInevitably, some in the Senate chamber will vote against Gorsuch. They will do so not because he is unqualified, because surely he is. They will do it because it is politically prudent or electorally expedient. And in Washington, after all, partisan politics is king these days.\n\nBut when Neil Gorsuch is confirmed to the Supreme Court, he will bring with him the potential to become one of its giants. He appears beholden to no one and cares only about following the law, wherever it may take him, as he made plain in response to one Senator\u2019s question:\n\n\u201cA good judge doesn\u2019t give a wit about politics or the political implication of his decision,\" he said. \"My job is not to write the laws, but to apply and interpret those laws.

Senator Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked Judge Gorsuch whether he believed President Trump could be impeached if he starts \"waterboarding people.\" The president has suggested that he would leave the issue of waterboarding up to his generals, but that the practice \"absolutely\" works.\n\nWhile he said he wouldn't speculate on the issue, Judge Gorsuch pointed out that \"the impeachment power belongs to this body.\" He added that \"no man is above the law.\"\n\nThe House has the sole power to impeach an official, and the Senate is the sole court for impeachment trials. An impeachment is a charge, not a conviction.\n\nAccording to the House of Representatives website, \"the founders, fearing the potential for abuse of executive power, considered impeachment so important that they made it part of the Constitution even before they defined the contours of the presidency.\"\n\nMAXINE WATERS ON TRUMP'S CABINET: THEY'RE A 'BUNCH OF SCUMBAGS'\n\nImpeachment proceedings have been initiated by the House more than 60 times, but less than one-third have led to full impeachments. Outside of the 15 federal judges impeached by the House, just two presidents (Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton), a cabinet secretary and a U.S. senator have also been impeached.\n\nA petition for President Trump's impeachment was launched almost immediately after his inauguration.

But despite these conditions, ethics attorneys in both the Bush and Obama administrations say Ivanka is a government employee.\n\n\u201cEven though the White House denies it, Ivanka is for these and other reasons a \u2018special government employee\u2019,\u201d Ambassador Norm Eisen, former White House Ethics Counsel under President Obama, said. \u201cSo we are headed for yet another Trump ethics dispute in a White House and administration that is already chock full of them.\u201d\n\nRichard Painter, former White House ethics counsel for George W.

John F. Kennedy famously appointed his brother, Robert Kennedy, as U.S. attorney general. The statute states a \u201cpublic official,\u201d including the president, \u201cmay not appoint, employ, promote, advance or advocate for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement in or to a civilian position in the agency in which he is serving over or which he exercises jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nThe Trump team has said since the election that they feel that the law is for government \u201cagencies,\u201d not the White House. The administration has since employed Ivanka\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner, to be a senior adviser to Trump.\n\nTrump is not the first to contend with anti-nepotism laws\u2014a recent example, was in 1993 when President Bill Clinton appointed then-first lady Hillary Clinton as chairwoman of the president\u2019s Task Force on National Health Care Reform. A court doubted that Congress intended to include the White House and the Executive Office of the President as agencies under federal anti-nepotism law, and upheld Mrs. Clinton\u2019s appointment to the unpaid position.\n\n\u201cIvanka has a lot of wiggle room to play around in policy. She may have more of a Hillary Clinton first lady role than that of Laura Bush,\u201d Painter said. \u201cBut the bottom line is that if Ivanka does work outside of the social realm and moves into policy, she becomes an employee.\u201d\n\nPainter stressed that so long as Ivanka stays away from policies involving trade with the countries she imports clothes in and out of, he didn\u2019t expect an ethical dilemma.\n\nBrooke Singman is a Reporter for Fox News.

But he never won Senate confirmation because Republicans viewed him as too favorable to labor unions.\n\nAt issue is a 1998 law aimed at preventing the president from using temporary appointments to bypass the Senate's advice-and-consent role. The Federal Vacancies Reform Act says a person nominated for a post requiring Senate confirmation can't serve in the same position on a temporary basis.\n\nBut the law contains an exception if the nominee served for 90 days as a \"first assistant\" to the person who previously held the office. The Obama administration said the exception also covered Solomon because he had been a director at a different office at the NLRB.\n\nRoberts said a close reading of the law's text shows that the exception did not cover Solomon. He rejected the government's argument that a ruling against it would hamstring future presidents and call into question dozens of temporary appointments made over the years.\n\n\"This does not mean that the duties of general counsel to the NLRB needed to go unperformed,\" Roberts said. \"The president could have appointed another person to serve as the acting officer in Solomon's place.\"\n\nRoberts also dismissed arguments that historical practice supported the government. Since the law was enacted in 1998, three presidents have nominated 112 people for permanent posts who also were serving as acting officials. There was never any objection from Congress.\n\nRoberts said those 112 nominations \"make up less than two percent of the thousands of nomination to positions in executive agencies\" that the Senate has considered during that time. He said the Senate either may not have noticed a problem or opted not to reject a candidate just to make a point about the law.\n\nSolomon's authority was challenged after an Arizona-based ambulance company was accused of unfair labor practices. The company, SW General, Inc., said the complaint was void because Solomon's tenure was invalid. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit sided with the company.\n\nIt's the second time in recent years that the presidential appointment process has come under scrutiny by the high court.

The host, Don Lemon, called on former prosecutor John Flannery to express his views on the decision of a federal judge to stay the order. This was Flannery's response:\n\n\"...Here's Trump saying that we have to write rules. What have they been doing? They've been sitting on their hands doing nothing this entire time. And our dear colleague, Alan Dershowitz, I think, hopes that this may secure Israel and thinks that this is a bogus argument...\"\n\nI asked him what he was talking about, since in my dozens of TV appearances discussing the travel ban, I have never once mentioned Israel, and certainly never made the argument that the ban \u2013 which I oppose as a matter of policy \u2013 would \"secure Israel.\"\n\nHe replied: \"I think that's what you believe.\"\n\nI shot back: \"I never said a word about Israel. You know when you focus everything I say on Israel it really raises questions about your own bigotry and bias.\"\n\nI then asked him directly \"what does this have to do with Israel? Why...do you have to bring in Israel to attack me and criticize me? Is it because I'm Jewish? You know your bigotry is showing?\"\n\nHe then said it has \"everything\" to do with Israel. He insisted that Israel is the \"reason you're taking the position you are. Because of your own bias.\"\n\nThe \"position\" to which he was referring is my view that although the travel ban is bad policy, it is probably not unconstitutional. Instead of responding to my \"position\" on the merits, he again \u2013 quite irrelevantly \u2013 repeated that he doesn't think the ban \"will help Israel.\"\n\nHaving heard variations on this argument many times in my debates about a wide range of issues \u2013 that my loyalty to Israel clouds my judgment and disqualifies me as an objective critic \u2013 I really tore into him: \"You can't believe anything I say because I'm a Jew and a Zionist? For shame on you, sir.\" I then announced that I don't want to be on panels with him in the future.\n\nAt the end of the segment Don Lemon asked if anyone wanted to \"apologize\" or explain if they feel they \"were taken out of context.\"\n\nFlannery chimed in: \"I have trouble understanding you Alan, in connection with this argument about the appeal...we have an honest disagreement about that.\"\n\nI responded: \"my only criticism of you was that you raised the issue of Israel and somehow questioned my motives because yes, I'm a Jew who supports Israel.\"\n\nThere was no legitimate reason for Flannery to bring Israel into the discussion. At no point during my analysis of Trump's revised travel ban \u2013 and I have spoken on this issue broadly both on TV and in print \u2013 did I suggest that this executive order relates to Israel, let alone would \"secure\" her. In suggesting that the reason for my position on the travel ban is \"because of [my] own bias\" toward Israel \u2013 and by doubling down on this position throughout the segment \u2013 Flannery engaged in an old trope: that one's dual loyalty undercuts their objectivity when it comes to analysis of domestic political issues here in the United States. By morphing the discussion about the constitutionality of U.S. immigration policy into a polemic against me and my pro-Israel \"bias,\" Flannery displayed his own bias.\n\nI'm glad I called Flannery out on this issue. I don't know generally what his views are about Israel. But his willingness to argue to an international TV audience that I am biased on the travel ban issue because I see every issue through the lens of my pro-Israel views, is dangerous if unrebutted. The reality is that the U.S. travel ban has little or nothing to do with Israel, but in Flannery's distorted mind it has \"everything\" to do with Israel if expressed by a Jewish supporter of Israel.\n\nThere is an old joke about a European student who was obsessed with Jews. Every time the professor gave an assignment, the student would find a way to bring in the Jews. Finally, in exasperation, he assigned the students to write an essay on the Pachyderm.

That\u2019s probably because nobody in particular seems to like it, even after Speaker Paul Ryan and his team pinned a suite of policy revisions onto its tail Monday.\n\n\n\nToday, Trump headed to the Hill to urge Republican lawmakers to pass his plan \u2013 not so much for what\u2019s in it but for its political necessity and its importance for him personally.\n\n\n\nThis tells us a couple of things: First, that Trump is \u2013 despite the ongoing wild gyrations over Russian influence \u2013 displaying some steadiness. For the new president to stand beside a bill that is controversial and unpopular rather than dump it back in Ryan\u2019s lap shows a surprising willingness to engage in sacrificial leadership. And second, this will be the defining political struggle of Trump\u2019s young presidency. This is TrumpCare.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s most ardent defenders have tried to blame Ryan for the creation of this patchwork plan, but by embracing it so closely, the president is passing up a politically expedient escape and instead staking his limited political muscle squarely behind the measure.\n\n\n\nBut can he force it through?\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s not a lot of reason for conservatives to be much happier about the legislation despite the leadership\u2019s tweaks. And moreover, they know that the deal only gets worse from here as the more-moderate Senate takes the baton. This is as good as it is likely to get for the right.\n\n\n\nWhat conservatives have to worry about is Trump hounding them if they manage to defeat the measure this week. If they hand the president a painful loss at exactly the moment that his administration is mired with low public approval and tossed with Russian dressing it could be a devastating setback.\n\n\n\nThe prospect of contending with an angry, wounded Trump for the next three years would be no happy thought for House conservatives.\n\n\n\nPlus, the next deal to keep ObamaCare afloat if this one fails would likely be even less conservative \u2013 a health insurance subsidy version of the spending plans passed in the Boehner era with lots of Democratic votes.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s pitch, previewed in Louisville, is that the details of this plan matter less than its passage for political purposes. Do this unpleasant thing, he essentially agues, so that we can get to the fun stuff: tax cuts, a massive infrastructure spending package and renegotiating trade deals. TrumpCare is just the cover charge to get into the party.\n\n\n\nThe initial response from conservatives was that they weren\u2019t feeling the beat just yet. \u201cHouse leadership does not have the votes to pass this very liberal bill unless they have a bunch of Democrats on board,\u201d crowed Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Mo., upon exiting the briefing on the updated version, according to Politico.\n\n\n\nTrump reportedly hit them pretty hard today, warning that Republicans would lose the House and the Senate both if they did not proceed.\n\n\n\nAnd, according to multiple sources, Trump called out House Freedom Caucus leader Rep. Mark Meadows by name and joking-not-joking warned him that the president was going to \u201ccome after\u201d him.\n\n\n\nSo now it\u2019s clear: In what is proving to be the first ideological test for conservatives of the Trump era, the president is not going offering any exemptions for conscientious objectors.\n\n\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: MONEY IS THE BEST WEAPON\n\n\u201cThis power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.\u201d \u2013 Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 58\n\nTIME OUT: FIRST TALKING, NOW LAUGHING\n\nNatGeo: \u201cForget the laughing kookaburra\u2014kea are the birds that really tickle each other\u2019s funny bones\u2026Scientists already knew that kea\u2014native to New Zealand\u2019s mountainous South Island\u2014make a non-threatening warbling sound while playing with other kea.

Trump\u2019s presidential campaign but also assumed center stage in a bizarre internecine struggle among Ukrainian political forces. On Monday, the intrigue took another turn, when a member of Parliament in Ukraine released documents that he said showed that Mr. Manafort took steps to hide the payments, which were tied to Mr. Manafort\u2019s work for former President Viktor F. Yanukovych. The documents included an invoice that appeared to show $750,000 funneled through an offshore account and disguised as payment for computers.

This would be the same hypocritical media that used the words \"wiretapping\" in their own reporting. Yes, right there on the front page of The New York Times on Jan. 20 was the headline, \u201cWiretapped data used in inquiry of Trump aides.\"\n\nWhile the Democrats feign moral outrage, they are missing the real scandal. Laws were broken. Starting back in January, we have seen the repeated leaking of classified information meant to inflict damage on President Trump and his entire administration. These are criminal acts, felonies in fact. Yet, it does not bother Democrats or their lapdogs in the media in the least. And the intelligence community? They don't seem to have any answers, and they don\u2019t seem to be looking very hard for them, either.\n\nConsider this back-and-forth between Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., and FBI Director James Comey at Monday\u2019s hearings on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cI thought it was against the law to disseminate classified information,\u201d Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor, said. \u201cIs it?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Comey replied. \u201cSure. It's a serious crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there an exception in the law for current or former U.S. officials who request anonymity?\u201d Gowdy pressed, alluding to all the unnamed sources quoted by outlets like the New York Times and Washington Post when printing leaked information.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Comey replied..\n\nIf Comey knows it is illegal to leak classified intelligence, why hasn't he found the person or the people responsible? And why, after all these months, can't the FBI give us an answer?\n\nGowdy further questioned Comey specifically on the case of Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who lost his job as President Trump\u2019s National Security Adviser after leaked conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. were published. Those conversations were not illegal, but leaking transcripts from federal wiretaps sure was.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a month-and-a-half or two months into something that you and I agree is incredibly important and also happens to be a felony,\u201d Gowdy said. \u201cSo I'm just simply asking you to assure the American people -- you've already assured them you take it really seriously. Can you assure them that it is going to be investigated?\u201d\n\nComey\u2019s reply ought to scare Americans who expect justice to be impartial.\n\n\u201cI can't,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I hope people watching know how seriously we take leaks of classified information. But I don't want to confirm it by saying that we're investigating it. And I'm sorry I have to draw that line. I just think that's the right way to be.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, the FBI doesn't comment on potential ongoing investigations? Yet Comey himself, at the same sitting, commented on an ongoing investigation into potential Russian influence in the election. The FBI director cannot have it both ways. By disclosing that the FBI is actively investigating Russian interference in the election, and specifically saying the probe included allegations of collusion with the Trump campaign, Comey fueled alt-left conspiracy theories.\n\nAs Obama's own Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said, Russian meddling didn't have an impact on vote tallies. Watch this.\n\n\u201cFirst, we cannot say -- they did not change any vote tallies or anything of that sort,\u201d Clapper recently told lawmakers. \u201cWe have no way of gauging the impact that -- certainly, the intelligence community can't gauge the impact that it had on choices that the electorate made.\u201d\n\nComey and National Security Agency boss Admiral Mike Rogers both testified Monday that Russia did not influence the vote tallies in key swing states -- Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina, Florida. So whatever meddling Russia may have done, it didn\u2019t change the vote tally. And there is no proof that President Trump\u2019s campaign worked with Moscow.\n\nYet, Comey keeps that story alive while refusing to say whether the Obama administration spied on Team Trump, even though it is obvious.\n\n\u201cI think that we know one thing for sure, that the Obama administration did spy on Flynn,\u201d said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. \u201cNow, whether it was indirect or direct, somebody was reading and taking a transcript of his phone calls, and then they released it. It is very, very important that whoever released that go to jail because you cannot have members of the intelligence community listening to the most private and highly classified information and then releasing that to The New York Times.\u201d\n\nFinally, if trying to influence elections of foreign countries is so awful, where were all of these Democrats back when President Obama was trying to influence the Israeli elections? Obama used taxpayer funds to try to defeat Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nA congressional investigation found that back in 2014, an Israeli political group used $300,000 in U.S. taxpayer funds from the Obama State Department to create a political apparatus to try and defeat our closest ally in the Middle East, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nIt\u2019s no news that there is a double standard in Washington and in the media.

It came from Matt Drudge, the proprietor of the Drudge Report.\n\n\u201cRepublicans lied about wanting tax cuts,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cCan we get our votes back?\u201d\n\nDrudge is looking ahead on the political horizon and seeing that ObamaCare replacement and tax reform can\u2019t be separated. Without a health care plan that cuts federal spending, there is no chance for tax reform.\n\nPresident Trump stunned a lot of people with his honesty when he recently blurted out that he\u2019d discovered that health care is \u201can unbelievably complex subject.\u201d He added that he remained determined on health care for one reason:\n\n\u201cAnd for budget purposes, as you know, we have to do health care before we do the tax cut,\u201d he explained.\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., acknowledged as much to my Fox colleague Maria Bartiromo last week, while begging for his House caucus to support the problem-filled GOP health care proposal.\n\n\u201cIt makes tax reform a lot harder, it makes it more difficult\u2026\u201d without a new, low-cost health care plan, Ryan noted.\n\nIn fact, Ryan built the House health care plan on the bedrock promise that it contains \u201cmassive tax relief.\u201d\n\nBut now with the GOP majority\u2019s mash-up of an effort to replace ObamaCare, the tax reform plan looks like it is headed for the graveyard. The only hope for the GOP is to demand party loyalty to the ObamaCare replacement plan in the service of reviving the tax cuts. Ryan and Trump are twisting arms by telling GOP lawmakers that if they don\u2019t pass tax reform, angry Republican voters will punish them in the 2018 midterms.\n\nBut high pressure tactics to produce tax cuts can\u2019t hide the GOP\u2019s health reform implosion. After seven years of campaigning against ObamaCare, including numerous repeal votes and acts of open sabotage, congressional Republicans have failed to come up with a better plan. They don\u2019t even have an inferior plan they can agree on.\n\nVoters have noticed. A Fox News poll showed 54 percent disapproval of the Republican plan. About two-thirds of those who dislike the proposal say their complaint is about \u201ctoo many changes to ObamaCare.\u201d\n\nTo save political face, Ryan is reversing course. He is signaling an openness to changing the failed GOP plan to buy votes from members of his caucus who are walking away from the fiasco.\n\nEven with that SOS call, the speaker\u2019s problem is that the Tea Party\u2019s Freedom Caucus wants more cuts to ObamaCare programs for seniors and the poor. That kind of fix will not arrest the decline in public support.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans and their allies in the business community are having anxiety attacks at the prospect of tax reform disappearing. They are divided over tax reform proposals, too.\n\nThe biggest problem the Republicans face is the so-called \u201cborder adjustment tax.\u201d Big manufacturers like Boeing support it, while big retailers like Walmart oppose it.\n\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R- Utah) is not upbeat about the border adjustment tax: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to pass over here. There\u2019s not a lot of enthusiasm for it. We\u2019re already working on what we\u2019d like to do.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, raised the bar even higher when he told CNBC recently that any tax cut plan will be \u201cdeficit neutral over a 10-year period.\u201d\n\nTo make matters worse, other fault lines in the tax debate are emerging amongst Republicans.\n\n\u201cThe fight over a border-adjustment tax isn\u2019t the only challenge for Republicans in their push for tax reform,\u201d The Hill reported last week. \u201cNotably, some business groups have criticized the proposal to do away with the deduction for businesses\u2019 net interest expenses.\u201d\n\nAs The Hill also notes, conservative interest groups are pressing House Republicans to oppose Trump\u2019s campaign promise to eliminate the carried interest tax break.\n\nIt\u2019s not like Trump and Republicans lack political cover to go bold on taxes. The problem is that the congressional GOP is unable to reach consensus within its ranks on even its most basic principles.\n\nIt is worth remembering that back in 2014, then-House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican, put forward a reasonable tax reform proposal. It was revenue neutral and lowered rates on 99 percent of Americans. His fellow Republicans ignored him. They were busy demonizing ObamaCare.\n\nIn their talking points, congressional Republicans like to remind people that the nation has not seen comprehensive tax reform since 1986, when Republican President Ronald Reagan worked with a Democratic speaker, Tip O\u2019Neill.\n\nRepublicans are learning there is a reason why it hasn\u2019t happened in more than three decades. Perhaps they should have listened to Camp when they had the chance.\n\nWhen it comes to a health care plan and tax reform, the GOP might as well echo the famous words of the comic-strip character Pogo: \u201cWe have met the enemy and he is us.\u201d\n\nJuan Williams is a co-host of FNC's \"The Five,\" where he is one of seven rotating Fox personalities.\n\n", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/03/21/for-gop-domino-effect-on-health-and-taxes.html"}, {"text": "President Trump flashed the thumbs-up Tuesday on Capitol Hill, where he pressured House Republicans to pass an ObamaCare replacement bill -- but despite White House optimism about a deal coming together, conservative members later said they\u2019re still voting no and could derail the chamber vote set for Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a personal decision. It\u2019s a policy decision,\u201d North Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Meadows, leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told Fox News. \u201cWe have a difference of opinion.\u201d\n\nMeadows said 21 of the influential caucus\u2019 30-plus members still intend to vote against the bill, crafted by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and his leadership team.\n\nTrump repeatedly has tried since the bill was introduced several weeks ago to win over Meadows -- from inviting him to the White House and his Mar-a-Lago Florida resort last weekend to calling him out Tuesday in a closed-door meeting.\n\n\u201cOh Mark, I'm going to come after you,\u201d Trump told Meadows to laughter, according to several reports.\n\nThe White House and Meadows later downplayed the comment, with the congressman saying he and the president have a good relationship and that he also got a visit Tuesday from Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the president was just having some \u201cfun\u201d with Meadows, an early supporter in Trump\u2019s 2016 White House race.\n\nStill, those who attended the roughly 40-minute, closed-door meeting thought Trump was dead serious when he said many House Republicans got elected on a vow to repeal and replace ObamaCare and they could lose re-election in 2018 if they don\u2019t fulfill the promise.\n\nTrump\u2019s blunt warning signaled his and Ryan\u2019s escalating efforts to get the requisite 218 votes to pass the legislation in the GOP-led chamber, then send it to the GOP-led Senate.\n\nLate Monday, Ryan and his team announced changes to their bill, the American Health Care Act, to shore up support from the GOP's rank-and-file, including moderates, and with voters who now rely on ObamaCare.\n\nThe change, in a 43-page manager's amendment, would pave the way for the Senate, if it chooses, to make the bill's tax credits more generous for people ages 50 to 65, so they could better afford the insurance. The bill reportedly sets aside $85 billion over 10 years for that purpose.\n\nThe measure also would curb Medicaid growth and allow states to impose work requirements on some recipients.\n\nRyan said Monday the amendment was the result of an \"inclusive approach\" involving the White House and congressional Republicans.\n\nBut even if the bill clears the House, it faces problems in the Senate.\n\nArkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton, a Trump supporter, said he cannot support the House bill, despite the proposed changes.\n\nHe said they \u201cdo little to address the core problem of ObamaCare: rising premiums and deductibles, which are making insurance unaffordable for too many Arkansans.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s signature health care law has provided insurance for at least 11 million Americans but has struggled to survive as customers face rising premium costs and fewer policy options.\n\nStill, the replacement plan has no Democratic support.\n\nMeadows indicated Monday that his group will not oppose or support the bill collectively, so members can vote on their own.\n\nHowever, Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, a founding Freedom Caucus member, said Tuesday that the group\u2019s opposition remains \u201cvery strong.\u201d And he sounded pessimistic about Republican leaders\u2019 down-the-road promises on tax relief and insurance deregulation.\n\n\u201cThis bill doesn't do what we told the American people we were going to do,\u201d he said.\n\nMeadows brushed aside concerns about losing in a GOP primary next year.\n\n\u201cI serve at the will of 750,000 people in western North Carolina. I\u2019m going to be a no even if it sends me home,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know of too many people who can challenge me on the right.\u201d\n\nDespite giving the thumbs-up before the Capitol Hill meeting, Trump appeared to leave with just cautious optimism, saying negotiations continue and \u201cI think we'll get the vote Thursday.\"\n\nThe president will apparently continue to meet with House Republicans until the vote deadline, which includes talking with the moderate Tuesday Group and attending a National Republican Congressional Committee dinner.\n\nNew Jersey GOP Rep.

But, with a disarming and amicable manner that rarely wavered, the appeals court judge repeatedly stressed that what matters is his independence, respect for precedent and willingness to hear the facts and keep an open mind on the cases before him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a fair judge,\u201d he vowed, under questioning from the committee\u2019s top Democrat, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein.\n\nPut another way, he told Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, \u201cA good judge doesn\u2019t give a whit about politics, or the political implications of his or her decision.\u201d\n\nThe nominee faced lawmakers\u2019 questions for the first time at Tuesday\u2019s hearing. The 10th Circuit judge is virtually assured support from majority Republicans but on Tuesday sought to assuage Democrats\u2019 concerns he would effectively serve as a reliable conservative vote on a split court, if confirmed to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nGorsuch insisted he would never be \u201ca rubber stamp.\u201d\n\nLawmakers of both parties specifically pressed on whether Gorsuch would be willing to rule against the president who nominated him.\n\n\u201cI have no difficulty ruling against or for any party, other than based on what the law and the facts of a particular case require,\u201d Gorsuch said, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a Republican judge or a Democratic judge, we just have judges in this country.\u201d\n\nGorsuch even quipped that it was \u201ca softball\u201d when Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, asked if he would have any trouble breaking with Trump.\n\nDuring a tricky line of questioning from Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., on whether Trump could face prosecution for reinstating waterboarding, Gorsuch said, \u201cNo man is above the law.\u201d\n\nThe tone of the hearing was mostly cordial, but grew tense at times.\n\nIn a raw moment under questioning from Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, Gorsuch said there\u2019s a lot about the confirmation process he regrets.\n\n\"I regret putting my family through this,\" he said. \"But it is what it is.\"\n\nWhitehouse questioned the nominee on the role of money in politics and chided him for not giving a definitive answer when asked about keeping distance from interests before the court.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t know that, you\u2019re going to have a very hard time figuring out how to make the right call,\u201d Whitehouse said.\n\nDemocrats throughout the hearing tried to discern Gorsuch\u2019s views on issues ranging from abortion rights to campaign finance to gun control \u2013 as well as probe his role in defending Bush-era interrogation policies while in that administration\u2019s Justice Department.\n\nGorsuch has not ruled directly on the right to an abortion, and was pressed on the topic by Feinstein. He said that legalized abortion is \u201cprecedent\u201d and \u201cworthy of treatment as precedent like any other.\u201d\n\nGraham later asked Gorsuch whether Trump had asked him to overturn Roe v. Wade. The nominee answered no, and said that if Trump had, \u201cI would have walked out the door.\u201d\n\nOn the major gun rights case known in short-hand as \u201cHeller,\u201d he also said that it\u2019s the \u201claw of the land.\u201d\n\nAsked by Feinstein whether he agreed with the decision overturning a sweeping handgun ban in the nation\u2019s capital, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of agreeing or disagreeing.\u201d\n\nOn the sidelines, Trump weighed in on Twitter, calling him \u201csomeone with a brilliant legal mind & a commitment to constitutional principles.\u201d\n\nThe hearing followed an initial day of opening statements, where Democrats and Republicans traded partisan barbs and Gorsuch himself tried to cut through the discord \u2013 vowing to be a \u201cfaithful servant of the Constitution\u201d and apply the law \u201cimpartially.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have their doubts, however, and signaled in advance they would have tough questions for Gorsuch during what is expected to be nearly a full week of hearings.\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., on Tuesday seemingly tried to get Gorsuch to tip his hand as to how he views the ongoing court challenges to the Trump administration\u2019s attempted suspension of travel and immigration from six Muslim-majority countries and the refugee program.\n\nLeahy asked more broadly about the constitutionality of religious tests, to which Gorsuch said he would \u201capply the law.\u201d When given the example of a religious test in the military, Gorsuch said that, specifically, is against the law, while declining to comment on the current case.\n\nAn exchange with Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., was particularly tense, as the senator grilled him on everything from the Hobby Lobby case concerning the right of religious nonprofits to skirt ObamaCare\u2019s contraceptive mandate to gay rights.\n\nGorsuch assured Durbin the Supreme Court has held same-sex marriage is \u201cprotected by the Constitution.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are still smarting over Senate Republicans\u2019 refusal to consider former President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee for the same seat, Judge Merrick Garland. Amid the yearlong delay, Trump won election and was able to nominate Gorsuch instead. That history hung over the start of Gorsuch\u2019s hearings.\n\nLeahy charged Monday that Gorsuch was selected by \u201cextreme interest groups\u201d and named by a president who lost the popular vote, and reiterated those concerns Tuesday.\n\nWhile Monday marked the opening day of his confirmation hearings, that session was largely overshadowed by FBI Director James Comey\u2019s explosive appearance before the House intelligence committee where he confirmed a long-running probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential race, including possible links to the Trump campaign.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/21/gorsuch-vows-independence-at-confirmation-hearing-says-won-t-be-rubber-stamp.html"}, {"text": "It doesn\u2019t take much intelligence to figure out who tilted the 2016 election.\n\nIf the House Intelligence Committee wanted to find out about illicit election influence, members missed an opportunity in failing to question FBI Director James Comey about his Oct. 28, 2016, letter to Congress, released to the media, which sensationally announced the discovery of new emails in the long-standing case of Hillary Clinton, dooming her presidential candidacy.\n\nIt is understandable that Republicans would not want to raise questions that would take the luster off their come-from-behind White House victory.\n\nDemocrats, unprepared for introspection about party failures in 2016, choose instead to blame Russia for the outcome, fanning the flames of a new Cold War while failing to explain why Russians suddenly like Republicans.\n\nSo both political parties were incentivized to ignore the 800-pound gorilla in the hearing room and official Washington, have moved on from the November election, with Republican leaders pushing for a $640 billion Pentagon budget, fueled by fear of Russia which is heightened by allegations of interference in the election.\n\nLet me help my former colleagues who are vexed by the politics of the moment.

And Clinton people are upset that the Trump/Russia probe remained secret while Comey talked about reopening the Hillary email inquiry in late October.\n\nBut there is more to the story and the way it is being covered.\n\nThe Intelligence Committtee hearing was highly partisan, with Democrats asking Comey all kinds of questions, many based on news reports, that he insisted he could not answer. They were obviously trying to get it all on the public record and raise suspicions for the viewing audience.\n\nAs for the Republicans, they kept pressing, but didn\u2019t get anywhere, for information on how Michael Flynn\u2019s name was leaked over the contacts with Russia\u2019s ambassador that led to his firing for not being truthful.\n\nThis dovetailed with some early-morning tweets from Trump, who said the Democrats \u201cmade up and pushed the Russia story\u201d and \u201cthe real story that Congress, the FBI and all others should be looking into is the leaking of Classified information. Must find leaker now!\u201d\n\nSo now the media have two related situations in which there is no evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nThe one making big headlines, more than two weeks after Trump\u2019s allegations, is that the FBI has nothing to support the notion that Obama directed some kind of 2016 surveillance against Trump.\n\nThe other, which has gotten little traction in the press, is that the FBI has found no evidence of improper collusion between the president or his associates and Moscow.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer made this argument to me in a \u201cMedia Buzz\u201d interview, saying the press is pushing a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d by not equally emphasizing the lack of evidence in the Russia probe. Of course, the White House press secretary wanted to focus on the Russian part of the equation while deferring to the intelligence panels on the wiretap claims that his boss has been unable to substantiate.\n\nNow critics can say that the reason there is no evidence of collusion between Trump World and the Putin government is that Comey remains tight-lipped about an ongoing investigation. But in this leaky environment, it\u2019s hard to imagine that damaging material, if it existed, wouldn\u2019t have made its way into the press.\n\nBased on Comey\u2019s testimony, this thing could drag on for months. But the media should apply the same standards to both questions: Make no damaging assumptions unless there is proof.\n\nAnd then there was this, in mid-afternoon: Gorsuch delivered his opening statement to a Senate committee, which was carried by Fox, while CNN and MSNBC stuck with the Comey hearing.

They believe he is too quick to side with conservative and business interests at the expense of working Americans and the poor.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s top Democrat, said Monday that the panel\u2019s top priority is to find out if Gorsuch is a \u201creasonable, mainstream\u201d conservative or not.\n\nSen. Schumer, D-N.Y., said last week that Gorsuch may \u201cact like a neutral, calm judge\u201d but in reality he \u201charbors a right-wing, pro corporate, special-interest agenda.\u201d\n\nBesides Gorsuch's take on the court\u2019s role and his view on whether the Constitution is a living body meant to evolve with the times, Democrats are well aware that blocking Gorsuch\u2019s nomination would be a tremendous blow to President Trump.\n\nTrump is still recovering from his national security adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s resignation and while Gorsuch addressed the panel Monday, FBI Director James Comey testified nearby that the bureau is investigating Russian meddling in the election and possible links between Trump associates and the Russians.\n\nThe Russian storyline as well as Trump's verbal attacks on federal judges both during the campaign and as president have fed into Democratic efforts to force Gorsuch to break publicly with the man who nominated him.\n\nGorsuch already has told some senators in private meetings that he found the criticism of the judges disheartening. But Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said the nominee needs to make a statement \"publicly and explicitly and directly.\"\n\nDemocrats are not the only ones who work to thwart an opposing party's president's pick for the High Court.\n\nBack in 2009, when Justice Sonia Sotomayor was going through her confirmation hearings, Republicans seized on a comment she made in 2001 that she \u201cwould hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn\u2019t lived that life.\u201d\n\nRepublicans hold 52 out of 100 seats in the Senate. Gorsuch needs 60 total votes. Of those 48 Democrats, 10 of them represent states in which Trump carried in November. His confirmation appears likely, but not guaranteed. Republicans can, however, \u201cgo nuclear\u201d and change the rule to confirmation by a simple majority. Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., took the unusual step in 2013 to break the filibuster.\n\nBesides Russia, there are two Gorsuch decisions that will likely be a focal point. He once ruled in favor of school that declined to extend the length of a six-month leave of absence to a teacher with cancer. In another case, he ruled against the parents of an autistic son who sought reimbursement of the cost of a private program after they took the boy out of public school. The rulings were unanimous \u2014 Gorsuch was joined by liberal judges \u2014 and The Wall Street Journal editorial page called the rulings \u201ccorrect\u201d based on \u201cstatue and precedent.\u201d Opinion editors at The Journal report that 89 percent of Gorsuch\u2019s 171 employment cases were unanimous decisions.\n\nGorsuch pledged on Monday that he would be independent or \u201chang up the robe.\u201d'\n\n\"These days we sometimes hear judges cynically described as politicians in robes, seeking to enforce their own politics rather than striving to apply the law impartially.

On Friday, she participated in a meeting on vocational training with the president and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nJamie Gorelick, an attorney and ethics adviser for Ivanka Trump, told the Associated Press Monday that the first daughter will not have an official title, but will get a West Wing office, government-issued communications devices and security clearance to access classified information. Gorelick said Ivanka Trump would follow the ethics rules that apply to government employees.\n\n\"Our view is that the conservative approach is for Ivanka to voluntarily comply with the rules that would apply if she were a government employee, even though she is not,\" said Gorelick, who also helped Kushner with the legal strategy that led to his White House appointment. \"The White House Counsel's Office agrees with that approach.\"\n\nIvanka Trump's role has already come under scrutiny because there is little precedent for a member of the first family with this kind of influence. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA person with knowledge of Ivanka Trump's thinking, who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations, said she believes she can offer more independent perspective to her father by not serving as a White House staffer.\n\nA popular surrogate for her father on the campaign trail, Ivanka Trump moved her young family to Washington at the start of the administration and signaled plans to work on economic issues, like maternity leave and child care. In a statement, she said: \"I will continue to offer my father my candid advice and counsel, as I have for my entire life.\"\n\nFederal anti-nepotism laws prevent relatives from being appointed to government positions. But the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel recently said the president's \"special hiring authority\" allowed him to appoint Kushner to the West Wing staff. Gorelick noted the office also made clear that the president could consult family members as private citizens, arguing that this is what Ivanka Trump will be doing.\n\nThe first daughter has sought to distance herself from the Trump Organization and her lifestyle brand, which offers shoes, clothing and jewelry. She has removed herself from executive roles and will have a more hands-off approach to the brand \u2014 though she will still get certain information and will have the power to veto new deals if they raise ethical red flags.\n\nRichard Painter, a University of Minnesota law professor who served as President George W. Bush's chief White House lawyer on ethics, said that Ivanka Trump is effectively working as a White House employee. He said that \"means that she, like her husband, has to follow the rules. It's not a huge deal if she stays out of things that affect her financial interests.\"\n\nPainter said that means Trump should avoid anything to do with foreign trade with countries where her products are made, as well as recuse herself from real estate matters, given Kushner's family real estate business.\n\nTrump says she will follow ethics rules and some of her financial information will be included in Kushner's official disclosures. She would have to disclose additional financial information if she were in a senior White House role, said Painter. That could include more details about her lifestyle brand, including her contracts and income.\n\nAttorney Andrew Herman, who has advised lawmakers on ethics issues, said he thought the administration should make her role official. He said: \"I think the right way to do that is to make her a special government employee. But that implicates all kind of formal and disclosure issues.\"\n\nIvanka Trump continues to own her brand. But she has handed daily management to the company president and has set up a trust to provide further oversight. The business cannot make deals with any foreign state, and the trustees will confer with Gorelick over any new agreements. Ivanka Trump will also be able to veto proposed new transactions.\n\nIvanka Trump has also barred the business from using her image to promote the products in advertising or marketing.\n\nTo be sure, the trustees are in the family \u2014 her husband's siblings Joshua Kushner and Nicole Meyer. But Gorelick said the goal of the trust wasn't to shield Trump from everything, but to remove her from the day-to-day operations. She also acknowledged that the arrangement did not eliminate conflicts, but she said Trump is trying to minimize them and will recuse herself from any administration decision-making that affects her business.\n\nWith the Trump Organization, Ivanka Trump has stepped down from a leadership role and will receive fixed payments rather than a share of the profits.\n\nIvanka Trump has also written a book, \"Women Who Work,\" that will be released in May.

It's putting the spotlight on Travis County, Texas, home of liberal Austin.\n\nThe administration released a list of 206 cases of immigrants released from custody before federal agents could intervene. Roughly two-thirds were from Travis County.\n\n\n\nThe 206 figure is somewhat murky. It doesn't represent all the cases in which immigration authorities sought custody of people facing criminal charges, with major cities like New York and Los Angeles underrepresented on the list. It's also unclear what period it covers. The cases were identified by the administration between Jan. 28 and Feb. 3, but most of the detention requests had been made before then, as far back as early 2014. Also unclear is the status of the immigrants -- whether some are in federal or state custody.\n\n\n\nThe release of the list by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was prompted by an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in January. That order called on the government to document which local jurisdictions aren't cooperating with federal efforts to find and deport immigrants in the country illegally.\n\n\n\nTrump has made immigration a key issue in his administration and has promised to deport \"bad dudes\" living in the United States illegally. The report highlights a variety of crimes, including the case of a Jamaican national in Philadelphia charged with homicide, along with multiple sex offenses, assaults and driving under the influence cases. The majority of the immigrants whose cases are highlighted are from Mexico or Central America. The Travis County cases also include a mix of convictions and charges ranging from drunken driving to aggravated assault and sexual assault.\n\n\n\nTravis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez, a Democrat, was elected last fall after campaigning on refusing to comply with immigration detainers in cases where people were arrested on minor offenses unrelated to their being in the country illegally. Detainers are government requests that an immigrant who could face deportation be turned over to immigration authorities.\n\n\n\nHernandez's office has continued to honor detainers for more serious offenses, including murder. All but 26 of the declined detainers were issued by the Obama administration and before Hernandez took office.\n\n\n\nTexas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott responded to Hernandez's policies by blocking $1.5 million in state grant funding to Travis County.\n\n\n\nJails and police agencies around the U.S. have opted in recent years not to cooperate with immigration authorities, in some cases citing federal court rulings that immigrants cannot be held in those jails strictly because of their immigration status. Other jurisdictions have passed local ordinances barring cooperation.\n\n\n\nAs a result, the Obama administration dramatically reduced the number of detainers filed annually, a trend Trump's immigration authorities have pledged to reverse.\n\n\n\nICE said that nationwide, from Jan. 28 to Feb. 3, it made 3,083 new requests to jails that immigrants accused of a crime be held long enough for ICE agents to take them into custody. It is unclear how many of those requests were honored.\n\n\n\nThe number of requests made and declined is likely to increase as the government issues more detainer requests, immigration officials said. The officials briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity despite Trump's complaints that anonymous sources should not be considered reliable.\n\n\n\nActing ICE Director Thomas Homan said that when detainer requests aren't honored and serious offenders are released, \"it undermines ICE's ability to protect the public safety and carry out its mission.\"\n\n\n\nTrump has said he plans to crack down on so-called \"sanctuary cities\" and other jurisdictions that do not cooperate with immigration authorities and has threatened to eliminate access to some federal grants. He also plans to restart the Secure Communities program that used fingerprints collected in local jails and shared with the FBI to identify immigrants who could face deportation. The program was scrapped under the Obama administration amid multiple court challenges and widespread complaints that it resulted in the deportations of people accused of only low-level offenses.\n\n", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/20/dhs-names-local-jails-that-wont-hold-illegal-immigrants.html"}, {"text": "A divided Supreme Court struggled on Monday over a property rights dispute that could make it tougher for state and local governments to limit development in coastal areas.\n\nThe case involves a family's effort to sell part of its riverfront land in Wisconsin. The family planned to use the money from a vacant lot they own to pay for improvements on a cabin that sits on the parcel next door.\n\nBut county officials nixed the sale for violating local conservation rules and treated the lots as a single property that can't be split up. The family says that's unfair and claims the government should pay what the vacant parcel is worth \u2014 up to $400,000. The government argues that when viewed as a whole, the land remains quite valuable and the family is owed nothing.\n\nThe case has drawn interest from property rights and business groups that say such rules let the government avoid paying landowners for restricting land use. The Constitution requires compensation if regulations take away a property's economic value.\n\nDuring a one-hour argument, the court's four liberal justices seemed to side with state and local officials, while conservative justices were generally more skeptical. Justice Anthony Kennedy \u2014 often a swing vote in close cases \u2014 asked tough questions of both sides.\n\nThe court's ruling could affect more than 100 cities and counties across the U.S. that have similar \"merger\" restrictions.\n\nThe Murrs' lawyer, John Groen, told the justices the lots should be viewed as \"independent, discrete, and separate parcels\" because that is how they originally were drawn up and have been taxed for years.\n\nBut Justice Elena Kagan said the Murrs seem to rely on state law as it originally drew up the property lines, but ignore revisions to the law that treat side-by-side lots as a single parcel if they have the same owner.\n\n\"If we're looking to state law, let's look to state law, the whole ball of wax,\" Kagan said.\n\nWisconsin Solicitor General Misha Tseytlin argued that the two lots \"have merged for all relevant purposes under state law.\" He said state officials also considered the reasonable expectations of the property owners.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts said it seemed \"a little quirky\" that the Murrs can't treat the properties separately, but if they had purchased them under separate names they would be in \"an entirely different situation.\"\n\nThe case began in 2004, when four siblings in the Murr family wanted to sell the vacant lot on the banks of the St. Croix River. Their father had purchased the two 1.25-acre lots separately in the 1960s. They were later transferred to his children in the 1990s.\n\nCounty officials blocking the sale point to regulations passed in 1976 that bar new construction on lots in the area to prevent overcrowding and pollution. A \"grandfather\" clause exempted existing owners. But the county won't apply that exemption to the Murrs' empty lot alone, since it is connected to the family's other land.\n\nA Wisconsin appeals court sided with the county, saying zoning rules did not take away the property's value because the Murrs could still use both lots as a vacation property or sell them as a whole.\n\nThe county argues that a ruling against it would undermine its ability to minimize flood damage and maintain property values in the area. It argues that the family has treated both parcels as a single lot and says they could build a new home on either lot.\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy criticized lawyers on both sides. He said the family's argument seemed to ignore \"market factors.\" But he also said the state should have to consider \"the reasonable investment-backed expectations of the owner.\"\n\nThe high court took the case up more than a year ago, but waited several months before scheduling arguments. Property rights issues often divide the high court along ideological lines and the delay prompted speculation the justices were waiting for a ninth justice to join them.\n\nYet only eight justices heard the case on Monday, the same day that confirmation hearings began for Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch. He could be confirmed in time to sit for arguments in April.\n\nA ruling is expected by June.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/20/supreme-court-seems-divided-in-property-rights-dispute.html"}, {"text": "President Trump on Monday held his first meeting with Iraq's prime minister Monday as the American leader shapes his policy for defeating the Islamic State group.\n\nWith Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi at the White House, Trump said Iran is one of the issues his team will discuss with the Iraqi delegation. He took the opportunity to criticize the nuclear deal his predecessor, Barack Obama, pursued with Iran.\n\n\"One of the things I did ask is, `Why did President Obama sign that agreement with Iran?' because nobody has been able to figure that one out,\" Trump said. \"But maybe someday we'll be able to figure that one out.\"\n\nTrump said he hopes to address the \"vacuum\" that was created when the Islamic State group claimed Iraq and added that \"we shouldn't have gone in\" to Iraq in the first place.\n\nSpeaking after Trump during the bilateral meeting, al-Abadi said that Iraq has \"the strongest counterterrorism forces, but we are looking forward to more cooperation between us and the U.S.\"\n\nTrump campaigned on a promise to dramatically ramp up the assault on IS and has vowed to eradicate \"radical Islamic terrorism.\" So far, he has not indicated a dramatic change of course.\n\nLike Obama before him, Trump has not suggested any sharp increases in troop levels or in airstrikes against militant targets, looking to avoid giving off the image of an invading force.\n\nEarlier Monday, Trump greeted al-Abadi in the Oval Office shortly after FBI Director James Comey said the FBI and Justice Department have no information to substantiate Trump's claims that Obama wiretapped him before the election.\n\nAs reporters were leaving, al-Abadi leaned over to Trump and joked, \"We have nothing to do with the wiretap.\"\n\nThe Iraqi premier's first visit to Washington since Trump's inauguration came before Trump hosts a 68-nation meeting geared toward advancing the fight against the militant group.\n\nDuring al-Abadi's last visit to Washington, the Iraqi premier worked to drum up greater financial and military support as he faced the daunting task of rebuilding cities destroyed in the fight against the Islamic State group. He also sought greater assistance to help the country confront a humanitarian crisis, with more than 4 million people displaced in the fighting.\n\nAs he departed Baghdad for the Monday afternoon meeting at the White House, al-Abadi declared in a video statement, \"We are in the last chapter, the final stages to eliminate IS militarily in Iraq.\"\n\nBut as Iraqi forces come closer to recapturing the city of Mosul -- it's militant group's biggest stronghold in Iraq -- the extent to which the Trump administration is willing to commit to efforts to rebuild Iraqi cities, many of them in ruins from the fighting, remains to be seen.\n\nTrump's budget proposal would cut by roughly 30 percent funding for the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nBoth contribute significantly to peacekeeping missions and development programs. How Iraq will be impacted by Trump's approach isn't known. Previous administrations have asserted a need for maintaining assistance to Iraq to counter the influence of neighboring Iran.\n\nIf the proposed budget is approved by Congress, more than $3 billion of the additional money being geared toward defense spending would be allocated to the fight against IS, including $2 billion for a fund that would give the Pentagon the discretion to direct those resources where needed to support the counter-IS strategy.\n\nAl-Abadi arrives having already won one concession from Trump administration. The temporary ban on travelers from seven countries was rewritten to exclude Iraq, after several Iraqi officials and U.S. lawmakers objected to Iraq's inclusion, noting the risks and sacrifices that many Iraqis made assisting U.S. troops during and after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. The rewritten ban has been blocked by U.S. courts.\n\nTrump may also find himself having to explain comments he made on his first day in office, when he vowed that the U.S. may get a chance to take Iraq's oil as compensation for its efforts there -- something al-Abadi, and later, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, rebuffed.\n\nAl-Abadi assumed power in 2014 after Iraq's longtime prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, was pushed out by his party for his failures to cap the surge of IS fighters. At one point, the radical Sunni Muslim group ruled about a third of Iraq.\n\nSince then, Iraq's military has seen significant military victories, with the help of an international coalition that has been assisting with airstrikes and weapons as well as a robust advise and assist operation.\n\nThe U.S. has sent about 5,200 U.S. forces in Iraq, but that number doesn't include a few thousand forces who are there on temporary duty or don't count in the military personnel accounting system for other reasons.\n\nIn neighboring Syria, the U.S. has more than 700 boots on the ground.

Comey used the forum to confirm for the first time that the bureau is probing Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign, including possible Trump team ties.\n\nAs Trump himself joined the fray on Twitter, Spicer said \u201cnothing has changed\u201d with regard to allegations of Trump-Russia connections.\n\n\u201cSenior Obama intelligence officials have gone on record to confirm that there\u2019s no evidence of a Trump-Russia collusion \u2026 and we take them at their word,\u201d Spicer said.\n\nSpicer said that while the FBI is investigating the circumstances of the 2016 campaign, \u201cthere is no evidence, according to the people that have been briefed, of any collusion or activity that leads them to believe that that exists.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cMy point to you is that despite the narrative that gets played over and over again \u2026every person Republican and Democrat that has been briefed on it has come to the same conclusion, that there is no collusion and that that\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Spicer said Trump was not prepared to withdraw and apologize for his controversial allegation that Obama directed wiretapping against him.\n\n\u201cThis is one in a series of hearings that will be happening,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of areas that still need to be covered.\u201d\n\nAt the hearing, Comey said he has \u201cno information\u201d to support the series of tweets Trump put out earlier this month alleging wiretapping by the Obama administration.\n\nAs for the Russia probe, Comey was careful in his testimony not to confirm any details of what the bureau\u2019s Russia investigation has uncovered or dismissed, saying he could not comment further since the probe is \u201copen\u201d and \u201congoing.\u201d\n\nBut he used his opening statement to address head-on the probe that has been the subject of news reports for months.

Comey, asked about that statement, said \u201cI think he\u2019s right\u201d to characterize the intelligence community\u2019s findings that way.\n\nThe @POTUS account then highlighted Comey\u2019s response, tweeting a clip of his answer.\n\nEchoing the White House, committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., also closed Monday\u2019s hearing by saying they also \u201cdon\u2019t have any evidence\u201d of collusion between Trump and Russia officials.\n\nBut Democrats maintained throughout Monday\u2019s hearing that various Russian contacts with associates of the Trump campaign raise troubling questions, not the least of which was former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s undisclosed contacts with the Russian ambassador; revelations that he misled Vice President Pence on the matter led to his resignation earlier this year.\n\nRep.

And while the public doesn\u2019t vote on Supreme Court nominees, my analysis of past votes suggests public approval is correlated with how many votes a nominee receives in the Senate once you control for other factors. Public pressure, for example, is part of what helped Clarence Thomas get confirmed. In pretty much every single survey taken so far, more Americans have supported Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation than opposed it. Gorsuch doesn\u2019t have quite the approval5 that many nominees over the past 30 years have had, but he\u2019s not far off.\u201d\n\nHurt\u2019s so good: Gorsuch and the corpse flower - WashTimes: \u201cAlready, Democrats in the Senate have declared that they have no interest in taking Judge Gorsuch or his confirmation hearings seriously. \u2018The high burden of proof that Judge Gorsuch has to meet is largely a result of the president who nominated him,\u2019 said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat who was elected to the Senate from the ridiculous state of Connecticut despite repeatedly lying about fighting in the Vietnam War. In other words, according to Mr. Blumenthal, it\u2019s all about politics. Nothing to do with the Constitution.

Chalupa had worked in the White House Office of Public Liaison during the Clinton Administration and was paid $412,000 by the DNC from 2004 to 2016, according to Federal Election Commission records.\n\nAn email released by Wikileaks dated May 3, 2016 from Chalupa to Luis Miranda, communications director of the Democratic National Committee, said: \u201cThey put me on the program to speak specifically about Paul Manafort\u2026there is a big Trump component you need to be aware of that will hit in the next few weeks.\u201d\n\n\u201cAli Chalupa naturally was interested on behalf of the DNC to paint Mr. Manafort in the most negative light possible,\u201d says Ukraine expert Adrian Karatnycky of the Atlantic Council. Critical to their efforts to find evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, Democrats wanted to figure out who was paying Manafort, and how much.\n\n\u201cThere was a financial ledger book under investigation by the Ukrainians,\u201d Karatnycky said. \u201cShedding light on that would have been in Chalupa\u2019s playbook. She was pointing media where there was smoke in the middle of a campaign. And indeed there was a media firestorm that led to Manafort\u2019s resignation in the middle of the campaign.\u201d\n\nPAUL MANAFORT RESIGNS FROM TRUMP CAMPAIGN\n\nThe financial ledger first surfaced when a Ukrainian journalist and Parliament member named Serhiy Leshchenko published parts of it online.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, I am not a reliable source on Manafort and Russia, I am just focused on the Ukraine issue,\u201d Leshchenko told Fox News when reached in Kiev.\n\nLeshchenko said he discussed Manafort\u2019s role in Ukrainian politics with Chalupa, the Democratic consultant, last year. Leshchenko said Manafort \u201ckept his eyes blind to all the corruption\u201d by the Ukrainian politicians he was advising years ago.\n\nEven so, Karatnycky points out that the \u201cbonafides of the ledger book were under question.\"\n\n\u201cI saw excerpts from the ledger book about half a year before they reached the public, and they were just photocopies of what was said to be an original document,\u201d Karatnycky said. \u201cI don\u2019t think any criminal cases have been brought on the basis of the ledger book.\u201d\n\nChalupa, the Ukrainian-American activists who has researched Manafort since the Ukraine crisis in 2014, said: \u201cThe evidence of collusion between Russia and Manafort is circumstantial at this point. It is unclear what new evidence the intelligence community has obtained that will be made public in the coming weeks. When you piece everything together, you see a distinct history of representing Russian interests.\u201d\n\nFormer Pentagon official J.D. Gordon, who met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak at the Republican National Convention last July and had a hand in the forming of the GOP platform on Ukraine, told Fox News he had never seen so much disinformation in his life.\n\n\u201cFrom the media and bloggers, to the leakers in the intelligence community,\u201d Gordon said, \u201cit\u2019s incredible to see how many people are contributing to a false narrative, whether intentional or not.\u201d\n\nAn American political consultant based in Ukraine with close knowledge of Manafort\u2019s dealings there also told Fox News the leaks have gotten out of hand.\n\n\u201cThis would almost make Joe McCarthy blush what\u2019s going on in Washington,\u201d the consultant said. \u201cAll this leaking\u2026 Are we witnessing a coup d\u2019etat by the intelligence services?\u201d\n\nThe source said that American political consultants like Manafort are common in Ukraine\u2019s fractious political system.\n\n\u201cTad Devine worked on Bernie Sanders campaign and there he was working for us in Ukraine. Democrats and Republicans working together. All the media reporting has been like Claude Raines in Casablanca, shocked, shocked there is gambling going on here!\u201d the consultant said. \u201cThere are Americans involved in politics in the world! Shocking! Americans have the most experience with bare knuckle politics, with Democratic processes. Who has the most experience in electoral and political technologies? You go to the guys with the most experience, with bare-knuckle politics like we practice in the U.S.\u201d\n\nKaratnycky said there is money to be made by the Americans in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cUkrainian leaders crave expertise\u2026 I think Manafort was making piles of money in Ukraine,\" Karatnycky said. \"I don\u2019t know anything about him making money from Russia.\u201d\n\nAs for reports that Manafort worked with a Russian agent named Konstantin Kilimnik, Karatnycky said: \u201cBefore he was hired by a USAID-funded project, Kilimnik had bragged he worked for Russian intelligence. But he was a good translator, and that\u2019s why Manafort\u2019s team hired him.\u201d\n\nThe frequent political consultant in Ukraine told Fox News, \u201cI know Konstantin and I know Paul. It seems extremely far-fetched and preposterous that they had anything to do with the Republican platform being changed.\u201d\n\nA former Manafort colleague from his days with the lobbying firm Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly \u2013 dubbed the \u201cTorturer\u2019s Lobby\u201d in a scathing report from the early 90s for its efforts in Africa and Asia \u2013 said despite many hair-raising experiences she had with Manafort, she does not doubt his patriotism. Riva Levinson describes her experiences with Manafort in her book \u201cChoosing a Hero\u201d and told Fox News: \u201cI questioned many things about Paul, but I never questioned his loyalty to the United States.\u201d\n\nLevinson said she learned a lot from Manafort, who she called a brilliant strategist.\n\nBut, she added, \u201cPaul sent me on a pointless mission to Somalia, to meet with a murderous dictator, because the guy was in trouble, and we could extract a big fee. It was pointless.

Comey\u2019s testimony could serve to fuel tensions with the White House, which maintains there\u2019s no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion.\n\nComey was careful in his testimony not to confirm any details of what the bureau\u2019s Russia investigation has uncovered or dismissed, saying he could not comment further since the probe is \u201copen\u201d and \u201congoing.\u201d\n\nBut he used his opening statement to address head-on the probe that has been the subject of news reports for months. He noted while the FBI normally would not confirm ongoing investigations, he could make an exception for such \u201cunusual\u201d circumstances.\n\n\u201cI have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government\u2019s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election,\u201d Comey said. \u201cThat includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia\u2019s efforts.\u201d\n\nHe added that this probe will \u201cinclude an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.\u201d\n\nIn response, a senior administration official told Fox News that \u201cnothing has changed\u201d on their end: \u201cSenior Obama intelligence officials have gone on record to confirm there is NO EVIDENCE of Trump-Russia collusion and there is NO EVIDENCE of a Trump-Russia scandal. \u2026 We take them at their word.\u201d\n\nThe White House also pushed back on Twitter, with the official @POTUS account used to highlight one section of the hearing where Rogers and Comey both said they have no evidence that Russian cyber-actors changed vote tallies in swing states.\n\n\u201cThe NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral process,\u201d the presidential account tweeted.\n\nMeanwhile, Comey used his appearance to effectively knock down a series of allegations Trump tweeted earlier this month about supposed wiretapping conducted against him by his predecessor.\n\n\u201cI have no information that supports those tweets, and we have looked carefully inside the FBI,\u201d Comey said, adding that the same is true for the Department of Justice.\n\nAsked about Trump\u2019s suggestion that the prior administration was engaged in McCarthyism, Comey responded, \u201cI try very hard not to engage in any isms of any kind, including McCarthyism.\u201d\n\nHe further clarified that \u201cno president\u201d could unilaterally wiretap anyone.\n\nRogers also said he\u2019s seen no evidence to support claims that the Obama administration instructed British intelligence to spy on the Trump team.\n\nThe hearing Monday marked a rare opportunity for top intelligence and law enforcement officials to speak publicly on matters that for months have been the subject of news reports driven by anonymous sources and speculation. Trump at times has fed the frenzy, namely with his explosive allegation that the Obama administration wiretapped Trump Tower and his phones before the election.\n\nTop lawmakers on both sides of the aisle said before and during Monday\u2019s hearing that they\u2019d seen no evidence to support Trump\u2019s charge, and Comey affirmed their claims.\n\n\u201cWe know there was not a physical wiretap of Trump Tower,\u201d Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said in his opening statement, while saying it\u2019s \u201cpossible\u201d other surveillance activities were conducted against Trump and his associates.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democratic member on the committee, said definitively Monday that no evidence was found to support the \u201cslanderous accusation.\u201d\n\nMore broadly, the hearing was meant to address the allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign and claims of collusion or coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. Before Monday, Comey had not said whether there is an investigation of possible Trump-Russia connections.\n\nAhead of the hearing, Trump blasted that narrative as \u201cFAKE NEWS.\u201d He cited Obama intelligence director James Clapper\u2019s recent statement that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d of Trump-Russia collusion.\n\nStill, Schiff maintains \u201ccircumstantial\u201d evidence existed. He laid out a series of concerns during his opening statement Monday, detailing a lengthy timeline of contacts and arrangements Trump associates had with Russian officials and entities. This included former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s initially concealed contact with the Russian ambassador and accurate suggestions from a Trump associate that WikiLeaks last year would go after Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nIn response to Trump\u2019s tweets, Schiff also tweeted Monday that: \u201cThe intelligence community concluded the Russians will interfere again. This is why full investigation is important to country.

Under questioning from Rep.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017\n\nA spokesman for Obama called the accusation \u201cfalse\u201d and said \u201cneither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen.\"\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions has suggested he never provided information to Trump that may have supported the wiretapping allegation.\n\nOn March 5, the White House called for Congress to investigate\u2014now, lawmakers in both chambers of Congress are demanding the FBI clear up the president\u2019s claims.\n\nBoth the House Intelligence Committee and Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism asked the Justice Department to turn over any evidence supporting Trump\u2019s allegations \u2013 including warrants and court orders. The DOJ said Friday it had \"complied\" with requests for information.\n\nThe leaders of the House and Senate Intelligence committees said earlier last week they didn't have evidence to back up the president\u2019s wiretapping allegations.\n\nClaims on Trump campaign contact with Russia\n\nThe New York Times and CNN reported in February that U.S. intelligence officials had evidence of repeated contacts between some Trump campaign associates and Russian officials. The Trump campaign denied any such contact.\n\nAttorney General Sessions held two meetings with the Russian ambassador last year, despite testimony before a Senate committee during his confirmation hearing that he had no communications with the Russians.\n\nSessions said that the meetings were not about the campaign, but rather in his capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nReports surfaced in February that Michael Flynn, then Trump\u2019s national security adviser, had inappropriately discussed sanctions on Russia with the country\u2019s ambassador before the inauguration and misled Vice President Pence. Flynn later had to resign amid the controversy.\n\nThere are also claims that former Trump Campaign Manager Paul Manafort, had been in contact with Russian officials. A New York Times report said the FBI found evidence of this relationship\u2014an allegation Manafort, who does business in Ukraine, has also denied.\n\nThese allegations all come in the midst of a \u201cdossier\u201d allegedly compiled by a British intelligence official on behalf of Trump opponents during the campaign, which was created with the purpose to outline evidence that Trump, himself, had deep ties to Russia.

For hours on end, he sat alone at a table, peppered with questions about his personal and professional record, all in an effort to see if he would crack under the pressure.\n\nThe informal, but intrusive prep sessions are known as \"murder boards\" for their intensity, designed to simulate what the 49-year-old nominee to the Supreme Court will face in his Senate confirmation hearing starting Monday.\n\n\"He's a home run, he's smooth, he's going to go through great,\" said Thomas Dupree, a former Bush deputy assistant attorney general. \"The [opposing] senators will take their shots, but I think he's close to a lock.\"\n\nThe stakes are enormous, not only for the nominee but also for the man who selected him from a list of 21 potential candidates announced during the presidential campaign. Aides say President Trump hopes a successful confirmation will build momentum for his separate political agenda, and bring a measure of stability and public confidence to what has been a challenging two months in office.\n\nIn the broader realm, filling the seat left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia will ensure the high court keeps a shaky right-leaning majority. And having that fifth conservative vote will help guide the administration as it makes strategic decisions about which high-profile issues to pursue in court-- like immigration, the environment, transgender rights and expanded executive authority.\n\n\"It's important Democrats and Republicans not roll over on this pick,\" said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the left-leaning Constitutional Accountability Center. \"The American people want their justices to be an independent check even to the president nominating you, to follow the Constitution, not their own political values.\"\n\nGorsuch will face a mixed reception, as Republicans largely welcome the nominee and some Democrats look for a line of attack \u2013 though they\u2019ve been distracted lately by other battles over the GOP bid to replace ObamaCare and the president\u2019s disputed claims about \u201cwiretapping.\u201d With their attention elsewhere, Gorsuch has been preparing.\n\nAlong with his courtesy visits to more than 70 members of the Senate who will decide his fate, Gorsuch has prepared for the spotlight by reviewing his own record, and enduring those closely guarded mock hearings.\n\nThe private rehearsals were coordinated by the White House Counsel's Office, and included more than a dozen participants -- government lawyers, conservative academics, and some of his former law clerks. The goal is to anticipate every possible line of questioning and danger zone -- to give measured answers but not reveal too much.\n\nSources say Gorsuch has settled in being himself, avoiding unscripted responses that might provide the televised \"soundbite\" to derail what has so far been a flawless confirmation journey.\n\nAdministration officials are privately confident he will shine in the hearings.\n\nRepublicans point to Gorsuch's unanimous 2006 confirmation to his appeals court seat as a template to blunt any efforts to filibuster this time.\n\nSources expect him to repeat in the upcoming hearings what he said 11 years ago, about the kind of judge he considered unacceptable: \"Someone who is not willing to listen with an open mind to the arguments of counsel, to his colleagues, to precedent.\"", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/20/gorsuch-enters-high-stakes-confirmation-hearing-after-intensive-preparation.html"}, {"text": "Congressional Democrats and their media allies hope FBI Director James Comey will deliver a body blow to the Trump presidency by telling lawmakers Russia undermined the the 2016 presidential election and that President Trump\u2019s claim that President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower is groundless.\n\nBut Democrats also are worried that Comey, who testifies Monday, will make other statements that could severely undermine their efforts to destroy President Trump and possibly turn the tables on them.\n\nSince this will be a public hearing of the House Intelligence Committee, expect an endless series of self-righteous and preening questions by Democratic committee members on the wiretapping of Trump Tower charge. Democrats want this to be the lead story coming out of the hearing and will extract as many sound bites as possible of Comey debunking this charge for CNN, The New York Times and the Washington Post.\n\nDemocratic committee members will also press Comey on Russian interference in the 2016 election and contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russians but probably do not expect to learn anything new.\n\nWhat worries Democrats is what Comey may say about Obama administration surveillance of the Trump campaign.\n\nIt seems likely, given former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper\u2019s statement on March 5 that there is no evidence of any collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia, that Comey will make a similar statement. If he does and also confirms the Obama administration sought FISA warrants to surveil Trump campaign staff, the hearing could take a very bad turn for the Democrats.\n\nIt has been reported but not officially confirmed that two FISA warrants were requested in 2016 \u2013 last spring and in October \u2013 to use U.S. intelligence to investigate Trump campaign staff interactions with Russian officials. The spring \u201916 FISA warrant reportedly was denied.\n\nFISA warrants to employ U.S. intelligence agencies to spy on Americans are only issued to address dire national security threats.\n\nThe standard to issue such warrants against staff members of a presidential campaign from an opposing political party should have been even higher.\n\nIn light of Clapper\u2019s statement that no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians was found and the rash of anti-Trump intelligence leaks after the election, there are serious questions as to whether these warrants were sought by Obama officials to conduct fishing expeditions to find information to hurt Trump\u2019s presidential bid.\n\nThere also is the question of the leaking of NSA reports of Russian communications that \u201cincidentally\u201d mentioned Trump campaign officials, including retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn and possibly then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, now the attorney general. Is the FBI investigating these leaks? Were they part of a broad effort by the Obama administration to cull though NSA reports on Russian officials to find references to Trump campaign staff that they could leak to the news media?\n\nA related question: when NSA intercepts of foreign persons incidentally mention U.S. citizens, the names of the U.S. citizens are \u201cminimized\u201d with anonymous references. However, senior U.S. officials are permitted to ask NSA to reveal the names of Americans minimized in NSA reporting.\n\nOn March 15, 2017, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., and ranking member Adam Schiff, D-Calif., requested the names of Obama officials who sought the identities of Americans mentioned in intelligence reporting be \u201cde-minimized\u201d during the last seven months of the Obama administration. Will Comey tell the committee Monday which Obama officials requested that the names of Trump campaign aides mentioned in NSA reports be \u201cde-minimized?\u201d\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Democrats will try to use Comey\u2019s appearance before the committee to focus exclusively on the accuracy of President Trump\u2019s charge that President Obama ordered the bugging of Trump Tower.\n\nThis issue is a distraction. All members of the committee realize that if Comey states there is no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia and if he confirms that FISA warrants were requested, it\u2019s a whole new ball game.\n\nSuch statements by Comey could turn the focus of congressional investigations of possible Russian interference in the 2016 election to whether the Obama administration tried to interfere in the election by spying on the Trump campaign and whether Obama officials tried to hurt the Trump presidency by leaking classified information to the news media after the election.\n\nDemocrats thus desperately hope Comey will not repeat Clapper\u2019s statement about no evidence of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign and will not comment on possible FISA warrants \u2013 or at least not discuss these issues in an open hearing.\n\nFred Fleitz is senior vice president for policy and programs with the Center for Security Policy, a Washington, DC national security think tank.

The record in many ways mirrors the late Justice Antonin Scalia's approach to constitutional and statutory interpretation.\n\nAnd the Colorado native's flair for colorful opinion writing is much in the mold of Scalia, whose sharp pen and wicked wit delighted conservatives -\u2013 and whose seat Gorsuch would fill if confirmed.\n\nAs Gorsuch wrote in 2015, \"Ours is not supposed to be the government of the 'Hunger Games' with power centralized in one district, but a government of diffused and divided power, the better to prevent its abuse.\"\n\nThe issues he has confronted vary widely -- from libel to capital punishment to regulatory enforcement and tax subsidies. But the overall message remains consistent: less is more when it comes to interpreting the rule of law.\n\nPerhaps his highest-profile case while on the 10th Circuit \u2013 where Gorsuch has served for the past decade \u2013 was a 2013 concurrence supporting the right of for-profit, secular institutions (and individuals too, he argued) to oppose the Obama administration's mandate to provide contraceptives to their workers. Gorsuch affirmed his past ardent commitment to religious freedom against claims of government \"intrusion.\"\n\nIn the so-called \"Hobby Lobby\" case, the judge concluded, \"For some, religion provides an essential source of guidance both about what constitutes wrongful conduct and the degree to which those who assist others in committing wrongful conduct themselves bear moral culpability.\"\n\nGorsuch later supported the right of religious non-profits, like Catholic charities, to also challenge the contraceptive coverage mandate.\n\nThe Supreme Court later partially vindicated Gorsuch's views on both cases.\n\nSometimes, the judge's conservative bona fides collide, as in the case of a notorious Wyoming inmate.\n\nAndrew Yellowbear, a Native American who murdered his daughter, wanted to use an existing sweat lodge in the prison facility as part of his religious tradition. Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion that under a federal law, the inmate deserved that right, striking down the state's discretionary correctional policy.\n\nIt was a setback for law-and-order advocates.\n\n\"While those convicted of crime in our society lawfully forfeit a great many civil liberties,\" he concluded, \"Congress has instructed that the sincere exercise of religion should not be among them-- at least in the absence of a compelling reason. In this record we can find no reason like that.\"\n\nIn his questionnaire to lawmakers, the nominee said none of his own written opinions were ever reversed by the Supreme Court.\n\nOne of Gorsuch's off-the-bench remarks is generating some concern -- a 2005 opinion piece in \"National Journal,\" written shortly before he donned the judicial robes.\n\n\"American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom,\" he wrote, \"relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda on everything from gay marriage to assisted suicide to the use of vouchers for private-school education. This overweening addiction to the courtroom as the place to debate social policy is bad for the country and bad for the judiciary.\"\n\nAnd Gorsuch's 2006 book, \"The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia,\" has both worried and encouraged some fellow conservatives. His conclusion that the doctor-approved procedure was \"essentially a right to consensual homicide\" might be used by as a red flag by abortion rights activists and death penalty opponents as a parallel argument, even though Gorsuch made clear in the book it should not.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/20/take-look-through-neil-gorsuchs-judicial-record.html"}, {"text": "Judge Neil Gorsuch enters his Supreme Court confirming hearings Monday with legal credentials lauded by conservatives, but open to attack by liberals eager to undermine President Trump\u2019s pick for the high court. However, his personal and academic histories are widely admired across the political spectrum.\n\nTrump has described Gorsuch as \"perfect in almost every way\" for the high court.\n\nGorsuch, who goes before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday, is roundly described by colleagues and friends as a combination of wicked smarts, down-to-earth modesty, disarming warmth and careful deliberation.\n\nCritics largely agree. But they don't think he belongs on the court, saying he's too quick to side with conservative and business interests at the expense of working Americans and the poor.\n\nThe 49-year-old Gorsuch has already served more than 10 years as an appellate judge in Colorado, styling himself in the mold of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, the conservative powerhouse whom he would replace.\n\nGorsuch is known for his plainly written opinions and his approach as a \"textualist\" who sticks within the boundaries of established law and precedent.\n\nBut some of his rulings and outside writings have led critics to say he tends to favor powerful interests over ordinary Americans.\n\nThey cite the case of a truck driver fired for leaving his trailer of meat on the side of an Illinois road after breaking down on a frigid night in 2009, fearing he'd freeze to death.\n\nAmong their other concerns is Gorsuch\u2019s view on assisted suicide and euthanasia. He made clear in his 2006 book and other writings that he's not a fan.\n\nDoctors, insurance companies and the healthiest in society, he argues, might wind up looking for ways to shorten the lives of the frail and the elderly to preserve resources for those with more promising futures.\n\nHis views on other controversial subjects, such as how widely the Second Amendment applies or whether abortion should be legal, are less known.\n\nGorsuch has not had a lot to say about abortion, either in his book or as a federal appeals court judge. However, he noted in the book that in the seminal Supreme Court abortion decision, Roe v. Wade, \"a fetus does not qualify as a person.\"\n\nStill, Gorsuch has academic credentials nearly beyond reproach, having attended Columbia University, Harvard Law School and Oxford University.\n\nIn his writings and lectures, Gorsuch presents himself as a \"workaday judge,\" one wearing \"honest, unadorned black polyester\" robes from a uniform supply store.\n\nHe is described as the dad whose standing birthday present from his family is an agreement to watch a Western with him.\n\nHe's the sports nut who jogs with his law clerks, teaches them the Zen of fly fishing and waits at the top of the ski slopes to see which of them he'll need to help up after a fall.\n\n\"He's someone who knows the names of the security guards at the courthouse and gets to know who their families are,\" says former law clerk Theresa Wardon.\n\nLuis Reyes, a former Gorsuch colleague at the Justice Department, says he \u201ca glass-half-full kind of guy.\"\n\nFrom his boyhood in Colorado, Gorsuch was a dutiful student, \"always on the brainy side,\" says younger brother J.J. Gorsuch.\n\nTheirs was a typical Western childhood, filled with family outings to go hiking, skiing and fishing.\n\nHe attended Georgetown Prep, an all-boys school in suburban Washington, after President Ronald Reagan chose his mother, Anne Gorsuch, a state legislator, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nShe brought her three children east while her husband stayed in Colorado, as their marriage dissolved.\n\nGorsuch's friends at the Jesuit high school included Bill Hughes, whose father was a Democratic congressman from New Jersey.\n\nBoth felt pressure to protect his family name.\n\n\"We were all very cognizant of the responsibility we had to our parents not to screw up,\" Hughes remembers.\n\nGorsuch led schoolmates to the Capitol to attend a rally for insurgents opposing the Soviet Army in Afghanistan. His yearbook entry includes a joking reference to founding the \"Fascism Forever\" club, a dig at left-leaning teachers.\n\nMost significant, he watched his mother's stormy 22-month tenure at EPA end with her forced resignation after being cited for contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over subpoenaed documents.\n\nAfter high school, Gorsuch was in and out of Columbia in three years, though still found time to co-found a conservative newspaper and magazine.\n\nHe then went to Harvard Law without a break, before going off to Oxford to study legal philosophy, ducking out in the middle for a clerkship with Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy.\n\nIn 1995, Gorsuch passed up job offers from big firms to work for a start-up, diving into \"the muck and mess of real-life litigation,\" representing both plaintiffs and defendants, recalls former partner Mark Hansen.\n\nHe credits Gorsuch with a dogged work ethic -- billing an average 2,400-3,000 hours a year as partner -- but also an easygoing temperament.\n\nAfter a decade in private practice, Gorsuch in 2005 joined the Justice Department, where he was deeply involved in lawsuits and legislative proposals supporting the George W. Bush administration's warrantless wiretapping program and its treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere.\n\nFrom Justice, Gorsuch made a quick leap to the judiciary when Bush nominated him in 2006 for the 10th Circuit, a lifetime appointment and chance to get back to Colorado.\n\nFox News\u2019 Bill Mears and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/20/who-is-neil-gorsuch.html"}, {"text": "I was watching President Trump during a press availability after he met with GOP leaders on the health care bill, when he said this:\n\n\u201cFake news\u2014I watch, I say that\u2019s not the bill we\u2019re passing\u2026\n\n\u201cObamaCare is dead.

The man is a constant newsmaking machine without an off button.\n\nThis in my view is a mixed bag. His in-your-face style is what got him elected, but he also talks and tweets his way into trouble.\n\nBut the Washington Post thinks this is a problem. Leading off with Trump at a Nashville rally, attacking the \u201cterrible ruling\u201d by a judge who blocked his revised travel ban, the paper says:\n\n\u201cThe episode was just one of numerous examples of Trump and his advisers pushing incendiary language and unfounded claims, even in the face of opposition from federal judges and top lawmakers of both parties\u2026\n\n\u201cTrump boosters say his freewheeling rhetoric, in person and on social media, is a large part of his appeal and has kept him in good stead with his political base.

He\u2019s had two weeks of extreme controversy over his unproven claim that Barack Obama had him wiretapped or surveilled during the campaign\u2014an issue that simply wouldn\u2019t exist if not for a series of Saturday morning tweets.\n\nBut a fundamental part of Trump\u2019s connection to his base is his regular-guy talk. They don\u2019t care if he sometimes misstates facts, and believe the media are constantly nitpicking in an effort to undermine him.\n\nThe result is two sharply clashing portraits. The mainstream media are depicting the president\u2019s opening weeks as a stumbling debut full of mistakes and self-inflicted wounds. His supporters see an outsider who just got to Washington and is trying to shake things up on everything from immigration to budget cuts.\n\nWith so much noise on the other side, it\u2019s no wonder Trump is constantly using his giant megaphone.\n\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

His background and character are unimpeachable.\n\nThe non-partisan American Bar Association has given him its highest possible rating. Even the Senator leading the charge against his nomination, Minority Leader Charles Schumer, has described Judge Gorsuch as \u201cclearly very smart, articulate and polite, with superb judicial demeanor.\u201d\n\nJudge Gorsuch is also uniquely positioned to succeed the irreplaceable Justice Antonin Scalia. Like Justice Scalia, Judge Gorsuch believes in the rule of law, not judge-made law. He believes that the judiciary is vested only with the power to interpret statues, not create them. As Justice Scalia wrote, this distinction is critical because it determines who governs: an unelected committee of judges with life tenure or the people\u2019s representatives.\n\nThe last four nominees to the Supreme Court have all been confirmed by comfortable margins. And since the balance of the Court will not change by the addition of Judge Gorsuch, he normally would sail through a confirmation hearing.\n\nThis political season is anything but normal, however. The Democrats are still smarting over their unforeseen loss of the presidency and over Judge Merrick Garland\u2019s failed nomination. They\u2019ve already worked publically to discredit Judge Gorsuch and have even previewed their attack on the nominee.\n\nJust last week, Senator Schumer took the unprecedented step of holding a pre-hearing press conference to attack the nominee. Judge Gorsuch, Senator Schumer claimed, \u201charbors a right-wing, pro-corporate, special-interest agenda.\u201d He accused the Judge of being in the pocket of billionaires and siding with corporate interests at the expense of the every man.\n\nSenator Schumer has a big imagination. Judge Gorsuch\u2019s record speaks for itself. But sadly, the Senator\u2019s comments are par for the course.\n\nIt was not so long ago that America was first introduced to another nominee, Chief Justice John G. Roberts. As a young attorney, I had the honor of helping him prepare, in a very small way, for those hearings. I can remember like it was yesterday sitting in the hearing room, as senator after senator tried to discredit then-Judge Roberts. I can remember the sharply worded questions, the insinuation that he, too, was all about big business, the attempted repudiation of his decades-worth of public service. (None of this was successful, of course.)\n\nI also remember a photo that was splashed across the front pages of the newspapers. The soon-to-be Chief Justice was looking out from behind the half-closed doors of a mini-van. This was obviously not a planned photo-op, and yet, the American people loved that picture. From it, they could see that this highly qualified, erudite, and well-spoken judge was also human. He was a husband. He was a father. And, yes, on occasion he drove a minivan.\n\nThe American people can and should be concerned about Judge Gorsuch\u2019s judicial philosophy. The way a judge thinks about judging matters. Is he or she someone who feels constrained by the words Congress has written? What about the Constitution? Is he or she a believer in original meaning of someone who believes that the Constitution is living, evolving even?\n\nDuring their press conference, Democrats complained bitterly about Judge Gorsuch\u2019s failure specifically to answer their many questions. But Senator Schumer should know better. He is no newcomer to Supreme Court nominations, having served on the Judiciary Committee for years. As such, he is very familiar with the so-called \u201cGinsburg Rule.\u201d This rule preserves judicial impartiality by preventing judicial nominees from commenting on potential issues. As then-Senate Judiciary Chairmen Joe Biden explained at the beginning of Justice Ginsburg\u2019s hearing, a nominee must not comment about \u201cany specific case that may come before her.\u201d\n\nJustice Ginsburg also clearly indicated that she would not comment on potential matters in her introductory statement:\n\nA judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no forecast, no hints for that would show not only disregard for the specifics of the particular case, it would display disdain for the entire judicial process.\n\nJustice Ginsburg made good on that promise. She deflected well over thirty questions from senators on both sides of the aisle on issues ranging from the First Amendment, to the death penalty, to Roe v. Wade, to the Speech and Debate Clause, to antitrust law. She reminded the senators that asking for a signal on a potential case \u201cis something you must never ask a judge to do.\u201d Every nominee to follow has invoked the \u201cGinsburg Rule\u201d and refrained from answering questions that implicate issues that might come before the Supreme Court.\n\nThe high theatre of a Supreme Court confirmation hearing is about to commence. When the senators doggedly insist upon more fulsome answers to questions\u2014and they will\u2014keep in mind that their questions may violate the Ginsburg Rule.\n\nOne hopes that the hearings will be civil. But if they are not, and all indications suggest that Democrats have no intention of making them so, it is worth remembering that Judge Gorsuch is also a husband, father, and son. The senators must do their due diligence, but as anyone with a toddler knows (I\u2019ve got two), the tone matters.\n\nIn a country so divided, the last thing people want to see is politics as usual. Indeed, Supreme Court nomination hearings should be the epitome of civility. They should be a learning opportunity for the American people.

The filibuster became a symbol of Republican obstructionism, and had to be stopped.\n\nThus, in 2013, the Democrats used the \u201cnuclear option,\u201d voting to change the rules for the President\u2019s nominees, and in essence ending the filibuster by requiring only a simple majority. President Obama himself suggested that the move was necessary because Republicans had used the filibuster as \"a reckless and relentless tool to grind all business to a halt.\" President Obama added that while \"neither party has been blameless... today's pattern of obstruction, it just isn't normal. It's not what our Founders envisioned.\"\n\nThen the Democrats lost the Senate. And changed their minds. Again. Now once more they warn the GOP against invoking the nuclear option.\n\n\u201cIf a nominee cannot get 60 votes, you don\u2019t change the rules, you change the nominee,\u201d Schumer said.\n\nIt's not the only time hypocrisy found its way into recent Supreme Court debate, critics believe.\n\nWhen Justice Antonin Scalia died in 2016, Democrats insisted his slot on the Supreme Court be filled as quickly as possible. In a statement at the time, Reid suggested that \"failing to fill this vacancy would be a shameful abdication of one of the Senate\u2019s most essential constitutional responsibilities.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland, but Republicans, under Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, declared there would be no vote for a nominee so late in the President\u2019s term. The Senate, he said, would wait until the country had decided on a new leader to make the pick.\n\nIt was a big risk for the GOP, especially with Hillary Clinton leading in the polls. But it seemed to pay off for the GOP when Donald Trump was elected, and then picked Neil Gorsuch.\n\nDemocrats were outraged by the tactic. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-D-Mas.., said in a tweet that the Republicans were betraying \"the duties they swore to uphold.\" She also wrote it would \"threaten both the Constitution and our democracy itself.\"\n\nHowever, no Democrat should have been surprised\u2014especially Schumer.\n\nIn 2007, with the Democrats having recently regained the majority, Schumer said, regarding potential Supreme Court nominees \u201cwe should reverse the presumption of confirmation.\u201d In fact, in the same speech, he regretted not having blocked Bush\u2019s previous nominations. President Bush didn\u2019t get the chance to nominate another Supreme Court Justice, but the Democrats appeared more than ready to block anyone if he did.\n\nSo today, with yet another nomination in front of him, critics are looking for Schumer to do whatever he can to stop Gorsuch, even if it means taking yet another position on the filibuster.\n\nIf so, Republicans may invoke the \"nuclear option,\" and change the rules so that a simple majority can confirm a Supreme Court nominee.

Learning must be more than just content. When we engage students with project-based learning, students not only learn math and science, they apply math and science.\n\nProject-based learning helps students see the relevancy of science and math to their lives and inspires them to pursue it. Instead of simply teaching content, our goal should be that students can apply their skills in situations outside the classroom. Not only can this build the abilities within our country\u2019s next generation to meet the skills gap in our job market, but it can also excite an entire generation of students.\n\nInstead of becoming distracted by politics, DeVos should focus on putting first things first for the education of our students.

Only thing is, they won\u2019t happen. It\u2019s a foregone conclusion that he\u2019ll take his seat as the ninth member of the Supreme Court on the first Monday next October.\n\nUnless another member of the Court falls under a bus between now and then.\n\nLiberal opposition research groups are struggling mightily to find ammunition to lodge at Gorsuch. They won\u2019t come up with much that we haven\u2019t heard already, and that\u2019s not been anything of note.\n\nHere\u2019s the worst of it. He studied at Oxford University under John Finnis and wrote a thesis on euthanasia for him. Finnis is a natural lawyer who believes that law\u2019s legitimacy derives from its adherence to rational principles about justice, which in turn can be understood by deliberating about common principles of humanity.\n\nThat\u2019s what natural law means, and Jeremy Bentham called it \"nonsense of stilts.\" That seems right to me.\n\nAmongst the people I know, natural law theories have been taken up by conservatives who pick their philosophies according to how they advance their political agenda. It\u2019s like saying, \u201cI\u2019m right-wing so I should like Christian rock.\u201d It\u2019s really just about politics. It\u2019s what happens when pundits and law professors pretend they\u2019re philosophers.\n\nYou can also be skeptical, as Blaise Pascal was, about whether you\u2019d find anything very uplifting in examining how people behave. We\u2019re no angels. Which is something James Madison and the other Framers of our Constitution well understood. They weren\u2019t natural lawyers.\n\nAll this sounds like an issue that only legal philosophers would care about. Except for one thing. If you can derive a principled objection to euthanasia from natural law, as Gorsuch did in his book, that\u2019s going to bother the right-to-die crowd. And then there\u2019s the slippery slope.\n\nIf Gorsuch thinks mercy killing wrong, what about abortion, same-sex marriage and all of the other causes prized by the left? Nothing in Gorsuch\u2019s book spoke to them, but for the lifestyle liberals who have captured the soul of the Democratic Party those are the issues that matter. Not jobs, just transgender bathrooms.\n\nGorsuch is going to be asked how he\u2019d rule on these issues. Problem is, those are easy questions for a nominee to deflect. All you have to do is pull a Ginsburg.\n\nIn other words, the nominee needn\u2019t\u2014and shouldn\u2019t\u2014answer questions about how he would vote in future cases. He shouldn\u2019t tie himself down before he\u2019s read the briefs and heard the arguments.\n\nIf he announces in advance that he\u2019s made up his mind, that arguments can\u2019t move him, he should recuse himself from deciding on the case. That\u2019s what Ruth Bader Ginsburg said when she was up for confirmation. Made sense then, and it makes sense now.\n\nSo the questions will turn to a more abstract, a more philosophical level. Anything you can do, I can do meta.\n\nGorsuch is going to be asked whether he\u2019d decide cases according to his understanding of natural law, and pray tell just what does that mean to him about when life begins and might end.\n\nOnce again, however, Gorsuch has an easy out. What he\u2019ll say, and what I think he believes, is that a judge should confine himself to the rules explicitly set forth in our constitution, legislation and case law, and to the principles implicit therein. There are foundational ideals in America law, and while some of them overlap with natural law doctrines, they\u2019re to be followed because they\u2019ve been incorporated into our law and not because some philosopher voiced them.\n\nThe reason why I think that\u2019s what Gorsuch believes is because he\u2019s made clear his deep admiration for Justice Scalia. And Scalia was a textualist who didn\u2019t think the Supreme Court should be a roving commission sent to search for principles of justice from sources other than well-recognized legal doctrines. That\u2019s pretty much what Justice Kagan said when she was up for confirmation, and Neil Gorsuch should take a page from her.\n\nJustices Ginsburg and Kagan are justly well-respected judges. So is Merrick Garland. It says something about Gorsuch that, when he heard he had been chosen by the president, his first phone call was to Judge Garland. But elections have consequences, as someone once said. Like the president, Gorsuch is a conservative, even as Ginsburg and Kagan are liberals.\n\nScalia was a conservative as well. Some argue that Gorsuch should be confirmed because he\u2019s stepping into Scalia\u2019s seat.\n\nNonsense. Conservatives don\u2019t have ownership of a seat on the Court, any more than liberals had ownership of a Massachusetts Senate seat when Ted Kennedy died.\n\nThere\u2019s another reason why liberals won\u2019t want to accept the argument that conservatives are entitled to a Scalia seat on the Court. It\u2019s because this is the fight that matters, the one that will determine whether a Court now split 4-4 between conservatives and liberals on most issues will become a 5-4 Court dominated by conservatives. And that in turn will decide whether the executive branch will be permitted to wrestle its foreign policies and its travel ban from the judicial branch of government.\n\nF.H.

They are. However, in an era when we are as divided as ever before as a nation, nearly all of these important issues will inevitably be decided in the courts \u2013 not by Congress.\n\nIn fact, President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court Justice nominee, Neil Gorsuch echoed this very sentiment in a National Review article he wrote over a decade ago: \u201cAmerican liberals have become addicted to the courtroom, relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda on everything from gay marriage to assisted suicide to the use of vouchers for private-school education.\u201d\n\nPretty compelling words from the likely future Justice. But just in case wiretaps, twitter feeds, or Kellyanne Conway sitting on a sofa have clouded our collective brains since election day, allow me to remind you what\u2019s at stake.\n\nOn the one side we have originalist judges: those who believe in exercising judicial restraint by honoring the original intent of our Framers. On the other, we have judicial activists: those who believe in redefining the words of the Constitution, often deriving policies and de facto laws in the process. The former applies deference to Congress as the primary source of social and economic policy. The later applies deference to itself.\n\nThe late Justice Antonin Scalia defined \"originalism\" this way: \"The Constitution that I interpret and apply is not living but dead, or as I prefer to call it, enduring. It means today not what current society, much less the court, thinks it ought to mean, but what it meant when it was adopted.\"\n\nSo why is it so important to have originalist judges? Because activist judges regularly obstruct the will of we the people by distorting what the Constitution says to suit their own agendas.\n\nTake for example the landmark decision of Roe v. Wade which infamously legalized abortion. What\u2019s less well known, is that before the ruling, elected governments in 46 states had prohibited abortion either at the ballot box or through legislation. Only four states had legalized abortion. In his dissenting opinion, Justice William Rehnquist slammed the activist ruling, stating, \u201cTo reach its result the Court necessarily has had to find within the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment a right that was apparently completely unknown to the drafters of the Amendment.\u201d In other words, the court created policy by twisting the original intent of the Constitution, effectively overruling the will of the people in 46 states.\n\nWhile Judge Gorsuch has not ruled on abortion directly, his position on the sanctity of life is clearly articulated in his 2009 book \u201cThe Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia.\u201d In reference to Roe v. Wade, Gorsuch maintains that there is \u201cno Constitutional basis\u201d for giving a mother more rights than her unborn child. Gorsuch\u2019s view stands in stark contrast to the legal rationale used by the majority opinion in the suit.\n\nOn other issues important to Evangelicals, Neil Gorsuch continues to shine. In fact, many of his most high-profile opinions have been in defense of religious freedom. He upheld Hobby Lobby\u2019s objection to Obamacare\u2019s contraceptive mandate, which required for-profit organizations like Hobby Lobby to provide contraceptives to its employees even when this went against the organization\u2019s sincerely held religious beliefs. He similarly defended Little Sisters of the Poor when it too objected to the contraceptive mandate of Obamacare.\n\nIf all of this comes as a breath of fresh air, you\u2019re not alone. President Trump told the American people that he would nominate a Supreme Court Justice in the mold of Antonin Scalia. In Judge Gorsuch, a strict originalist, he has succeeded marvelously and honored his promise to Evangelicals. In turn, we Evangelicals must speak up and keep unrelenting pressure on the Senate to move swiftly to confirm this highly qualified nominee.\n\nAnd if Washington\u2019s daily media circus still has you distracted, just ask yourself this: What kind of judge would Hillary Clinton have nominated?\n\nDr. David Jeremiah is among the best known Christian leaders in the world.

This low scoring is not a new trend \u2014 from 2011 to 2016, our global rank has ranged from a high of 34 to a low of 58.\n\nIt\u2019s evident that change in America\u2019s education system is needed. But as Sec. DeVos works to reform education policy, and the minutiae of her every move is debated by the American public, one thing we should all be able to agree upon is that the education of minority and low income students in America cannot be an afterthought. Should we continue to ignore this issue, our country is likely to pay a high price.\n\nTake a short overview of the educational realities of Hispanics, for example.\n\nAt 56.6 million strong, Hispanics are the largest and fastest growing minority in the U.S. According to Pew Research, one in four babies born in America today is Hispanic, and The Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics projects that by 2050 Hispanic children will constitute approximately one third of all American children. When it comes to school participation, Hispanic public school enrollment has increased by 25 percent in the past decade-and-a-half, while enrollment for white and African American students has decreased and is projected to continue decreasing. The National Center for Education Statistics also estimates that, currently, one out of five high school graduates is Hispanic and that, in less than a decade, this could become one out of three.\n\nYet, despite this exponential growth and recent positive strides in retention and enrollment, clear disparities still exist for Hispanics in the classroom.\n\nAt 12 percent, Hispanics still retain the highest dropout rate in the nation. And although their enrollment keeps increasing, their academic achievement in subjects like reading and mathematics has remained basically unchanged for the past two decades. By grade four, only 26 percent of Hispanic students are proficient in math and 21 percent in reading; by senior year, only 12 percent are proficient in math and 25 percent in reading. Of those who reach high school graduation,only one in four is college prepared, and less than half of those who make it to college graduate.\n\nFor African Americans \u2014 another group that has lagged in enrollment and academic achievement \u2014 some of these statistics are bleaker still: only 7 percent of African American high school seniors are proficient in math, and one in 10 is college prepared.\n\nEducation is the responsibility of all community stakeholders. It\u2019s the responsibility of all of us. We all need to work together to craft a vision that truly - finally - leaves no child behind and ensures every student succeeds.\n\nIn a few decades, the United States will become more diverse, with the combined population of Hispanics, African Americans, Asian and mixed-race students representing the majority. It is high time every child in America \u2014 regardless of race, income or zip code \u2014 has access to high-quality, equal-opportunity in education.\n\nSecretary DeVos must make marginalized children her first priority.\n\nDr. Andrea Ramirez is the executive director of the Faith and Education Coalition, an initiative of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference (NHCLC). With 2,568 members representing almost 3,000 local churches in 44 states, the Faith and Education Coalition advocates for high-quality education options for all of America\u2019s children. www.faithandeducation.com", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/03/18/secretary-devos-should-make-education-minority-children-her-no-1-priority.html"}, {"text": "An unidentified person was apprehended Saturday jumping a barrier in front of the White House, resulting in a full lockdown of the complex.\n\nThe incident occurred at about 12:45 p.m. on the front side of the White House, along Pennsylvania Avenue.

Mulvaney declared that he and President Trump were engineering an \u201cAmerica First\u201d budget that would not be \u201cadding to the deficit.\u201d He declared that the \u201ctopline defense number is the largest in history.\u201d Mulvaney then indicated that Trump would spend \u201c$603 billion\u201d on defense programs and \u201c$462 billion\u201d on \u201cnon-defense.\u201d\n\nThat means Congress would cough up a total of $1.065 trillion in \u201cdiscretionary\u201d spending. But when it came to \u201cmandatory\u201d spending, the budget director told reporters, \u201cthat won\u2019t come until May.\u201d\n\nMulvaney argued the prototype \u201cwasn\u2019t a full-blown budget.\u201d His pecuniary jabberwocky doesn\u2019t mean much to most Americans. But let\u2019s decrypt the code.\n\nThink of a big pie totaling around $4 trillion. The $4 trillion pie represents each dollar the federal government spends on every single program imaginable. This pie is the true federal budget. Trump and Mulvaney still haven\u2019t cobbled together that package yet.\n\nThen bring out a knife and slice the pie into two sections. One slice comprises about 69 percent of the pie, or a little more than two-thirds. That\u2019s known as \u201cmandatory spending.\u201d\n\nMandatory spending isn\u2019t mandatory, per se. It\u2019s simply money Congress put on auto-pilot long ago. It flows out the door without lawmakers flagging any of it. Mandatory spending covers Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and interest on the debt. Congress could certainly reclaim that huge slice of the pie if lawmakers wanted. But they haven\u2019t -- yet.\n\nThe second piece of the pie is trickier. This is discretionary spending. This is the blueprint Mulvaney released two weeks ago. He amplified it Thursday with more specific spending targets for a variety of agencies and departments.\n\nTake the discretionary spending chunk and convert it into its own, standalone, second pie. Then divide that pie into 12 uneven pieces. Each piece represents one of the 12 appropriations or spending bills which fund the government each year.\n\nA failure to approve any of those bills in Congress and secure the President\u2019s signature prompts a government shutdown.\n\nThe size of last year\u2019s discretionary spending pie was $1.070 trillion. Defense consumed nearly half of the pie. Other pieces were smaller. The Agriculture appropriations bill came in at $21.8 billon. The Interior appropriations bill clocked in at $32 billion. Legislative branch was $4.4 billion. State/Foreign operations was $37.8 billion.\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nThe State Department and Environmental Protection Agency took a whack under Trump\u2019s blueprint, losing about a third of its funding. On life support is the National Endowment for the Arts and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n\nMulvaney says cuts will come from 11 of the 12 spending bills to increase the size of the military slice.\n\nThere\u2019s an appropriations bill called Military Construction/VA. It funds the Department of Veterans Affairs and last year cost $79.9 billion.\n\nLawmakers won\u2019t trim much there because it looks bad to ding veterans. How about Homeland Security? $41 billion last year. Well, Trump wants more money for the border patrol and customs/immigration officials.\n\nSo, to make up the extra $54 billion, he wants to divert to the Pentagon slice of the pie, cuts could come from the remaining nine slices, not 11 \u2013 excluding Military Construction/VA and Homeland Security.\n\nTherein lies the problem.\n\nThe House struggled last year to find enough votes to pass appropriations bills. The reason? Conservatives and members of the Freedom Caucus thought some spending bills cost too much. Moderate and \u201cmainstream\u201d Republicans argued the bills didn\u2019t spend enough.\n\nSo the GOP lost votes at the margins. Help from Democrats? Forget it. They didn\u2019t like anything they saw. As things now stand in the House, the GOP can only lose 22 votes before the leadership can\u2019t pass a bill on its own. How about the Senate? Well, senators need 60 votes to call up appropriations bills and shut off debate. Very hard when Republicans only have 52 yeas in the Senate.\n\nThe House GOP brass yanked several appropriations bills off the floor last year. The Financial Services Appropriations bill flat-out failed on a floor vote.\n\nThe problem is that Republicans need to fund things besides the military. The size of the non-defense spending bills could be too puny to sustain large reductions.\n\nRep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, is a senior member of the Appropriations Committee and is what is called a \u201ccardinal.\u201d That means Simpson is the chairman of one of the appropriations subcommittees: the Energy and Water panel.\n\nLawmakers refer to colleagues like Simpson as a cardinal because of the \u201cdivinity\u201d or \u201ceminence\u201d they wield over their section of spending.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can pass any of the bills,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cYou can\u2019t get there from here.\u201d\n\nGrowing the Pentagon budget is good politically. But it may not be practicable.\n\n\u201cA lot of members have interest in these programs,\u201d Simpson continued. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more to our government than defense.\u201d\n\nCould Trump be picking a fight with Capitol Hill so he has a foil?\n\n\u201cSetting up Congress? Hell, every president does that. \u2018It\u2019s the damn House!\u2019\u201d Simpson exclaimed.\n\nIs the Senate able to stomach a measure slashing diplomatic funding?\n\n\u201cProbably not,\u201d predicted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. \u201cI think the diplomatic part of the budget is important and a lot cheaper than the results you get on the defense side.\u201d\n\nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, a California Republican, fretted: \u201cI am very concerned that deep cuts to our diplomacy will hurt efforts to combat terrorism, distribute critical humanitarian aid and promote opportunities for American workers,\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, predicated Democrats and Republicans alike will \u201crun away.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already cut EPA,\u201d said Rep. Mark Amodei, a Nevada Republican and a member of the Appropriations Committee. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be on our mind when it comes to cutting more.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s budget pruned grants for federal housing programs that assist the elderly and poor. That could make it hard for Congress to OK the Transportation, Housing, Urban Development & Related Agencies spending bill, piloted by cardinal and Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla.\n\nPennsylvania GOP Rep. Charlie Dent, the chairman -- or cardinal -- of the Military Construction/VA panel predicted: \u201cThe budget in this form will make it very difficult to pass many appropriations bills.\u201d\n\nAll of these cuts are from the smaller pie, with none from entitlement spending like Medicare and Medicaid, far and away the biggest drivers of the debt.\n\nMulvaney promises a look at that in May.\n\n\u201cWe targeted programs that sound great but that don\u2019t work,\u201d said Mulvaney in an interview Thursday with on Fox News \u201cSpecial Report\u201d host Bret Baier. \u201cThese are programs that sound great. Many of them Democrat programs.\n\nMany of them 30 years. They\u2019ve never been reviewed in a long time or when they\u2019re reviewed, they\u2019re just not producing any results.\u201d\n\nSome conservatives embraced the spending outline. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, is happy about filleting the State Department\u2019s allocation.\n\n\u201cThey were promoting an LBGT agenda,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe went to African countries, telling them, \u2018Yes, we will help you with Boko Haram if you change the law in your country and allow same-sex marriage and pay for abortion.\u2019 \u201d\n\nGOP Defense hawks like House Armed Services Committee Chairman Rep. Mac Thornberry, Texas, and Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, Arizona, still want more for the Pentagon. They\u2019d like as much as $640 billion to go toward defense programs.\n\nBut Dent noted that regardless of what the president and Mulvaney request, it\u2019s just that. A request.\n\n\u201cThe president proposes. The Congress disposes,\u201d he said. \u201cCongress will write the appropriations bills.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the House and Senate do it a different way, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cWe would be happy to negotiate with them.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the secret. Members of Congress -- even Republican members of Congress -- will attempt to craft the 12 appropriations bills in a way that can pass.\n\nHouse Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., will design a discretionary spending allotment (the smaller pie) known as a \u201c302(a).\u201d\n\nHe will then dice the pie into its 12 pieces for each subcommittee. The individual pieces are called \u201c302(b)\u2019s.\u201d Then subcommittee chairmen like Simpson, Dent and Diaz-Balart hope to write bills in a way they can pass.\n\nThe question is whether Trump would sign bulkier bills into law. This could spark a remarkable standoff between the Republican president and members of his own party -- especially if GOP members can\u2019t agree on the size of each bill.\n\nThe president touts his negotiation skills. Mulvaney says the administration is willing to talk. There\u2019s a lot of speculation on Capitol Hill that these budget outlines are merely opening bids.\n\nHere\u2019s the key takeaway: Mulvaney\u2019s two budget proposals aren\u2019t binding. The word \u201cbudget\u201d is a malleable term in the federal spending lexicon.\n\nCongress never adopts the budget a president sends to Capitol Hill. If and when the House and Senate approve a budget (the big pie), that is only a resolution, not a binding law. The president does not sign a \u201cbudget.\u201d\n\nWhat the president must sign are the 12 annual appropriations bills that comprise the smaller pie. Otherwise, there\u2019s a government shutdown.\n\nSo these are the words that help explain the numbers. Budgets are wish-lists. Consider that when the president wants to slash art funding, Meals on Wheels or bolster the military. It\u2019s just an ambition.\n\nWhat counts are appropriations and 12 pieces of the smaller pie. Appropriations are real. And we\u2019ll see how much the president is willing to negotiate on those.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/18/in-trump-s-1-065-trillion-budget-details-are-more-in-words-than-numbers.html"}, {"text": "The Trump administration wants to build a 30-foot-high border wall that looks good from the north side and is difficult to climb or cut through, according to a pair of contract notices posted to a government website further detailing President Donald Trump's promise to build a \"big, beautiful wall\" at the Mexican border.\n\nThe notices were made public late Friday by Customs and Border Protection, the Homeland Security Department agency that will oversee the project and eventually patrol and maintain the wall. The proposals are due to the government by March 29.\n\nOne of the CBP contract requests calls for a solid concrete wall, while the other asks for proposals for a see-through structure. Both require the wall to sunk at least six feet into the ground and include 25- and 50-foot automated gates for pedestrians and vehicles. The proposed wall must also be built in a such a way that it would take at least an hour to cut through it with a \"sledgehammer, car jack, pick axe, chisel, battery operated impact tools, battery operated cutting tools, Oxy/acetylene torch or other similar hand-held tools.\"\n\nThe government will award a contract based on 30-foot-wide sample walls that are to be built in San Diego.\n\nThis is the second time the Trump administration has asked for private companies to bid on building the wall. Last month CPB put out a call for \"concept papers\" to design and build prototypes by March 10.\n\nTrump has bragged in recent days that the wall is ahead of schedule, though it's unclear from the latest contract notices if any firms have submitted wall proposals or if any such submissions have been rejected.\n\nThe government has not said where the wall will be built, though the contract notices suggest some pieces of a new wall could replace existing fencing that stretches over about 700 miles of the roughly 2,000-mile border. The current fencing of mixed construction, including 15-foot steel posts set inches apart that are designed to keep people from crossing and shorter posts that are intended to block cars. Border Patrol agents are constantly repairing holes in the structure.\n\nTrump has long promised that Mexico would pay for the wall, which he has said is necessary to stop the flow of immigrants crossing the border illegally and drug smugglers.\n\nThis week the president sent a budget proposal to Congress that included a $2.6 billion down payment for the wall. The total cost for the project is unclear, but the Government Accountability Office estimates it would cost about $6.5 million a mile for fence to keep pedestrians from crossing the border and about $1.8 million a mile for a vehicle barrier.\n\nCongressional Republicans have said Trump's wall would cost between $12 billion and $15 billion and Trump has suggested $12 billion.\n\nAn internal report prepared for Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly estimated the cost of building a wall along the entire U.S.-Mexico border at about $21 billion, according to a U.S. government official who is involved in border issues. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the report has not been made public.\n\nThat report proposed an initial phase that would extend fences 26 miles and a second wave that would add 151 miles, plus 272 \"replacement\" miles where fences are already installed, according to the official. Those two phases would cost $5 billion.\n\nIt is unclear how soon Congress might act on that request or how much money lawmakers will ultimately approve for the wall. Democrats and some Republicans have said a border-long wall is unnecessary.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security reported earlier this month that the number of border arrests dropped about 44 percent from January to February, the lowest monthly tallies since at the least the start of the 2012 budget year.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/18/trump-wants-to-build-30-foot-high-wall-at-mexican-border.html"}, {"text": "The Justice Department is asking the federal judge in Hawaii who temporarily halted President Trump\u2019s new travel ban to limit the scope of his ruling so that the United States can immediately stop taking in refugees worldwide.\n\nJustice Department attorneys argued in a motion Friday that U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson's temporary restraining order was essentially based on the argument that the ban appears to unconstitutionally target Muslims.\n\nSo his ruling should be limited to the part of Trump\u2019s March 6 executive order that temporarily bans visas to travel from six mostly-Muslim countries into the U.S., not the temporary refugees ban, they say.\n\nThe attorneys essentially want Watson\u2019s ruling to be in line with a federal judge's ruling in Maryland on Thursday that temporarily halts the travel ban.\n\nU.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang cited earlier Trump statements and said the purpose of the new executive order \"remains the realization of the long-envisioned Muslim ban.\" However, he declined to issue an injunction blocking the entire executive order.\n\nSince Watson\u2019s federal ruling went further than the Maryland judge\u2019s, his ruling has the most impact on the president's intended actions.

Experts say it could have a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the U.S. within a few years.\n\nChina has stridently opposed the deployment of a U.S. missile defense system to South Korea, saying its X-band radar can peer deep into China to monitor flights and rocket launches. The U.S. says it's a system focused on North Korea. China sees it as a threat to its own security.\n\nTillerson's visit to Beijing is the final stop on his three-nation swing through Northeast Asia, which began in Japan. State Department officials have described it as a \"listening tour\" as the administration seeks a coherent North Korea policy, well-coordinated with its Asian partners.\n\nIn Beijing, he is also expected to discuss China's claim to virtually the entire South China Sea, including its building of islands atop coral reefs, complete with airstrips and military installations.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearings in January, Tillerson compared China's island-building and deployment of military assets to Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, and suggesting China's access to the island should not be allowed.\n\nWhile President Donald Trump during his campaign pledged to slap 45 percent tariffs on imports from China and label the country a currency manipulator, there has been little sign of his doing either. His pick for U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, has said he would use a \"multi-faceted approach\" to cracking down on Chinese trade abuses.\n\nTillerson's trip is also expected to highlight the Trump administration's lack of concern with human rights abroad, formerly a key element of U.S. policy toward China and a major irritant for Beijing.\n\nIn a departure from past practice, Tillerson skipped the launch of an annual report on human rights last week that cited numerous abuses by China. He has also said the U.S. would not continue participating in the U.N. Human Rights Council unless it undergoes \"considerable reform.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/17/tillerson-in-beijing-set-to-talk-on-north-korea-south-china-sea.html"}, {"text": "George Conway, the husband of senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, is set to be nominated to run the Justice Department\u2019s civil division, according to people familiar with the matter, a job that would put him at the forefront defending the controversial immigration executive order and other lawsuits against the Trump administration.\n\nConway, a partner at Wall Street law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, had also been in the running for other jobs at the Justice Department.\n\nHe has worked on major securities law cases and deal litigation, according to his law firm biography.\n\nConway didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Frankly, as a former public official at the Federal Election Commission, I believe we\u2019ve gone way too far in denying officials any semblance of a private life.\n\nI don\u2019t care what President Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns show, and I don\u2019t think they are any of my (or anyone else\u2019s) business.\n\nI am interested in the principles and policies that candidates and elected officials stand for, not how much income they earned or taxes they paid.\n\nOthers feel differently, of course. But there is no question that the White House is right about what it said in the statement it released after MSNBC and a contributor at the Daily Beast, David Cay Johnston, published Trump\u2019s 2005 federal tax return: \u201cIt is totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns.\u201d\n\nTake a look at 26 U.S.C. \u00a77213, which Congress passed to protect the confidentiality of the returns filed by every adult American. Section (a)(1) makes it a felony for any federal employee to disclose tax returns or \u201creturn information.\u201d Violating this provision can land the offending bureaucrat in federal prison for up to five years and he can be fined up to $250,000 under the Alternative Fines Act (18 U.S.C. \u00a73571).\n\nBut this law doesn\u2019t just apply to government employees. It also applies to private individuals and entities such as Mr. Johnston.\n\nSection (a)(3) makes it unlawful for any person who receives an illegally disclosed tax return or return information from printing or publishing that return or that information. That is also a felony.\n\nFurthermore, section (a)(4) of the law makes it a crime to solicit disclosure of such a return in exchange for \u201cany item of material value,\u201d an issue that came up recently when columnist Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times sent out a tweet asking IRS employees to send him the president\u2019s tax return.\n\nJust three years ago in 2014, the IRS agreed to pay the National Organization for Marriage (NOM) $50,000 to settle a lawsuit NOM filed after an IRS clerk illegally disclosed its tax return.\n\nThe return was given to Matthew Meisel, a former employee of Bain & Company, who turned it over to the Human Rights Campaign (HRC). It ended up being posted on the HRC website and published by the Huffington Post.\n\nNeither the HRC nor the Huffington Post were prosecuted for violating the non-publication rule in this federal law. -- Whether that part of the statute could survive First Amendment challenge is open to question, although other parts are not.\n\nAmerican citizens are forced by law to file tax returns and to provide the federal government with highly sensitive, highly confidential financial information.\n\nAs Eugene Volokh, one of the leading First Amendment experts in the country, recently pointed out, \u201cthe government can generally restrict government employees from revealing confidential documents, including tax returns.\u201d\n\nThe First Amendment doesn\u2019t immunize government employees from prosecution for disclosing confidential tax information. Volokh also does not believe that the First Amendment would immunize a reporter or anyone else from the anti-solicitation provision, since under U.S. v. Williams (2008), \u201ccalls to commit a specific crime are generally not constitutionally protected.\u201d\n\nHowever, under the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in 2001 in Bartnicki v. Vopper, the ban on actual publication is probably not enforceable.\n\nIn that case, the Court held that a lawsuit could not be brought under federal and state wiretapping laws against a radio commentator who played a cell phone conversation that had been illegally recorded by a third party.\n\nThe key issue was balancing privacy concerns against the interest in publishing matters of public importance. But the Court also noted that the radio host had not participated in the original, illegal interception of the phone call.\n\nIt would be up to a court to determine whether the interests of both the government and citizens in maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of tax returns outweighed the public\u2019s interest in obtaining financial information on elected officials.\n\nAgain, Volokh says this issue \u201cis not completely clear.\u201d But he doesn\u2019t think that such a provision against publication could be enforced against anyone who, as two of the justices said in Bartnicki, had not \u201cordered, counseled, encouraged, or otherwise aided or abetted the interception.\u201d\n\nPublishing tax return information under such circumstances is different than if you have participated in what amounts to a conspiracy to obtain the information. Volokh doubts \u201cthat Bartnicki would provide First Amendment protection for publishing tax return information that was released in response to an unlawful solicitation.\u201d\n\nThis raises a particularly thorny problem, because without an assurance of confidentiality, our entire tax system and the ability of the IRS to collect the revenue that funds the government would be severely damaged.\n\nAs the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals said in 1991 in U.S. v. Richey, \u201cthe government seeks to restrict disclosure of private tax information to the press \u2026 given the compelling governmental interests in maintaining a workable tax system, it is difficult to say that this regulation is unreasonable.\u201d\n\nThe rule of law is a vital principle that is a fundamental part of who we are as a nation. Part of that principle is the concept that no one is above the law.\n\nAll of us \u2013 from the lowliest citizen to the president \u2013 are entitled to expect that the financial information we are forced to provide to the government will be kept confidential. When that expectation is broken, the government has an obligation, at a minimum, to go after those in government who violated the law.\n\nHans A. von Spakovsky is a Senior Legal Fellow at The Heritage Foundation and former Justice Department official.

UN agencies must do a better job of eliminating false and biased work, and I applaud the Secretary-General\u2019s decision to distance his good office from it,\u201d she said.\n\nAmong the report\u2019s recommendations was a call to \u201cbroaden support for boycott, divestment and sanctions initiatives among civil society actors.\u201d It also called for the secretary-general to recommend to the General Assembly and Security Council that a \u201cglobal conference\u201d be convened to determine what action should be taken by the U.N.\n\nThe controversy over the reports comes as the Trump administration has been taking a tougher line against the international body. The Trump administration is already considering pulling back support for and participation in various U.N. programs, in part due to its perceived anti-Israel stance.\n\nIn an interview with \"America's Newsroom\" Friday, Haley reiterated that the administration intends to take a hard stance with the U.N.\n\n\"The U.N. has been Israel-bashing for decades and what we are trying to do is make sure they understand that there's a new administration in town and we're not going to put up with it,\" she said.\n\nIsraeli diplomat Eitan Weiss praised Haley and said the removal of the report was a sign that, \u201cthe winds of change are blowing in the [corridors] of the U.N.\u201d\n\nThe winds of change are blowing in the coridors of the @UN.

The arrests were part of Turkish authorities\u2019 broad crackdown after the 2016 failed military coup.\n\nAccording to Republican Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford, who has worked quietly behind the scenes to secure Brunson's release, the couple was called in for a routine visa check when the ordeal began.\n\n\"Instead they were detained there at the police station, saying they may be part of a terrorist plot,\" Lankford said. \"Then they released his wife but kept him and then later transferred Dr. Brunson to a prison facility.\"\n\nIn December, Lankford personally travelled to the Turkish capital Ankara and met with their department of justice. \"For the first time, we learned what these charges are. They were given to me orally.\"\n\nLankford said the Turkish authorities alleged that Brunson had helped Kurdish refugees (Turkey labels the Kurds an insurgent group) and that the pastor attended a conference sponsored by Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, whom the Turkish government accused of instigating the 2016 coup from his Pennsylvania base.\n\n\"It seemed very odd for them to be able to pick up ... an American citizen that's been serving for more than 20 years in Turkey, and has been very engaged, very accepted by the culture and then suddenly, for him to be swept up and to be part of a terrorist investigation without any evidence, with just an accusation -- and still to this day, six months later, no charges,\" Lankford said.\n\n\"This is a completely false accusation, there is nothing to back this up,\" Jacqueline Brunson said. \"In it all, he's remaining faithful. He's saying, \u2018God I don't understand what is happening, I don't know how much longer this can last. I don't know what is going to happen in the end.\u2019 What he is saying, is, \u2018God I'm still choosing you to follow despite everything.\u2019\"\n\nThe Embassy of Turkey in Washington, D.C., has not responded to questions from Fox News for this report.\n\nJordan Sekulow, executive director of the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), has worked for the successful release of other Americans wrongly detained. In the Brunson case, Sekulow said they are working through the United Nations and the Trump administration. \"We have heard from nearly 230,000 people demanding his release. The fact is Pastor Andrew is wrongfully being held for his Christian faith. He should be released immediately and allowed to return home to his family in America.\"\n\nLankford said it is \u201cvery clear that through the last six months of the transition of the Obama administration to the Trump administration this fell through the cracks at the State Department.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are trying to keep it alive,\" Lankford said, adding there is a simple solution for all involved. \"There is a way to be able to resolve this. If they are having concern about this United States citizen, deport them \u2026 but not just hold them indefinitely with detention.\"\n\nA State Department official told Fox News the department takes seriously its obligation to assist U.S. citizens arrested abroad: \u201cWhen a U.S. citizen is detained overseas, we seek to visit as soon as possible and to provide appropriate consular services. Privacy considerations prevent us from commenting further.\"\n\nIn February, a bipartisan letter from the Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign Affairs committees was signed by 78 members of Congress to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan \"seeking the unconditional release of American pastor Andrew Brunson, who has been unjustly detained in Turkey since October and denied regular and appropriate access to legal counsel and American consular services.\"\n\nSen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, Brunson's home state, said through a spokesperson that he \"is aware of this case and his office has been in touch with appropriate authorities.\"\n\n\"As frank as I can say it, one of the things the Brunson family would ask of all Americans is to be able to pray for Dr. Brunson and for Mrs. Brunson as she is there waiting,\" Lankford said. \"They are extremely confused about what's happening. We are asking for the American government to be as involved as we can, to continue to raise this with the Turkish government, and to continue to pray for the Brunson family.\"\n\nCatherine Herridge is an award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington, D.C.

The House of Representatives voted 393-0 to declare that ISIS was committing genocide against Christians, Yazidis, and other ethnic and religious minorities in Iraq and Syria.\n\nLed by Representatives Jeff Fortenberry (R-NE) and Anna Eshoo (D-CA), the resolution was a lesson in complete cooperation on an issue that transcends politics.\n\nA few days later, on March 17th, then-Secretary of State John Kerry followed suit, declaring that ISIS was committing genocide against Christians, Yazidis, and Shia Muslims. In July, the Senate concurred, also unanimously.\n\nSuch unanimity is rare in government.\u2014and so are genocide designations by our State Department. Only two such declarations have ever been made, both for situations still ongoing \u2013 ISIS\u2019 persecutions, and, in 2004, the Sudanese government\u2019s massacres in Darfur.\n\nNow a new Congress and a new Administration can act again-- to go beyond declarations to action.\n\nA year ago, Christians and other religious minorities in Iraq and Syria were elated by the genocide designation. They hoped it would be followed by direct U.S. action to stabilize their communities through government aid.\n\nThey were wrong. Shockingly, far too often, that was not to be. Despite the declarations that the \u201ccrime of crimes\u201d was being committed, there was, by and large, no special outreach or direct funding by the U.S. government to communities that suffered through the atrocities.\n\nWhen I visited Iraq last May, I spoke with Christian and Yazidi genocide survivors, who had been overlooked in this terrible way. As I had tea with a group of Yazidis \u2013 living by an open sewer in the Erbil suburb of Ozal City \u2013 I asked them if they had received aid from the U.S. government or the United Nations.\n\nThey said: \u201cNo.\u201d Only Iraqi Christians had helped them.\n\nThen one of them thought hard and spoke up. \u201cWe did receive two kilos of lamb from the U.N .in the summer of 2014,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd since then?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d he responded. \u201cOnly the [local Catholic] Church has helped us.\u201d\n\nThat Catholic Church\u2013 in the form of the Archdiocese of Erbil \u2013 is caring not only for Yazidis, but also for 12,000 families, the largest population of displaced Christians in Iraq. Despite that enormous responsibility, the Church has yet to receive money or anything else from the U.S. government or from the U.N.\n\nAt the U.S. Consulate in Erbil last spring, officials told me they prioritized \u201cindividual needs.\u201d But as we spoke further, they admitted they did not think in terms of the groups targeted by the genocide at all. The only priority was meeting basic needs of any refugee There was no thought being given to supporting communities that faced genocide lest they disappear. It was the same story at the U.N. compound.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t need to be this way.\n\nThis should not have been allowed to happen. But more importantly, this should not be allowed to continue.\n\nThe United States government could assist genocide survivors \u2013 as we have done over and over again for the past 100 years and more. Action is needed \u2013 the kind of action we took in Darfur a decade-and-a-half ago that resulted in more than $7 billion in aid being given to the people in that region, with almost $3 billion in direct assistance to Darfur via USAID.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I received a phone call from an archbishop in Iraq. He was hopeful. He told me that he recently had an excellent meeting with a U.S. official there and the attitude that excluded his community was changing.\n\nHe was optimistic that this would soon result in meaningful financial support for his shrinking flock \u2013 a flock that has lived as refugees for two-and-a-half years and is losing hope.\n\nThere is another reason for optimism, which I witnessed just before Christmas. I was in Iraq again, this time with Congressman Chris Smith (R-NJ), and he was committed to helping fix the aid situation.\n\nWe spoke with displaced Christians, UN and U.S. officials, and Church leaders. Congressman Smith wanted to know why communities like the Christians in Erbil were not getting U.S. and U.N. aid and what could be done about it.\n\nCongress had not acted last year on Smith\u2019s bill to help provide aid to these genocide survivors (H.R. 5961).\n\nBut based on our trip to Iraq, he \u2013 along with Representative Anna Eshoo (D-CA) \u2013 reintroduced an enhanced version of the bill this year. Known as the Iraq and Syria Genocide Emergency Relief and Accountability Act (H.R. 390), the proposed legislation would ensure that those who suffered genocide are not ignored in U.S. aid distribution.\n\nThe budget for 2017 is already in place, so the benefits of action taken now would be immediate. Going forward, until the situation for these communities stabilizes, the United States will continue to have the opportunity to play a major role in ensuring that religious and ethnic minorities from the region do not disappear. This can be done by continuing to provide funds in future years for the assistance of genocide targeted communities in Iraq and Syria.\n\nSuch actions would change the future of a devastated region. It would also be a step toward transcending the partisanship of politics at home.\n\nAndrew Walther is vice president for communications and strategic planning for the Knights of Columbus, which which has raised more than $12 million for Christian refugees --primarily from Iraq and Syria --since 2014.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/03/17/transcend-our-domestic-political-battles-give-help-to-victims-genocide.html"}, {"text": "President Trump pressed German Chancellor Angela Merkel \u201chard\u201d on NATO dues during the leaders\u2019 Oval Office meeting on Friday, Fox News is told \u2013 a point the president underscored during their joint press conference minutes later.\n\n\u201cMany nations owe vast sums of money from past years, and it is very unfair to the United States,\u201d Trump said at the press conference, discussing the need for NATO allies to pay \u201ctheir fair share\u201d for defense. \u201cThese nations must pay what they owe.\u201d\n\nHe then thanked Merkel, who was standing beside him, for Germany\u2019s apparent commitment to increase defense spending and work toward contributing 2 percent of GDP to NATO.\n\nAccording to a source with direct knowledge of the meeting, the comments came after Trump privately pressed Merkel during their discussion to increase NATO spending.

He said they seek a \u201cpeaceful solution\u201d to the conflict in Ukraine and added, \u201cOur two countries must continue to work together to protect our people from radical Islamic terrorism. \u201c\n\nThe meeting could be a restart of a relationship complicated by Trump's rhetoric on the campaign trail.\n\nMerkel shared a strong bond with former President Barack Obama. And as the leader of Europe's biggest economy and most stable government, Merkel emerged in recent years as the leading voice for a continent struggling with slow growth, identity issues and increased security threats after a string of terrorist attacks.\n\nDespite his criticism during the campaign, Trump still found ways to voice respect. When a television station in September asked him to name a world leader he admired, he cited Merkel.\n\nMerkel's first major encounter with Trump came as she seeks a fourth term as chancellor in elections later this year. She has acknowledged the contest could be difficult and has stressed a need for stability after Britain's decision to leave the European Union.\n\nShe reportedly has studied Trump's speeches and policies in advance of her trip, eager to find areas for cooperation.\n\nAt the press conference, Trump also disputed any characterization that he is an \u201cisolationist,\u201d scolding a reporter for a related line of questioning.

The Left wants to create a false narrative that Republican opponents of the CBO are simply defending their party and president.\n\nBut these Democrats are reimagining history.\n\nIn fact, I have advocated replacing the CBO for more than a decade.\n\nIn my 2005 book \"Winning the Future,\" I argued that the CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation should be replaced with an Accurate Scoring Caucus after the CBO inaccurately projected $63 billion of revenue losses from the 2003 Bush tax cut, which never materialized.\n\nThen \u2013 as now \u2013 I argued that the CBO doesn\u2019t score legislation dynamically. It simply ignores growth that results from tax cuts in its projections, which creates an inherent legislative bias toward more taxes and budget gimmicks.\n\nIn a more recent example, I advocated for ditching the CBO after it gave ObamaCare an unrealistically positive initial score.\n\nIn a 2014 opinion piece, I argued: \u201cThe CBO\u2019s original analysis of ObamaCare deserves to be the final nail in the agency\u2019s coffin. As much as any other single institution, the Congressional Budget Office is responsible for sticking us with this egregious law. The CBO\u2019s \u2018scores\u2019 lent credibility to ObamaCare\u2019s supporters by making predictions that weren\u2019t very good based on assumptions that made no sense.\n\n\u201cOn [Feb. 4, 2014], the CBO updated its projections about the health care law\u2019s effect on the economy, and included the bombshell that because of ObamaCare, 2.3 million fewer Americans will have full-time jobs over the next 10 years. The White House\u2019s charitable interpretation of the report was that millions of people will leave the workforce or will work less because of their subsides under ObamaCare.\u201d\n\nIn the same opinion piece, I said the CBO\u2019s \u201cnonpartisan\u201d label gave it \u201can outsized influence on policy, as reporters, commentators, \u2018fact checkers,\u2019 and many members of Congress (most of whom should know better) treat CBO projections like trump cards in debates over legislation.\u201d\n\nIf the CBO had reported in early 2010 that ObamaCare would result in 2.3 million fewer full-time jobs or that it would cost $1.8 trillion over a decade, then ObamaCare would never have passed Congress.\n\nIn both my 2005 book and my 2014 op-ed, I pointed out the central flaw at the CBO is the agency does not utilize any kind of dynamic scoring. It wrongly presumes that a change of fiscal policy will have no impact on labor, markets or other economic factors.\n\nAny analytical model that changes fiscal policy and holds other variables constant is useless, and CBO has proved this again and again.\n\nThe other day on Fox News, I argued for the same solution I suggested in 2014:\n\n\u201cThe credit rating agencies that service financial markets could offer a useful model for obtaining better policy scores\u2026 We should consider replacing the CBO with a competitive system of multiple scoring agencies whose success depends on accuracy over time.\u201d\n\nWhat I wrote in 2014 \u2013 long before the CBO scored the American Health Care Act \u2013 is just as relevant today as it was then.\n\nI\u2019ll say it again: We can\u2019t afford any more errors like ObamaCare\n\nNewt Gingrich is a Fox News contributor.

However, the good news that is once the computer is connected to the internet, it can be wiped, according to Bongino.\n\nIf the security information for Trump Tower was somehow on the laptop and was then removed from the laptop, however, the entire security plan for the Manhattan skyscraper would have to be overhauled, Bongino added.\n\nBongino said that the security plan would likely include information on where assets are located, where people are located, sensitive locations, where the water comes in, where the air comes in, where the hard rooms are.\n\nLaw enforcement sources could not confirm specific information that may have been housed on that laptop, but Fox News is told that such laptops have in place security features that would prevent someone without authorized access from simply logging on and searching through its contents.\n\nThe laptop was taken from an agent\u2019s vehicle parked outside of her home in Brooklyn, according to a New York Daily News report.\n\nSome items that were taken, such Secret Service pins \u2013 which could be used to get access to secure areas \u2013 and an agency radio have been recovered, a Secret Service source told Fox News, but not the laptop.\n\n\"The Secret Service is very heavily involved and, citing national security, there's very little we have on our side,\" a New York City Police Department source told the New York Daily News.\n\n\"There's data on there that's highly sensitive,\u201d the police source added. \u201cThey're scrambling like mad.\u201d\n\nThe Secret Service source told Fox News that they don\u2019t believe the laptop was stolen by a foreign power and that the incident is being investigated as a \u201cstreet crime.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Matt Dean, Malia Zimmerman and Ed Henry contributed to this report.\n\n", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/17/secret-service-laptop-stolen-in-new-york.html"}, {"text": "A just-published United Nations report that claims to find Israel guilty of the \u201ccrime of apartheid,\u201d is only one element of a broader legal and propaganda offensive being pushed by an obscure U.N. regional commission to stigmatize America\u2019s close ally and build support for the Palestinian cause, according to documents examined by Fox News.\n\nThe offensive has been gestating for at least two years within the U.N.\u2019s Economic and Social Commission for West Asia (ESCWA), whose entire membership are Arab states, and is timed to this year\u2019s 50th anniversary of the 1967 war between Arab states and Israel, which resulted in Israel\u2019s control of the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nAt least one additional report commissioned by ESCWA, attempting to create an \u201cinnovative\u201d and \u201cscientific\u201d methodology for estimated the cost of Israel\u2019s 50-year control of the territories, is still in the works, with the aim of demanding billions in reparations for Palestinians.\n\nA third aspect of the strategy is an elaborate proposed propaganda campaign against the Israeli occupation, making use of U.N. institutions and a variety of diplomatic and media channels, to create a new , sympathetic \u201cbrand\u201d for Palestinians as victims \u201cthat would cause a snowball effect, thus altering public opinion globally in record time,\u201d as an ESCWA background paper puts it.\n\nAll three elements, including the now-notorious apartheid report, were given a thorough airing at the biennial high level meeting of ESCWA\u2019s 18 members, one of them being the State of Palestine, held in Doha from December 13 to 15, 2016.\n\nESCWA is ostensibly a forum for regional economic coordination and development; the meeting was touted largely as an occasion to examine the U.N.\u2019s ponderous Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nNonetheless, a preliminary version of the apartheid report, containing much of its final wording, was one of the documents circulated at the session, and a resolution passed at the end of the meeting called on ESCWA\u2019s secretariat to publicize the explosive apartheid study as much as possible.\n\nThe resolution also called for an \u201cESCWA media and communications strategy aimed at increasing global awareness,\u201d of, among other things, \u201cIsraeli violations of Palestinian rights and international law,\u201d and orders the bureaucracy to \u201cincrease activities on Palestine and organize special activities to mark\u201d the 1967 anniversary.\n\nThe apartheid report caused an eruption of outrage from U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley when it was officially published under U.N. auspices on March 15. She noted it came \u201cfrom a body whose membership nearly universally does not recognize Israel,\u201d and demanded the U.N. officially \u201cwithdraw\u201d the report from circulation.\n\nHaley heaped additional scorn on the co-author of the 306-page document: Richard Falk, a notoriously anti-Israel academic who often provoked U.S. irritation for his anti-Semitic statements and anti-U.S. diatribes during a six-year term as U.N. special rapporteur on the rights of the Palestinian people.\n\nFalk has, among other things, cast doubt on the \u201cofficial version\u201d of the 9/11 attacks as the work of Islamic terrorists and after the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings remarked that the \u201cAmerican global domination project is bound to generate all kinds of resistance in the post-colonial world.\u201d\n\nIn her counter-blast against the ESCWA-sponsored report, U.S. Ambassador Haley called him \u201ca man who has repeatedly made biased and deeply offensive comments about Israel and espoused ridiculous conspiracy theories.\u201d\n\nFalk stepped down from his U.N. job in May, 2014, but has kept up his anti-Israel agitation as a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and has made frequent references to the Israel-apartheid theme.\n\nFor his part, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres distanced himself from the document, and an official close to him asserted he was blind-sided by its appearance.\n\nA U.N. official pointed the finger of blame for the publication at ESCWA\u2019s Executive Secretary, Rima Khalaf, a Jordanian and longtime U.N. bureaucrat who was appointed to her job by former U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in 2010.\n\nKhalaf was slated to step down within weeks as part of Guterres\u2019 initial management shuffle, but instead abruptly resigned on March 17 after Guterres asked that the report be removed from ESDWA\u2019s website.\n\nAt a Beirut press conference, an unrepentant Khalaf reportedly hailed the report as the \u201cfirst of its kind\u201d from a U.N. agency to condemn Israel, and added, \u201cIt was expected that Israel and its allies would put enormous pressure on the United Nations secretary general to renounce the report.\"\n\nThe U.N. official observed that Khalaf \u201cwas in New York recently and did not mention [the apartheid report] to anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the responsibilities of U.N. economic commissioners,\u201d the official noted, \u201cis to move information up the chain of command\u201d to avoid such problems.\n\nThat may well be so. But an official summary of the Doha session is also available on the ESCWA website, accessible to all.\n\nAmong other things, it notes the elements of the ESCWA 50th anniversary actions, issuing broadside condemnations of Israel\u2019s actions in the territories without reference to acts of terrorism or other assaults on Israelis, and calling for creation of a \u201cspecialized unit on issues related to Palestine and its people,\u201d including further monitoring of \u201cIsraeli violations of the Palestinian people\u2019s rights and of international law.\u201d\n\nAlong with ESCWA members and officials, the report notes, representatives of at least 15 other U.N. offices and agencies were present. One of them was the Office of the U.N. Special Coordinator of the Middle East Peace Process, although only a lower-level official was listed in attendance.\n\nQuestions emailed to ESCWA by Fox News about the apartheid report and the other elements in the organization\u2019s anti-Israel, pro-Palestinian campaign, including some of its future plans, were acknowledged but not answered before this story was published.\n\nGuterres\u2019 claim of ignorance about the Falk report is made more credible by the fact that he has only been in the U.N.\u2019s job since January 1 -\u2013less than three months.\n\nBut the ESCWA campaign also offers a smudged window into the maze of bureaucracies, agencies and free-floating organizations that make up the sprawling U.N. system\u2014and their lurking biases and often invisible channels of influence.\n\nTheir topmost official of each is usually appointed by the U.N. Secretary General, and their supervision by U.N. member states\u2014their nominal bosses\u2014is often cursory at best.\n\nThere are more than 30 funds, agencies and programs alongside the bulky U.N. Secretariat, plus a flotilla of regional commissions (including ESCWA), research and training institutes, facilitating networks, and a bewildering array of other entities, spread around the globe, often with overlapping mandates and spheres of influence.\n\nESCWA, for example, is a $70 million body ostensibly concerned with social and economic coordination and development in the Middle East. Its biennial budget is part of the U.N.\u2019s regular budget, meaning that 22 per cent of the total is paid by the U.S.\n\nYet alongside its regional work, ESCWA is also the author of a report issued by the U.N. Secretary General himself, on the living conditions of Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories.\n\nThe report focuses contributions from a wide variety of other U.N. and U.N.-supported organizations in a 20-page condemnation of allegedly illegal Israeli practices, ranging from illegal detention and displacement of civiians to possible \u201csustained extensive soil damage, including the removal and destruction of topsoil,\u201d during a 2014 Israeli anti-terrorism offensive in Gaza.\n\nAmong other things, the report adds: \u201cAccording to UNEP [the U.N. Environmental Program], the 2014 offensive may also have resulted in loss of wildlife and native plants.\u201d The document offers no specific evidence at all for the extremely hypothetical claim.\n\nESCWA\u2019s most recent compendium of Israel crimes was published in July, 2016\u2014as a Note from then-Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.\n\nThe next ESCWA ghost-writing job, if it occurs, will have Guterres\u2019 name on it.\n\nGeorge Russell is Editor-at-Large of Fox News.

That was not during us.\"\n\nThe president may have been referring to the recent publishing of what are alleged to be CIA documents and hacking tools by the website WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange claims that the leaks are real, and highlight what he calls the \u201cdevastating incompetence\u201d of the agency\u2019s cybersecurity. The CIA has yet to confirm whether the materials are, in fact, authentic.\n\nOn Thursday, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, took serious issue with the president\u2019s suggestion that the agency was hacked. And Schiff says that, if true, the president\u2019s comments are akin to the actions of those who leak government secrets.\n\nWHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS STAND BY TRUMP WIRETAPPING CLAIM\n\n\"It would be one thing if the president\u2019s statements were the product of intelligence community discussion and a purposeful decision to disclose information to the public, but that is unlikely to be the case,\" Schiff said in a statement.\n\nHe added that while he thinks \"the president has the power to declassify whatever he wants... this should be done as the product of thoughtful consideration and with intense input from any agency affected. For anyone else to do what the president may have done, would constitute what he deplores as 'leaks.'\"\n\nA Fox News poll released Wednesday shows a record 73 percent of voters have confidence in the CIA, up from 67 percent in December.\n\nIn recent weeks, the president has made clear his distaste for leakers. On February 24, the president lamented on Twitter that \"the FBI is totally unable to stop the national security 'leakers' that have permeated our government for a long time\u2026 Classified information is being given to media that could have a devastating effect.\"\n\nCritics point to his support for WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign as evidence to the contrary. \u201cI love WikiLeaks,\u201d then-nominee Trump said during campaign remarks in October.\n\nThe investigation into possible CIA hacking isn't the only thing over which Schiff seems to be at odds with Trump. On Wednesday, Schiff and House Intel Committee Chair Devin Nunes (R-CA) repeated their assertions that they have yet to see any evidence that supports the president's claim that Trump Tower was the subject of wiretapping.\n\nTRUMP GIVES CIA POWER TO LAUNCH DRONE STRIKES\n\nAnd on Thursday, the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee took that assertion one step further, suggesting in a statement that they have seen no evidence that Trump Tower was under surveillance \u201cby any element of the United States government either before or after Election Day 2016.\u201d\n\nIn a March 4 tweet, the president suggested that \"Obama had my \u2018wires tapped\u2019 in Trump Tower just before the victory.\" When asked on Wednesday why he didn\u2019t withhold comment until he had proof of his claim, President Trump told Tucker Carlson \u201cdon't forget, when I say wiretapped, those words were in quotes\u2026 [T]hat really covers surveillance and many other things.

Nunes suggests he expects some of that evidence on Friday.\n\nMonday is also when the committee expects to hold its first open hearing on Russia's interference in the 2016 race and possible contacts between Trump associates and Russia. FBI Director Comey is expected to face direct questioning at that hearing, and it isn\u2019t just the House that\u2019s looking for answers.\n\nSenator Lindsay Graham suggested earlier this week that subpoenas aren\u2019t out of the question if lawmakers don\u2019t get the information they\u2019re looking for.\n\n\"Congress,\u201d Graham said, \u201cis going to flex its muscles.\"", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/17/house-democrat-says-trump-may-have-leaked-government-secrets.html"}, {"text": "Suggesting that Donald Trump should keep his head down, ignore petty slights and soldier on is like telling a raging bull to cover up his privates; both are unlikely propositions. Nonetheless, it\u2019s good advice. The country elected Mr. Trump because voters were unhappy with the status quo \u2013 a sputtering economy, the loss of power and pride to overseas rivals, the unaffordability of healthcare, the inability to stem illegal immigration and the dithering over how to protect the country from terrorism. Outrage from a jilted Left doesn\u2019t make those problems any less real.\n\nFor the good of the country, and the good of the GOP, President Trump needs to make progress on these issues; astonishingly, if you can peer through the volcanic eruption of liberal disapproval, you\u2019ll see he\u2019s doing just that.\n\nTake immigration. Despite being pilloried as hateful and barbaric, Mr. Trump has stood by his position that legal immigration into our country is welcome and beneficial, but that illegal immigration will not be tolerated. Sending that message loud and clear has already had an impact, as common sense would have predicted. Border crossings plummeted 40% in Trump\u2019s first month, to the lowest level in five years.\n\nThat\u2019s a victory, and it could lead to an even greater accomplishment. For many years conservatives have demanded that secure borders precede immigration reform. If Trump can stem the inflow of undocumented people, perhaps he can then resolve the status of the 11 million living in the country illegally. That would be a major win, and Trump loves winning.\n\nLook at healthcare. For all the sturm und drang, the GOP has managed to wrangle a complex bill through several committees in the House that would effectively dismantle Obamacare\u2019s onerous taxes and fines, reduce the deficit and begin a much-needed reform of Medicaid. Despite predictable posturing from all sides, the bill will likely be punched and pulled into legislation that most Republicans can live with. Is it perfect? No. Is it better than Obamacare, with its narrowing choices and spiraling costs? You bet.\n\nHow about trade? The Trump White House last week laid down a significant marker, hitting Chinese telecommunications company ZTE with a $1.2 billion fee for shipping goods illegally to North Korea and Iran in violation of sanctions. The penalty is the largest-ever levied by the Commerce Department; more important, Secretary Wilbur Ross says payment will be demanded. The Obama administration was so deferential to China that even when it won assessments against Beijing through the World Trade Organization, it failed to collect the billions owed in fees. When our trading partners cheat, as they have done with impunity, we will hold them accountable, vows Ross. High time.\n\nWant federal spending to decline? Take a look at Trump\u2019s budget. This is another marker, putting Washington on notice that nothing is sacred. The establishment is howling over cuts to sacred cows like the EPA, but with $20 trillion in debt and deficits poised to rise again, something has to give.\n\nThe punditry is aghast that Trump wants to cut spending at the EPA, but the agency\u2019s ineffectiveness weakens the case for the status quo. In spite of its 15,000 employees, 10 regional offices and a budget of over $8 billion, the EPA completely whiffed on fixing the poisoned water disaster in Flint, Michigan. Its own Inspector General reported that the agency should have intervened and issued an emergency order a full seven months earlier than it did. They should have had a greater sense of \u201curgency\u201d, said the watchdog group, since protecting the health of our citizens is surely the EPA\u2019s number one goal.\n\nAt least it used to be. During the Obama years, management fired many older workers to cut costs. They recruited a younger, more diverse workforce, reaching out for the first time to historically black colleges, for instance. They hired people fired up by President Obama\u2019s climate crusade and by the mission of the EPA, a place the local union leader described as \u201ca great place to work because you get to do something you believe in.\"\n\nIn other words, they stocked the place with zealots, which is why Scott Pruitt, the new agency head and others are being purposefully undermined. David Schnare, who was on the Trump transition team at the EPA, recently resigned, noting the pushback he and others faced from a group of employees who \u201cwere definitely antagonistic\u201d to the incoming administration. He described the group \u201cas here for a cause.\u201d This is not new news, since EPA workers took the unprecedented step of lobbying against the confirmation of Mr. Pruitt, but it is not good news.\n\nAs with most federal agencies, the EPA has outgrown its mandate and its mission. One excuse management gave for the Flint debacle is that they were uncertain of the state\u2019s role. That confusion was reasonable, in that much of what the EPA purports to do is already handled by the states. The reality is that a lot of the work done in D.C. (but not all) can and should be done at the state level. That would lead to greater efficiency, and also lower costs.\n\nTrump is on the right track, as is the country. His instincts are sound, pressing for more accountability and more common sense in government. It\u2019s not easy draining the swamp, but that is what the voters want, and that is what he is already delivering. He needs to stay the course. Now if he could just have one speedbump in his Twitter feed\u2026.\n\nLiz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNews.com.

[Here\u2019s what President Trump told Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson:]\n\n\u201cIf we had the greatest health care bill ever in history, and we needed eight votes from the Democrats to get us up to the 60 number that you would need, they would not vote for it. It's a very selfish thing. They are doing a very, very bad disservice to the country.\u201d\n\nNow, it is certainly true that ObamaCare passed in the first place without one Republican vote.\n\nSo to be fair, partisan politics dominates both sides of the aisle.\n\nBut there's one very important difference -- ObamaCare was an unknown when it passed in 2010.\n\nNow, we know it doesn't work! Because health insurance premiums are rising for too many Americans and a number of health insurance companies are simply bailing out of the system because they can't make enough profit.\n\nSo the situation must be improved for the good of everybody.\n\nHere's what should happen:\n\nThe federal mandate that all Americans must buy health insurance is not a good thing.\n\nEven though the Supreme Court said it\u2019s constitutionally okay, it really isn't. The feds have no right to tell us to buy anything.\n\nHowever, there are millions of Americans who simply cannot afford health insurance.\n\nAnd those folks should be able to receive government assistance, but in order to make it efficient that assistance should come from the states through Medicaid.\n\nAlso health insurance companies should compete nationwide. That would drive down the premiums for working families.\n\nIn addition, those Americans who do not buy health insurance, who won\u2019t buy it, should have to pay a bit more for coverage after they get sick.\n\nIt is simply not fair for someone to wait until they have cancer and then want the same insurance rate as a healthy person.\n\nIt's also not fair for the partisan press to say folks will \u201close\u201d their health insurance if those same people refuse to apply for Medicaid or whatever.\n\nI mean come on.\n\nAs \u201cTalking Points\u201d laid out last week, there is a huge conflict between the Bernie Sanders people who want free health insurance for everybody and conservatives who say you should pay your own way.\n\nThat's at the heart of the health care debate, and it's never going to be resolved.\n\nBut for the good of all Americans, these pinheads in Congress should try to get the best bill possible and put their ideology on the shelf.\n\nWorking Americans do not deserve to be gouged paying for health care insurance.\n\nAnd, yes, we are a compassionate country, so we have to have safety nets for those who cannot support themselves.\n\nThe problem is, the can-nots mix with the will-nots and the system gets hammered. But that's another problem that\u2019s never going to be be solved.\n\nThere will always be irresponsible Americans who game the system.\n\n\u201cTalking Points\u201d believes the Republican version of ObamaCare will make it through the House with some compromises and arrive in the Senate at the end of March.\n\nThere are a few Democratic senators who might be won over but only a few.\n\nSo a new health care law is shaky to say the least.\n\n", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/03/17/bill-oreilly-wiretaps-and-your-health.html"}, {"text": "The Marine Corps\u2019 new ad campaign takes viewers on a journey through everything the Corps stands for -- from victory on the battlefield to citizenship and service at home.

Gary Palmer, a Republican from Alabama, who voted against the plan in a House budget committee vote. One lawmaker said the changes include \"work requirements and block grants.\"\n\nSeveral participants later confirmed to reporters that those who attended the meeting indeed are now a \"yes.\"\n\nGOP leaders are hoping to push the legislation through the House next week, after the budget committee narrowly approved the Republican legislation on Thursday.\n\nWhether they can will soon become clear. Apparently in a deal-making mode, Trump was trying to offer assurances Friday amid concerns voiced from both the right and center, as well as from Democrats.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to take care of people at all levels,\u201d Trump said.\n\nMuch is at stake for Republican congressional leaders and the Trump White House. The package represents the first major piece of legislation aimed at fulfilling a top 2016 campaign promise \u2013 further, Trump has said Washington must first deal with health care before officials can tackle the next policy priority of tax reform.\n\nOn the sidelines of Trump\u2019s Friday meeting, Health Secretary Tom Price prodded divided Republicans on Friday to \"get together and collaborate.\"\n\nStill, the leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus -- whose members want to curb Medicaid, reduce a new tax credit and eliminate requirements on insurers \u2013 said earlier there's been little give from House leaders.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., said the only change leaders might be willing to make was imposing an optional work requirement on some recipients of Medicaid, which helps finance health coverage for the poor. He said he believes they have not agreed to quickly phase out an expansion of Medicaid, another conservative demand.\n\n\"They won't have the votes unless they change it\" further, Meadows said. He said that optional work requirement \"doesn't move the ball more than a couple yards on a very long playing field.\"\n\nConservatives and moderate House Republicans want to pull the bill in opposing directions, GOP senators are rebelling and Republican governors say the House bill gives them almost no new flexibility and lacks sufficient resources to protect the vulnerable.\n\nIf Trump is offering changes to mollify conservatives, it\u2019s unclear whether that risks losing votes on the other end of the spectrum.\n\nThe House bill would repeal major elements of former President Barack Obama's 2010 law. It would create new, leaner tax credits for health insurance, cap federal spending on Medicaid for low-income people and reverse tax increases on wealthy Americans used to finance Obama's statute.\n\nOne House GOP leader, Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, said leaders were on track to bring the legislation to the House Rules Committee early next week. That panel's meeting -- usually a prelude to bringing legislation to the House floor -- is expected to produce amendments aimed at securing votes.\n\nCritics say it would make health insurance more expensive for individuals, especially older adults and those with modest incomes. An analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found 24 million people would drop or lose their health insurance over a decade though the bill would also reduce the deficit.\n\nIn the Senate, Susan Collins, R-Maine, told the Portland Press Herald, \"This is not a bill I could support in its current form.\" She joins Kentucky's Rand Paul and Utah's Mike Lee in opposing the legislation. Collins' opposition leaves the bill short of the support it needs in the Senate unless it changes, since GOP leaders can only lose two votes.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/17/trump-in-deal-making-mode-says-conservatives-backing-health-bill-after-changes.html"}, {"text": "It was not hard to see this coming. Two President Obama-appointed federal U.S. district judges have blocked President Trump's revised travel ban executive order from taking effect.\n\nTrue to form, President Trump is fighting back, and reminding his supporters why they voted for him. You\u2019ve got to love it.\n\n\u201cHundreds of refugees are under federal investigation for terrorism and related reasons,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Nashville this week. \u201cWe have entire regions of the world destabilized by terrorism and ISIS. For this reason, I issued an executive order to temporarily suspend immigration from places where it cannot safely occur.\n\n\u201cA judge has just blocked our executive order on travel and refugees coming into our country from certain countries,\u201d he added incredulously.\n\nI've been saying for quite a while that this is all part of the radical alt-left's strategy to undermine and delegitimize the president. In this case, they are cherry picking liberal judges to rule against what are very legal, constitutional executive orders.\n\nBut these activist judges aren't just slowing down the president's agenda. They're putting the lives of Americans in jeopardy. It is clear the alt-left would rather score cheap political points than listen to the repeated warnings about the risks of letting unvetted foreigners into this country. And it's important for the left to hear this because these warnings that ISIS would infiltrate the refugee flow initially came from Obama-era top U.S. national security and intelligence officials.\n\nOne by one, Obama administration officials acknowledged the possibility to lawmakers over the last few years. They included former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper; ex-CIA Director John Brennan; Nicholas Rasmussen, Obama\u2019s National Counterterrorism Center director; Assistant FBI Director Michael Steinbach; and State Department spokesman and former Navy Admiral John Kirby.\n\nBut FBI Director James Comey said it best, on Oct. 21, 2015.\n\n\u201cWe can only query against that which we have collected,\u201d Comey said. \u201cAnd so if someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interests reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home, but we're not going to -- there'll be nothing show up because we have no record on that person.\u201d\n\nIt is an outright dereliction of duty to ignore these warnings. I urge the alt-left critics of the ban to take a look at Fox News\u2019 reporting from last week, in a story headlined, \"Iraqi insurgent fighter allegedly lied about identify, got through 'extreme vetting.\u2019\u201d\n\nAmerica needs to make a very profound, yet very simple choice. Do we want to sacrifice our safety over the fears of slightly inconveniencing a few people? And is there really something wrong with finding out if people who want to come to this country agree with our values, constitutional rights and principles?\n\nIt\u2019s time to put protecting lives over political correctness. We cannot allow the alt-left to drag us back into the pre-9/11 mindset. Since that dark day, when 2,996 Americans died and more than 6,000 more were injured, we\u2019ve had plenty of reminders to stay vigilant.\n\nWe saw what happened at the finish line in the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013. Terrorists took the lives of four people, including two policemen, and injured 264 innocent people.\n\nIn 2015 in San Bernardino, Calif., a jihadist couple slaughtered 14 and wounded 22 at a holiday party.\n\nAnd just last June, at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., a radical Islamist gunned down 49 and wounded 53 more.\n\nThese are just a few of the many terror attacks and plots that have occurred on American soil in the last two decades.\n\nIf the radical alt-left wants to continue to undermine the president's ability to keep Americans safe, and a single person dies because Trump's extreme vetting policy is being blocked, they will have blood on their hands.

Elijah Cummings of Maryland asked the Trump administration to provide a comprehensive record of Flynn's contacts with foreign governments and interests.\n\nFlynn accepted $33,750 from Russia's government-run television system for appearing at a Moscow event in December 2015 \u2014 a few months before Flynn began formally advising President Donald Trump's campaign \u2014 and thousands more in expenses covered by the network and in speech fees from other Russian firms, according to the documents.\n\nFlynn's financial relationship with the RT network may violate a constitutional provision against gifts from foreign governments, said Cummings, who released documents obtained during the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform's inquiry into Flynn's activities before Trump appointed him to become national security adviser.\n\nIn addition to the record of Flynn's foreign contacts, Cummings, the senior Democrat on the committee, also asked the Defense Department to compel Flynn to pay the money he received to the U.S. government.\n\n\"I am writing to request information about whether Gen. Flynn fully disclosed\u2014 as part of the security clearance and vetting process for his return to government\u2014 his communications with Russian agents, Turkish agents and other foreign agents, as well as his payments from foreign sources,\" Cummings wrote. Last week, Flynn registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent whose lobbying work may have benefited the Turkish government. The lobbying occurred before Election Day from August to November, during the period when Flynn was Trump's campaign adviser.\n\nTrump fired Flynn as national security adviser last month, saying the former U.S. Army lieutenant general misled Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about his conversations with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. Flynn's ties to Russia have been scrutinized by the FBI and are part of House and Senate committee investigations into contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russians.\n\nThe newly-released files show that RT \u2014 designated by the U.S. intelligence community as a propaganda arm for Russia's government \u2014 also paid for luxury hotel stays and other expenses incurred by Flynn and his adult son, Michael Flynn Jr., during the Moscow trip.\n\nFlynn, who was fired in August 2014 as chief of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, sat next to Russian President Vladimir Putin during the climax of the televised RT gala.\n\nCummings said Flynn's acceptance of payments from RT violated the emoluments provision of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits retired military officers from accepting gifts from foreign powers. RT identifies itself as an independent news network, but a report by U.S. intelligence agencies made public in January said RT has long been considered by the U.S. government a Russian propaganda arm.\n\nIn letters sent to Trump, Defense Secretary James Mattis and FBI Director James Comey, Cummings said Flynn \"violated the Constitution by accepting tens of thousands of dollars from an agent of a global adversary that attacked our democracy.\" Cummings was referring to the intelligence agencies' conclusion that Russia instigated cyber-hacking of Democratic party officials and organizations in the months before the presidential election.\n\nThe Defense Department has said retired military officers are covered by the emoluments clause because they could be recalled to military service. The department has also noted that the prohibition on accepting foreign gifts includes commercial groups controlled by foreign governments or others \"considered instruments of the foreign government.\"\n\nA Flynn spokesman said Flynn informed the DIA before he went to Moscow and after his return. Price Floyd, a spokesman for Flynn, said that \"as many former government officials and general officers have done, Gen. Flynn signed with a speakers' bureau and these are examples of that work.\"\n\nDIA spokesman Jim Kudla said Thursday that Flynn did report to the agency in advance that he was traveling to Moscow \"in accordance with standard security clearance procedures.\"\n\nSeparately, the Army is looking into the matter of Flynn's reporting and compensation, but has found no answers yet, according to spokesman Col. Pat Seiber.\n\nEmails indicate Flynn initially asked for a higher fee than the $45,000 paid to his speakers' group, Leading Authorities Inc., but was asked to reduce his price. Flynn's take from RT was ultimately $33,750 after Leading Authorities received its commission.\n\n\"If Gen. Flynn is coming, we would like him to be front and central at the Moscow conference,\" an RT official told Flynn's representatives in a November 2015 email. During his Moscow stay, Flynn was interviewed by an RT personality on national security affairs before attending the lavish RT gala with Putin.\n\nIn an addition to the RT payments, Flynn was also paid $11,250 for two speeches in Washington \u2014 one in August for Volga-Dnepr Airlines, a Russian charter cargo airline, and a second, in September, for Kaspersky Government Security Solutions Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of Kaspersky Lab, a Russian-based cybersecurity firm.\n\nFlynn and his son also received an unspecified amount in expenses paid by RT for business-class flights to and from Moscow and for their three-day stay at the Hotel Metropol. RT representatives said the stay offered tours of the Kremlin, RT headquarters, the Bolshoi Theater and art museums. Another attendee who took part in some of the tours told The Associated Press they did not see Flynn at those events.\n\nCummings said he has given the Trump administration, the FBI and the Defense Department until April 7 to produce documents related to Flynn's contacts with foreign nationals and any documentation of funds he received from foreign sources.\n\nCummings also asked for documents about Flynn's security clearance over the past 10 years. They include how Flynn answered questions about his contact with foreign nationals, his work for foreign governments and businesses, and any international real estate holdings.\n\nThe release of the documents comes one week after Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group, registered with the Justice Department as foreign agents whose lobbying work may have benefited the government of Turkey.\n\nThe registration involved $530,000 worth of lobbying that Flynn's firm performed for a company owned by a Turkish businessman. In that filing, Flynn acknowledged the lobbying on behalf of the company, Inovo BV, \"could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.\"\n\nThe AP reported last week that while Flynn was under consideration for the top national security post, his attorneys informed the presidential transition team that it was likely he would have to register as a foreign agent. After Flynn was appointed, his attorneys then notified the White House counsel's office that a filing was imminent.\n\nThe White House initially said it had no recollection of the second discussion but later acknowledged such a contact had occurred.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/17/flynn-was-paid-67g-by-russian-interests-documents-say.html"}, {"text": "Now we\u2019re talking real money.\n\nWith President Trump detailing the budget cuts he would make to pay for his sharp rise in defense spending, the battle for control of the swamp is getting under way.\n\nThe apocalyptic reaction, led by the media, reminds me of 1981, when Ronald Reagan proposed what were then described as draconian proposals to slash the budget. Trump\u2019s cutbacks are far larger. And it\u2019s worth noting that while Reagan got much of what he wanted, the federal budget wound up being bigger by the end of his tenure, and he didn\u2019t eliminate a major agency.\n\nBut even the smaller cuts that Trump wants to make are hard because every program in that gargantuan budget has a fiercely loyal constituency backed up by lobbyists who know how many jobs would be lost and in which congressional districts.\n\nThose who don\u2019t want their programs slashed have a built-in PR advantage. They can generate coverage of real-life victims who would be hurt by the withdrawal of this or that federal subsidy, while the other side has to make abstract arguments: Government is too wasteful, the deficit is out of control, we\u2019re living beyond our means.\n\nA Washington Post headline: \u201cMassive cuts to the arts, science and the poor.\u201d\n\nA New York Times headline: \u201cTrump Proposes Eliminating the Arts and Humanities Endowments.\u201d\n\nA Huffington Post headline: \"Trump Government Bloodletting.\"\n\nA BuzzFeed headline: \u201cSlash and Bird\u201d\u2014with a picture of Big Bird, since Trump would end aid to PBS, along with National Public Radio.\n\nSome of this is part of a culture war, and Republicans have tried before to zero out PBS. While big-city stations and programs like \u201cNews Hour\u201d and \u201cSesame Street\u201d would survive, some of the smaller of PBS\u2019s 350 stations would be faced with extinction.\n\nAnother Washington Post story ticks off some of the subsidized services that lower-income people rely upon:\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a poor person in America, Trump\u2019s budget is not for you.\u201d It \u201cwould slash or abolish programs that have provided low-income Americans with help on virtually all fronts, including affordable housing, banking, weatherizing homes, job training, paying home heating oil bills, and obtaining legal counsel in civil matters.\u201d\n\nA New York Times piece says that many Trump voters would be among those penalized:\n\n\u201cSome of the budget losers, it turns out, may be some of the very constituencies that have been most supportive of the new president during his improbable rise to power.\n\n\u201cWhile border guards will have more prisons to lock up unauthorized immigrants, rural communities will lose grants and loans to build water facilities and financing to keep their airports open. As charter schools are bolstered, after-school and summer programs will lose money. As law enforcement agents get more help to fight the opioid epidemic, lower-income Americans will have less access to home energy aid, job training programs and legal services.\u201d\n\nAll this is true. It\u2019s also the price that must be paid to slim down government\u2014although Trump is demanding deeper cuts in part to offset his proposed $54-billion boost in defense spending and his planned tax cuts.\n\nOf course, some agencies employ the Washington Monument defense, singling out the services that will most outrage the public as opposed to the training and research programs where much of the fact may lie. (No threat to close the monument this year, since it\u2019s already shut down for repairs.)\n\nIt\u2019s reminiscent in some ways of the ObamaCare debate, where the rallying cry of repealing the program is being tempered by the impact on millions of Americans who could lose their coverage.\n\nNo president gets everything they want in a budget.

We have hit the debt ceiling and the federal government is taking what is called \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to keep us solvent until Congress either balances the budget at current levels or raises the ceiling again.\n\nOf the debt, more than a quarter of that money is owed to ourselves through IOUs issued to the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds, the Federal Reserve and other intergovernment entities, about 32 percent is owed to governments around the world, including approximately $1.1 Trillion to the government of Japan and $1 Trillion to China, and the remainder is owed to private banks and individual investors in everything from savings bonds to mutual fund holdings of government Treasury bills.\n\nAnd the situation is not getting better.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office reports that overall federal government spending has increased by approximately $1.13 Trillion over the past decade, while tax revenues have increased by $699 Billion with the result being a more than doubling of our national debt during the previous ten years. To make matters worse, while the national debt has been skyrocketing, our nation\u2019s economy has not grown by more than 3 percent since 2005 which used to be considered normal growth, causing our overall debt to GDP to increase to an unsustainable 107 percent.\n\nFortunately, we currently enjoy historically low interest rates, keeping total interest payments on the debt at a mere $433 billion, a number which dwarfs every discretionary budget expenditure except defense and is about 70 percent of the Pentagon budget. The most alarming part of our nation\u2019s interest costs, is that they are completely dependent upon demand for our government debt on the open market.\n\nA January 2017 report by the Congressional Budget Office projects, \u201cBecause of rising interest rates and, to a lesser extent, growing federal debt held by the public, the government\u2019s interest payments on that debt rise sharply over the next 10 years\u2014nearly tripling in nominal terms and almost doubling relative to GDP.\u201d\n\nAdd into this mix, the fact that our military has been stretched well beyond its capacity to fight a two-front war, strained from more than fifteen years of constant war fighting and political choices to defer development of big ticket items like a replacement for the nuclear weapon carrying Ohio class submarines even though the existing fleet is reaching the end of its effective life, and the only rational choice is to aggressively cut the discretionary budget now.\n\nAnd that is what President Trump is proposing, difficult, but doable budget cuts beginning the process of reflecting the needs of the nation, not just the wants.\n\nOne of the big differences between and adult and a child is that a child cannot distinguish the difference between a want and a need. But America can no longer afford to be fiscal children.\n\nAs the projected growth of interest payments on the debt threatens to crowd out other spending priorities, the time is now to change our nation\u2019s spending habits with a recognition that the current debate on the discretionary budget only covers one-third of federal government spending.\n\nThe big battle for our nation\u2019s economic security lies in how we are going to fix so-called \u201centitlement spending\u201d which is untouched in the President\u2019s budget outline, along with whether we will choose to lower our highest in the world corporate tax rate that stifles economic growth, job creation and overall tax collections.\n\nHowever, any hope we have to comprehensively change our fiscal spiral to insolvency will be determined by Congress\u2019 reaction to the President\u2019s budget proposals. If they ignore the combined challenge of a need for expensive military upgrades at a time when our deficits provide an existential threat to our nation, interest payments on the debt alone will dictate draconian choices in the near future.\n\nAmerica simply can no longer afford to pretend that we can continue on the current path, President Trump\u2019s budget is a good starting point on our national decision of whether we are going to be adults addressing our nation\u2019s true needs or children disconnected to the looming debt crisis.\n\nIt is that simple.\n\nRichard Manning is president of Americans for Limited Government.

Legally, what did the 2 judges find wrong with the revised travel ban?\n\nPrincipally, that the executive order violates the Establishment Clause in the First Amendment of the Constitution because it discriminates against Muslims. The judges relied not on the detailed language of the executive order, but on several of the remarks President Trump made as a candidate on the campaign trail, even though he later revised his stance on immigrants seeking entry into the U.S.\n\nThe judges largely ignored the President\u2019s justification stated specifically in the ban that he was acting in the interest of national security to protect American citizens from potential terrorists because the 6 banned nations are state sponsors of terrorism (as identified by Congress and President Obama in an anti-terrorism law) and those governments do not assist the U.S. in vetting applicants with background checks.\n\n2.) How unusual is it for a judge to rely so heavily on campaign rhetoric?\n\nIt is extraordinary and well beyond the scope of what judges are supposed to consider. Candidates for office often make statements they don\u2019t entirely mean. Or they later revise or change their views. That is what candidate Trump did. After first claiming he would institute a Muslim ban, he later changed his stance to say that he would ban entry from countries that pose a terrorist threat.\n\nBut these two judges ignored his revised position and accused the President of using national security as a pre-text for banning Muslims. In doing so, the judges were pretending to read President Trump\u2019s mind. It smacks of judicial activism and appears contrary to established law on judicial review. Courts don\u2019t normally consider campaign rhetoric in interpreting a law or executive order.\n\n3.) At the same time, 5 judges on the 9th circuit court of appeals issued their own opinion. What was it?\n\nThis was also unusual. In an unsolicited filing, five Republican-appointed judges on the 9th Circuit (the same court which last month ruled against President Trump\u2019s first travel ban) wrote this in a published opinion:\n\n\u201cWhatever we as individuals may feel about the President or the executive order, the President\u2019s decision was well within the powers of the presidency.\u201d\n\nThese five judges all but accused their colleagues of judicial activism and overreach because they don\u2019t like President Trump or his policies. The five judges recognized that the President has both constitutional (Article 1, Section 8) and statutory authority (the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act) to dictate immigration as it applies to national security threats.\n\n4.) So, what happens next?\n\nThe ruling by the judge in Hawaii can be appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The Maryland ruling would be appealed to the 4th Circuit. They could be reversed on appeal. Or not.\n\nAfter that, the cases could wind their way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, which currently has 8 Justices. Neil Gorsuch, President Trump\u2019s nominee to fill the seat left vacant by Antonin Scalia\u2019s death, is set to begin confirmation hearings next week. It is possible Democrats may try to delay his confirmation vote, leaving a potential 4-4 split on the high court. In that case, the lower appellate court rulings would stand. But if those rulings conflict, it is unclear what would happen.\n\nBut all of this may turn out to be moot. The main part of the travel ban will expire after 90 days.\n\nGregg Jarrett is a Fox News Anchor and former defense attorney.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/03/16/gregg-jarrett-4-things-need-to-know-about-rulings-against-trumps-latest-travel-ban.html"}, {"text": "Sen.

Critics, like Trump, say companies abuse it to hire cheap labor.\n\nThose critical of the program say the time is now for Trump to reform it.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that 900,000 to 1 million individuals are working under H-1B visas in the U.S. today,\u201d said the Goldman Sachs study, which was published in February, \u201cbased on the assumption that most existing visas are renewed for a second term, and that about two-thirds of qualified H-1B visa holders eventually apply for a green card.\u201d\n\nBUSINESSES BRACE FOR TRUMP DECISION ON H-1B VISAS IN WAKE OF SESSIONS PICK\n\nLast week, when asked about progress on H-1B visa reform, Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Trump was reviewing the issue. He did not offer a timetable on when Trump would make changes to the visa program but an executive order revamping it is reportedly under review.\n\n\u201cThe president's actions that he's taken in terms of his executive order and other revamping of immigration policy have focused on our border security, keeping our country safe, our people safe. And then, obviously, whether it's H-1B visas or the other one \u2013 spousal visas \u2013 other areas of student visas,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cI think there is a natural desire to have a full look at \u2013 a comprehensive look at that.\u201d\n\nThe H-1B visa is an employment-based, non-immigrant visa category for temporary workers. To obtain one, an employer must offer a foreigner a job and then apply for his or her H-1B visa petition with the U.S. Immigration Department. Under the visa, the foreigner is allowed to work but is required to return home after five years \u2013 but the work permit could be extended.\n\nThe visa was created so companies could find workers in hard-to-fill, highly specialized positions.\n\nTECH TITANS SLAM TRUMP'S CONTROVERSIAL IMMIGRATION MOVE\n\n\u201cCongress intended the H-1B program to allow an employer to hire a skilled foreign worker in a specialized occupation when the employer could not find an American worker with needed skills and abilities,\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said last year at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.\n\nBut some argue it is being abused to bring in cheaper labor from outside the country. Trump released a statement last year saying H-1B is neither \u201chigh-skilled nor immigration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are temporary foreign workers, imported from abroad, for the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions.\u201d\n\nIn late February, the Trump administration announced that it would temporarily stop allowing expedited applications for H-1B visas \u2013 a change that may be a precursor to a broader overhaul of the visa system.\n\nAlthough H-1B visas are not limited to IT and tech positions, such positions are the ones that would be most affected. According to the Goldman Sachs report, \u201cWhile H-1B visa holders comprise only 0.6-0.7 percent of total U.S. jobs, we estimate they comprise about 12-13 percent of tech-related jobs.\u201d\n\nThis year, the H-1B visa season begins April 1st.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/16/h1-b-critics-urge-trump-to-reform-visa-say-takes-jobs-from-us-workers.html"}, {"text": "Two top senators said Thursday they see \"no indications\" that Trump Tower was surveilled \u201cby any element of the United States government,\u201d in one of the most definitive bipartisan rejections to date of President Trump's wiretapping allegation.\n\nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., issued the statement only hours after Trump told Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson that he would be providing evidence of his claims \u201cvery soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on the information available to us, we see no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election Day 2016,\u201d the statement from Burr and Warner said.\n\nThe language used by the senators was a degree more definitive than that used by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who Wednesday said his committee didn\u2019t \u201chave any evidence\u201d wiretapping took place.\n\nNunes also said there was no \u201cactual tap of Trump Tower,\u201d saying he believed Trump was discussing surveillance in a broad sense when he sent his initial tweet.

Since then, three investigations have been launched -- one by the FBI, one by the House of Representatives and one by the Senate. Are the investigators chasing a phantom, or did this actually happen?\n\nHere is the back story.\n\nObama would not have needed a warrant to authorize surveillance on Trump. Obama was the president and as such enjoyed authority under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to order surveillance on any person in America, without suspicion, probable cause or a warrant.\n\nFISA contemplates that the surveillance it authorizes will be for national security purposes, but this is an amorphous phrase and an ambiguous standard that has been the favorite excuse of most modern presidents for extraconstitutional behavior.\n\nIn the early 1970s, President Richard Nixon used national security as a pretext to deploying the FBI and CIA to spy on students and even to break in to the office of the psychiatrist of Daniel Ellsberg, one of his tormentors.\n\nFISA was enacted in the late 1970s to force the federal government to focus its surveillance activities -- its domestic national security-based spying -- on only those people who were more likely than not agents of a foreign government. Because FISA authorizes judges on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to make rules and establish procedures for surveillance -- essentially lawmaking -- in secret, the public and the media have been largely kept in the dark about the nature and extent of the statute and the legal and moral rationale for the federal government's spying on everyone in the U.S.\n\nThe mass spying that these judges have ruled FISA authorizes is directly counter to the wording, meaning and purpose of FISA itself, which was enacted to prevent just what it has in fact now unleashed.\n\nWe now know indisputably that this secret FISA court -- whose judges cannot keep records of their own work and have their pockets and briefcases checked by guards as they enter and leave the courthouse -- has permitted all spying on everyone all the time.\n\nThe FISA court only hears lawyers for the government, and they have convinced it that it is more efficient to capture the digital versions of everyone\u2019s phone calls, texts, emails and other digital traffic than it is to force the government -- as the Constitution requires -- to focus on only those who there is reason to believe are more likely than not engaging in unlawful acts.\n\nWhen FISA was written, telephone surveillance was a matter of wiretapping -- installing a wire onto the target\u2019s telephone line, either inside or outside the home or business, and listening to or recording in real time the conversations that were audible on the tapped line.\n\nToday the National Security Agency has 24/7 access to the mainframe computers of all telecom providers and all computer service providers and to all digital traffic carried by fiber optics in the U.S. The NSA has had this access pursuant to FISA court orders issued in 2005 and renewed every 90 days. The FISA court has based its rulings on its own essentially secret convoluted logic, never subjected to public scrutiny. That has resulted in the universal surveillance state in which we in America now live. The NSA has never denied this.\n\nThus, in 2016, when Trump says the surveillance of him took place, Obama needed only to ask the NSA for a transcript of Trump\u2019s telephone conversations to be prepared from the digital versions that the NSA already possessed. Because the NSA has the digital version of every telephone call made to, from and within the U.S. since 2005, if President Obama last year wanted transcripts of Trump\u2019s calls made at any time, the NSA would have been duty-bound to provide them, just as it would be required to provide transcripts of Obama's calls today if President Trump wanted them.\n\nBut if Obama did order the NSA to prepare transcripts of Trump\u2019s conversations last fall under the pretext of national security -- to find out whether Trump was communicating with the Russians would have been a good excuse -- there would exist somewhere a record of such an order. For that reason, if Obama did this, he no doubt used a source on which he\u2019d leave no fingerprints.\n\nEnter James Bond.\n\nSources have told me that the British foreign surveillance service, the Government Communications Headquarters, known as GCHQ, most likely provided Obama with transcripts of Trump\u2019s calls. The NSA has given GCHQ full 24/7 access to its computers, so GCHQ -- a foreign intelligence agency that, like the NSA, operates outside our constitutional norms -- has the digital versions of all electronic communications made in America in 2016, including Trump\u2019s. So by bypassing all American intelligence services, Obama would have had access to what he wanted with no Obama administration fingerprints.\n\nThus, when senior American intelligence officials denied that their agencies knew about this, they were probably being truthful. Adding to this ominous scenario is the fact that three days after Trump\u2019s inauguration, the head of GCHQ, Robert Hannigan, abruptly resigned, stating that he wished to spend more time with his family.\n\nI hope the investigations of Trump\u2019s allegation discover and reveal the truth -- whatever it is. But the lesson here is terribly serious.\n\nWe face the gravest threat to personal liberty since the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 proscribed criticism of the government.\n\nWe have an unelected, unnamed, unaccountable elite group in the intelligence community manipulating the president at will and possessing intimate, detailed knowledge about all of us that it can reveal.\n\nWe have statutes that have given the president unconstitutional powers that have apparently been used. And we have judges on secret courts facilitating all this as if the Constitution didn\u2019t exist.\n\nFor how much longer will we have freedom?\n\nEditor's Note: A spokesperson for Britain's GCHQ agency has responded to this column.

John McCain, an Arizona Republican, and Rep.

Kenny has made a similar pitch on immigration in the past, but the current U.S. administration's position on illegal immigration has heightened the underlying tension.\n\n\n\nTrump ran on a promise to curtail illegal immigration. His revised travel ban, affecting travelers from six Muslim-majority nations, was set to go effect Thursday before it was put on hold Wednesday by a federal judge in Hawaii.\n\n\n\nKenny also sought to impress upon Trump the difficulties Ireland will face as a result of Britain's decision to leave the European Union. During an evening reception at the White House, he described Ireland as \"a committed member\" of the EU.\n\n\n\nTrump supported the British vote to leave the 28-country bloc -- known as Brexit -- saying earlier this year that it would \"end up being a great thing.\"\n\n\n\nTrump welcomed Kenny to the White House, proclaiming his love for Ireland.

Consider this recent hit job by NBC.\n\n\"Here you have a deranged president, or a pathologically lying president, lying about the operations of the American government and lying about the previous president of the United States,\u201d said an MSNBC host named Lawrence O\u2019Donnell on March 7. \u201cThat's enough to invoke the 25th Amendment, but Mike Pence and the Cabinet are not there yet.\u201d\n\nHis colleague, Chris Matthews, infamously compared Trump to Hitler after the president\u2019s inspired inauguration speech.

They don\u2019t care that there is no evidence whatsoever that shows any kind of collusion.\n\nThe grand dame of the alt-left propaganda media, Rachel Maddow, went off the deep end this week in the midst of her spectacular Trump tax return fail. She claimed that a 2005 transaction with a Russian oligarch proves Trump is a White House plant put in place by the Kremlin. At least, I think that\u2019s what she meant.\n\nTo follow Maddow\u2019s nimble thought process, one must believe the oligarch knew that Donald Trump was going to be president, bought a property from him in Florida for which Trump made a huge profit, all so the future president would be at Russia\u2019s disposal more than a decade later. If that\u2019s the case, NBC should hire the Russian to be its pollster, because the Peacock network thought Trump as president was impossible right up until its anchors had to grudgingly call the election for him.\n\nTwo accomplished journalists at Circa News, Sara Carter and John Solomon have thoroughly and convincingly debunked the Russian conspiracy theory. Last week, they reported that the FBI has found no evidence of collusion between Trump and the Russians, affirming what President Obama\u2019s director of national intelligence, James Clapper, had said.\n\nNow, they have taken their investigation further with a story headlined \"Hillary Clinton supporter pushed Trump-Russia computer narrative investigated by FBI.\"\n\nAccording to the report, computer scientist and Indiana University professor L. Jean Camp pushed the theory to the left-wing media that a computer server connected to Donald Trump was communicating with a Russian bank. The FBI did, in fact, look into it, according to Circa News. They found nothing to indicate collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.\n\nWho is L. Jean Camp? Well, she donated $2,200 to Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. She's also donated over $10,000 to Democratic groups and candidates since 2004, including the radical group Moveon.org.

Both sides of the privatization debate say the system is one of the most complex and safest in the world. The FAA would continue to provide safety oversight of the system under a congressional privatization plan.\n\nAirlines have been lobbying vigorously for the change, saying the FAA's NextGen program to modernize the air traffic system is taking too long and has produced too few benefits. Industry officials say that privatization would remove air traffic operations from the uncertainties of the annual congressional budget process, which have hindered the FAA's ability to make long-term procurement commitments.\n\nThe National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union that represents the FAA's 14,000 controllers, is also backing privatization. Union officials have complained that the FAA has been unable to resolve chronic controller understaffing at some of the nation's busiest facilities, and they say they've become discouraged by the modernization effort's slow progress.\n\nBut FAA Administrator Michael Huerta told an aviation industry conference earlier this month that the agency has made \"tremendous progress\" over the past decade in updating its computers and other equipment in order to move from a radar-based to a satellite-based control system. The modernization program has already delivered $2.7 billion in benefits to airlines and other users of the system, and the FAA expects to produce another $13 billion in benefits by 2020, he said.\n\nAirlines have an important ally in Rep. Bill Shuster, R-Pa., the House transportation committee chairman. The committee approved an aviation bill sponsored by Shuster last year that would have removed air traffic operations from the FAA and placed them under the control of a private, nonprofit corporation. The bill would also have protected the controllers' wages and benefits and continued their union representation.\n\nOpposition to the bill from other powerful House committee chairmen who oppose ceding Congress' oversight of the air traffic system to a private entity prevented Shuster from bringing the bill before the entire House for a vote. Lobbying groups representing business aircraft operators, private pilots and small and medium-sized airports also oppose privatization. They say they fear airlines will dominate the corporation's board and that they'll be asked to pay more to support the system while facing reduced services.\n\nShuster received $148,499 in airline industry campaign contributions in the 2016 election, making him the industry's top recipient in the House, according to the political money tracking site Opensecrets.org. Shuster was also an early House backer of Trump's presidential campaign, and campaigned with him in Pennsylvania three times.

The industry also has pushed back strongly on claims it skimps on rehabilitative programs like job training.\n\n\u201cWe do not believe in cost-cutting for profit's sake as critics like the ACLU contend,\u201d Pablo Paez, vice president of corporate relations for top private prison provider GEO Group, told Fox News. \u201cInstead we believe in running an efficient operation that provides adequate staffing and relies on state of the art technology for monitoring, communication, health care and rehabilitation programs.\u201d\n\nBut critics point to a Justice Department audit that found private facilities have more safety and security problems than government-run ones. In moving to phase out these operations, the Obama administration also cited the decline in the federal prison population.\n\nCritics also allege some for-profit prison providers enjoy a cozy relationship with Sessions.\n\n\u201cJeff Sessions is a private prison enthusiast,\u201d said Donald Cohen, executive director of In the Public Interest, a left-leaning Washington non-profit.\n\nA private prison \u2013 also known as a for-profit prison \u2013 is run by a third party that is contracted by a government agency.\n\nIn the U.S., there are two leading private prison providers \u2013 GEO Group and CoreCivic (formerly known as Corrections Corp. of America). Both companies donated heavily to Republicans during the 2016 election cycle and both have seen their share prices double in value since President Trump\u2019s White House win.\n\nGEO maintains it has never taken a position or been an advocate for or against any criminal justice, sentencing or immigration policy. Paez says the company\u2019s \u201ccontributions should not be construed as an endorsement of all policies or positions adopted by any individual candidate.\u201d\n\nPrivate prisons were virtually non-existent in the 1980s but shot up more than 1,600 percent between 1990 and 2009. As incarceration rates continued to climb, the private prison industry grew with it \u2013 expanding at exponential rates.\n\nAs the Obama administration began to put a damper on that growth, Democratic presidential contenders Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders both vowed to keep the Obama directive during last year's campaign.\n\nShares of GEO and CoreCivic (formerly Corrections Corporation of America) tumbled.\n\nBut with Trump\u2019s surprise November win and Sessions in place as the country\u2019s top cop, the private prison industry has recouped its losses and is currently on track for a substantial windfall.\n\nThe market capitalization of GEO has roughly doubled to $3.7 billion; CoreCivic\u2019s market capitalization is more than $4 billion.\n\nIn the Public Interest said the policy change didn\u2019t come as a total shock.\n\nSessions backs a no-holds-barred approach to going after drug and violent crime offenders. In a Feb. 21 memo, the former Alabama Republican senator said Obama\u2019s efforts to end privatization had \u201cimpaired\u201d the U.S. Bureau of Prison\u2019s \u201cability to meet the future needs of the federal correctional system.\u201d\n\nSessions' comments indicate he expects a significant rise in people being incarcerated, though the number of federal prisoners has been on the decline since 2013. It is now at its lowest rate in a decade. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, there are 189,041 total federal inmates. Of those, 11 percent or 21,359 federal inmates are held in private prisons.\n\nTrump's illegal immigration crackdown, though, could represent one area where the administration hopes to employ private facilities.\n\nNina DiSalvo, executive director of Towards Justice, a Colorado-based nonprofit that represents low-wage workers, told The Washington Post that Trump\u2019s pledge to deport 2 million to 3 million undocumented immigrants creates an environment where for-profit prisons could make millions detaining and deporting those who cross the border illegally.\n\nCohen believes Sessions\u2019 motives run deeper.\n\n\u201cAs Alabama\u2019s attorney general, Sessions green-lighted their use in the state, and shortly after the Obama Justice Department\u2019s original announcement, GEO Group ... hired two former Sessions aides as lobbyists,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nThe Justice Department did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Fox News.\n\nPrivate prison companies operating in the United States handle facilities and inmates for the federal Bureau of Prisons, the U.S. Marshals Service and the Department of Homeland Security \u2013 which includes detainees from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nWith government contracts worth millions of dollars on the line, groups like the American Civil Liberties Union argue that a profit motive introduces perverse incentives into the job of running prisons.\n\nThe less a prison spends per inmate on things like health care, upkeep and security, the more it can make monetarily, they say.\n\n\u201cCertain private prison companies employ shrewd tactics to obtain more and more government contracts to incarcerate prisoners,\u201d the 2011 ACLU report \u201cBanking on Bondage: Private Prisons and Mass Incarceration,\u201d claimed. The report said tactics include: \u201cuse of questionable financial incentives; benefitting from the \u2018revolving door\u2019 between public and private corrections; extensive lobbying; lavish campaign contributions; and efforts to control information.\u201d\n\nSafety concerns also have been cited. After a well-documented 2010 escape from an Arizona private prison, an Arizona Department of Corrections audit revealed that prison staff hired by Management & Training Corp. were \"fairly green,\" \"not proficient with weapons,\" and habitually ignored sounding alarms.\n\nAround the same time, at least 28 riots were documented in private prisons in Arizona, as well as more than 200 other \"disturbances\" involving dozens of inmates.\n\nEarlier this month, a federal judge green-lighted a 2014 lawsuit filed against GEO to continue as a class-action lawsuit. It\u2019s the first time a class-action lawsuit accusing a private prison company of violating federal anti-slavery laws has been allowed to move forward.\n\nThe suit centers on conditions at the 1,500-bed prison at the Denver Contract Detention Facility. The prison, owned and operated by GEO Group, is accused of using tens of thousands of immigrants detained by ICE to work for $1 a day \u2013 or for free.\n\nGEO maintains it did nothing wrong.\n\n\u201cWe have consistently, strongly refuted these allegations, and we intend to continue to vigorously defend our company against these claims,\u201d Paez told Fox News. \u201cThe volunteer work program at immigration facilities as well as the wage rates and standards associated with the program are set by the Federal government. Our facilities, including the Aurora, Colo. Facility are highly rated and provide high-quality services in safe, secure and humane residential environments pursuant to the federal government\u2019s national standards.\u201d\n\nIn addition to allegations of forced labor at private prisons, there have also been accusations of collusion.\n\nIn 2011, for example, Pennsylvania Judge Mark Ciavarella was convicted of racketeering, racketeering conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy in connection with payments received from a private prison developer.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/16/trump-administration-reversal-on-private-prison-use-faces-pitfalls.html"}, {"text": "A hacker used McDonald's Twitter account to attack President Donald Trump in an extremely derogatory tweet early Thursday.\n\nSent at 9:16 a.m. ET Thursday morning, McDonald's tweeted: \"@realDonaldTrump You are actually a disgusting excuse of a President and we would love to have @BarackObama back, also you have tiny hands.\"\n\nHACKERS HIJACK TWITTER ACCOUNTS WITH SWASTIKAS, 'NAZI HOLLAND' MESSAGES\n\nThe tweet, which was sent out to the 151,000 followers of the @McDonaldsCorp account, was retweeted more than 200 times, before being deleted.\n\nUh oh...it appears that McDonald's corporate twitter account has been compromised in some way.

A federal judge in Hawaii issued an injunction against the updated travel ban on Wednesday, a maneuver that could send the matter back to the same, oft-criticized Ninth Circuit which covers Hawaii.\n\nThe development comes as three judges from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals testified Thursday at a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing on proposals to split the circuit. It is the largest of the 13 U.S. Courts of Appeals and has a reputation for being ultra-liberal and frequently overruled by the Supreme Court.\n\nVanderbilt Law School Professor Brian Fitzpatrick pointed to what he called the \"indisputable\" fact that the circuit has the highest reversal rate of any court of appeals, and said one of the reasons for this was its size.\n\n\"If we go to smaller circuits we reduce the number of outlier\n\ndecisions the court malkes,\u201d he said. \"Smaller courts lead to fewer outlier decisions.\"\n\nCircuit judges disagreed with Fitzpatrick, and said it would lead to other problems.\n\n\"It would certainly increase delay on the appelate level, not decrease delay,\" Chief Judge Sidney Thomas told lawmakers. Thomas also said the vast majority of judges on the circuit are against breaking it up.

It gives $2.6 billion for \u201chigh-priority infrastructure and border security technology\u201d including funding to construct a \u201cphysical\u201d border wall.

Federal Work-Study is reduced and also reorganized to better be allocated to those undergraduate students most in need. More than 20 categorical programs \u201cthat do not address national needs\u201d are reduced or eliminated.\n\nHousing and Urban Development\n\nDECREASE: $6.2 billion, 13.2 percent\n\nHUD\u2019s rental assistance program is reformed and funding is eliminated for lower priority programs and Section 4 Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing.

The notion is that, since it applies to majority Muslim countries, and an Egyptian imam with American citizenship has a Syrian mother-in-law who would be affected, the order violates the First Amendment\u2019s \u201cno establishment\u201d clause. The court\u2019s reasoning is contorted. Worse, the ruling sets a dangerous precedent.\n\nNever mind that the asserted injury is intangible, attenuated and hard to conceive, and that the object of this temporary visa delay is a non-American who hails from a country suffused with terror. Never mind that the First Amendment\u2019s \u201cno establishment\u201d and \u201cfree exercise\u201d clauses apply to Americans.\n\nNever mind the bold imputation of bad faith to a sitting President of the United States, along with his Secretaries of Homeland Security, State, Defense and Attorney General. Never mind supposition that the countries to which the restriction applies were identified by the prior administration as \u201ccountries of concern,\u201d each warranting extra caution.\n\nAll of this is of no matter. Instead, waving the wand of judicial activism, the judge gave his ruling national effect. More, he declared the \u201cillogic of the Government\u2019s contentions\u2026 palpable.\u201d If that is not contempt by a judge, and Obama appointee, for the Executive Branch, one is hard pressed to imagine what contempt looks like.\n\nDespite this ill-advised ruling and juridical hubris, the Ninth Circuit US Court of Appeals will likely to uphold the lower court. This is not because the lower court is correct, but because that misguided Circuit \u2013 of which Hawaii is a part \u2013 has become a bastion of unelected, unaccountable, unrestrained redefinition of the Constitution in their own activist image.\n\nNotorious for judicial overreach and eye-popping inferences, this ruling goes further. It not only shows disregard for strict construction of the Constitution\u2019s words, betrayal of textual fidelity, as well as of original intent and judicial restraint. It does more.\n\nThis judge \u2013 and likely the Ninth Circuit \u2013 seems prepared to assume not just power to \u201csay what the law is,\u201d but power to \u201csay what national security is.\u201d In doing so, the Court and Circuit upend the considered judgments of two administrations and Congress as to countries presenting undue risk to America \u2013 and requiring more intense vetting.\n\nThe irony is that none of these esteemed judges, arrogating to themselves this national security power, appear to have any experience vetting foreign nationals who possess no documentation and emerge from a country internationally recognized as a terrorist haven. The sheer scope of the judicial arrogation is breathtaking.\n\nAs a former Assistant Secretary of State for a chiefly functional bureau, part of my assigned job was to assist military and civilian discussions, assessments, and implementation of screening or so-called vetting of foreign nationals in certain parts of the world to become police officers, including in Iraq.\n\nThese individuals often had no written records. They came from war-torn sub-regions of Iraq. Their past lives were material to judging whether they could be trusted. Their life stories were complicated, hard to disentangle, corroborate and confirm. Nevertheless, doing that was essential. How much more essential if they were coming to the United States?\n\nThese facts affected the level of trust with which individuals could be invested. A wide range of questions, including personal, family, tribal and professional affiliations were relevant. In sum, vetting those emerging from war-torn, terror-infested countries is inordinately hard and takes time.\n\nNo matter. Watch what is about to happen. Judicial activism will hold sway. By hold sway, I mean that \u2013 until we have a fully loaded Supreme Court bench \u2013 the Ninth Circuit will be allowed to place the Nation at risk by assuming to itself this national security power. Objectively, that usurpation of Executive Branch power seems dangerous.\n\nHistorically, I cannot think of a similar period in which the external threats to our national security, level of popular concern about security, and basis for both assessments were as high, and yet judicial temperament so out of sync with core realities and established institutional prerogatives.\n\nI could be wrong of course. The Ninth Circuit may surprise me. They may recognize the President\u2019s inherent authority, narrowed anti-terror travel order, nonsensical nature of blocking a national security order on grounds of religious demography. They may reverse. If so, I will be surprised. So far, the circuit has disappointed constitutional scholars and security experts.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Derrick Watson gives Hawaii and the Muslim leader \"a strong likelihood of success on their claim\" that our President crafted the order not to secure America from the growing international terrorist threat, but strictly from religious animus.

On March 22-23, his Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, will host foreign ministers from 68 countries to discuss how to significantly improve our combined efforts to crush ISIS once and for all. In April, Mr. Trump and Vice President Pence will reportedly host a summit for Sunni Arab leaders towards the same end.\n\nIt is useful, therefore, to consider the question: at present, are we winning or losing the war against the Islamic State?\n\nFirst, some context. Americans were initially blindsided by the murderous rise of ISIS, as was the rest of the civilized world.\n\nHaving been famously assured by President Obama that this movement previously known as al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) was not a serious threat \u2013 merely a \u201cjayvee squad\u201d \u2013 we all watched in horror as ISIS fighters carrying black flags launched a stunningly successful military offensive in the summer of 2014. By August, a group most people had never heard of had captured of a swath of territory in Iraq and Syria larger than Great Britain.\n\nTheir jihadists beheaded and crucified their enemies and posted the gruesome videos on the Internet. They systematically slaughtered, raped, enslaved, forcibly converted and expelled Christians, Yazidis and Shia Muslims from their territory.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it soon became clear that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and his senior leaders truly believed that the End of Days had come and that by establishing the caliphate and fomenting chaos and carnage in the Levant they could hasten the coming of their so-called messiah known as the Mahdi, with Jesus as his deputy, to establish a global Islamic kingdom.\n\nClearly, this was not your garden variety group of militant Islamists. These were followers of a brand of genocidal Apocalyptic Islam the world had never seen before.\n\nMr. Obama, who had declared the war in Iraq over, and thus removed all U.S. forces from Iraq, at the end of 2011, was suddenly forced to launch a new military campaign there. By 2015, he and his team were insisting that the tide had been turned and we were winning the war, a case they continued to make until they left office.\n\nBut that\u2019s not how most Americans see it.\n\nLast month, I asked McLaughlin & Associates, a respected U.S. polling firm whose clients included the Trump campaign, to conduct a national survey to better understand how Americans view the war against the Islamic State. What we found was sobering.\n\nOnly one-in-three Americans believe \u201cthe U.S. and our allies are winning the war against the Islamic State and getting safer every day.\u201d\n\nA remarkable 41 percent believe \u201cthe U.S. and our allies are losing the war against the Islamic State and the threat to our safety is growing.\u201d\n\nFully one-in-four say they had no idea if we\u2019re winning or not.\n\nWe also found that almost seven-in-ten Americans (68%) said they \u201cfear catastrophic terrorist attacks by ISIS are coming to the U.S. homeland, possibly involving chemical or biological weapons.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that progress in the fight against ISIS has been made. An estimated 50,000 ISIS fighters have been killed, including some top operatives. Coalition forces are retaking land and cities in Iraq. Mosul will soon be liberated. Perhaps Raqqa, too.\n\nBut the evidence clearly indicates the ISIS message is metastasizing like a deadly cancer across the planet. Senior U.S. officials \u2013 current and former \u2013 tell me they believe ISIS fighters who hold foreign passports are retreating from the battlefield and repositioning themselves to launch a tsunami of terror across Europe and the U.S.\n\nISIS has built a global terrorist network. They have drawn recruits from 120 countries, and have killed 1,200 people in countries outside of Iraq and Syria over the past several years.\n\nU.S. officials believe that more than 250 Americans traveled to Syria to participate in the civil war, or attempted to. How many have now returned home, with ISIS training and experience? That is not yet clear.\n\nWe do know that since 2014, 117 people have been arrested in the U.S. for connection to ISIS terror plots. In 2016 alone, 37 suspects were arrested in 18 U.S. States on ISIS-related charges.\n\nCurrently, there are at least 1,000 active FBI cases into terrorist plots underway, including investigations in all 50 states, and most are related to ISIS.\n\nThe bottom line is troubling: we are winning battles, but losing the war.\n\nPresident Trump is absolutely right to ask his advisors to design and execute a war plan that will achieve victory, and significantly improve homeland security policies to keep the American people safe from attack. ISIS is coming. God forbid we let ourselves be blindsided.\n\nJoel C. Rosenberg is the bestselling author of novels and non-fiction books about the Middle East.

If I have health insurance, will it get me the tests and treatment I need? If I pay a high premium, can it go toward lowering my deductible? If I choose a high deductible, will my premiums be lower? If I have pneumonia, will I have to wait to see my doctor behind someone who has a cold?\n\nWill I have coverage but not access to the health care I need?\n\n2010-2016\n\nObamaCare has failed on all fronts. While the state exchanges claim they insure close to 20 million people, including more than 11 million on Medicaid, they have provided heavily subsidized (up to 80 percent) policies with high premiums and high deductibles (up to $13,000 on a bronze plan) serviced by narrow networks of doctors offering restricted services.\n\nIn offices throughout the country, including mine, patients are reluctant to see their doctors until they\u2019ve met their deductible \u2014 and then they immediately begin to overuse their insurance at every opportunity.\n\nEach plan includes 10 essential health benefits you can get without paying a copay or deductible, including mammograms, colonoscopies prescription drug coverage, [SB1] STD screenings, maternity care, mental health services and treatment for alcohol, smoking and drug addiction.\n\nIt sounds great \u2014 until you consider how much you pay for services you may not need.\n\nPremiums rose under ObamaCare because pre-existing conditions were covered and everyone had to share in paying for them.\n\nIn a country where 5 percent of the people consume 50 percent of the health care, it became necessary to convince young, healthy people to buy insurance or pay a penalty/tax. But it didn\u2019t work.\n\nIn 2014, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, only 28 percent of enrollees in Affordable Care Act policies (not covered under their parents\u2019 plan) were between 18 and 34 years old, and a whopping 45 percent of taxpayers who chose to pay a penalty or claimed an exemption (also not on their parents\u2019 plan) were under 35.\n\nNot only is it unethical to force people to buy insurance when it doesn\u2019t guarantee a person\u2019s actual health care (since you can\u2019t force doctors to accept that insurance), but premiums and deductibles have risen out of control anyway.\n\n2017\n\nThe American Health Care Act being debated in Congress does away with the unethical mandates, a very good place to start. The subsidies are being replaced by tax credits based more on age than income, ranging from $2,000 a year for those under 30 to $4,000 for those over 60 who earn up to $75,000 (the credit decreases incrementally for those who earn more than $75,000).\n\nTax credits can be a useful incentive if connected to an a la carte menu of health care choices, rather than the ObamaCare prix fixe menu of options you will rarely or never use. [SB4] But [SB5] the bill does not get rid of the essential benefits, it does not move those with pre-existing conditions to separate high-risk pools and it does not create a national marketplace \u2014 at least not yet. [SB6]\n\nWithout these changes, there is no reason to think outrageous premiums or deductibles will come down. The expanded health savings accounts in the proposed law will increase choice and make patients more aware of what they are paying for, but they should accumulate year-to-year and be transferable from one family member to the next.\n\nI hope HHS Secretary Tom Price will stick to his promise to remove many of ObamaCare's onerous regulations. That will also increase choice and potentially lower premiums.\n\nThe bill also needs a catastrophic policy option \u2014 a low-cost, minimum-coverage policy that protects patients and hospitals from high bills for emergencies, including surgeries. Vaccines and addiction treatment represent public health needs and should also remain included.\n\nBut it is a stretch to say that the government is right to mandate no copayment for colonoscopies and mammograms, especially when they often lead to unnecessary biopsies that drive up costs.\n\nLarge health insurance companies use fear of sickness and death to drive sales, yet exercise and diet are still our best preventive measures. The last thing we need is for everyone\u2019s premium to cover a useless weight loss consultation between an obese doctor and an obese patient.\n\nAll doctors would rather see a patient\u2019s credit card than an insurance card. Incentivizing primary care training and paying primary care doctors more will ease the burden that ObamaCare has added at the doctor\u2019s office.\n\nPreserving the federally funded Medicaid expansion but converting it to a more efficient model led by Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services new head Seema Verma, with bridges to jobs and premiums for more substantial services, will keep millions with Medicaid from losing their coverage.\n\nIt\u2019s that simple.\n\nMarc Siegel MD is a professor of medicine and medical director of Doctor Radio at NYU Langone Medical Center.

But voters revolted over the Voting Rights Act, big spending, Vietnam and racial unrest. Republicans picked up a staggering 47 House seats. But the Democrats\u2019 distended House majority shrank only from 295 seats to 248 seats. Democrats maintained the majority.\n\nThen there was 1994.\n\nRepublicans flipped control of the House for the first time in 40 years, pocketing an eye-popping 54 seats. Analysts viewed the GOP\u2019s triumphs as a repudiation to President Bill Clinton\u2019s failed efforts at health care reform and gun control provisions in a major crime bill.\n\nAnd of course, consider 2010.\n\nWith President Obama in in the White House and big majorities in the House and Senate, Democrats approved a massive stimulus package, ObamaCare and the financial reform measure now known as Dodd-Frank. Climate legislation called \u201ccap and trade\u201d eked its way through the House of Representatives but died in the Senate.\n\nRepublicans reclaimed the House in the 2010 midterm elections, winning an astonishing 63 seats.\n\nCongressional Republicans are mindful of this midterm phenomenon which waylays members of a first-term president in the initial midterm. GOP strategists fret about what could happen if they fail to deliver on promises to repeal and replace ObamaCare, construct a border wall and approve tax reform.\n\nBut consider the converse \u2026\n\nWhat happens if Republicans are successful in their efforts to repeal and replace ObamaCare?\n\nRepublicans now occupy 237 House seats, down from their high-water mark of 241 before several resignations. Political parties don\u2019t capture these big majorities in Congress to sit on them. They win these seats to execute major legislative initiatives \u2026 and burn seats in the process.\n\nVice President Pence descended on Capitol Hill twice Wednesday to huddle with House Republicans. He met midday with the Republican Study Committee (RSC), the largest bloc of conservatives in the House. Pence returned in the late afternoon for confabs with the \u201cTuesday Group,\u201d a coalition of 50-plus moderate Republicans. The vice president then talked to the entire House Republican Conference.\n\n\u201cThis president and this administration are standing shoulder-to-shoulder with you,\u201d said Pence to the GOP Conference, according to a source in the room. \u201cWe\u2019re going to support this bill.\u201d\n\nAnd what about those who don\u2019t?\n\nThe House Republican whip operation sprang into action Wednesday night, checking in with rank-and-file members. Are they yea? A nay? Lean yes? Lean no? Undecided?\n\nThe GOP can only lose 22 votes before the bill is toast.\n\n\u201cThis bill is a win for conservatives,\u201d boasted House Budget Committee Chairwoman Diane Black, R-Tenn.\n\nThere\u2019s a plan to mollify conservatives by offering a slate of at least four non-binding motions to gin up conservative votes for the health care bill. Those motions include more state flexibility for Medicaid, work requirements for childless, able-bodied persons in order to receive Medicaid, ending the Medicaid expansion at the end of this year and some changes in tax credits to true deductions.\n\nConsider the challenges some lawmakers face to support the bill. Look at Reps. Martha McSally, R-Ariz.; Hal Rogers, R-Ky.; and David Valadao, R-Calif. McSally represents one of the most-prominent battleground districts in the country. Hillary Clinton won McSally\u2019s district with 49 percent of the vote. President Trump scored 44 percent. Moderates like McSally met with Pence. That group argued they are the \u201cmajority makers.\u201d In other words, Republicans wouldn\u2019t control the House without them. So, moderates ask why conservatives who win their districts by large margins aren\u2019t the ones taking a hit. Meantime, if Republicans \u201cscrew up\u201d the health care bill, Republicans could risk losing those seats \u2013 and the majority \u2013 if moderate GOPers vote yea.\n\nValadao represents one of the poorest districts in the nation. Nearly half of his constituents are on Medicaid. Medicaid cuts could be devastating. Then there is Rogers. He represents a rural, \u201colder\u201d district where Medicaid is popular. Never mind how many people in Rogers\u2019s district gained insurance for the first time under ObamaCare. A \u201cwrong\u201d vote by these lawmakers could spell disaster at the polls.\n\nBlack may tout what the bill does for conservatives. But the trick to passing the bill could center on how GOP leaders lure moderates.\n\nRep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., represents a district with the highest percentage of seniors in New Jersey. He said moderates told Pence during their meeting that altering the Medicaid expansion date is \u201ca non-starter for us.\u201d\n\nMacArthur took a pass when pressed if conservatives were scoring wins in the bill and moderates would have to pick up the slack and vote yes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to react to that,\u201d said MacArthur. \u201cThis is not about the politics between moderates and conservatives.\u201d\n\nBut MacArthur conceded that conservative and moderate Republicans come from \u201cdifferent tribes\u201d within the same family. He added that \u201ca lot of the work gets done here on the backs of centrist Republicans.\u201d\n\nMany Republicans like MacArthur represent districts that could trend Democratic under the right circumstances. History shows that historic midterm elections sometimes unfold just two years after a new President assumes office.\n\nThe Republican brain trust may want to repeal and replace ObamaCare. They don\u2019t have the votes to do so yet.\n\nPolitical parties don\u2019t score these big majorities just to sit on them. Want to repeal and replace ObamaCare? Republicans may have to burn the seats of vulnerable members from battleground districts to get there.

Mulvaney acknowledged to reporters that passing the cuts could be an uphill struggle and said the administration would negotiate over replacement cuts.\n\nThe battle was joined almost immediately on Capitol Hill.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called the proposed cuts \u201cdevastating to the middle class.\u201d\n\nHe said in a statement, \u201cOnce again the Trump administration is showing its true colors: talk like a populist but govern like a special interests zealot. \u2026 Democrats in Congress will emphatically oppose these cuts and urge our Republican colleagues to reject them as well.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., gave a more positive assessment.\n\n\u201cI welcome the president\u2019s blueprint for next year\u2019s budget, which turns the page from the last eight years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are determined to work with the administration to shrink the size of government, grow our economy, secure our borders, and ensure our troops have the tools necessary to complete their missions. I look forward to reviewing this with the Appropriations Committee and our entire conference.\u201d\n\nThe Trump proposal covers only a quarter of the roughly $4 trillion federal budget -- representing the \u201cdiscretionary\u201d portion that Congress passes each year. It doesn't address taxes, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, or make predictions about deficits and the economy. Those big-picture details are due in mid-May, and are sure to show large -- probably permanent -- budget deficits. Trump has vowed not to cut Social Security and Medicare and is dead set against raising taxes.\n\nWhile law enforcement agencies like the FBI would be spared in the budget plan, 12 of the government's 15 Cabinet agencies would absorb cuts under the president's proposal. The biggest losers are Agriculture, Labor, State, and the Cabinet-level EPA.\n\nThe plan calls for cutting the EPA by 31 percent over current levels. More than 3,000 EPA workers would lose their jobs and programs such as Obama's Clean Power Plan, which would tighten regulations on emissions from power plants seen as contributing to global warming, would be eliminated. Popular EPA grants for state and local drinking and wastewater projects would be preserved, however, even as research into climate change would be eliminated.\n\nAt the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development, Trump seeks a 28 percent reduction. This will have a big impact on foreign aid, but the plan says this would \u201cfree up funding for critical priorities here at home and put America first.\u201d\n\nThe Defense Department, Department of Homeland Security and Department of Veterans Affairs, meanwhile, are the winners in the budget blueprint.\n\nThe budget also increases user fees, boosting the airline ticket tax by $1 per one-way trip. It would also slash subsidies for the federal flood insurance program that's a linchpin for the real estate market, especially in coastal southern states and the Northeast.\n\nTrump's proposal will face resistance from Capitol Hill, and not just with opposition Democrats outraged over cuts to pet programs such as renewable energy, climate change research and rehabilitation of housing projects.\n\nRepublicans like Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio are irate over planned elimination of a program to restore the Great Lakes.

A temporary catchall spending bill expires April 28; negotiations have barely started and could get hung up over Trump's request for the wall and additional border patrol and immigration enforcement agents, just for starters.\n\nSome of the most politically sensitive domestic programs would be spared, including food aid for pregnant women and their children, housing vouchers for the poor, aid for special education and school districts for the poor, and federal aid to historically black colleges and universities.\n\nBut the National Institutes of Health would absorb a $5.8 billion cut despite Trump's talk in a recent address to Congress of finding \"cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us.\" Subsidies for airlines serving rural airports in Trump strongholds would be eliminated.

It\u2019s that it wasn\u2019t treated as a serious news story.\n\nInstead, the MSNBC anchor turned it into a long, arduous, embarrassingly partisan spectacle that was widely mocked, even by some on the left.\n\nIf she had just handled it as a straight news story, she would have been fine. Instead, she wound up fumbling away her scoop.\n\nAs Maddow touted and tweeted and just plain delayed, she gave the White House time to put out the tax information\u2014Trump paid $38 million in taxes on income of about $150 million\u2014along with a shot at the \u201cdishonest media.\u201d And that actually helped the president by showing that he paid substantial taxes, the 25 percent rate being far higher than Mitt Romney\u2019s.\n\nMaddow is smart and a talented broadcaster. But she and the people around her botched this one.\n\nThe \u201cRachel Maddow Show\u201d got the story from David Cay Johnston, a Pulitzer Prize-winning former New York Times reporter who says the tax return just showed up in his mailbox. It is illegal, and an outrageous invasion of privacy, for anyone to leak someone else\u2019s tax return. But if Johnston and Maddow were passive recipients, it gets them off the ethical hook.\n\nMaddow first tweeted that she had the Trump returns on 7:26 p.m. on Tuesday. She began her 9 p.m. show with a rambling, 20-minute monologue about all the questions raised by Trump\u2019s taxes, then teased the big reveal after the next commercial break.\n\nTwitter was on fire by then, with some comparing it to the hyperbole of Geraldo Rivera opening Al Capone\u2019s vault\u2014a crown that Geraldo happily handed to Rachel yesterday.\n\nMaddow seemed downright gleeful during the hour, saying things like: \u201cFor the record, the First Amendment gives us a right to publish this return. It is not illegally published. Nor are we fake. Pinch me. I\u2019m real.\u201d\n\nNot that that stopped the president from tweeting yesterday: \u201cDoes anybody really believe that a reporter, who nobody ever heard of, \u2018went to his mailbox\u2019 and found my tax returns? @NBCNews FAKE NEWS!\u201d\n\nWell, David Cay Johnston is not exactly unknown. In fact, he wrote a negative book on Trump last year, compared him to P.T. Barnum and said: \u201cDonald doesn\u2019t know anything.\u201d Johnston says he has known Trump for decades.\n\nPerhaps the weakest part of the show was Johnston\u2019s speculation that maybe Trump himself sent him the returns. First, he has no idea. Second, if the Trump team was behind this, it\u2019s unlikely they would have picked Johnston. Nor should we speculate, as some conservatives have, that this was an IRS leak, especially since the two-page summary says \u201cClient Copy.\u201d\n\nMediaite criticized \u201cMaddow\u2019s heavy hype, low-delivery script\u201d and concluded:\n\n\u201cRachel Maddow just trolled all of us for ratings.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe longer Maddow went on, ever deeper into a conspiratorial thicket,\u201d said Slate, \u201cthe clearer it became that whatever tax returns Maddow had, they weren\u2019t as juicy as the ones she was talking about. If she had anything that damning, she would have shared them from the start\u2026\n\n\u201cMaddow even went so far as to hold the tax returns back until after the first commercial break, as if we were watching an episode of The Bachelor and not a matter of national importance ...\n\n\u201cIf ever a story should have been delivered in a stentorian, fuddy-duddy, nonpartisan manner, this was it. In positioning it as a grand revelation, a vital step in comprehending Trump\u2019s corruption, MSNBC created an exceedingly cynical spectacle.\u201d\n\n\n\nRachel Maddow will never be a fuddy-duddy.

The state says the ban would harm its tourism industry and the ability to recruit foreign students and workers.\n\nSenator Mazie K.

It doesn't draw any religious distinctions,\" Jeffrey Wall, who argued for the Justice Department, said in court.\n\nAttorneys for the ACLU and other groups said that Trump's statements on the campaign trail and statements from his advisers since he took office make clear that the intent of the ban is to ban Muslims.\n\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman called the order \"yet another victory.\"\n\n\"President Trump's second executive order is just a Muslim Ban by another name - with the same unlawful and unconstitutional goal of discriminating based on religion and national origin,\" he said in a statement.\n\nTrump policy adviser Stephen Miller has previously said the revised order was designed to have \"the same basic policy outcome\" as the first.\n\nThe latest version of the ban details more of a national security rationale. It is narrower and eases some concerns about violating the due-process rights of travelers, appyling only to new visas from Somalia, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya and Yemen and temporarily shuts down the U.S. refugee program. It does not apply to travelers who already have visas.\n\n\"Generally, courts defer on national security to the government,\" said U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang. \"Do I need to conclude that the national security purpose is a sham and false?\"\n\nIn response, ACLU attorney Omar Jadwat pointed to Miller's statement and said the government had put out misleading and contradictory information about whether banning travel from six specific countries would make the nation safer.\n\nThe Maryland lawsuit also argues that it's against federal law for the Trump administration to reduce the number of refugees allowed into the United States this year by more than half, from 110,000 to 50,000. Attorneys argued that if that aspect of the ban takes effect, 60,000 people would be stranded in war-torn countries with nowhere else to go.\n\nIn the Hawaii case, the federal government said there was no need to issue an emergency restraining order because Hawaii officials offered only \"generalized allegations\" of harm.\n\nJeffrey Wall of the Office of the Solicitor General challenged Hawaii's claim that the order violates due-process rights of Ismail Elshikh as a U.S. citizen who wants his mother-in-law to visit his family from Syria. He says courts have not extended due-process rights outside of a spousal relationship.\n\nNeal Katyal, a Washington, D.C., attorney representing Hawaii, called the story of Elshiskh, an Egyptian immigrant and naturalized U.S. citizen, \"the story of America.\"\n\nWall told the judge that if he is inclined to issue an injunction, it should be tailored specifically to Hawaii and not nationwide.\n\nIn Washington state, U.S. District Judge James Robart -- who halted the original ban last month -- heard arguments in a lawsuit brought by the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, which is making arguments similar to the ACLU's in the Maryland case.\n\nRobart said he is most interested in two questions presented by the group's challenge to the ban: whether the ban violates federal immigration law, and whether the affected immigrants would be \"irreparably harmed\" should the ban go into effect.\n\nHe spent much of Wednesday afternoon's hearing grilling the lawyers about two seeming conflicting federal laws on immigration -- one which gives the president the authority to keep \"any class of aliens\" out of the country, and another that forbids the government from discriminating on the basis of nationality when it comes to issuing immigrant visas.\n\nRobart said he would issue a written order, but he did not say when. He is also overseeing the challenge brought by Washington state.\n\nAttorney General Bob Ferguson argues that the new order harms residents, universities and businesses, especially tech companies such as Washington state-based Microsoft and Amazon, which rely on foreign workers. California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York and Oregon have joined the claim.\n\nWashington and Hawaii say the order also violates the First Amendment, which bars the government from favoring or disfavoring any religion. On that point, they say, the new ban is no different than the old.

Joseph Votel, the head of the command, who spoke last month during a visit to the region of the need for more artillery and logistics support for the coming assault by the U.S.-supported Syrian Democratic Forces on the Raqqa stronghold of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS.\n\nIf approved by Mattis and President Donald Trump, the additional forces would likely come from a mix of troops from the Army's 82nd Airborne Division and the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which was aboard ships headed for the Mediterranean.\n\nLast week, the Defense Department announced that an additional 2,500 conventional troops, including troops of the 82nd Airborne Division's 2nd Brigade Combat Team based at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, were being sent to Kuwait where they would be on standby for possible deployment to either Iraq or Syria to support local forces against ISIS.\n\nAbout 1,700 of the 2nd BCT troops from the 82nd are already in Kuwait and Iraq in the train, advise and assist role with the Iraqi Security Forces.\n\n\"The remainder of the brigade will be leaving Fort Bragg, going to Kuwait to be postured there to do all things Mosul, Raqqa -- all in between.

Joseph Anderson, the Army's deputy chief of staff, told the House Armed Services Committee Wednesday.\n\nMattis has made clear since his Senate confirmation hearings that he was looking for ways to accelerate the campaign against ISIS that could include scrapping the Obama administration's separate caps on the number of U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria.\n\nCurrently, about 500 mostly Special Forces troops are permitted in Syria and a little more than 5,000 in Iraq under what are called the Force Management Levels.\n\nHowever, the number of U.S. troops in Syria began going above the caps earlier this month. A small contingent of Army Rangers and Stryker combat vehicles has moved into Manbij in northeastern Syria and an estimated force of about 400 Marines from the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit has deployed into Syria to set up a firebase for M777 .155mm howitzers near the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa.\n\nOn Jan. 27, in his first trip to the Pentagon, Trump directed Mattis to draw up a plan within 30 days to speed up the ISIS campaign and Mattis delivered the closely-held plan on Feb. 27.\n\n\"It is a plan to rapidly defeat ISIS,\" said Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said at the time but he stressed that \"this is a preliminary plan\" whose details would not be disclosed to allow for continued discussion and to avoid giving the enemy forewarning.\n\nThe plan called for the involvement of \"all elements of national power\" in what Davis called a \"trans-regional approach\" to defeating ISIS. \"Diplomacy is a key part of the plan\" that was focused on ISIS but was also shaped to include other \"trans-regional\" terrorist groups, Davis said. \"This is really a framework for broader discussion.\"\n\nEarlier at the Brookings Institution, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen.

The 48 percent \u201cgetting better\u201d number is the highest since the question was first asked in 2003.

Now a new battlefront has emerged for the Marine Corps following the revelation of nude photo sharing among Marines and it\u2019s unlike anything they\u2019re accustomed to facing on distant shores and combat zones.\n\nAs soon as it was reported publicly that Marines were posting lewd photos of female Marines online through private social media sites, Marine Corps Commandant Robert Neller responded forcefully and without hesitation or delay.\n\nThe Marine Corps, at his direction, committed to a full investigation and to take appropriate action against those who violated the privacy and rights of the Marines who are the subjects of the photos.\n\nFor some lawmakers and observers, this commitment isn\u2019t enough. Predictably, the controversy has now morphed into an opportunity for elected officials\u2014led by New York Democrat Senator Kristen Gillibrand\u2014to publicly chide the Commandant and raise questions about his leadership without regard for the fact that he is still presiding over Marines in a shooting war.\n\nNo different than the blatant disrespect demonstrated by the Marines at the center of the controversy, Senator Gillibrand and others echoing her narrative underscore an obvious level of disdain for the Marine Corps and gives added attention to the wrongful view that Marines are nothing more than a group of uncontrollable misfits. Something they\u2019re not.\n\nDuring a Senate hearing this week, Senator Gillibrand lambasted the Commandant as if he himself sanctioned the wrongful behavior of the Marines who posted photos or even encouraged it by virtue of his leadership. Never mind the fact that the Commandant has taken ownership of the problem and vowed to expend all resources to continue addressing a challenge that is neither easily nor immediately solvable.\n\nWhat should give Senator Gillibrand hope is that the Commandant is leading the charge and if there is anybody in the Marine Corps who can make a difference, it\u2019s him.\n\nThis Commandant is like his predecessors in so many ways, especially when it comes to caring for his Marines and ensuring they\u2019re the most effective fighting force in the world. But he has his own distinct qualities and attributes, and it\u2019s safe to say that no Commandant has ever rivaled his dedication to the creation of a diverse Marine Corps.\n\nIn fact, it was the Commandant who led a diversity task force under previous leadership and his takeaways from that experience are no doubt informing his efforts today.\n\nHis leadership team is no less committed. Sitting behind the Commandant during this week\u2019s hearing was General David Furness\u2014a true patriot with over 30 years of service. So too was General Lori Reynolds, also with 30 years of service to the Marine Corps. Lambasting the Commandant might be good for appearances, but doing so not only undercuts his effectiveness, it also calls into question the ability of his team to set things straight.\n\nWhat Senator Gillibrand fails to understand is that when she targets the Commandant as she did, there\u2019s a cascade effect that gives others the courage to take even more drastic steps, among them calls for the Commandant\u2019s resignation. That was the case again this week.\n\nShould the Commandant consider resigning? The answer isn\u2019t just no\u2014it\u2019s hell no. Rather, he should be entrusted to fix the problem and given the operating space to do exactly that.\n\nWhether Senator Gillibrand and others want to hear it or not, it\u2019s a fact that the Marine Corps doesn\u2019t surveil the internet looking for nefarious sites. Upon discovery, their response is how they should be judged as well as what they do to impose control mechanisms to the extent the law permits.\n\nThe nude photos that were posted are not exclusively a Marine Corps problem. The other military services are sure to encounter private sites among their own ranks. And with the prevalence of social media, it\u2019s worth asking how much of this is a byproduct of a deeper cultural issue that compels both men and women\u2014whether students, employees or uniformed military\u2014to allow themselves to be photographed so freely or even post content about themselves that they might one day regret. This should by no means excuse the behavior, but it should reinforce the point that this latest controversy is not unique solely to the Marine Corps.\n\nThe Commandant deserves to be trusted\u2014he\u2019s earned it. But any suggestion that he might not be taking this latest controversy seriously or can resolve the matter with a snap of his fingers is absurd.\n\nThe behavior of Marines who posted nude photos and violated the rights and privacy of their fellow Marines is atrocious and it\u2019s something the Commandant rightly said he won\u2019t tolerate.\n\nWhat he needs now is less showmanship in the halls of Congress and more trust that he will lead in a way that we all expect and know he will.\n\nCongressman Duncan D.

To satisfy its Paris commitments, the Obama Administration announced plans to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions anywhere from 26 to 28 per cent below what they were in 2005\u2014plans that would steeply raise energy costs on American households and businesses and impede job growth.\n\nDonald Trump, on the other hand, made opposition to the Paris Agreement crystal clear during his Presidential campaign: \u201cWe\u2019re going to cancel the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs.\u201d\n\nNow some supporters of the Paris Agreement are urging President Trump to break this promise. But they can\u2019t really argue that the Agreement is an effective way to address climate change; MIT\u2019s Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change projects that, even if every country followed through with its promises, the Paris agreement would reduce warming by only 0.2 degrees Celsius by the year 2100.\n\nInstead, the argument is that honoring the Paris Agreement is all about U.S. leadership. As Timmons Roberts and Caroline Jones wrote in a recent Brookings Institution paper : \u201cTo renege on our commitments \u2026 in support of the Paris Agreement would weaken America\u2019s ability to muster enthusiastic support on important international policies we might care about.\u201c\n\nThis is fantasy. Gratitude is a rare commodity in international affairs \u2013 just look at the vast majority of U.S. foreign assistance recipients. They routinely vote against the U.S. most of the time in the U.N.\n\nThose arguing for the U.S. to remain in the Paris Agreement are less interested in bolstering U.S. leadership than in ensuring that they have means to criticize Trump when he fails to follow Obama\u2019s other ineffectual climate policies.\n\nRepudiating the Paris Agreement would be akin to ripping off a Band-Aid \u2013 a small pain in the form of anger from the U.N. and other governments committed to the agreement, but after that, nothing.\n\nHow do we know this? Because President George W. Bush lived through discarding the Paris Agreement\u2019s predecessor, the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. The Clinton Administration signed the Protocol in 1998, despite unanimous Senate resistance. President Bush correctly concluded the Protocol would be ineffective in addressing the problem and impose heavy economic costs on the U.S economy, particularly to the manufacturing sector.\n\nDespite strong pressure from the U.N. and European governments, Bush held firm by announcing that he would not ratify or implement the agreement.\n\nWhat was the impact of Bush\u2019s actions on American leadership role? Foreign governments criticized the decisions, but continued to cooperate and work with the U.S. More importantly, they learned that the U.S. was willing and able to resist diplomatic pressure in order to protect American interests.\n\nHaving other countries know that the U.S. President is resolute is valuable diplomatic currency, not fecklessness.\n\nThere are broader U.S. constitutional and security interests to consider too. The Paris Agreement is a supplementary agreement to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). President Obama misused the UNFCCC framework to avoid seeking Senate advice and consent for the Paris Agreement under Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nConservatives should insist that the President repudiate the Paris Agreement to correct that action alone.\n\nBut in addition, the Palestinian Authority is a party to the UNFCCC. As was the case when the Palestinians joined the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 2011, this event should trigger a U.S. law prohibiting any future U.S. funding to the UNFCCC.\n\nThe Obama administration continued funding the UNFCCC based on the absurd argument that the UNFCCC is a treaty, not an international organization. In fact, the UNFCCC is a treaty-based international organization, just like UNESCO \u2013and the United Nations.\n\nSo, in addition to the issues surrounding the Paris Agreement, if the Trump administration does not end funding for the UNFCCC in accordance to the law, it would signal to U.N. organizations that there will be no consequences if they grant membership to the Palestinians prior to a negotiated peace with Israel.\n\nIn fact, to prevent the accrual of financial arrears, it makes sense for the U.S. to withdraw from the UNFCCC, which would also lead to withdrawal from the Paris Agreement.\n\nU.S. presidents rarely face easy choices, but this one comes close.\n\nOther governments will carp, but withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and the UNFCCC would fulfill a campaign promise and send a welcome signal that, unlike the previous Administration, President Trump respects the treaty process outlined in the U.S. Constitution and will stand firmly with Israel.\n\nBrett D.

While apartheid originally was associated with South Africa, the report said Israel's policies today meet the definition of \u201can institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination\u201d by one racial group over another.\n\n\u201cAware of the seriousness of this allegation, the authors of the report conclude that available evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that Israel is guilty of policies and practices that constitute the crime of apartheid as legally defined in instruments of international law,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe commission's role is to promote economic development in the Arab region, but the U.N. employed a highly controversial figure to co-author the report. Sources told Fox News the report was launched with Falk speaking at a ceremony in Beirut on Wednesday.\n\nFalk, a former U.N. special rapporteur to the Palestinian territories, is known for harsh and often outlandish criticisms of both America and Israel, particularly on matters of Islamist terrorism. After the 2013 Boston Bombings, Falk remarked: \u201cThe American global domination project is bound to generate all kinds of resistance in the post-colonial world.\u201d\n\nFalk repeatedly has questioned what he calls \u201cthe official version of 9/11.\u201d In 2013, he told a radio show host about \u201cgaps\u201d in the standard 9/11 narrative.\n\n\u201cQuestioning that deeply the official version of 9/11 does touch the third rail of American political sensitivities, and there is an attempt to discredit and destroy anyone that makes such a bold statement,\u201d Falk continued.\n\nThe U.N.\u2019s decision to get Falk, who lives in the U.S., to co-author the report could in itself be seen as a poke in the eye to the Trump administration. Not only has the Trump administration expressed concerns about anti-Israel bias in the U.N., but Falk himself has been an outspoken Trump critic. Earlier this year, Falk said Trump\u2019s inauguration led him to \u201cmuse about what it might mean to live in a pre-fascist state.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres distanced Guterres from the report Wednesday, telling Fox News that the report does not reflect his views.\n\n\u201cIt was published by the Economic Commission for Western Asia, a regional U.N. economic commission, without prior consultation with U.N. headquarters,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nThe Israeli ambassador to the U.N. slammed the report's conclusion as \"biased and deceitful.\"\n\n\"The attempt to smear and falsely label the only true democracy in the Middle East by creating a false analogy is despicable and constitutes a blatant lie,\" Ambassador Danny Danon said. \"It comes as no surprise that an organization headed by an individual who has called for boycotts against Israel, and compared our democracy to the most terrible regimes of the twentieth century, would publish such a report.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the report inflamed already-frayed tensions beteen the U.N. and the Trump administration. Haley blasted Falk while urging the secretary-general to go further.\n\n\"That it was drafted by Richard Falk, a man who has repeatedly made biased and deeply offensive comments about Israel and espoused ridiculous conspiracy theories, including about the 9/11 terrorist attacks, is equally unsurprising,\" Haley said. \"The United Nations Secretariat was right to distance itself from this report, but it must go further and withdraw the report altogether.\"\n\nThe report pointed to what it claims is demographic engineering by policies seeking to maintain Israel as a Jewish state, and a \u201cpolicy of domination\u201d in \u201cinferior services, restrictive zoning laws and limited budget allocations made to Palestinian communities \u2026 and in the mostly segregated landscape in which Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel live.\u201d\n\nIt also referred to \u201cthe system of military law\u201d imposed on Palestinians who live in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as Palestianian \u201crefugees and involuntary exiles\u201d who live in neighboring countries.\n\nThe report called on member states to act against Israel.\n\n\u201cThis report accordingly recommends that the international community act immediately, without waiting for a more formal pronouncement regarding the culpability of the State of Israel, its Government and its officials for the commission of the crime of apartheid,\u201d it said.\n\nAmong the report\u2019s recommendations was a call to \u201cbroaden support for boycott, divestment and sanctions initiatives among civil society actors.\u201d It also called for the secretary-general to recommend to the General Assembly and Security Council that a \u201cglobal conference\u201d be convened to determine what action should be taken by the U.N.\n\nThe Trump administration already is considering pulling back support for and participation in various U.N. programs, in part due to its perceived anti-Israel stance.\n\nForeign Policy magazine reported Monday that the administration is eyeing 50 percent cuts in U.S. funding for U.N. programs.\n\nThe administration earlier confirmed it is reviewing U.S. membership on the Human Rights Council over concerns the body unfairly targets and focuses on Israel, while overlooking crimes by despots such as Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.\n\nIn her confirmation hearing in January, Haley pointed specifically to the U.N.\u2019s perceived anti-Israel bias as something the Trump administration would focus on.\n\n\"Nowhere has the U.N.\u2019s failure been more consistent and more outrageous than in its bias against our close ally Israel,\" Haley told senators.\n\nAdam Shaw is a Politics Reporter and occasional Opinion writer for FoxNews.com.

He must build a federal budget that accounts for President Donald Trump\u2019s focus on frugality, deregulation and his extraordinary bargaining ability \u2013 a challenge to the traditional budget scoring process.\n\nThe traditional process anticipates and accounts for red tape and typical procurement policies. So any proposed budget based on the bureaucratic system will inevitably be far more expensive than a budget driven by President Trump's entrepreneurial drive and frugality.\n\nThe latest economic outlook from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimated the federal budget deficit in the 2016 budget year was $544 billion. This represents a public debt of 76 percent of the gross domestic product. By 2026, this figure is expected to exceed 86 percent \u2013 assuming nothing changes in Washington. However, something has changed in Washington \u2013 the arrival of President Trump.\n\nDirector Mulvaney has the great challenge of calculating how much the president\u2019s entrepreneurial skills will significantly lower costs and reverse projected trends over the next decade.\n\nIf Mulvaney and his team successfully create a Trumpian budget, the administration can potentially save a tremendous amount of money.\n\nLook at federal construction alone. President Trump's entire career was based on successful construction with great buildings delivered at or below budget and ahead of schedule.\n\nApplying Trumpian principles to the hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of federal construction planned over the next decade could be a huge opportunity for a less expensive federal budget.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s skills could help save tens of billions of dollars on a long list of federal projects including buildings, roads, bridges, locks, dams and other major infrastructure projects across the country.\n\nTake the Wollman Rink example from President Trump\u2019s book The Art of the Deal. The City of New York had spent six years and $15 million trying to repair the Wollman Rink. Trump, who could see the defunct rink from his home in Trump Tower, finally got fed up and offered to take over the repairs. He was able to fully repair the rink in less than four months for less than $2.5 million. He even had time and money left over to renovate the adjacent restaurant and skate house.\n\nOr take a more recent project, Trump International, built in the Old Post Office in Washington, D.C. This project opened in October 2016, but its final contracted completion date with the General Services Administration was actually August 2018.\n\nThe Wollman Rink was fixed for one-sixth of the cost in one-eighteenth of the time New York City had spent failing. President Trump\u2019s team should apply the Wollman Rink model to every major construction project it undertakes \u2013 such as the wall on the Mexican border \u2013 and the $1 trillion-worth of infrastructure President Trump wants to build.\n\nFurther, if Director Mulvaney can work with Congress to identify and change laws that currently push projects over schedule, force bureaucrats to make poor decisions, and drive up costs, the long-term price tag for federal construction can be reduced even further. President Trump can save tens of billions of dollars in the direct federal construction budget and hundreds of billions of dollars on federal contracting and funding over the next decade.\n\nPresident Trump should also continue to determine what current contracts and programs need to be renegotiated. For instance, all construction contracts with costs that exceed $100 million should be reviewed as soon as possible, and renegotiations or cancellations should be ordered wherever possible. He has already begun renegotiating major contracts with Boeing and Lockheed Martin with positive results. President Trump was able to shave $600 million off the disastrous F-35 fighter jet program, and has extracted assurances from Boeing that the price tag for two Air Force One replacements will not exceed $4 billion. With contracts as large as these, even a savings of 6 percent can keep billions of tax dollars in the federal coffers.\n\nBut renegotiation isn\u2019t enough. President Trump should make sure all federal contracts are rigorously enforced \u2013 just as he did with the Wollman Rink and other Trump developments.\n\nThe administration should also introduce the same type of sound data systems that protect private sector companies from fraud into frequently abused federal programs such as Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security. If the administration applied these same anti-fraud systems to federally funded healthcare, food stamp and disability benefits, and other programs, it could save taxpayers $120 billion to $160 billion a year \u2013 well over a trillion dollars a decade.\n\nThis first Trumpian budget shouldn't just be frugal. It should be relentlessly innovative in applying the principles the President has developed throughout his long and impressive career.\n\nNewt Gingrich is a Fox News contributor.

For example, taxable income between $40,774 and $51,530 draws a 8 percent tax rate while taxable income between $51,531 and $263,222 draws a 9.3 percent tax rate.\n\nAnother enticement in the bill would give new teachers tax credits for the money they spent to earn full teaching credentials. These credits would cover such costs as college tuition and certification tests, and these expenses could be entirely recouped entirely over five years.\n\n\u201cTeachers are the original job creators. The teaching profession is critical to California\u2019s economic success and impacts every vocation and profession in the state,\u201d Stern said in a press release. \u201cSB 807 addresses the immediate teacher shortage and sends a loud and clear message across the state and nation: California values teachers. We will help train you and we want you to stay in the classroom.\u201d\n\nStern \u2013 a former teacher \u2013 said one-third of all California teachers quit before their fifth year because of the financial hardships placed on them due to low pay and the state\u2019s high cost of living.\n\n\"You're not going to be able to get paid $50,000 a year and go live in the Bay Area, go teach at the local school.... we think it's a pretty creative tool, we'll see how the fiscal conservatives in this house want to approach this,\u201d Stern told Fox 40.\n\nThe median household income in San Francisco is over $88,000 and more than $61,000 statewide. Average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in the Bay Area is just shy of $3,500 a month.\n\nFiscally conservative groups, including the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, criticized the bill. Jazz Shaw, writing on the group's website, said that for lawmakers to pick certain groups to get privileged treatment is a slippery slope.\n\n\"If you take an entire class of people based on their occupation and say that they are somehow 'more deserving' than everyone else and should be exempted from paying state income taxes, what other groups might qualify?

And there is no documentation of the hundreds of thousands of campaign funds she received in her unsuccessful 2015 Virginia state Senate race.\n\nAs first reported by The Wall Street Journal, Clinton confidant and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe urged McCabe\u2019s wife to run for statewide office shortly after news reports were published that Hillary Clinton used a private email server and address for all her government business while serving as secretary of State.\n\nFor the reporting period of October through November 2015, McCabe's campaign filings show she received $467,500 from Common Good VA, a political action committee controlled by McAuliffe, as well as an additional $292,500 from a second Democratic PAC.\n\nAsked why the deputy director did not list his wife's salary or the campaign contributions on the \"Executive Branch Personnel Public Financial Disclosure Report\" (OGE Form 278e) for 2015, an FBI spokesman said the forms were certified as \"in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\" The spokesman added Office of Government Ethics regulations do not stipulate that a spouse's salary or contributions received by a spouse's political campaign must be declared.\n\nAfter this story was first published, an FBI spokesman provided an on-the-record statement to Fox News defending how McCabe's disclosure forms were handled:\n\n\"The rules instructing filers how to complete the OGE 278e form are published by the independent Office of Government Ethics (OGE) in a document titled 'The Public Financial Disclosure Form (July 2016).' The form does not require that an employee spouse's salary be disclosed; only the employer name and type of income required. Nor does the form require or contain a line for campaign contributions, which are not considered income. Rules governing campaign donations are overseen by the Federal Election Commission.\n\nEach form submitted by an FBI employee to the OGE is certified by FBI's chief ethics officer, who heads the Office of Integrity and Compliance. Mr. McCabe consulted with this office upon his wife's decision to run for political office.\"\n\nThe document was filed by Andrew McCabe on July 8, 2016, after he received a 44-day filing extension. He filed three days after FBI Director James Comey's public statement where he recommended against criminal charges in the Clinton case.\n\nAccording to the OGE website, despite the box on the form for spouse income, it is not mandatory to fill in the blank, and it is not required to include contributions to a political campaign because there is a lower level of disclosure for the spouse.\n\nThe chief of policy for Issue One, which describes itself as a \"bipartisan organization dedicated to reducing the influence of money in politics,\" said this is another example of how the disclosure system is flawed.\n\n\"The OGE itself and operates as a \u2018compliance\u2019 agency -- taking the information given to it by the covered government official and working with that. I have not heard of the office doing any further investigation to assess whether the information provided by the official is actually correct, unless that information is uncovered by outside forces like the media,\" Meredith McGehee told Fox News, adding that her group is discussing possible changes with Capitol Hill offices.\n\n\"There is a need to strengthen OGE's authority -- from clarifying its power to conduct investigations to giving it authority to conduct random audits to having it play a larger role for matters involving high-ranking executive branch officials,\u201d she said.\n\n\"If it's not required, then why is there a spot on the form for spouse's income?\" retired FBI agent Jeff Danik said. Danik filed the FOIA requests with the FBI, and shared the financial disclosure forms with Fox News.\n\n\"Isn't it particularly convenient that loopholes in the ethics law are used to eliminate reporting hundreds of thousands of donated dollars benefiting the spouse of one of the most powerful FBI executives, while at the same time those laws demand that every dime in earnings on a minor stock account be disclosed?\u201d he said. \u201cThat hardly seems transparent.\"\n\nAndrew McCabe was at the center of the FBI's investigation into the use of Clinton's use of a private, unsecured email server as secretary of state \u2013 despite his wife having run for office supported financially by a close Clinton ally.\n\nRepublican Sen. Chuck Grassley, in a November 2016 letter to the Justice Department inspector general, noted that in July 2015, around the time the Clinton investigation began, Andrew McCabe was promoted to associate deputy director at FBI headquarters -- the No. 3 position.\n\nYet, Grassley wrote, \"the FBI asserts that Mr. McCabe did not have an \u2018oversight role\u2019 in the Clinton investigation until he became the number two in command in 2016. However, the FBI's statement does not foreclose the possibility that Mr. McCabe had a non oversight role while associate deputy director. Thus, even during the time period in which his wife's political campaign received approximately half a million dollars from Gov. McAuliffe's political action committee, and over $200,000 from the Virginia Democrat Party, he may have had a role in the investigation and did not recuse himself.\"\n\nInspector General Michael E. Horowitz is now conducting a sweeping investigation of events leading up to the November election, including potential conflicts at the FBI, Comey's public recommendation against prosecution, and related matters -- which are expected to include then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch's tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton at Sky Harbor airport in Arizona one week before Hillary Clinton's FBI interview.\n\nIn his letter, Grassley noted the Journal reported \u201c98% of the Gov. McAuliffe related donations to his wife came after the FBI launched the investigation.\u201d Given this, he wrote, \u201cthe FBI must provide a more detailed explanation as to why it determined that it was appropriate for Mr. McCabe to participate in that investigation in any way.\"\n\nMcGehee said states like Virginia have a \u201clong tradition of very little regulation \u2026 and minimal disclosure,\u201d meaning \u201cinadequate disclosure of real and potential conflicts of interest for those individuals who are subject to financial disclosure requirements and thus by definition are taking on powerful positions in the federal government.\"\n\nCatherine Herridge is an award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington, D.C.

Under the plan, companies like Boeing \u2013 which invests millions into its U.S.-based assembly plants \u2013 would receive capital investment deductions along with deductions for labor and inventory costs.\n\n\u201cWe need to look at the bigger picture here and see if the upsides of this plan outweigh the downsides,\u201d Stohr said. \u201cOur industry believes they do.\u201d\n\nOpponents of the tax plan, including Wal-Mart \u2013 the world\u2019s largest company \u2013 and fellow retail giant Target, say that the move to tax all imports would not only hurt their bottom line but also cause steep price increases for consumers on items like gas, clothing and prescription medicines.\n\n\u201cWe need tax reform that rewards entrepreneurs and allows businesses to grow and create good-paying jobs that lift working families up,\u201d David French, a senior vice president at the National Retail Federation, said in a press release. \u201cThe [border adjustment tax] does just the opposite, penalizing Americans by adding a tax on clothing, food, gas and other necessities while threatening the very industry that 42 million hardworking men and women rely upon for their livelihoods.\u201d\n\nThe divide between the country\u2019s manufacturers and retailers mirrors one on the halls of Congress where House and Senate Republicans seem sharply divided over key elements of the plan. GOP lawmakers in the Senate have expressed opposition to a House proposal to replace the current 35 percent tax on corporate profits with the border adjustment tax.\n\nUnder the House proposal, American companies that produce and sell their products in the United States would pay a new 20 percent tax on the profits from those sales. But if the company exports its products, the profits from those exports would not be taxed by the United States. However, foreign companies that import goods into the U.S. would have to pay the 20 percent tax.\n\nBesides retailers in the U.S., the proposed border adjustment tax has also become a major concern for some of the U.S.\u2019s biggest trade partners like China and Mexico.\n\nDuring the campaign, President Trump pledged to attack America's persistent trade deficits, which he blamed for the loss of millions of good-paying factory jobs. Along with border adjustment tax in the House\u2019s plan, Trump has threatened to slap punitive tariffs on imports from China, Mexico and other nations he has accused of trading unfairly.\n\nThere is worry among economists who worry that the border adjustment tax and Trump\u2019s tough talk could elevate the situation into all-out trade wars in which foreign nations retaliate by boosting their tariffs on American goods.\n\n\u201cU.S. trade partners are likely to respond to the border tax adjustment by retaliating,\u201d Desmond Lachman, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote in The Hill. \u201cThey would do so by taking similar trade measures as did the U.S. with the aim of boosting their own exports and of penalizing U.S. imports.\u201d\n\nDespite mixed messages on the House plan early on, the White House has recently warmed up to the idea. Bloomberg reported that top Trump strategist Steve Bannon is a major supporter of the tax reform package.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said late last month that he is working with Ryan and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, on a combined plan that would draw support from lawmakers in both the House and Senate.

Johnston said he found the president\u2019s 1040 form \u201cin the mail,\u201d a story Trump wasn\u2019t buying as he took aim at Maddow\u2019s parent network.\n\n\u201cDoes anybody really believe that a reporter, who nobody ever heard of, \u2018went to his mailbox\u2019 and found my tax returns? @NBCNews FAKE NEWS!\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nDoes anybody really believe that a reporter, who nobody ever heard of, \"went to his mailbox\" and found my tax returns? @NBCNews FAKE NEWS! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 15, 2017\n\nJohnston's story about finding the tax documents in the mail mirrors how a New York Times reporter was mailed Trump tax info from 1995 in October.\n\nThe tax documents, which showed Trump made $153 million in 2005 and paid $36.5 million in income taxes ($38 million in total taxes), did not exactly amount to a bombshell. His effective rate was close to 25 percent. It appeared so favorable to the president that Johnston -- a longtime reporter who won a Pulitzer Prize in 2001 -- speculated to Maddow it was possible \u201cDonald sent this to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald has a long history of leaking material about himself when he thinks it\u2019s in his interest,\u201d Johnston said.\n\nFormer Trump Deputy Campaign Manager David Bossie told \"Fox & Friends\" on Wednesday that Johnston's charge was ludicrous.\n\n\"That's ridiculous,\" Bossie said. \"President Trump is a very private person. He takes his privacy, the safety of his family, and his business empire very seriously.\"\n\nThe White House in a Tuesday night statement called the tax story a sign that Maddow was \u201cdesperate for ratings.\u201d A senior administration official added it was \u201ctotally illegal to steal and publish tax returns.\u201d\n\nMaddow argued the returns were \u201cnot illegally published\u201d and said MSNBC merely exercised its First Amendment right to publish information in the public interest. The unauthorized publishing of federal tax returns is a criminal offense that can be punished by five years in jail or a fine of up to $5,000.\n\nMost of the post-reveal chatter focused on how Maddow overhyped the report and took too long -- about 20 minutes -- to even break the story on her own show, a delay that allowed other publications and TV shows to report on the tax news ahead of her.\n\nThe \"Legal Insurrection\" website mocked Maddow with the headline \"Rachel Maddow's career committed suicide live on national TV tonight.\"\n\n\"If anything, Maddow helped Trump by showing he paid $38 million in taxes on $150 million of income. Hardly the narrative the Democrats like,\" William A. Jacobson wrote.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. sent out a slew of tweets lambasting the Maddow segment and highlighting the millions of dollars in taxes his dad was proven to have paid. The narrative that Trump paid little or no taxes has dogged Trump since the GOP primary battle. Trump has so far refused to release his taxes, saying the documents are under audit.\n\n\"BREAKING NEWS: 12 years ago @realDonaldTrump made a lot of money and paid a lot in taxes #scandal #thankyouMaddow,\" Trump Jr. tweeted.\n\nCan you imagine what the outcry would be if @SnoopDogg, failing career and all, had aimed and fired the gun at President Obama?

Some are challenging the credibility of the CBO.\n\nDemocrats, for their part, say the law would be disastrous and that Trump is breaking a campaign promise.\n\nThere\u2019s also an icy battle between journalists and the White House over the language being used to defend the president\u2019s unproven wiretapping allegation.\n\nSo the mood is chilly as just four inches of snow closed many federal agencies, businesses and schools in Washington, which is notorious for its inability to cope with a little snow.\n\nLet\u2019s take a blowtorch to the layers of rhetoric surrounding the health care debate.\n\nThe thing about attacking the nonpartisan CBO is that its director, Keith Hall, was a Bush administration economist named to the Hill post by Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell. But its estimate is damaging, prompting a quick counterattack.\n\n\u201cThe CBO simply has it wrong,\u201d HHS Secretary Tom Price said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not believable.\u201d Budget chief Mick Mulvaney told MSNBC that \u201cI don\u2019t believe the facts are correct.\u201d On the other side, Bernie Sanders is proclaiming that \u201cthousands of Americans will die.\u201d\n\nNow I don\u2019t put much stock in 10-year estimates based on models. But for what it\u2019s worth, the CBO said the number of uninsured people would jump 24 million by 2024, while the government would save $337 billion on Medicaid and insurance subsidies for the poor.\n\nSean Spicer came under a barrage of health care questions at yesterday\u2019s briefing, and he criticized the coverage for not including Trump\u2019s eventual plans to reform the program further. When Politico obtained a preliminary administration analysis that went further, predicting that 26 million people would lose coverage in the next decade, Spicer tweeted: \u201cThis story is totally misleading.The projection was an estimate of what CBO would conclude. It was not a WH analysis.\u201d\n\nIn any event, Trump officials say, the coverage estimates can be misleading because they are dropping the Obama mandate, and some people may choose not to buy insurance under the new law.\n\nBeyond the dueling green-eyeshade arguments, the president\u2019s political problem is real. He promised that no one would lose coverage but that he would come up with an ObamaCare replacement that costs less. The House conservative wing already thinks he\u2019s not junking enough of the current law and that the bill is too expensive. Squaring this circle will take all of Trump\u2019s dealmaking skills.\n\nAnother media storm centers on whether the White House is slowly backing away from Trump\u2019s wiretapping claim. Spicer told reporters that \u201che doesn\u2019t really think that President Obama went up and tapped his phone personally.\u201d\n\nInstead, the press secretary said, using his fingers for air quotes, \u201cThe president was very clear in his tweet that it was, you know, \u2018wiretapping.\u2019 That spans a whole host of surveillance types of options.\u201d\n\nWhether it\u2019s wiretapping or other \u201coptions,\u201d Spicer\u2019s difficulty\u2014and the reason the press keeps pounding on this\u2014is that the White House still hasn\u2019t produced any evidence.\n\nAnd while those cross-currents were swirling, Breitbart (Steve Bannon\u2019s former outfit) posted an audiotape of Paul Ryan (the president\u2019s partner in the health care fight) abandoning Trump last October after the leak of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape.\n\nYep, this is how we pass the time in Washington on a snow day.\n\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

Or am I just grouchier?\n\nEvery day I see things that are wrong or that so miss the point I want to scream.\n\nFour examples:\n\n1. Storm Coverage\n\nAs this week's storm approached the East Coast, the media reverted to breathless hype: \"monster storm ... very dangerous.\" Here I blame my beloved free market: Predicting scary weather works. Viewers tune in.\n\nWhat galls me more is the reporters' government-centric thinking. \"Everything is closed,\" they say. \"Employees can't get to work.\"\n\nBut the corner grocery stayed open. So did many gas stations and restaurants.\n\nWhy is it that when government buildings close, so many private businesses stay open? Because their own money is at stake.\n\nThe store's employees probably make less money than government workers. They are less likely to own all-wheel-drive cars. But they get to work. Some sleep there. Their own money is on the line.\n\nReporters don't think about the distinction.\n\n2. The Deep State\n\nMonday, The New York Times ran the headline \"What Happens When You Fight a 'Deep State' that Doesn't Exist?\"\n\nThe article explained that unlike Egypt or Pakistan, America doesn't really have a powerful deep state, and to claim that it does \"presents apolitical civil servants as partisan agents.\"\n\nGive me a break. \"Apolitical civil servants\"?\n\nA deep state absolutely exists. Some call it \"administrative state\" or \"regulatory state.\" These are the people who crush innovation and freedom by issuing hundreds of new rules. Regulators, if they don't pass new rules, think they're not doing their job.\n\nEven \"anti-regulator\" President George W. Bush hired 90,000 (SET ITAL) new (END ITAL) regulators. Calling them \"nonpartisan\" doesn't make them harmless -- it just means we put up with them through multiple administrations.\n\nEven if you exclude the military and post office, more than 20 million Americans work for the government. Because of civil service rules, it's almost impossible to fire them.\n\nThe Times calls these 20 million people \"apolitical\". Please. Most are just as partisan as you or I. Maybe more so, as leaks and signs of bureaucratic resistance to presidential edicts demonstrate.\n\nPeople who choose to work for, say, the EPA, tend to be environment zealots. This should surprise no one. Somehow, New York Times reporters don't see it.\n\n3. \"Chief of EPA Bucks Studies\"\n\nSpeaking of the EPA and the Times, their front page claimed President Donald Trump appointee Scott Pruitt is \"at odds with the established scientific consensus.\" That makes Pruitt sound like an anti-science idiot. But the headline is bunk.\n\nPruitt only said that he does not agree that man is \"the primary contributor to global warming.\"\n\nThat's \"at odds\" with Times reporters and government flunkies on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, but many scientists say there is so much uncertainty to climate measurements that no one can know if man's greenhouse gases are the \"primary\" cause of warming.\n\nThe earth warmed similarly last century, well before we emitted so much carbon dioxide.\n\n4. John Oliver\n\nBritish comedian John Oliver hosts one of the better political talk shows. He's like Bill Maher but funnier and not as mean. Yesterday, on an airplane, I watched an episode that led with a report on the chaos in Venezuela.\n\nI perked up, expecting Oliver to at least mention Venezuela's caps on corporate profits, abolition of property rights, media censorship, regulation of car production \"from the factory door to the place of sale,\" etc. In other words: socialism.\n\nBut no, Oliver didn't mention any of that.\n\nHe mocked President Maduro's speeches but said Venezuela was in trouble because its economy depends on oil and oil prices dropped. What?\n\nKuwait, Nigeria, Angola and other countries exported more oil than Venezuela. But they survived the price drop without experiencing the misery that Venezuela suffers. The suffering was created by socialism.\n\nAmerica's leftists cannot see the horrors of socialism even when they are right in front of them.\n\nJohn Stossel is the author of \"No They Can't!

He will meet Thursday with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida.\n\nThe former Exxon Mobil CEO has adopted a low profile during his six weeks as secretary of state. The State Department Correspondents' Association expressed disappointment Wednesday that Tillerson was traveling to Asia without a full contingent of the diplomatic press corps or even a pool reporter on his plane \u2014 although it is taking a reporter from the conservative-leaning website, the Independent Journal Review.\n\nPresident Trump's rise to power has raised anxiety in Asian capitals. During last year's election campaign, Trump asked whether allies like Japan and South Korea contribute enough for their own defense or should get their own nuclear weapons. He also questioned the fundamentals of four decades of U.S. diplomacy with China.\n\nTrump has allayed some of those concerns since taking office. Trump hosted Abe at his Florida resort last month, and when Tillerson goes to Beijing Saturday, he is expected to arrange a much-anticipated visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to the U.S.\n\n\"The U.S. allies, Japan and South Korea, want to know that the United States is going to continue to defend them but also is going to show a certain amount of finesse and diplomatic skills in dealing with China and with North Korea,\" said Robert Dujarric, the director of the Institute of Contemporary Asian Studies at Temple University's campus in Tokyo.\n\nNorth Korea will be a top priority on all Tillerson's stops. The State Department says Tillerson wants to discuss \"fresh\" approaches. Administration officials say all options are on the table, including military ones, but signs are that the U.S. for starters wants to see rigorous implementation of existing sanctions against Pyongyang.\n\nThere appears to be little desire for now to negotiate with North Korea, unless it commits to denuclearization, which it shows no sign of doing.\n\nThe North conducted two nuclear tests and 24 ballistic missile tests last year, deepening concern in Washington that it could soon develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland \u2014 something Trump has vowed won't happen.\n\nThe U.S. is currently involved in annual military drills in South Korea that North Korea regards as rehearsal for invasion. In a show of defiance, the North fired four ballistic missiles into ocean off Japan last week. The next day, the U.S. began bringing in equipment for the long-planned deployment in South Korea of a missile defense system, known by its acronym, THAAD.\n\nThat has raised tensions with China, which says the THAAD's radar could peer into Chinese territory, weakening its own nuclear deterrent. The U.S. says the system is intended to be used only against North Korea.\n\nA Trump administration official told Reuters that Tillerson's position on THAAD would be uncompromising.\n\n\"THAAD is non-negotiable,\" the official told Reuters. \"This is one of those things where Beijing is just going to have to adapt to or live in a perpetual cycle of outrage.\n\n\"But this is a chance to lay down a marker on what we would need from China and to hear from them what they would want to see in return.

Johnston, with the website DCReport.org, said only that he found the documents \u201cin the mail.\u201d\n\nCiting the files, they said Trump made $153 million that year and paid $36.5 million in taxes, which Johnston suggested was relatively low and the result of a benefit.\n\nThe return shows the then-real estate mogul also reported a business loss of $103 million that year, although the documents don't provide detail. The forms show that Trump paid an effective tax rate of 24.5 percent, a figure well above the roughly 10 percent the average American taxpayer forks over each year, but below the 27.4 percent that taxpayers earning 1 million dollars a year average, according to data from the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\nThe White House pre-emptively pushed back minutes before the on-air report, saying that publishing the returns would be illegal.\n\n\"You know you are desperate for ratings when you are willing to violate the law to push a story about two pages of tax returns from over a decade ago,\u201d a senior administration official said in a statement.\n\nThe official added it is \"totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns.\"\n\nThe statement also acknowledged Trump made over $150 million that year, while saying he paid $38 million in income taxes \u2013 noting he had a responsibility to his company and family \u201cto pay no more tax than legally required.\u201d The statement said he also paid \u201ctens of millions of dollars in other taxes such as sales and excise taxes and employment taxes and this illegally published return proves just that.\u201d\n\nMaddow countered that the return was \"not illegally published,\u201d and argued that MSNBC was exercising its First Amendment right to publish information in the public interest.\n\nThe unauthorized release or publishing of federal tax returns is a criminal offense, punishable by a fine of up to $5,000 and up to five years in jail.\n\nTrump's hefty business loss appears to be a continued benefit from his use of a tax loophole in the 1990s, which allowed him to deduct previous losses in future years. In 1995, Trump reported a loss of more than $900 million, largely as a result of financial turmoil at his casinos.\n\n\n\nTax records obtained by The New York Times last year showed the losses were so large they could have allowed Trump to avoid paying taxes for up to 18 years. But Trump's 2005 filing shows another tax prevented him from realizing the full benefit of those deductions.\n\n\n\nThe bulk of Trump's tax bill that year was due to the Alternative Minimum Tax, a tax aimed at preventing high-income earners from paying minimal taxes.\n\n\n\nThe AMT requires many taxpayers to calculate their taxes twice -- once under the rules for regular income tax and then again under AMT -- and then pay the higher amount. Critics say the tax has ensnared more middle-class people than intended, raising what they owe the federal government each year.\n\n\n\nWere it not for the AMT, Trump would have avoided all but a few million dollars of his 2005 tax bill.\n\n\n\nTrump's campaign website called for the end of the AMT, which is expected to bring in more than $350 billion in revenues from 2016 to 2025.\n\nThe report follows unsuccessful efforts by Democrats since the start of the 2016 presidential campaign to pressure Trump to release the documents. Last month, House Democrats even tried to force Trump to give them to Congress, only to be blocked by majority Republicans.\n\nMaddow\u2019s report also points to what could be another significant leak inside the federal government meant to embarrass the new president. In his first two months on the job, reports have surfaced with sensitive details about Trump\u2019s calls with foreign leaders as well as details from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign.\n\nTrump last month blasted what he termed \u201cillegal leaks.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s tax documents were a top target for critics throughout the 2016 race. Despite indications from Trump early on that he would follow a decades-long tradition of presidential nominees making their returns public, he later balked.\n\nHe cited an IRS audit as the reason he did not want to release the documents, while also saying at a September debate that he\u2019d release them if Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton turned over the thousands of emails deleted from her private server.\n\nShe didn\u2019t.

They hate it! They want the feds to dictate health insurance costs and who gets it free or subsidized.\n\nSo that's essentially where we are.\n\nThe key question for you, the American citizen, is, will your health care premiums go up or down once ObamaCare is history?\n\nMonday the Congressional Budget Office said that under the Republican plan, the feds will spend about $337 billion dollars less subsidizing health care over the next ten years.\n\nBut about 21 million more Americans will not have health insurance by the year 2020.\n\nAgain, that would most likely be their own choice \u2013 not to have insurance.\n\nThe CBO does not know what might happen if the insurance companies are allowed to compete nationwide, which they cannot do now.\n\nWill that drive premiums down?\n\nThat's the hope on the Trump side.\n\nBut not on the left: Here's Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders on \"Face the Nation\":\n\n\"This really has nothing to do with health care. What this has everything to do with is a massive shift of wealth from working people and middle-income people to the very richest people in this country. It is a $275 billion tax break for the top two percent.\"\n\nSenator Sanders is angry because the Republican health care plan knocks out an ObamaCare payroll tax and a tax on investment income.\n\nSanders saying that gives money to the rich people. That's always the argument from the left -- any tax breaks, especially on investment income sales of stocks, interest, that kind of thing, [it]helps the wealthy.\n\nBut the Trump administration has promised to lower taxes and their health care plan does that.\n\nIt is simply impossible for you, the American consumer, to know how this will all turn out.\n\nAs they say on the West Coast, it's complicated.\n\nSumming up, liberals want a big entitlement culture. Some uber-conservatives want few, if any entitlements.

Now they\u2019re talking about \u201cblowing up the White House,\u201d bringing back would-be presidential assassin John Hinckley or shooting that \u201cmotherf***er.\u201d\n\nThis all becomes more important since there has already been one assassination attempt on Trump, a June 18, 2016, attack that went under-reported. Then there was the time during the early part of the 2016 campaign when another man charged his stage March 12, 2016, and had to be tackled by Secret Service. Add in the hundreds of arrests at the anti-Trump inauguration riot and several arrests for threats against the president and it appears that there is a terrifying liberal penchant for endangering the life of the president and reveling in it. Twitter has also become a home for the left\u2019s assassination fascination.\n\nSingers, celebrities and journalists have all joined in the bloody Trump assassination fantasies.

White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon has described their goal as \u201cthe deconstruction of the administrative state.\u201d\n\nBut the dire predictions pertain to goals strikingly similar to what the Clinton administration tried to accomplish, working with the other side of the aisle.\n\nIn the opening paragraph of his 1996 report on the progress of the National Government Review, future Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore hailed in the opening paragraph that the \u201cClinton-Gore Administration [sic] has made the federal government smaller by nearly a quarter of a million jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the largest, swiftest government-wide cut in the history of the United States. It\u2019s not just a post-Cold War defense reduction; every department except Justice has become smaller,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe ensuing lines, at times, sound more like Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., or a member of the House Freedom Caucus than a Democratic vice president.\n\n\u201cPresident Clinton and I are just as proud of making government work better as we are of making it smaller. It isn\u2019t good enough yet, or small enough yet, but we sure have things headed in the right direction,\u201d he said.\n\nIf anything, the Clinton administration's budget ax had a broader sweep.\n\nIn terms of spending cuts, the Trump administration has indicated non-discretionary spending, including entitlements, will remain untouched. That was not the case under Clinton.\n\nUnder a deal hashed out with then-Speaker Newt Gingrich, a budget agreement in 1997 cut (or rather, reduced the growth rate of) discretionary spending by $138 billion over a five-year period. It also cut Medicare spending by $115 billion, Medicaid by $14 billion and other mandatory spending by $40 billion.\n\nThe Clinton-era deal also cut military spending significantly, while Trump is pushing for a roughly $54 billion increase in military spending.\n\nAdam Shaw is a Politics Reporter and occasional Opinion writer for FoxNews.com.

The Sanders campaign specifically was sending out national messages on social media about 17-year-olds being able to vote in presidential primaries, Magney said, although Wisconsin election officials didn't see any misinformation from that campaign about Wisconsin.\n\nNo one under 18 can vote in any Wisconsin election, but 17-year-olds may have seen Sanders' messages and thought they could vote. Poll workers may not have understood the law or may not have been paying enough attention, he added.\n\n\"It wasn't a case of anyone sneaking in,\" Magney said. \"It was a misunderstanding of the law.\"\n\nSanders campaign officials didn't immediately respond to an email Monday seeking comment.\n\nKewaunee County District Attorney Andrew Naze said he chose not to charge any of the 17-year-olds whom clerks referred to him. He said they honestly thought they were eligible to vote and didn't intend to break the law.\n\nBrown County District Attorney David Lasee said nine 17-year-olds were referred to him but he decided not to file charges as well. Like Naze, Lasee said the teens genuinely believed they could vote and there was no intent to commit fraud. They told poll workers their ages and were still allowed to cast ballots, Lasee said.\n\nProsecutors in Rock and Racine counties didn't immediately respond to messages Monday.\n\nThe report noted that its findings aren't conclusive and it's possible other instances of suspected fraud may have been referred to prosecutors without the commission's knowledge or people may have filed complaints directly with district attorneys.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/14/wisconsin-official-blames-sanders-campaign-poll-workers-for-minors-voting.html"}, {"text": "President Trump\u2019s special envoy for the Middle East peace process concluded his second day in the region Tuesday as he tries to revive discussions between the Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nNETANYAHU: JOURNALIST'S CLAIM WIFE KICKED HIM OUT OF CAR 'A LIE'\n\nJason Greenblatt met first Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Send Paul Ryan and Secretary Price back to the drawing board and come up with a free market solution.\n\nHere are a few ideas:\n\n1. Drop the state line restriction. Allow insurers to compete nationally.\n\n2. Tort reform: Medical malpractice insurance is crushing doctors. Reform settlements and judgments now.\n\n3. Allow group providers to negotiate drug prices.\n\n4. Require doctors, hospitals and insurers to post costs of procedures online. Allow the consumer to shop around.\n\n5. Allow associations to provide medical insurance. Imagine if the NRA or the Sierra Club or AAA were allowed to provide health insurance which is decoupled from ones work. Massive groups such as these would have quite a lot of leverage to negotiate prices with medical providers.\n\nThere are ways to make health care more affordable. That should be the sole purpose of reform along with fully repealing ObamaCare.\n\nThe House GOP and Paul Ryan should get on board.

But the same study notes the new rules would allow insurance companies to charge older people considerably more.\n\nThis could pose an added complication for the Trump administration as it works with congressional allies to advance, and perhaps refine, the bill.\n\nTrump last November carried voters between 45 and 64 years old, as well as those 65 and over, exit polling shows.\n\nBroken down by income, the results were less clear.

And of high importance to the West, he has made clear that he intends to push for considerable social reform. At the top of his agenda: greater rights for women.\n\nAfter eight years in which the Saudis watched as the Obama administration seemed to pivot towards Iran\u2014a country where \u201cDeath to America\u201d is still shouted daily in the streets\u2014this is the moment for a reset on national security issues, with an eye toward the exciting social changes happening in the kingdom.\n\nHere are seven things Team Trump needs to know before they meet:\n\n1. Saudi Arabia\u2019s leaders have already seen that the Trump administration has a clear vision of the Iranian regime\u2019s trouble making. In Trump\u2019s generals, at the Pentagon, and among national security advisers, they see veteran Middle East hands, with boots on the ground experience, no illusions about Iranian meddling, and an understanding of the price paid by many U.S. servicemen and women, killed by Iranian made IED\u2019s. Even with this increased comfort level in Riyadh, more reassurance from the Trump team would be even better, signaling that the U.S. will continue to support and contribute to the defensive war in Yemen, and hold the line against further Iranian expansionist efforts that undermine regional stability.\n\n2. The Kingdom is on the front line of the War on Terror, crushing Al Qaeda and ISIS at home, and working very closely with the U.S. and their allies to hunt them down across the region. Saudi intelligence provided information to the U.S. that stopped attacks planned to take place on American soil. The Kingdom has been recognized by the U.S. Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, in testimony to Congress last year, as a world leader in combatting terrorism financing.\n\n3. Saudi Arabia\u2019s next big project is the remaking of the country\u2019s economy, transforming the oil-dependent state into a modern, technologically advanced and economically diversified nation. To do that, the Kingdom wants to work closely with American business and will be looking to the Trump administration to encourage U.S. businesses to seek opportunities there.\n\n4. In Riyadh, there is frustration that too often, the U.S.-Saudi relationship is not fully appreciated in the United States. Recognition that the relationship is mutually beneficial\u2014that Saudi purchases of U.S. military equipment have brought hundreds of billions of dollars back to the States and helped create tens of thousands of jobs, while enhancing the U.S. goal of greater regional stability, is important. As a businessman, Trump is likely to understand this.\n\n5. Support and understanding of the pace of social reform would be helpful. An acknowledgement that Saudi leadership is carefully calibrating systemic change to avoid disastrous clerical pushback would be gratefully received. A celebration of accomplishments such as the recent appointment of a woman to head the Saudi stock exchange, and of another to head a major bank, would signal a recognition that the kingdom is on the path to profound change.\n\n6. The government has worked to deal with intolerance at home by undertaking a systematic effort to rewrite textbooks and other literature to highlight the need for understanding of other religions and cultures. This is an important step in the movement forward of Saudi Arabia.\n\n7. The Saudi national oil company, Aramco, is moving toward partial privatization. When that happens, this IPO will likely be the largest offering in history.

The state has executed 23 prisoners under Scott, more than any other governor since capital punishment was reinstated in Florida in 1979.

The estimate swiftly fueled opponents\u2019 warnings that the measure would toss millions of voters off insurance plans.\n\n\u201cThe CBO's estimate makes clear that TrumpCare will cause serious harm to millions of American families,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement. \u201c\u2026 This should be a looming stop sign for the Republicans repeal effort.\u201d\n\nGOP supporters of the repeal plan, however, for days have downplayed the significance of the CBO findings, noting that the same office\u2019s coverage projections for the original Affordable Care Act were off by millions.\n\nTrump administration officials pushed back on the report late Monday, with Health Secretary Tom Price saying the CBO looked only at the bill before Congress, and not the regulatory reforms and flexibility for states also being planned.\n\n\u201cThe coverage numbers are in fact going down,\u201d Price said. \u201cThe CBO looked at a portion of a plan but not the entire plan.\u201d\n\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney argued the idea that people on ObamaCare through Medicaid would drop out immediately is \u201cjust absurd.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told Fox News' \"Special Report with Bret Baier\" that he was \"pretty encouraged\" by the report and claimed it \"actually exceeded my expectations.\"\n\n\"Where I\u2019m encouraged is once our reforms kick in, what the CBO is telling us is it\u2019s going to lower premiums,\" Ryan said. \"I\u2019m excited about this analysis and yeah, I think they sort of overestimate the uninsured number just like they overestimated who would be insured by ObamaCare.\"\n\nWhile millions are projected to lose insurance under the plan, the CBO projected this would largely be due to individuals opting to drop coverage in the event the so-called \u201cmandate\u201d is lifted.\n\nTo this point, Ryan said, \u201cOur plan is not about forcing people to buy expensive, one-size-fits-all coverage. It is about giving people more choices and better access to a plan they want and can afford. When people have more choices, costs go down.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump contends the current law is unsustainable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s imploding,\u201d Trump said in a meeting earlier Monday with Americans the White House described as \u201cvictims\u201d of ObamaCare. He vowed the Republican plan eventually would bring insurance costs \u201cdown, down, down.\u201d\n\nThe CBO report noted that while new tax credits largely would be \u201cless generous for those receiving subsidies under current law,\u201d other changes would \u201clower average premiums enough to attract a sufficient number of relatively healthy people to stabilize the market.\u201d\n\nThe CBO said the plan would probably increase average premiums in the nongroup market until 2020, after which costs would decrease.\n\n\u201cIn 2018 and 2019 \u2026 average premiums for single policyholders in the nongroup market would be 15 percent to 20 percent higher,\u201d the report said. \u201c\u2026 By 2026, average premiums for single policyholders in the nongroup market under the legislation would be roughly 10 percent lower than under current law.\u201d\n\nThe CBO noted insurers would be allowed to charge older enrollees significantly more.\n\nThe CBO report, compiled along with staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, also determined that the Republicans\u2019 American Health Care Act would save money for taxpayers. According to the study, it would reduce federal deficits by $337 billion from 2017 to 2026.\n\nThe report\u2019s estimate on the number of uninsured nevertheless could overshadow projections about premiums and taxpayer savings, fueling critics. Criticism so far has come from Democrats, Republicans from states that benefit from Obama's law and many corners of the health-care industry.\n\nAccording to the CBO, the projected loss in insurance coverage is related mostly to a provision repealing penalties associated with the ACA\u2019s requirement to buy insurance.\n\n\u201cSome of those people would choose not to have insurance because they chose to be covered by insurance under current law only to avoid paying the penalties, and some people would forgo insurance in response to higher premiums,\u201d the CBO said.\n\nRepublican leaders have said their aim is to lower health care costs.

Waldhauser, the chief of the Pentagon\u2019s Africa command, said in a testimony to the Senate\u2019s foreign relations committee last week.\n\nRussia has already irked numerous Western governments with its support of the brutal regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and, despite assurances from Oleg Krinitsyn - owner of private Russian firm RSB-group \u2013 that the mercenaries were sent to Libya as a commercial arrangement, it is unlikely that the Kremlin did not grant Krinitsyn its approval, according to Reuters.\n\nKrinitsyn told Reuters that his firm did not work with the Russian defense ministry, but was \"consulting\" with the Russian foreign ministry.\n\nRSB-group sent the contractors to eastern Libya last year and they were pulled out in February having completed their mission. The task of the security contractors was to remove mines from an industrial facility near the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, in an area that Haftar's forces had liberated from Islamist rebels.\n\nKrinitsyn did not say who hired his firm, where they were operating or what the industrial facility was. He did not say if the operation had been approved by the U.N.-backed government, which most states view as the sovereign ruler of Libya.\n\nEarlier this month Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov held talks in Moscow with Fayez Seraj, the head of the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli, where he reaffirmed the Russian Federation\u2019s support of working toward a united government in the oil-rich nation.\n\n\"Moscow confirmed its readiness to work closely with all sides in Libya with the aim of seeking mutually acceptable solutions to create the grounds for the stable development of Libya as a united, sovereign and independent state,\" the ministry said in a statement.\n\nDespite the Lavrov\u2019s promises, actions by the Kremlin indicate that it is strongly in favor of Haftar taking control of the country and not just the eastern section currently under his control. In February Reuters reported that around 70 soldiers fighting for Haftar have been sent to Russia for treatment and Haftar has publically met with Russian officials at least three times \u2013 twice in Moscow and once aboard a Russian aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean where he spoke with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu.\n\nOver the weekend, Haftar\u2019s forces launched a series of airstrikes against the western Libyan city of Sidra, the country\u2019s biggest oil port which has recently been the scene of intense between Haftar\u2019s troops and militias in the west.\n\nIn another worrying step, the eastern parliament last Tuesday voted to withdraw support from the United Nations peace deal that created the Tripoli government in January 2016 in hopes of ending years of chaos in the North African country. The withdrawal of support further undermines the government, which has had difficulty asserting authority even in Tripoli.\n\nExpand / Contract General Khalifa Haftar (C), commander in the Libyan National Army (LNA), leaves after a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow, Russia, November 29, 2016.

He has talked of marching to take Tripoli to unite the country, hinting that he aims to rule. He opposed the government set up by the U.N. peace deal because it would have pushed him out as head of the military.\n\nThe general is backed by Egypt and Russia, but Washington under the Obama administration kept him at arm's length. One key question in Haftar\u2019s future will be whether the U.S. warms up to him under President Donald Trump.\n\nHafter's forces seized the oil facilities last year. The Obama administration had joined the U.N. in calling on him to hand them over to the Tripoli government.\n\nBut now that they have been wrested from him by force, he may resort instead to an all-out fight against Tripoli. His army says it is massing forces east of the terminals, awaiting orders.

They sounded the alarm without saying that most people in ObamaCare had nothing to fear because of federal subsidies.

With every new administration, the incoming president asks all U.S. attorneys appointed by the prior administration to resign. After all, they are political appointees, just like cabinet officials and the attorney general, other cabinet members and literally thousands of other jobs within the executive branch.\n\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama asked for the resignation of George W. Bush-appointed U.S. Attorneys. When he replaced virtually all of them, it was treated as nothing out of the ordinary. That\u2019s because it wasn\u2019t.\n\nIn March 1993 President Bill Clinton had Attorney General Janet Reno fire 93 of the 94 U.S. Attorneys appointed by the prior administration. (Only Michael Chertoff was retained, apparently at the request of Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.) Again, there was no outrage over these firings.\n\nYet today, Preet Bharara, Obama\u2019s U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, is being portrayed by some as a political martyr because he was \u201cfired\u201d after he refused the Trump administration\u2019s request to resign along with the remaining 45 Obama appointees in the U.S. Attorney slots. The fuss being made about this is just as phony as the outrage ginned up in 2006 by political opponents of President George W. Bush. They were shocked, SHOCKED!, that Bush had dared replace eight U.S. Attorneys\u2014all of whom had been appointed by\u2026 Bush himself.\n\nAll the sensational coverage\u2014past and present\u2014ignores one simple and controlling fact: All political appointees, including U.S. Attorneys, serve at the pleasure of the president.\n\nAll the sensational coverage\u2014past and present\u2014ignores one simple and controlling fact: All political appointees, including U.S. Attorneys, serve at the pleasure of the president. That is why only 46 Obama appointees were asked to resign last week; all the others had already left.\n\nThat is why only 46 Obama appointees were asked to resign last week; all the others had already left.\n\nThey knew, as does everyone else in Washington politics and the media \u2013 that they were expected to resign as soon as the new president was inaugurated and move on to the no doubt very lucrative jobs they are now being offered in big law firms all over the country.\n\nThe moment a U.S. Attorney leaves, the First Assistant in that office\u2014a career prosecutor\u2014takes over until a new U.S. Attorney is confirmed by the Senate. All of that office\u2019s investigations and prosecutions continue uninterrupted. There is no \u201cpartisan\u201d interference going on.\n\nAll of us can agree that law enforcement should be nonpartisan and carried out in an objective manner that meets the best interests of the administration of justice. But new presidents and new attorneys general are entitled to put in U.S. Attorneys who will carry out their policies and their priorities when it comes to enforcing the myriad federal laws covering everything from terrorism and organized crime to immigration and election fraud.\n\nOn many of these issues, the Trump administration\u2019s policy varies widely from the previous administration. For example, President Trump wants to enforce our immigration laws rather than ignore them. A cadre of U.S. Attorneys appointed to accommodate the old policy would make it virtually impossible to implement the new.\n\nWe know exactly what to expect from these holdovers because we\u2019ve seen what happened when the Trump administration allowed Obama political appointees to remain at the Justice Department.\n\nThe prime example is Sally Yates, the former Deputy Attorney General, who enhanced her reputation (and her job prospects) with the progressive left when she announced that she would not defend President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration. Her political allies portrayed her as a martyr, even though she let her political views interfere with her sworn duty to defend an executive order that her own department had already concluded was lawfully issued.\n\nPreet Bharara, the now former U.S. Attorney for Southern New York, seems to be trying to stage the same type of media spectacle. Like all of the other remaining Obama political appointees, he was asked to resign. Unlike all the others, he refused to do so.\n\nThe administration then did the most natural thing in the world: it dismissed him. Bharara broke the news himself, tweeting out that he had been fired almost as soon as he got off the telephone call with Main Justice. This little bit of political theatre is apparently calculated to raise his profile, his \u201ccred\u201d and perhaps his market value among the \u201cResist\u201d wing of the Left.\n\nI am told by a knowledgeable media source that Bharara is extremely ambitious. New York papers have speculated that he may be ramping up for a run for governor or mayor. Another former Justice Department source confirmed that Bharara \u201chas grand political aspirations,\u201d adding that he is also \u201cextremely partisan.\u201d\n\nThe only real outrage here is that a politically ambitious prosecutor and his friends in the media are taking a totally routine event \u2013 the request that a political appointee resign the post he was given under a prior administration\u2019s patronage \u2013 and trying to turn it into a scandal.\n\nHans A. von Spakovsky is a Senior Legal Fellow at The Heritage Foundation and former Justice Department official.

Rob Portman, R-Ohio, is joining with Democrats to push back on that last proposed reduction.\n\nCuts to the Coast Guard are meeting Republican resistance. Trump's plan to eliminate community development block grants was dismissed on Capitol Hill by those who remember how a modest cut to the program sank a spending bill not long ago.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we have no alternative but to reinvest in our military and make ourselves a military power once again,\" White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nThe United States, however, already spends more than half trillion dollars on defense, more than the next seven countries combined.\n\nCohn defended the spending cuts elsewhere as necessary to balance the budget. \"These are tough decisions, but the president has shown he is ready, willing and able to make these tough decisions,\" he said Sunday.\n\nDemocrats are unlikely to support the cuts, and Republican defections raise the possibility of a congressional train wreck and a potential government shutdown when the 2018 budget year begins Oct. 1.\n\nPreliminary reports on the budget show some domestic Cabinet agencies, such as the departments of Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs, would see increases, including $3 billion for Trump's promised wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump said repeatedly during the campaign that Mexico would pay for that project, but Mexico has said no.\n\nThose intended spending increases, however, would mean deeper cuts elsewhere.\n\nPeople familiar with the budget who spoke on condition of anonymity in advance of the public release say the White House is seeking a 30 percent cut from an Energy Department office that promotes energy efficiency and renewable energy.\n\nThe office has funded research on projects such as LED light bulbs, electric trucks, advanced batteries and biofuels.\n\nThe Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy is targeted for at least $700 million in cuts from its current $2.1 billion budget, said Scott Sklar, chairman of the steering committee of the Sustainable Energy Coalition.\n\nThe Energy Department could see steep cuts for its 17 national laboratories, which conduct cutting-edge research on topics from nuclear power to advanced materials for energy generation, storage and use.\n\nTrump's preliminary budget, delivered in secret to agencies last month, proposes a 37 percent cut to the State Department and foreign aid budgets. Those cuts and others were subject to revision in the back and forth that the White House had with agencies leading up to the coming release this week.\n\nTrump's submission won't tell the complete story. It will be limited to the discretionary, $1 trillion-plus portion of the $4 trillion annual federal budget that pays for Cabinet agencies and departments.\n\nThese annually appropriated programs have been squeezed in recent years while the costs of mandatory programs such as Medicare and Social Security have risen each year, mostly unchecked.\n\nThe remainder of Trump's budget -- proposals on taxes, mandatory spending and deficits and projections on the economy -- won't come out until May. That document is sure to upset members of the GOP's once-proud and large band of deficit hawks, because Trump's full plans are sure to show large, permanent budget deficits, even with all of the tricks and tools available to the White House Budget office.\n\nThe government ran a $587 billion deficit last year that required it to borrow 15 cents of every dollar it spent. Looking ahead, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the government is on track for accumulated deficits of more than $9 trillion over the coming decade.\n\nCBO Director Keith Hall warns that such huge deficits are putting the government on a long-term path that \"would have serious negative consequences for the budget and the nation, including an increased risk of fiscal crisis.\"\n\nBut Trump is promising to leave the government's two largest programs, Medicare and Social Security, virtually untouched. He's also promising $1 trillion in infrastructure spending, even as pressure is building to finance tax cuts with borrowed money.\n\nTrump's budget options are already being hemmed in by decisions on health care. The Trump-endorsed House bill cuts taxes by $1 trillion over the coming decade while devoting hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicaid cuts toward a new GOP subsidy.\n\n\"They're going to have a hell of a hard time passing a budget that balances -- even fabricating a budget that balances,\" said Kentucky Rep.

But the judges in their 2-1 decision didn't propose an immediate fix, and Texas could appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nRepublicans hold two of three congressional districts ruled newly invalid and were found to have been partly drawn with discriminatory intent. The GOP-controlled Texas Legislature approved the maps in 2011, the same year then-Gov. Rick Perry signed a voter ID law that ranks among the toughest in the U.S. Courts have since weakened that law, too.\n\nJudges noted the \"strong racial tension and heated debate about Latinos, Spanish-speaking people, undocumented immigrants and sanctuary cities\" that served as the backdrop in the Legislature to Texas adopting the maps and the voter ID law. Those tensions are flaring again over President Donald Trump's executive orders on immigration, and Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is also demanding tough crackdowns on so-called sanctuary cities.\n\n\"The record indicates not just a hostility toward Democrat districts, but a hostility to minority districts, and a willingness to use race for partisan advantage,\" U.S. District Judges Xavier Rodriguez and Orlando Garcia wrote in their opinion.\n\nRepublican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton did not immediately remark on the ruling.\n\nAn attorney for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund welcomed Friday's ruling.\n\n\"The court's decision exposes the Texas Legislature's illegal effort to dilute the vote of Texas Latinos,\" said Nina Perales, the group's vice president of litigation and lead counsel in the case. \"Moving forward, the ruling will help protect Latinos from manipulation of district lines in order to reduce their political clout.\"\n\nHispanics were found to have fueled Texas' dramatic growth in the 2010 census, the year before the maps were drawn, accounting for two out of every three new residents in the state. The findings of racially motivated mapmaking satisfied Democrats and minority rights groups, who are now pushing a separate federal court in Texas to determine that the voter ID law was also crafted with discriminatory intent.\n\nTexas was forced ahead of the November election to weaken its voter ID law, which allows concealed handgun licenses but not college student IDs, after a federal appeals court found that the requirements particularly hampered minorities and the poor.\n\nThe Obama administration had brought the muscle of the U.S. Justice Department into Texas to help challenge both the maps and voter ID law. But barely a month after Trump took office, the federal government reversed course and announced it would no longer argue that Texas purposefully discriminated against minorities with its voter ID law.\n\nIt was not yet clear whether the Trump administration will also drop opposition to Texas' maps. But U.S. Circuit Judge Jerry Smith, in a blistering dissent, had strong words for Obama administration attorneys after they joined the case.\n\n\"It was obvious, from the start, that the DoJ attorneys viewed state officials and the legislative majority and their staffs as a bunch of backwoods hayseed bigots who bemoan the abolition of the poll tax and pine for the days of literacy tests and lynchings,\" Smith wrote. \"And the DoJ lawyers saw themselves as an expeditionary landing party arriving here, just in time, to rescue the state from oppression, obviously presuming that plaintiffs' counsel were not up to the task.\"\n\nThe stakes in finding discriminatory intent are higher because it provides a window for opponents to argue that Texas should be forced to resume having changes to voting laws \"pre-cleared\" by the Justice Department or a federal court. A 2013 U.S. Supreme Court ruling did away with preclearance by striking down a key provision in the federal Voting Rights Act.\n\nThe congressional districts voided by the panel belong to Democrat Lloyd Doggett and Republicans Will Hurd and Blake Farenthold.

Little did I know that less than 10 miles behind me, a bridge across the New York State Thruway had given way, sending 10 unsuspecting motorists plunging into the Schoharie River.\n\nFast forward to the summer of 2007, the entire nation watched in horror as a massive chunk of the I-35 bridge, crossing the Mississippi River just outside of Minnesota, gave way in rush hour traffic sending 13 people to their death and injuring nearly 150 Americans.\n\nThe next day on the banks of the river, politicians wrung their hands.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans alike always take a September 12th mindset to infrastructure failures. Our leaders intone that \u201cwe can make certain this never happens again\u201d \u2013 until it does.\n\nWe should all remember Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty holding a news conference, just days after the I-35 bridge collapse, acknowledging that the bridge had been rated as \"structurally deficient\" for a full 17 years.\n\nToday alone, nearly 500 trains will cross the Portal Bridge in New Jersey. Those trains will carry nearly 200,000 passengers. It is the busiest train bridge in the Western Hemisphere. The Portal Bridge is 105 years old.\n\nPresidents and other elected officials have ignored this foundational responsibility of government for decades now.\n\nRight now, there are more than 600,000 bridges in our nation that are knowingly rated to be \"obsolete or structurally deficient.\"\n\nPresident Trump has made it clear that he will not stand silently by and wait for the infrastructure equivalent of September 11th.\n\nI\u2019m offering four key points critical to the impending debate.\n\n1. We need to prioritize our spending. An infrastructure bill can't be to fund every pet project for every Member of Congress. The federal government just set a record for revenue. Washington, DC does not need more money - it needs to spend our money smarter and on the right priorities. Elected officials love to cut ribbons next to new bridges. Let's fix the ones that exist today or close them.\n\n2. Pour concrete rather than fund pensions. A full 30 percent of the so called \"stimulus spending\" under President Obama in 2009 went to fund bureaucracy.\n\n3. Reduce regulations. A perfect example of government run amuck and wasting taxpayer dollars is the New York State Wicks Law. Passed in 1924 to protect union laborers, the law requires that on all public projects, separate contracts must be let for plumbing, HVAC, and electrical. It is estimated that this antiquated law adds as much as 30% to construction projects. This taxpayer dollar sucking regulation must be eliminated.\n\n4. Bring in private capital. After more than 50 years of public operation, Indiana recently privatized a more than 150 mile toll road in a nearly $4B contract. Rather than forcing taxpayers to foot the bill for modernization and enhanced customer improvements, the State of Indiana struck an arrangement to lease the toll road for the next 75 years to private operators that will improve the highway through user fees.\n\nInfrastructure investment does not poll high. It's not at the top of American's list of priorities. But it is critical that our roads, bridges, dams and energy grid are those of a first world nation.\n\nToday, China spends more on infrastructure than all of Europe and the United States, combined!\n\nPresident Trump is putting a stake in the ground by saying and demonstrating that the safety of Americans is his top priority.\n\nPresident Roosevelt had his Civilian Conservation Corp to create manually skilled labor jobs during the Great Depression. President Kennedy rallied the nation to \"send a man to the moon and back safely by the end of the decade.\u201d President Eisenhower inspired the national highway network we use to travel each and every day.\n\nThis 21st century modernization initiative will make Americans safe, create good paying jobs, and demonstrate to over burdened taxpayers that government can actually deliver real value.\n\nMark Aesch is CEO of TransPro, a performance management consultancy focused on helping transportation organizations to perform at higher levels of efficiency with strategic planning, customer satisfaction survey and reporting services, and executive leadership coaching.

And some Republicans accuse Ryan and fellow House GOP leaders of moving too quickly.\n\nDemocrats paid a price for their lengthy process in passing the bill.

He also said that he would ask FBI Director James Comey directly when he appears later this month before the full committee, which is investigating Russian activities during the election.\n\n\"We should be able to determine in fairly short order whether this allegation is true or false,\" Schiff told reporters Tuesday evening at the Capitol.\n\nNunes has said that so far he has not seen any evidence to back up Trump's claim and has suggested the news media were taking the president's weekend tweets too literally.\n\n\"The president is a neophyte to politics \u2014 he's been doing this a little over a year,\" Nunes told reporters earlier this week.\n\nOther lawmakers have asked for similar evidence.\n\nDeclaring that Congress \"must get to the bottom\" of Trump's claim, Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., asked Comey and Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente to produce the paper trail created when the Justice Department's criminal division secures warrants for wiretaps.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/11/house-panel-wants-any-evidence-trumps-phones-were-tapped.html"}, {"text": "Congress is like a computer system. Its constructs are binary -- \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1.\u201d Yes and no.\n\nLawmakers are elected to office. Lawmakers are defeated for office.\n\nYes and no.\n\nMembers of Congress vote yes on a bill. They vote no on a bill.\n\nMeasures pass. Measures fail.\n\nThere is no middle ground.\n\nAnd if both houses of Congress voted today, the Republican ObamaCare replacement bill would fail.\n\nYes and no.\n\nAnd in this case, no.\n\nThat\u2019s why House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is vaulting into the highest-octane sales pitch of his career. The next several weeks could define his speakership.\n\nHe must successfully advance a health care package, adopt a budget blueprint and avoid a government shutdown by the end of April. Lurking down the line are fracases over the debt limit and tax reform.\n\nOn Thursday morning, it was as though stagehands from the Broadway production of \u201cHamilton\u201d showed up in the House Radio/TV Gallery studio to prepare for Ryan\u2019s weekly press conference.\n\nRadio/TV Gallery staffer Ryan Dahl ripped his suit jacket detaching and moving the bulky, wooden lectern where lawmakers usually field questions from reporters so Ryan could maneuver about the stage, not tethered to the podium. Other aides wheeled in a TV monitor and synched up cables so the speaker could use a remote clicker for a slide presentation.\n\nRyan entered, sans jacket, white shirt sleeves rolled up, exposing his forearms.\n\nYou know things are getting serious when a politician shows up for a photo-op or press conference with his shirt sleeves rolled up.\n\nEverything went well for the speaker\u2019s multi-media presentation with reporters. Ryan\u2019s kids didn\u2019t bound jauntily into the studio unexpected while he spoke.\n\nHis panicked wife didn\u2019t slide across the floor Tom Cruise \u201cRisky Business\u201d style in stocking feet to extract the juvenile interlopers. But whether Ryan successfully marketed the health care bill to fellow conservatives is another story.\n\nRepublicans have campaigned on repealing and replacing ObamaCare for seven years. Just the fact that the speaker has to make such a carnival barker pitch to his own members speaks volumes.\n\n\u201cThis is the closest we will ever get to repealing and replacing ObamaCare,\u201d he said. \u201cThe time is here. The time is now. This is the moment. And this is the closest this will ever happen. It really comes down to a binary choice.\u201d\n\nIn other words, yes or no. Lawmakers vote to repeal and replace ObamaCare with the current bill -- or they don\u2019t. A binary choice.\n\nSkeptics could use a harsher phrase: \u201cTake it or leave it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHitting the pause button is like hitting the status quo button,\u201d House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, told Fox News.\n\nPresident Trump promised at a meeting Friday of key House GOP committee chairmen: \u201cWe are going to get it done. \u2026 Something is going to happen very shortly.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the trouble. When Ryan assumed the speakership, he promised rank-and-file members an open, bottom-up, member-driven process.\n\nMuch of the health care bill is codified in Ryan\u2019s \u201cA Better Way\u201d agenda. But that doesn\u2019t mean he has satisfied members who want to alter the bill.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer stoked those embers this week when he said \u201cevery member of the House and Senate will be able to have their opportunity to have amendments offered through the committee process and on the floor.\u201d\n\nThat could translate to what\u2019s called an \u201copen rule\u201d in the House by which any member may offer an amendment at any time. Typically, the powerful House Rules Committee decides what, if any, amendments are in order on a given piece of legislation.\n\nDemocrats permitted precisely two amendments when they advanced the first version of ObamaCare in November, 2009.\n\n\u201cI would just point-blank say I would encourage Mr. Spicer, if he thinks he\u2019s going to start talking about my business, give me a darn call,\u201d excoriated House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions, R-Texas. \u201cI try not to get in his business. I don\u2019t appreciate him getting in my business.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why Ryan doesn\u2019t want much deviation from the original, base bill.\n\nHouse GOP legislative staff has toiled for weeks to make sure their legislation comports with unique Senate budgetary provisions called \u201creconciliation.\u201d\n\nDemocrats would inevitably filibuster any effort by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to move a health care bill under standard procedures.\n\nBut considering a measure under the complicated budget reconciliation process shuts off filibusters. Republicans have no other option than to move the bill via reconciliation.\n\nThat creates another set of problems. The Senate mandates that only budgetary-fiscal provisions fall under the reconciliation process. In other words, making some policy changes could be dicey.\n\nSecondly, packages under reconciliation cannot add to the deficit. In other words, Ryan thinks he\u2019s astutely crafted a health care replacement bill that falls narrowly within the reconciliation window.\n\nSo major changes could blow that up.\n\n\u201cThe last thing we want to do is prevent our ability to actually get law made,\u201d he said. \u201cThis reconciliation tool is pretty tight. There's a lot of stuff we would love to put in the bill, but unfortunately the Senate rules don't allow us that.\u201d\n\nWhat stays in or out of the bill is up to Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough. She\u2019s in charge of enforcing what\u2019s called \u201cThe Byrd Rule,\u201d named after the late Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.V.). MacDonough oversees the \u201cByrd bath.\u201d\n\nThis is a process of plucking out any provisions that don\u2019t meet the reconciliation standards. The Senate refers to removed provisions as \u201cByrd droppings.\u201d The Senate can vote to overrule MacDonough\u2019s decisions -- but only with 60 votes.\n\nThere are currently 52 Republicans in the Senate.\n\nThe idea of sticking to Senate rules infuriates some conservatives.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a problem with this whole Byrd Rule and the way this works that some unelected parliamentarian can do that,\u201d scoffed Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a co-leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.\n\nJordan is a two-time NCAA Division I wrestling champion at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It\u2019s unclear if the congressman would endorse wrestling matches without referees.\n\nBut Jordan is incensed that lawmakers may be limited in their opportunities to change the bill.\n\n\u201cGod bless the speaker. But that\u2019s not how the legislative process is supposed to work,\u201d said Jordan about Ryan\u2019s push to curb amendments. \u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be closed off.\u201d\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus member Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., harbors the same frustrations as Jordan.\n\n\u201cSomehow ObamaCare made it through reconciliation,\u201d Brat said. \u201cSo how did they do that and we can\u2019t?\u201d\n\nThe answer is that Democrats advanced some of ObamaCare through budget reconciliation. Not all.\n\nThat\u2019s why Ryan wants Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price to administratively filet other portions of the law. Ryan also hopes the House and Senate can pass future, additional bills, changing Obamacare.\n\nThat could be an issue for members of the Freedom Caucus.\n\nFor years under the leadership of former House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, conservatives often bit their tongue and reluctantly voted for a host of emergency bills to fund the government, grapple with tax issues and increase the debt ceiling.\n\nMany believed leadership frequently promised opportunities to \u201cfix\u201d things on future bills, but those tomorrows never came. Thus, Freedom Caucus members are reluctant to buy Ryan\u2019s promise of addressing other parts of ObamaCare down the road.\n\nThat\u2019s why Brat suggested Republicans incinerate Senate precedents with what\u2019s sometimes referred to as \u201cthe nuclear option.\u201d\n\nDemocrats took this extraordinary step to curb filibusters on most executive branch nominees in 2013. Now Brat and others want to lower the bar to break filibusters on legislation to just a simple majority rather than the current 60-vote threshold.\n\nThat move would make the reconciliation process a moot point. Republicans could achieve their legislative goals on health care with just 51 yeas -- but not have to fit their bill neatly into the special confines of budget reconciliation and comply with the Byrd Rule.\n\n\u201cWe just need some action over there,\u201d said Brat of Senate Republicans. \u201cThey are hiding under their desks.\u201d\n\nSaid Jordan: \u201cI\u2019m for what needs to be done.\u201d\n\nIf not the \u201cnuclear option,\u201d some Republicans might back another tactic which would entail a wild, Senate parliamentary high-wire act.\n\nIf MacDonough ditches a provision in reconciliation, some conservatives want Vice President Pence to preside over the Senate, ignore her advice and rule the issue in question to be in order.\n\nThat gambit would turn the question on its head. Senate Democrats would then have to miraculously muster 60 votes to get the chamber to bounce the provision because it didn\u2019t comply with reconciliation guidelines.\n\nThis parliamentary contrivance would entail buy-in from McConnell and Ryan. McConnell is an institutionalist who is very protective of the Senate\u2019s rules and precedents.\n\nRyan is a former House Budget Committee chairman and is custodial when it comes to respecting the congressional budget process. Getting that duo to go along with such an artifice would take a lot.\n\nEven so, there\u2019s no guarantee that the Senate can even garner 51 votes to pass the replacement bill right now.\n\nJordan and Freedom Caucus co-leader Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., met one-on-one with Trump and also with other White House officials Thursday. If Republicans lack the votes, it\u2019s unclear what steps Trump may demand congressional Republicans take to replace ObamaCare.\n\n\u201cDespite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great,\u201d the president recently tweeted. \u201cIt will end in a beautiful picture.\u201d\n\nRep. Mark Walker, R-N.C., is chairman of the Republican Study Committee, the largest bloc of conservatives in the House.\n\nHe says group members will likely back the replacement bill if leaders attach two provisions.\n\nOne is a proposal from Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Va., to allow states to mandate work requirements for some people to receive Medicaid. The other plan comes from Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas. He wants the Medicaid expansion frozen at the end of the year.\n\nHowever, Medicaid expansion is popular among many Republicans.\n\nOhio is a Medicaid expansion state, and Ohio GOP Sen. Rob Portman huddled this week with Pence and Price.\n\n\u201cWe must provide stability and certainty for individuals and families in Medicaid expansion programs and real flexibility for states,\u201d Portman said.\n\nThe key is tweaking the bill -- plus allowing in order and adopting amendments -- which generates precisely the right number of votes to pass the bill.\n\n\u201cSometimes when you have pushback on one side and the other side from a political spectrum, you might have found the sweet spot,\u201d said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\n\nBut again, if there are too many changes.\n\nIn the summer of 2009, the Democratically-controlled House tried to gin up the votes to approve major environment legislation known as \u201ccap and trade.\u201d\n\nJust before the measure went before the Rules Committee, then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., authorized a middle-of-the-night, 309-page \u201cmanager\u2019s amendment.\u201d\n\nThe massive amendment was a cavalcade of additions and fixes, all designed to court just the right number of members to pass the 1,200 page bill.\n\nThe manager\u2019s amendment proved to be essential. The House OK\u2019d the climate bill 219-212. Switch four votes and the bill would have failed.\n\nRyan contends Republicans can\u2019t wander too far astray. And a massive, Pelosi-type amendment could upend the bill in reconciliation.\n\nSo it\u2019s back to zero and one. Yes and no. They pass the bill or they defeat the bill.\n\nCongress is a computer system. It\u2019s binary.\n\nAnd if Republicans can\u2019t muster the votes, perhaps the only way to approve the bill may be to hack the system.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/11/gop-house-leaders-vow-input-on-obamacare-replacement-but-know-changes-could-topple-effort.html"}, {"text": "An outspoken Manhattan federal prosecutor known for fighting public corruption was fired Saturday afternoon.\n\nU.S. Attorney Preet Bharara tweeted that he \"did not resign\" and added, \"Moments ago, I was fired.

The person, who spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to comment publicly, said Bharara was remaining in his post after receiving assurances last year from Trump and Sessions that they wanted him to stay on.\n\nHowever, a senior administration official told Fox News later Saturday night that Bharara's account of his meeting with Trump and Jeff Sessions at Trump Tower -- where he informed the press afterward that he was invited to stay on indefinitely as U.S. attorney -- was never confirmed by Trump's transition team but was solely an account from Bharara himself.\n\nIt was previously reported by the Associated Press that Bharara was not complying with Attorney General Jeff Sessions' request to resign along with other prosecutors appointed by former President Barack Obama.\n\nNew York Attorny General Eric Schneiderman issued a statement Saturday afternoon.\n\nBy abruptly removing 40+ US Attorneys - including @PreetBharara - Pres.

Chuck Schumer, D-NY, in a statement.\n\nSpokespeople for Bharara's office declined comment after word Friday that Bharara's name was included on Sessions' list.\n\nThe Justice Department declined comment early Saturday.\n\nThe department said Friday that some U.S. attorneys, as in prior transitions, already had left the department.

Incoming administrations over the past several decades typically have replaced most U.S. attorneys during the first year or two.\n\nThe Obama administration allowed political appointees of President George W. Bush to serve until their replacement had been nominated and confirmed. One U.S. attorney appointed by Bush, Rod Rosenstein of Maryland, remained on the job for the entire Obama administration and is the current nominee for deputy attorney general.\n\nBut Sessions' actions are being closely scrutinized by Democrats after a rocky start to the attorney general\u2019s time at the Justice Department.\n\nWeeks after his tight confirmation vote on Feb. 8, it emerged that Sessions had met twice with the Russian ambassador last year -- despite testifying during his confirmation hearing he had no communications with the Russians. Sessions later clarified his testimony, while recusing himself from any investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 campaign.\n\nSen.

They are leading their party at a time when it is changing and the country has changed. There are fissures in terms of what they believe and what they want. There is no shared, overarching sense of the meaning and purpose of the Republican Party, no agreed-upon blueprint from which to operate.\n\nMost of them know that something substantial happened in 2016, when half, and then considerably more than half, of the Republican base followed Donald Trump, along with a great many Democrats. But they are still uncertain of the meaning of the event. I suggested to a Capitol Hill figure last week that it was a populist wave and the future of the Republican Party is moderate populism.

He asked Conley to block its enforcement against his family.\n\nU.S. District Judge William Conley said there were daily threats to the Syrian man's wife and child that could cause \"irreparable harm.\" He issued a temporary restraining order barring enforcement against the family. The order doesn't block the entire travel ban. It simply prevents Trump's administration from enforcing it against this family pending a March 21 hearing.\n\nKELLYANNE CONWAY: NEW TRAVEL BAN 'WILL PASS LEGAL MUSTER'\n\n\u201cThe court appreciates that there may be important differences between the original executive order, and the revised executive order. ... As the order applies to the plaintiff here, however, the court finds his claims have at least some chance of prevailing for the reasons articulated by other courts,\u201d Conley wrote.\n\nA Syrian Muslim man who was granted asylum and settled in Wisconsin has been working since last year to win U.S. government approval for his wife and 3-year-old daughter to leave the devastated city of Aleppo and join him here. The man, who is not identified because of fears for his family's safety, filed a federal lawsuit in Madison in February alleging Trump's first travel ban had wrongly stopped the visa process for his family.\n\nAfter the Trump ban was blocked the first time, the approval process restarted for the Syrian family and they're now preparing to travel to Jordan for visa interviews at the U.S. embassy, the last step before U.S. customs officials decide whether to issue them visas. But the family doesn't have dates for the interviews yet and Trump's new travel ban goes into effect March 16, stirring fears that the process could halt again before visas are issued, according to the Syrian man's attorneys.\n\nGovernment attorneys argued during a teleconference with Conley on Friday that the new ban may not apply to this family anyway, although they did not go into details. There are various exemptions and waivers in the new ban including some that give consular officers flexibility to decide cases. Conley acknowledged that the family's situation is murky but still issued the order, saying the man seems to have a good chance of winning the case.\n\nThe U.S Justice Department is defending the ban. Spokeswoman Nicole Navas said agency attorneys were reviewing the Syrian man's complaint and declined further comment on it and Conley's order.\n\nTrump issued an executive order in January banning travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Syria, from entering the United States. U.S. District Judge James Robart in Washington state blocked the entire order on Feb. 3.\n\nThe revised order issued Monday removed Iraq from the list of countries and would temporarily shuts down the refugee program. Unlike the first order, the new ban would not affect current visa holders and removes language that would give priority to religious minorities. Hawaii filed a lawsuit challenging the new ban Wednesday; other states with Democratic attorneys general plan to sue next week.\n\nAccording to the Syrian man's lawsuit, he fled his country to avoid near-certain death at the hands of two military factions, one a Sunni-aligned group fighting against President Assad 's regime and another group fighting in support of Assad. The pro-Assad forces thought he was sympathetic to the other side and the anti-Assad army targeted him because he was a Sunni and traveled to pro-Assad areas to manage his family's business.\n\nBoth sides tortured him and threatened to kill him, the lawsuit said. The pro-Assad forces also threatened to rape his wife. He came to the United States in 2014 and was granted asylum last year. He then began filing petitions seeking asylum for his wife and daughter.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/10/new-trump-travel-ban-cant-be-enforced-on-syrian-family-trying-to-flee-to-wisconsin-judge-says.html"}, {"text": "Under expanded authority granted by President Trump shortly after he took office, U.S. commanders have taken the gloves off in the fight against al Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula, a terrorist group known by its initials AQAP.\n\nWith the Islamic State on the ropes in Iraq and Syria, many U.S. counterterrorism officials now see the al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen as the more immediate threat to the U.S. homeland.\n\n\"We strongly believe that AQAP remains intent on attacking the West,\" a senior defense official involved in counterterrorism told reporters at the Pentagon recently.\n\n\"AQAP is constantly near the top when we rack and stack threats to the homeland from terrorist groups.\"", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/10/is-al-qaeda-more-dangerous-than-isis-again.html"}, {"text": "Attorney General Jeff Sessions has asked the remaining 46 U.S. attorneys who served under the Obama administration to resign, the Justice Department announced Friday, describing the move as part of an effort to ensure a \"uniform transition.\"\n\nThe department said some U.S. attorneys, as in prior transitions, already had left the department. Now, \"the Attorney General has now asked the remaining 46 presidentially appointed U.S. Attorneys to tender their resignations,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\n\u201cUntil the new U.S. Attorneys are confirmed, the dedicated career prosecutors in our U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices will continue the great work of the Department in investigating, prosecuting, and deterring the most violent offenders,\u201d the statement added.\n\nDepartment of Justice spokesperson Peter Carr told Fox News late Friday night: \u201cThe President called Dana Boente and Rod Rosenstein tonight to inform them that he has declined to accept their resignation, and they will remain in their current positions.\u201d\n\nHowever, no additional guidance was given on U.S. Attorney General for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara, who was appointed by then-President Barack Obama and assumed the role of Manhattan U.S. Attorney in 2009. Bharara met with Trump in November and said after the meeting that he had agreed to stay on.\n\nIt is customary, though not automatic, for the country's 93 U.S. attorneys to leave their positions once a new president is in office. Incoming administrations over the past several decades typically have replaced most U.S. attorneys during the first year or two.\n\nThe Obama administration allowed political appointees of President George W. Bush to serve until their replacement had been nominated and confirmed. One U.S. attorney appointed by Bush, Rod Rosenstein of Maryland, remained on the job for the entire Obama administration and is the current nominee for deputy attorney general.\n\nBut Sessions' actions are being closely scrutinized by Democrats after a rocky start to the AG's time at the DOJ.\n\nWeeks after his tight confirmation vote on Feb. 8, it emerged that Sessions had met twice with the Russian ambassador last year -- despite testifying during his confirmation hearing he had no communications with the Russians. Sessions later clarified his testimony, while recusing himself from any investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 campaign.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, issued a statement late Friday saying: \u201cI\u2019m surprised to hear that President Trump and Attorney General Sessions have abruptly fired all 46 remaining U.S. attorneys. \"\n\n\u201cIn January, I met with Vice President Pence and White House Counsel Donald McGahn and asked specifically whether all U.S. attorneys would be fired at once. Mr. McGahn told me that the transition would be done in an orderly fashion to preserve continuity. Clearly this is not the case. I\u2019m very concerned about the effect of this sudden and unexpected decision on federal law enforcement,\" she said.\n\nU.S. attorneys are responsible for prosecuting federal crimes in the territories they oversee. They report to Justice Department leadership in Washington, and their priorities are expected to be in line with those of the attorney general.

Trump has called the FDA's drug approval process \"slow and burdensome\" despite changes to speed reviews, particularly of cutting-edge products.\n\nThe White House official confirmed Trump's selection of Gottlieb on condition of anonymity because the nomination has not been formally announced.\n\nGottlieb, 44, is no stranger to the FDA \u2014 he served as a deputy commissioner under President George W. Bush. While he has frequently criticized the FDA for unnecessary regulations and urged changes to get safe and effective drugs onto the market faster, he generally has supported its overall mission.\n\nGottlieb is a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and a partner in the venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates. He has spent more than a decade in Washington rotating between the worlds of government, health policy consulting and political think tanks.\n\nSince leaving the FDA in 2007, Gottlieb has served as a board member or adviser to at least nine pharmaceutical or medical technology companies, according to his LinkedIn profile. Gottlieb is a consultant to GlaxoSmithKline's product investment board; a managing director at T.R. Winston & Company merchant bank, which specializes in health care; and a clinical assistant professor at New York University School of Medicine.

As part of the federal vetting process, FDA nominees typically disclose and sell stocks, funds and other investments that could pose a financial conflict of interest.\n\nGottlieb generally supports reduced FDA regulation, particularly for emerging products like health apps and wearable devices like the Apple Watch. But he has never embraced libertarian-leaning proposals that would have the FDA abandon its effectiveness reviews of drugs and medical products. Under those plans, the FDA would simply approve products that appear safe, allowing the private sector to determine how well they actually treat diseases or medical conditions.\n\nThe evaluation of medical effectiveness has been a cornerstone of the FDA's mission since the early 1960s and is universally embraced by its staff and the businesses it regulates.\n\n\"If FDA were not in business of evaluating effectiveness then these companies wouldn't be able to say much.

Chelsea Manning, then known as Bradley Manning. But to date, Assange has not been charged with any crime related to his website.\n\nSESSIONS ASKS REMAINING 46 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS TO RESIGN\n\nThe Australian-born Assange remains holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London where he was granted asylum in 2012, because of a European arrest warrant stemming from sexual assault allegations made by two women in 2010. Assange denies the claims, but risks deportation the moment he steps foot outside of that embassy.\n\nProsecuting Assange for the document dump would be an uphill battle for the U.S., according to Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano. In the modern, increasingly broad definition of press, WikiLeaks fits the bill, he said.\n\n\"If a stolen document containing state secrets gets into the hands of the press, which is loosely defined as any entity in the business of revealing things, and it is a matter of public interest then it can be exposed with impunity,\" Napolitano said. \"Assange is clearly a media entity, albeit an unorthodox one... so the thief, the person who hands it to WikiLeaks, is the criminal.

The CIA, according to the files, has the ability to spy on people through their smartphones and certain TVs and computers, expressed interest in hacking into the electrical systems of automobiles and operates a clandestine hacking sites in Germany.\n\nWhile the First Amendment may protect Assange, it would not cover anyone who illegally leaked the material to his organization. The FBI has already mounted an investigation aimed at finding the mole who divulged the material or any external hacker who retrieved it from CIA servers.\n\nBut U.S. investigators will get no help from Assange on that score.\n\n\"We're specialists in source protection,\" Assange said.\n\nAdding to the difficulty in tracing the source of this leak is the fact that many of the tools the government would have used may have just been shared with the public, at least according to WikiLeaks.\n\n\"How can you use your full resources when they were just radically depleted?\" cybersecurity expert Gregory Keeley wondered. \"This is analogous to the nuclear football codes being posted on Facebook.\"", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/03/10/first-amendment-could-protect-assange-despite-pences-vow-says-legal-expert.html"}, {"text": "**Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day?

Aside from having been swept into power with the largest electoral landslide in 68 years, Roosevelt was also dealing with a nation so desperate for relief that it was willing to accept almost anything.\n\nWhen a quarter of the workforce is unemployed and depositors are losing their life savings in bank busts, folks tend to become rather open to change.\n\nSo it\u2019s hardly fair to judge Roosevelt\u2019s successors by the same standard, especially one such as Donald Trump, who took office with a narrow margin and at a moment of relative peace and prosperity. Things may not be good enough for voters to want a caretaker presidency, but they\u2019re not so bad as to create a sudden demand for radicalism.\n\nTrump, like most of the rest, embraced the 100-day concept because of a mix of the historical grandiosity that comes with the start of every administration as well as the needed momentum that such a deadline provides. Congress doesn\u2019t move until it must, and setting the finish-line for a 100-day dash helps get lawmakers out of the starting blocks \u2013 even when the situation isn\u2019t so perilous as the one that faced the nation 84 years ago.\n\nThere was plenty more to fear back then than fear itself\u2026\n\nEven so, as Trump took office, he laid out an agenda as ambitious in some ways as Roosevelt\u2019s and at least as audacious as any that came after: Remake the American health care system, re-write the tax code, overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration policies, launch the most expensive infrastructure program in American history, re-negotiate trade policy from top to bottom and curtail drug abuse, all while creating a new paradigm for foreign policy and national security.\n\nWhew\u2026\n\nBy assembling a list so mind boggling, Trump was, in the strictest sense, setting himself up to fail. It would be impossible for any president to make even a down payment on such a list of promises in his first 100 days.\n\nBut, despite lots of turbulence, Trump is starting to make progress on some of his plans, particularly on health insurance and immigration. The moves have been halting at times, but, halfway through the first 100 days, the forward progress is unmistakable.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is whether the strides Trump is taking toward effective governance in the past week are the new norm or a blip in what has mostly been a chaotic and unfocused start.\n\nWill we look back 50 days from now and say that the middle of March was the start of the real Trump presidency or will it be a footnote in a larger story about executive insufficiency?\n\nThat will depend on Trump\u2019s development of self-discipline equal to the task. Tweetstorms issued in fits of pique or other distractions prove only too appealing to reporters eager to write the story of the reality show host overwhelmed by office.\n\nIf it remains a chaotic, cutthroat affair pulled weekly into new and pointless controversies surrounding old grievances from the election or Trump\u2019s internal and external grudges, there\u2019s no hope of success.\n\nWhether Trump finds victory or meets his Waterloo after 100 days will be in direct proportion to his ability to bring calm and focus to his still-unfinished administration.\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: FIRST THINGS FIRST\n\n\u201cSecurity against foreign danger is one of the primitive objects of civil society.\u201d \u2013 Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 41\n\nTIME OUT: JACK WHITE, READ ALL OVER\n\nAmerica got to know Jack White as half of the punk revival band The White Stripes.

Despite our best efforts to fund the company and continue to fuel our growth, the Company has been unable to raise the growth capital needed to continue operating as a going concern,\u201d Scott Pearson, Aquion's outgoing CEO, said in a press release.\n\nThe company, which is now seeking a buyer, produces batteries to store solar and renewable energy. It had been touted as a rising star in the energy storage business, even attracting investment from Microsoft founder Bill Gates and millions more in state funding.\n\nIn January, the company was named \u201cthe North American Company of the Year Award\u201d at the annual Cleantech Forum in San Francisco, which \u201cfocuses on emerging trends, leading innovation companies, and key players in sustainable innovation.\u201d\n\nSuzanne Roski, the company's chief restructuring officer, did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News.\n\nCritics say Aquion\u2019s fate is further evidence the government should not be in the business of picking winners and losers.\n\n\u201cWho thinks the Department of Energy has the expertise to predict which companies will succeed for fail in the marketplace, particularly in an industry that is not only dependent upon government subsidies, but is highly unpredictable?\u201d said William Yeatman, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.\n\nThe company grew out of the work of Jay Whitacre, an engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University. He developed a successful design for a storage battery that would use only non-toxic, non-flammable chemicals, rather than the more flammable lithium batteries.\n\nDays before the company filed for Chapter 11, Whitacre was named the new director of the Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation at Carnegie Mellon.\n\nAquion was awarded its federal grant in 2010. The Department of Energy issued the funding to build a large-scale battery manufacturing plant that would be located on the site of a former Sony facility in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania.\n\nPrivate investors flocked to the project.\n\nAccording to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, Aquion raised about $190 million from investors, including from Ray Lane, a former president of Oracle.\n\nThey began low-volume production in the summer of 2011, broke ground on full-scale manufacturing facility in 2012 and have been shipping commercially since mid-2014, according to its website.\n\nTwo years later, Aquion Energy received $16.6 million in funds from the state of Pennsylvania, including two alternative clean energy loans totaling $5 million, to develop.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Aquion committed to create 341 new jobs and retain 70 existing employees, according to Heidi Havens, communications director for Pennsylvania\u2019s Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED).\n\nIn February 2016, the company requested a two-year extension to create the jobs promised. At that time, only 50 jobs had been created.\n\nThe Westmoreland facility has since halted operations.\n\n\u201cThis announcement is a reminder of the critical need to ensure that taxpayer dollars for economic development projects are spent appropriately and that intended outcomes are met,\u201d Havens said in an email to Fox News.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s remember that the need for energy storage systems is strictly a consequence of the intermittency of renewable energy sources like solar and wind,\u201d Yeatman said. \u201c... These companies benefit from the grants and indirectly from the inefficiencies of an industry that exists by the grace of political favoritism.\u201d", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/10/another-taxpayer-funded-energy-company-files-for-bankruptcy.html"}, {"text": "Since President Trump\u2019s inauguration, Republicans have triggered a steady churn of outrage from the left over perceived gaffes, errors and omissions.\n\nSome of it has been rightly deserved (see: erroneous Trump tweet on Gitmo prisoners). Some of the desk-thumping, however, has more than a hint of hypocrisy -- as that outrage machine was largely silent when similar comments were made by the Obama administration.\n\nHere are just a few examples of statements met with thunderous criticism when uttered by Republicans, yet crickets when made by Democrats:\n\nCarson vs. Obama\n\nHUD Secretary Ben Carson, speaking to department employees earlier this week, sparked outrage when he referred to slaves as \u201cimmigrants.\u201d\n\n\"That's what America is about, a land of dreams and opportunity,\" Carson said. \"There were other immigrants who came here in the bottom of slave ships, worked even longer, even harder for less. But they too had a dream that one day their sons, daughters, grandsons, granddaughters, great-grandsons, great-granddaughters, might pursue prosperity and happiness in this land.\"\n\nThe NAACP and Chelsea Clinton were both among those offended by Carson\u2019s comparison. Actor Samuel L. Jackson tore into Carson in an R-rated tweet.\n\nThis can't be real. Slaves were not & are not immigrants. 2017. https://t.co/8CuUvnR2Mf \u2014 Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) March 6, 2017\n\nThe problem was, then-President Barack Obama made a similar comparison before.\n\n\"It wasn't always easy for new immigrants. Certainly, it wasn't easy for those of African heritage who had not come here voluntarily and yet in their own way were immigrants themselves,\" he said at a 2015 naturalization ceremony.\n\nLots of nastiness directed @RealBenCarson - but in 2015 President Obama also referred to the slaves as immigrants https://t.co/0sinrwgQs3 pic.twitter.com/OSzfbrweHb \u2014 Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) March 7, 2017\n\nThe Federalist went so far as to dig up 11 times Obama had referred to slaves as immigrants, and noted there was barely a peep of outrage each time. What changed?\n\nLay off the iPhones\n\nTwitter was apoplectic when Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, recently said Americans may have to choose between buying a new iPhone and health insurance.\n\n\"Well, we're getting rid of the individual mandate. We're getting rid of those things that people said that they don't want. ... Americans have choices, and they've got to make a choice,\" he said on CNN. \"So rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and want to go spend hundreds of dollars on that, maybe they should invest in their own health care.\u201d\n\nChaffetz was accused of everything from being OK with poor people dying to \u201creviving the \u2018poverty is a choice\u2019 argument.\"\n\nYet the criticism glossed over similar remarks made by Obama in 2014.\n\nAsked in a Spanish-language town hall about those who said they can\u2019t afford premiums, Obama speculated about someone making $40,000-$50,000 a year, who thinks an insurance option that costs $300 a month is too much.\n\n\u201cI guess what I would say is if you looked at that person\u2019s budget and you looked at their cable bill, their telephone \u2026 cell phone bill, other things that they\u2019re spending on, it may turn out that they just haven\u2019t prioritized health care because right now everybody is healthy,\" he said.\n\nShame-rock\n\nSome were put out after the Trump team recently put out green versions of his famous \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats, branded with a four-leaf clover. While said clover is considered a symbol of good luck, some Irish news outlets and others on Twitter grumbled that the three-leaf clover was more appropriate.\n\n\u201cThe shamrock is a three-leaf sprig of clover and is associated with St Patrick's Day,\u201d The Irish Independent complained. \u201cThe four-leaf clover is a plant, that's rarer in abundance. It's also a sugary, oat piece that's usually found in a box of Lucky Charms cereal.\u201d\n\nYet Obama did something similar in 2012 when his campaign produced an \u201cO\u2019Bama\u201d shirt with a four-leaf clover. While the error was noted, it produced little outrage, and even some apologists.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s creative license,\u201d Kevin O\u2019Neill, a professor of Irish History at Boston College, told The New York Times.\u201d If you can add an apostrophe, why not a leaf.\u201d\n\nOmission Outrage\n\nA Trump White House statement on International Holocaust Remembrance Day provoked condemnation when it left out any reference to Jewish people \u2013 the main target of Hitler\u2019s genocidal atrocities.\n\n\u201cIt is with a heavy heart and somber mind that we remember and honor the victims, survivors, heroes of the Holocaust. It is impossible to fully fathom the depravity and horror inflicted on innocent people by Nazi terror,\u201d the statement said.\n\nA number of Jewish groups were critical of the omission. But former Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine, D-Va., went further by comparing the statement to Holocaust denial.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama, President Bush always talked about the Holocaust in connection with the slaughter of Jews. The final solution was about the slaughter of Jews. We have to remember this. This is what Holocaust denial is,\u201d he said.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer blasted the controversy as \u201cnitpicking.\u201d He said: \"To suggest that remembering the Holocaust and acknowledging all of the people -- Jewish, gypsies, priests, disabled, gays and lesbians -- it is pathetic that people are picking on a statement.\"\n\nBut Kaine\u2019s comments in particular were striking considering his former running mate \u2013 former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \u2013 released a statement in 2013 that also did not mention the Jewish people.\n\nThe statement said: \"Each year, we gather together to commemorate the victims of one of the worst tragedies in human history. Indeed, almost 70 years after the end of World War II, we continue to honor those lives that were brutally taken during the Holocaust by the Nazis. This machinery of systematic extermination also took the lives of Roma, gays, persons with disabilities, and others deemed inferior or undesirable by the Nazis.\"\n\nThe statement did condemn Holocaust denial, while also mentioning other genocides, including in \u201cCambodia, Srebrenica, Rwanda and Darfur.\u201d\n\nAdam Shaw is a Politics Reporter and occasional Opinion writer for FoxNews.com.

Gen. Michael Flynn told President Donald Trump's transition team before the inauguration that Flynn might need to register with the government as a foreign agent, but Trump was not aware of the possible move, the White House said Friday.\n\nThe disclosure by White House officials confirms the Trump transition team was aware of the situation involving the president's pick for a top national security post either before he joined the government or soon afterward.\n\nBut the White House's acknowledgement raised new questions about whether Trump's transition team, and later, his White House lawyers, fully vetted Flynn after being informed about his possible filing as a foreign agent for his lobbying during the presidential campaign that may have benefited the government of Turkey.\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer dismissed questions about whether the information should have given the transition team pause, saying Flynn had \"impeccable credentials.\"\n\nTrump fired Flynn last month after less than a month on the job saying he had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other administration officials about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S.\n\nSpicer confirmed that Flynn's personal lawyer contacted Trump transition attorneys before the inauguration about the possible filing. But he added that Flynn's representative only asked for guidance and did not provide more details about the lobbying work or Flynn's business dealings.\n\nSpicer said Flynn's decision whether to file as a foreign agent was a personal matter that his own attorney would need to handle.\n\nAmong those told of Flynn's lobbying work was Don McGahn, Trump's campaign lawyer who served in the transition and later became White House counsel, said a person with direct knowledge of the conversations between Flynn's representatives and the transition team.\n\nThat person, who was not authorized to describe confidential conversations and spoke on condition of anonymity, said that during discussions after the inauguration White House lawyers were told Flynn was moving ahead with plans to file as a foreign agent.\n\nOn Thursday, Spicer had said he did not believe Trump had been told of Flynn's work as a foreign agent. Later that day, Vice President Mike Pence said he was unaware of Flynn's foreign agent work until this week.\n\nFlynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc., filed paperwork this week with the Justice Department formally identifying him as a foreign agent and acknowledging that his work for a company owned by a Turkish businessman \"could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.\"\n\nIn the filings with the Justice Department's Foreign Agent Registration Unit, Flynn and his company described $530,000 worth of lobbying before Election Day on behalf of Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin. The lobbying occurred from August through November while Flynn was a top Trump campaign adviser.\n\nIn an interview with the AP, Alptekin said Flynn and his firm filed the registration after pressure from Justice Department officials. Alptekin said he disagreed with the decision to register. He also said he had asked for some of his money back.\n\nFlynn's registration comes as he has drawn scrutiny from the FBI for his contacts with Russian officials. Through a spokesman, Flynn declined to discuss the registration. In the filing, his attorney said the lobbying contract quickly ended after Trump's election in November.\n\nOn Thursday, Spicer defended Flynn's work, saying he did it as a \"private citizen,\" but he declined to say whether Trump would have hired Flynn if he had known about the lobbying.\n\n\"There's nothing nefarious about doing anything that's legal as long as the proper paperwork is filed,\" Spicer said.\n\nAfter Flynn joined the administration, he agreed not to lobby for five years after leaving government service and never to represent foreign governments. It appears that Flynn's work wouldn't violate the pledge because it occurred before he joined the administration in January. The pledge bars Flynn from ever doing the same type of work again in his lifetime.\n\nUnder the Foreign Agents Registration Act, U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign governments or political entities must disclose their work to the Justice Department. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the department rarely files criminal charges in such cases. It routinely works with lobbying firms to get back in compliance with the law by registering and disclosing their work.\n\nAccording to Flynn's filings, his firm's work involved research, informational materials and a video on the cleric Fethullah Gulen. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, of orchestrating a botched coup last summer. Erdogan has called for Gulen's extradition, a request the Obama administration rebuffed.\n\nAlptekin, the Turkish businessman, has denied having any ties to Erdogan's government. But he is a member of a Turkish economic relations board run by an Erdogan appointee.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/10/trump-transition-knew-flynn-might-register-as-foreign-agent.html"}, {"text": "France\u2019s top diplomat is pressing a French-Swiss cement manufacturer to rethink its bid to sell the United States material to build President Trump\u2019s proposed border wall.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said Thursday that while construction giant LafargeHolcim can do what they want as a private company, the company should consider the social responsibility it has and the fact that the move could hurt its business with other clients.\n\n\"It should reflect upon what its interests are.

Other limitations under the Byrd rule include prohibitions against provisions that don\u2019t fall under the jurisdiction of the committees that recommend them, or provisions that in any way change Social Security programs such as disability.\n\nIf House lawmakers include provisions that the Senate Parliamentarian finds to be extraneous or unrelated to budgetary matters, Senate Democrats can block them and slow down the Republicans\u2019 momentum. This is the bottleneck through which every provision of the American Health Care Act has to fit.\n\nThat\u2019s why the American Healthcare Act is just the first of many steps to come.\n\nStill, even with these limitations, this legislation is better for consumers than our current law.\n\nThis bill will allow Congress and President Trump to eliminate ObamaCare taxes and its mandate that forces people to buy health insurance; strengthen and expand Health Care Savings Accounts to give families more control over their health care spending; reform Medicaid so states can use per-capita block grants to best serve their residents; provide tax credits to people who don\u2019t get insurance through other avenues; and take health care decision-making power away from Washington and return it to patients and doctors.\n\nMeanwhile, Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price will implement dramatic regulatory reforms in the health care sector that will empower states to make health care decisions that are best for their residents while lowering costs.\n\nThese regulatory changes must be followed by a series of targeted health care reform bills, which should be much more visionary, more powerful, and have a positive impact on the entire health care system.\n\nThe health care system is enormously complex. It addresses many completely unique challenges \u2013 each with its own special set of intricacies \u2013 and health care accounts for one-fifth of our nation\u2019s economy.\n\nMore importantly, our health care system\u2019s success means life or death for millions of Americans.\n\nSo, a rolling series of focused bills is far better for the American people than one gigantic bill that no one reads or understands.\n\nPassing future targeted bills will be more difficult if we let President Trump lose this first major fight \u2013 we cannot allow that to happen.\n\nThe 21st Century Cures Act is an excellent model to follow. The Cures bill was targeted, specific and just under 1,000 pages long. By comparison, ObamaCare drastically changed many aspects of our health care system, was 2,700 pages long and produced more than 20,000 pages of related regulations, according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nThe American Health Care Act is the start of a remarkable reinvention of American health care. By 2018, President Trump and the Congress will have made serious progress and we\u2019ll have a dramatically better system for all Americans.\n\nNewt Gingrich is a Fox News contributor.

He can\u2019t pay his $1 million bond, and hopes the judge will reduce it.\n\nTHE WEEK IN PICTURES\n\nThe now notorious former politician, 43, faces a number of felony white-collar criminal counts related to embezzlement, money laundering, grand theft, and misuse of public funds stemming from his operation of the Stockton Kids Club (formerly the Boys & Girls Club), a non-profit that serves area youth.\n\nThese charges are separate from those filed last summer, when Silva was arrested and charged with supplying alcohol to youth counselors at a camp he ran in Amador County, including a 16-year-old boy, and with illegally recording the parties, including a strip poker game with camp youth leaders. Silva has maintained his innocence.\n\nExpand / Contract Anthony Silva is accused of using public funds to pay for a Filipino dating website, Filipino Cupid.\n\nAt his first court appearance on the latest charges on Monday, dressed in a red jailhouse jumpsuit, the former mayor pleaded not guilty to six felony charges handed down in a grand jury indictment. Attorneys with the San Joaquin District Attorney\u2019s Office allege Silva defrauded the club, a non-profit, pocketing hundreds of thousands of dollars for his own private use, including trips to Lake Tahoe, and on a Filipino dating website.\n\n\"He destroyed 45 years of good work at the Boys & Girls Club, a well-respected and heavily endowed institution for his own personal, ill-gotten gains,\u201d said District Attorney Tori Verber Salazar.\n\nSilva\u2019s lawyer, Mark Reichel, told Fox News that though Silva had been traveling in Colombia, he returned to the U.S. to comply with the arrest warrant. Because the ex-mayor has extensive roots in Stockton, his lawyer said he should be released on his own recognizance.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing to these charges,\" Reichel said.\n\nSilva is enduring miserable conditions at the San Joaquin County Jail, his attorney said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s freezing,\u201d Reichel said, noting Silva\u2019s cell is consistently 56 degrees. \u201cHe\u2019s being held in solitary confinement for his own protection, but solitary is also used as a punishment, so he\u2019s being punished before he\u2019s even adjudicated.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, other arrests may be coming, law enforcement sources said.\n\nAt least one person with close ties to Silva, Sharon Simas, is reportedly under investigation. Once named \u201cStocktonian of the Year,\" Simas was most recently listed as president of the Stockton Kids Club and served as Silva\u2019s executive assistant at City Hall. Messages left at the club have gone unreturned. Neighbors said it has been closed since federal agents served a search warrant there last week, removing computers and boxes of documents. The club\u2019s website has also been taken down.\n\nBefore being elected mayor in 2012 to lead the city of 300,000, Silva spent much of his adult career as a youth swim coach, school board president and leader for kids\u2019 camps and events.\n\nSilva has weathered several previous damning accusations, including three criminal probes by school board police, local police and prosecutors in Stockton.\n\nSilva was under investigation for more than two years before the probe became public in October 2015, when Homeland Security agents detained the politician and seized his laptops and cell phone in the customs area of San Francisco\u2019s airport.\n\nThe FBI turned over the investigation to the Amador County District Attorney\u2019s office in July 2016, and the agency moved quickly to charge Silva.\n\nIn an exclusive and extensive interview in Oct. 2015 with Fox News, Silva touted his affinity for children, noting he had served as the president for the Boys & Girls Clubs of Stockton for nearly a decade, served on the Stockton Unified District Board of Education from 2004 to 2008, and was appointed board president in 2006 and 2007. He also served as a City of Stockton Parks & Recreation Commissioner, was a swim coach for teen girls, operated several camps for kids including Stockton Silver Lake Camp, Miss San Joaquin and the East Stockton Yellowjackets.\n\nAfter he was detained by Homeland Security agents and had his electronics seized, Silva told Fox News, \u201cI am confident that any forensic search of my personal devices will never ever show illegal or inappropriate activities of any sort.\u201d\n\nHis lawyer has maintained that the charges are politically motivated.

It has a military chat room in which members of other services have been sharing such photos.\n\nThe discovery comes after the Defense Department launched an investigation into pictures being shared of female Marines and others \u2013 some taken without their knowledge \u2013 on the Facebook page \u201cMarines United.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese allegations undermine everything we stand for as Marines,\u201d Marine Corps commandant Gen. Robert B. Neller said at a briefing Friday. He said the Marines have set up a task force to investigate the matter, following on the Naval Criminal Investigative Service opening a criminal investigation.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis, in a statement Friday, also said the \u201cchain of command is taking all appropriate action to investigate potential misconduct and to maintain good order and discipline.\u201d\n\nMattis decried the \u201clack of respect\u201d and said the Pentagon \u201cwill not excuse or tolerate such behavior.\u201d He said: \"The purported actions of civilian and military personnel on social media websites, including some associated with the Marines United group and possibly others, represent egregious violations of the fundamental values we uphold at the Department of Defense.\u201d\n\nNotInMyMarines, a group of female Marines that formed in response to the controversy, is now seeking legislation to make sharing nude photos and sex videos without someone's permission a federal crime.\n\nIn response to the latest allegations, the group said: \u201cThe publication of this new information has only solidified our belief that the nature of the military must fundamentally change in order to provide equal opportunities, a safe work environment free from harassment and assault, and end the mentality in which women are considered substandard.\u201d\n\nThe Marines United Facebook page was widely used, with about 30,000 active-duty and former Marines frequenting the group chat space.\n\nReporters were tipped that the site was being used for predatory behavior to share nude photos -- some of them purely pornographic images of female Marines. Marines stalked the women on social media and egged each other on to find and share photos, some taken in locker rooms and showers when the women were not aware, others shared by former boyfriends.\n\nThe story was broken by Thomas Brennan of The War Horse.\n\nNeller issued a stern rebuke in a video to his troops.\n\n\u201cWhen I hear allegations of Marines denigrating their fellow Marines, I don't think such behavior is that of true warriors or warfighters,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now we all need to be focused on getting better. Not hiding on social media, participating in or being aware of actions that are disrespectful and harmful to other Marines.\u201d\n\nErika Butner, a former Marine radio operator whose nude photos were shared on the site in question, says she was disgusted when she found out and encourages others to speak out.\n\n\u201cWe will not be silenced. As a rape survivor I can tell you that this exact behavior leads to the normalization of sexual harassment and even sexual violence,\u201d she said.\n\nMarine Corps commanders have been called before Congress to explain this breach of discipline, which is seen as a serious recruiting issue for the Marines.\n\nJennifer Griffin currently serves as a national security correspondent for FOX News Channel .

Those limitations, which have been in place since 1976, forbid taxpayer funding of abortion, except in the cases of rape, incest or threat to the mother\u2019s life.\n\nBut the AHCA does not ban abortion coverage, or prohibit anyone from buying abortion coverage \u2014 as stated in the text of the bill.

Rex Tillerson\u2019s voyage next week to Japan, China and South Korea may be one of the most significant, and challenging, by an American diplomat \u2014 ever.\n\nThe new secretary of state must reassure Japan that President Trump is committed to keeping it safe. He needs to convince China, which Trump has demonized as a currency manipulator and trade cheat, that the United States wants to work cooperatively on common causes, like reining in North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. And he is under enormous pressure to provide a sense of stability to South Korea, which just impeached its president and is quaking in the face of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un\u2019s increasingly erratic behavior.\n\nTillerson, a seasoned businessman and deal-maker, prefers to work quietly, behind the scenes. But his every statement on this trip will be parsed, the length of every meeting judged. His body language, and that of his counterparts, will be subject to intense scrutiny.\n\nEach country Tillerson will visit presents separate, interlocking challenges. Japan is nervously eyeing North Korea\u2019s recent ballistic missile test launches, which were aimed at the Sea of Japan. Some Japanese politicians have suggested acquiring first-strike weaponry to pre-emptively ward off an attack.\n\nTillerson, a seasoned businessman and deal-maker, prefers to work quietly, behind the scenes. But his every statement on this trip will be parsed, the length of every meeting judged. His body language, and that of his counterparts, will be subject to intense scrutiny.\n\nThat prospect alarms South Korea, which has a long memory that includes Japan\u2019s occupation of Korea more than a century ago. Put simply: South Korea distrusts a more militarized Japan. Its mood is further darkened by the removal of its president, on charges she took bribes.\n\nChina reacted sharply this week to the U.S. shipment of Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile batteries to South Korea. Beijing warned \u2014 somewhat disingenuously \u2014 that increasing South Korea\u2019s defense capability would destabilize the region, and it hinted at unspecified retaliation.\n\nMost of the Asian nations\u2019 insecurity stems from the brazen and dangerously unpredictable actions of North Korea\u2019s Krazy Kim. In the past few months alone, the 33-year-old authorized the ballistic missile test, which North Korea said was intended to prepare for an attack on U.S. military bases in Japan. He almost certainly sanctioned the fatal poisoning of his half-brother, Kim Jong Nam, whom he perceived as a rival, at an airport in Malaysia. And, as the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, the North Korean regime tried to sell lithium-6, which, when sufficiently enriched, can be used to create a nuclear bomb.\n\nDealing with Kim is just the thorniest of Tillerson\u2019s tasks. China\u2019s construction and militarization of artificial islands in the South China Sea has unnerved its neighbors. Its alleged use of cyber-espionage is also a sore point. Chinese support for North Korea, both economic and diplomatic, allows Kim to continue to flout international law.\n\nThere are also economic issues to be resolved. America racked up a nearly $350 billion trade deficit with China last year. Beijing holds more than $1 trillion in U.S. treasury bonds, giving it some negotiating leverage in any Trump-inspired trade war. How Tillerson handles those topics may shape the future of U.S.-China relations for the duration of Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nThe U.S. also runs deficits with Japan and South Korea, but, unlike China, those countries are allies. However, Trump\u2019s scrapping of American participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, of which Japan is a signatory, could give China even more influence in the region than it already has.\n\nSo, Tillerson\u2019s plate is full even before he gets airborne. He can only hope that the unhinged North Korean despot doesn\u2019t spring any new provocations while he tries to sow diplomacy on Asian soil.\n\nJohn Moody is Executive Vice President, Executive Editor for Fox News.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has proposed a bill to call for declaring the Brotherhood a terror organization. In the past, it has been accused of supporting terrorist groups around the world, and several countries, including Muslim nations, have banned them.\n\nThe Brotherhood\u2019s critics include prominent Muslim leaders in the U.S. and around the world, with prominent sheikhs of both Shia and Sunni Muslim groups accusing it of engaging in terrorism.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump must go ahead with his listing of the Brotherhood,\u201d Sheikh Mohammed el Hajj Hassan, founder of the American-Muslim Alliance, told Fox News. \u201cThis group since its inception practiced killing, crimes and terror attacks in the Arab world. In Egypt, Syria, Tunisia and other countries their clerics call for violence.\u201d\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood was formed in Egypt in the 1920s with the stated goal of establishing a worldwide Islamic caliphate, or empire, ruled under Sharia law. Egypt declared it a terror group in 2013 after the government blamed it for a bombing of a police headquarters that killed 16, even though the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood denied involvement and condemned the attack.\n\nThe Defense Department isn\u2019t the only government agency that has been battling with the White House over its picks \u2013 last month Secretary of State Rex Tillerson saw his top choice for deputy secretary of state denied by Trump \u2013 but Mattis appears to be the most adamant about staffing his department and has the least amount of qualms with battling it out with the White House.\n\nThe tug-of-war between Mattis and the White House has meant that not a single undersecretary or deputy secretary to the Defense Department has been nominated to a post. For his part Mattis\u2019 deputy, Robert Work, is a holdover from the Obama administration and is only staying on until the secretary can get his own deputy nominated.\n\n\u201cMattis is a guy who cares very much about personnel,\u201d a friend close to Mattis said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want people off the tracks that he has laid down and that he\u2019s running his train on.\u201d", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/10/mattis-pentagon-pick-seen-as-supporter-muslim-brotherhood-group-trump-may-outlaw.html"}, {"text": "Deep-state Obama holdovers embedded like barnacles in the federal bureaucracy are hell-bent on destroying President Trump. It's time for the Trump administration to purge these saboteurs.\n\nBack to 1861, President Abraham Lincoln created a so-called \u201cteam of rivals,\u201d a cabinet of adversaries that he ran against in the Republican primary. But while Lincoln sought to unify his party through these cabinet selections, he also cleaned house in the federal government. He fired more than 75 percent of executive branch employees, at the time nearly 1,200 people. Why? He had reason to fear they could be disloyal.\n\nPresident Trump would do well to follow Lincoln's example and a fire anyone and everyone who is actively working against him in government.\n\nAfter all, even former president Bill Clinton utilized this tactic back in 1993. He fired all 93 U.S. attorneys. According to Conservative Review's Daniel Horowitz, sacking subversive government employees is best done at the start of an administration.\n\n\u201cClinton easily fired all 93 U.S. attorneys on Day 1,\u201d Horowitz noted. \u201cNobody blinked an eye. Yet when Bush's attorney general fired eight U.S. attorneys well into his second term, well, that became a national scandal.\u201d\n\nIt's also very important for President Trump to act now because he's got to end the leaks that are plaguing this administration. This explosion of leaks coincides with President Obama 11th hour revision of federal policy to allow the widespread sharing of raw data collected by American intelligence agencies. Obama had to know making thousands more government workers privy to sensitive information would exponentially increase the likelihood of leaks.\n\nWhy did President Obama wait until the waning days of his eight years in office to do this? Maybe because he wanted to facilitate leaks that he hoped would cripple his predecessor.\n\n\u201cThey're dealing with seditious people within the Department of Justice, within the FBI, within the Department of Interior, within the CIA,\u201d Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., said. \u201cThere are just people that don't approve of the Trump presidency, and I think that they're trying to take him down from the inside.\n\n\u201cI think you have people within the government, what you call the deep state, bureaucrats, Obama appointees that hate Donald Trump,\u201d Hunter added.\n\nRep.

One tactic has been to insinuate - without any evidence - that there was some sort of campaign collusion with Russia.\n\nEven if they did produce evidence, it would be difficult to evaluate in light of the latest revelations published by WikiLeaks. The CIA, according to the disclosures, has sophisticated malware that can make it appear that cyber activity is being conducted by other nations, when, in fact, people within our own government may be responsible. WikiLeaks, in its press release, specifically pointed out that they could be doing this in the case of this Russian campaign meddling narrative.\n\nMy message is simple. Every holdover from the Obama administration needs to go. A thorough investigation of leakers needs to be conducted. And people who have committed felonies or violated the Espionage Act must be prosecuted.\n\nThose who aren't actively working with President Trump to fix the country need to be shown the door.

But today, our security is wobbling because of hackers and leakers, and the federal government does not seem to be able to stop the espionage.\n\nWhile many Americans don't pay attention, this issue, that we cannot guard our defense secrets or even protect the president of the United States when he talks to a foreign leader, is something that America has never seen before.\n\nSimply put the high-tech world is creating threats to our security that are almost out of control.\n\nThis is, perhaps, the most important issue the federal government faces right now. But close to that is health care.\n\nAmericans are entitled to an affordable medical system that can alleviate their suffering. All of us are going to get sick, and we will need help. But right now, that help is confusing, to say the least.\n\nIt is pointless for \u201cThe Factor\u201d or anyone else to debate ObamaCare and what might replace it until a new specific proposal is put forth. When details are decided and the bill is ready to be considered, we'll be all over it.\n\nThe guiding principles of health care should be that it is financially reasonable, affordable, but you have direct access to the doctors you want, and that you are not bogged down in a chaotic system of red tape and delays. So Congress has a lot of work to do, to put a fair health care system in place.\n\nFinally, all American adults should have fair access to the free marketplace. By that I mean, you can't be denied a job because of your color, your race, or anything else.\n\nAlso, the government needs to put sensible guidelines in place that protect workers from exploitation. With many unions now politically corrupted, the feds and the states have much more responsibility to working Americans.\n\nThat's it. That is what we are owed.\n\nThe Bernie Sanders philosophy that everybody should be guaranteed a job and a set wage and shepherded through life is not what America is all about.\n\nWe compete here but in some cases, some Americans are not treated fairly in the marketplace.

That is unacceptable to Washington\u2019s foreign policy establishment, which dismissed Trump\u2019s approach as impossibly na\u00efve.\n\nWhen combined with Russian hackers trying to hurt Hillary Clinton by illegally obtaining emails from her campaign and the DNC, some Trump skeptics assumed either collusion between the Republican candidate and the Kremlin or speculated that Putin\u2019s gang had damaging information on Trump.\n\nBut now that the new president is confronting the harsh truth of geopolitics, his stance looks very different.

That prompted stories like this one in the New York Times, which said \u201chis administration has spoken with multiple voices as it seeks to explain its evolving policy.

Davis called out the Freedom Caucus.\n\n\u201cWhat do they need?\u201d asked Davis.\n\nBy nightfall Monday, Vice President Pence journeyed to the Capitol to meet with the Freedom Caucus.\n\n\u201cWe continue to work earnestly with Congress for a new future on health care reform,\u201d said Pence Tuesday. \u201cThe president and I remain confident we will repeal and replace ObamaCare.\u201d\n\nPence, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney descended on the Capitol around 8:30 p.m. Tuesday for another conclave with key Republicans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just talking. Any time we\u2019re talking is good,\u201d said Price.\n\nAnd they talked. For more than two hours. But most lawmakers left the confab uttering bromides.\n\n\u201cGood talk,\u201d said House Budget Committee Chairwoman Diane Black, R-Tenn. \u201cMaking progress.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat meeting and great conversations,\u201d said Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn.\n\n\u201cGood conversation. Making progress,\u201d said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas.\n\nBut while some lawmakers are upbeat, it\u2019s unclear if they\u2019re truly getting anywhere. Sources tell Fox News the consultations may pick up some Republicans but lose others.\n\n\u201cThere were no agreements tonight and no agreements in principle, and, certainly no agreements in terms of a foundation,\u201d said House Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C. \u201cThere was a general agreement that the progress we\u2019re making is certainly progress.\u201d\n\nMeadows expressed mild disappointment that the administration and committee chairs didn\u2019t present updated legislative text.\n\nHouse Republicans fear jetting out of Washington for the Easter/Passover break without a new health care bill. Time is short to retrench the bill, walk lawmakers through the legislation and whip it for a vote count.\n\n\u201cI think to suggest that we can\u2019t get it done by the end of the week would be premature,\u201d said Meadows. \u201cThere\u2019s concern on my part that if we are making real progress that going home sends a wrong message.\u201d\n\nOne source familiar with the talks speculated that there was only a \u201c30 percent\u201d chance the House could act this week even if the sides forged a pact.\n\n\u201cNothing has happened which would change the votes,\u201d said one senior House leadership aide.\n\nAnother senior House Republican source was emphatic that the House wouldn\u2019t remain in session over the weekend and would cut short the recess \u201conly if we have a deal.\u201d Some lawmakers are concerned the sides are exhausting too much effort extricating the health care bill from doom and not focusing on how to avoid a government shutdown at the end of the month.\n\n\u201cThis is all about saving face,\u201d said one House Republican source. \u201cThe speaker. The president. The committee chairs. The Freedom Caucus.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether saving face justified the exercise, the source replied, \u201cYes. Anything that gets us to yes, at this point.\u201d\n\nRepublicans long criticized Democrats for what they perceived were efforts to \u201cmuscle through\u201d ObamaCare. Republicans piously touted their own process to advance their own health care measure. Now? Well, it\u2019s messy.\n\nAlso, an important operational issue lingers. The health care measure is tucked into what\u2019s called a special \u201cbudget reconciliation package,\u201d structured in a way to avoid a Senate filibuster. The House must soon pass a budget for the next spending round. But congressional rules bar the House and Senate from having two \u201clive\u201d budget packages at once. So, the House and Senate could be forced to delay passing a budget for fiscal 2018 if they haven\u2019t disposed of the budget reconciliation vehicle crafted for health care.\n\nOf course, that presumes the House can approve a budget this year. Republicans browbeat Senate Democrats for not adopting budgets. But House Republicans failed to okay a budget last year.\n\nDo lawmakers believe negotiations can lug the legislation across the finish line?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s real or not,\u201d said one senior Republican source of the recent machinations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of noise. Busywork,\u201d declared another skeptical Republican.\n\nSome Republicans are leery of the fire drill approach. But they concede, people talking.\n\n\u201cAs soon as people quit talking, then you know there is trouble,\u201d said a source familiar with the conversation.\n\nCapitol Attitude is a weekly column written by members of the Fox News Capitol Hill team.

Yet that isn\u2019t enough to put the president\u2019s job rating in positive territory, according to a Fox News Poll released Wednesday.\n\nBy a 19-point margin, voters feel the economy is getting better rather than worse for their family (48-29 percent). The 48 percent \u201cgetting better\u201d number is the highest since the question was first asked in 2003. Just five months ago, voters felt the economy was getting worse by an 11-point margin (37 percent better vs. 48 percent worse, October 2016).\n\nREAD THE FULL FOX NEWS POLL RESULTS.\n\nIncreasing economic optimism only goes so far, as a majority still says the world\u2019s \u201cgoing to hell in a handbasket.\u201d Fifty-four percent feel that way, down just a touch from 57 percent in 2016 and 58 percent in 2014.\n\nCheck out these post-election swings among partisans: optimism in the economy is up 54 points among Republicans, and down 29 points among Democrats since October. The number saying the world\u2019s going to hell has gone up 26 points among Democrats, but dropped 32 points among Republicans.\n\nTrump gets his best job rating on the economy: 47 percent approve, while 44 percent disapprove. Almost as many approve of how he\u2019s handling terrorism (45 percent approve vs. 48 percent disapprove). Voters are much more disapproving on other issues, such as immigration (41 vs. 56 percent), health care (35 vs. 55 percent), and America\u2019s relationship with Russia (33 vs. 55 percent).\n\nIn addition, a 54 percent majority disapproves of the president\u2019s revised executive order banning citizens from six countries from traveling to the United States, and the number believing the travel ban makes the U.S. safer dropped eight points since last month and now stands at 34 percent.\n\nApproval of Trump\u2019s overall job performance is down five percentage points. Currently, 43 percent of voters approve, while 51 percent disapprove. In February it was 48-47 percent.\n\nTrump opponents hold more strident views than his fans: 45 percent \u201cstrongly\u201d disapproves of the job he\u2019s doing, while 30 percent \u201cstrongly\u201d approves.\n\nThe poll also asked about Trump\u2019s tweeting. One-third of Trump voters (35 percent) approve of his tweeting -- but just 16 percent of all voters approve. The rest either disapprove (50 percent) or \u201cwish he\u2019d be more careful\u201d with his tweets (32 percent).\n\nBy a 51-38 percent margin, more voters than not feel that being a non-politician has hurt rather than helped Trump do his job as president.\n\nThose backing Hillary Clinton in the election overwhelmingly disapprove of Trump\u2019s job performance (93 percent) and a large majority feels his lack of political experience is a negative (84 percent).\n\nIt\u2019s the opposite among Trump voters: 93 percent give him a thumbs-up and 81 percent feel being a non-politician has helped him do his job.\n\nFifty-one percent of voters think Trump has done more to fulfill his campaign promises than most other presidents at this point in their administrations. That number climbs to 88 percent among voters who backed him in the election. Overall, 34 percent think he\u2019s done less.\n\nMeanwhile, less than half of voters (47 percent) are confident the Trump administration will be able to make \u201csignificant positive change for the country.\u201d\n\nFor comparison, at a similar point in President Obama\u2019s first term, 63 percent approved of his job performance and a 64 percent majority had confidence he would bring positive change (February/March 2009). A notable difference is that only a third as many Democrats (10 percent) have confidence in Trump now as Republicans had in Obama then (31 percent).\n\nPollpourri\n\nThere\u2019s remarkable agreement among Democrats, Republicans, and independents in the ranking of top priorities for the president.\n\nWhen asked about the one thing they really want Trump to get done, voters pick \u201ccreate jobs.\u201d Thirty-three percent say that and it\u2019s the number one choice across the political spectrum. Next, 23 percent say \u201cdestroy ISIS,\u201d and it\u2019s the second pick across the board.\n\n\u201cThe only significant difference in priorities is that just nine percent of voters overall pick putting a Constitutionalist to the Supreme Court, but it\u2019s the top choice for 19 percent of Republicans,\u201d says Democratic Pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican counterpart Daron Shaw. \u201cJust 8 percent of independents and 2 percent of Democrats feel that way.\u201d\n\nPutting a Constitutionalist on the court tops the list among \u201cvery conservative\u201d voters (26 percent) and Republican men (22 percent).\n\nFifty-eight percent of voters approve of the job the Supreme Court is doing, up from 45 percent the last time the question was asked in 2012. The shift comes mainly from Republicans (+19 points in approval) and independents (+14 points).\n\nBy a 45-39 percent margin, voters would confirm Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch.\n\nThe Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,008 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from March 12-14, 2017. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/15/fox-news-poll-trump-approval-slips-even-as-more-feel-economy-improving.html"}]
